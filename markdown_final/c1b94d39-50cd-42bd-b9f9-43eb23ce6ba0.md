## Question

Visible cervix cyst

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a "visible cervix cyst", likely a nabothian cyst, and wants information on differential diagnosis, imaging, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the lesion and its most common etiology. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and the red flags that would change management. Next, I will review the imaging strategy and how to interpret findings. After that, I need to check the management pathways for benign versus suspicious lesions. Finally, I should confirm follow-up and counseling points, and ensure the plan aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its typical features. A "visible cervix cyst" on speculum exam is most often a nabothian cyst, a benign retention cyst of endocervical glands that appears as a translucent, smooth, mucus-filled cyst on the ectocervix or endocervix, frequently multiple and asymptomatic, and typically discovered incidentally on exam or imaging, which fits standard colposcopic descriptors of normal variants including nabothian cysts [^116HhnGT] [^115D8WVZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the differential so I don't miss important mimics. Other benign cystic cervical lesions include tunnel clusters, endocervical hyperplasia, and cystic endometriosis, while premalignant and malignant considerations include lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), atypical LEGH, minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA), and gastric-type adenocarcinoma (GAS), which can present as multicystic or solid-cystic lesions and carry different prognostic implications, so I need to ensure I'm not overlooking atypical features or worrisome patterns on exam or imaging [^115D8WVZ] [^1117FuyF] [^114QtNix].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging approach because management hinges on it. Transvaginal ultrasound is the first-line modality to characterize cervical cysts, distinguishing simple cysts from complex or solid-cystic lesions and guiding whether further workup is needed. MRI is reserved for indeterminate or complex multicystic lesions where malignancy is a concern, and recent work proposes an MRI morphology classification (types 1–4) that correlates with benign, LEGH, premalignant, and malignant disease, respectively, which can refine preoperative risk stratification when combined with cytology [^111cWKcJ] [^114QtNix] [^111FKzqS].

> I should double-check how to interpret imaging features that raise suspicion. A solid component with diffusion restriction, diffuse microcystic involvement of more than half the cervical wall, or focal mass-like bulging patterns are concerning for atypical LEGH or malignancy, whereas purely cystic lesions without solid components are more likely benign. Importantly, combining MRI morphology with cytology improves diagnostic accuracy for premalignancy or malignancy, which should prompt biopsy or conization rather than observation [^111cWKcJ] [^114QtNix] [^1175roeX].

> Let me consider management for a classic, simple nabothian cyst. If the cyst is small, asymptomatic, and lacks concerning features on exam or ultrasound, no treatment is indicated. Reassurance and routine cervical screening per guidelines are appropriate, and I should avoid unnecessary procedures given the benign nature and the potential harms of overtreatment in low-risk scenarios [^115D8WVZ].

> But wait, what if the cyst is symptomatic or cosmetically bothersome? In that case, I should confirm that symptoms localize to the cyst and consider simple aspiration or unroofing in select cases. If excision is pursued for persistent symptoms or diagnostic uncertainty, I need to ensure the specimen is sent for pathology to exclude atypical or malignant mimics, aligning with the principle of tissue diagnosis when the presentation is atypical or the patient is higher risk [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I escalate appropriately when red flags are present. If there is abnormal bleeding, a visibly abnormal cervix, a complex or solid-cystic lesion on imaging, or high-risk cytology, I should proceed with colposcopy with directed biopsies and consider endocervical sampling, because symptomatic patients or those with abnormal-appearing cervices require diagnostic testing rather than surveillance per ASCCP guidance [^117B4FjU] [^111NEr2U].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of MRI-based morphology in surgical decision-making. When MRI shows type 3 or 4 patterns, particularly with diffusion restriction or diffuse/focal mass-like growth, the risk of premalignancy or malignancy is substantially higher, and conization or hysterectomy may be warranted after correlating with cytology; this integrated MRI–cytology approach reduces over- and under-diagnosis and helps tailor the extent of surgery [^114QtNix] [^1175roeX] [^111rk3ZR].

> Let me reconsider follow-up and counseling so I don't under- or over-monitor. For confirmed simple nabothian cysts, routine cervical screening intervals per risk-based management are sufficient. For complex or persistent cysts without definitive diagnosis, interval ultrasound or MRI and repeat cytology can be considered, with a low threshold to biopsy if features evolve. I should counsel patients that nabothian cysts are common, benign, and not cancer, but new bleeding, pain, or growth warrants re-evaluation [^117B4FjU] [^115D8WVZ].

> In summary, I should confirm that a visible cervical cyst is most often a benign nabothian cyst, use ultrasound to characterize complexity, reserve MRI for indeterminate or suspicious multicystic lesions, integrate MRI morphology with cytology when malignancy is a concern, treat simple cysts conservatively, and escalate to biopsy or excision when red flags or high-risk imaging–cytology combinations are present, ensuring tissue diagnosis guides definitive management [^115D8WVZ] [^111cWKcJ] [^114QtNix] [^117B4FjU].

A visible cervix cyst is most often a **nabothian cyst** — a benign mucus retention cyst that appears as a smooth, translucent, asymptomatic lesion on the cervix [^115D8WVZ]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, supported by transvaginal ultrasound when needed to confirm a simple cyst and exclude complex features [^notfound]. No treatment is required unless symptomatic or large; if intervention is needed, simple aspiration or excision is effective [^notfound]. Rarely, cystic lesions may represent malignancy (e.g. minimal deviation adenocarcinoma) [^114QtNix]; red flags include solid components, irregular borders, or symptoms such as bleeding or discharge, prompting MRI and biopsy [^111cWKcJ]. Routine follow-up is **unnecessary** for stable, asymptomatic cysts, but new or changing lesions warrant reassessment [^notfound].

---

## Clinical appearance and symptoms

- **Appearance**: Nabothian cysts are smooth, translucent, round lesions, typically 2–10 mm, often multiple, and usually asymptomatic [^notfound].

- **Symptoms**: Most are asymptomatic; larger cysts may cause mild discomfort, dyspareunia, or a feeling of fullness.

- **Location**: Commonly on the ectocervix, but can occur anywhere on the cervix [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical examination

On speculum exam, Nabothian cysts appear as **smooth, translucent cysts** on the cervix [^notfound]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on characteristic appearance and absence of concerning features [^notfound].

---

### Imaging modalities

Transvaginal ultrasound is the **first-line modality** to confirm a simple cyst and exclude complex features; Nabothian cysts appear as anechoic lesions with posterior acoustic enhancement [^117B9Q1M]. MRI is reserved for **indeterminate or complex lesions** to differentiate benign from malignant pathology [^111cWKcJ].

---

### Laboratory tests

Routine laboratory tests are **not indicated** for simple Nabothian cysts. Cervical cytology (Pap smear) is recommended per screening guidelines but is **not specific** for cyst diagnosis [^117B4FjU].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Imaging features** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nabothian cyst | Smooth, translucent, asymptomatic | Simple anechoic cyst | Observation |
| Cervical polyp | Pedunculated, friable, may bleed | Solid or mixed echogenicity | Polypectomy |
| Cervical endometriosis | Cyclic pain, bleeding | Complex cyst with hemorrhage | Surgical excision |
| Minimal deviation adenocarcinoma | Large, multicystic, may be asymptomatic | Complex cystic-solid lesion | Surgical excision, oncologic management |
| Cervical ectopic pregnancy | Rare, abnormal bleeding, pain | Gestational sac in cervix | Surgical or medical management |

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

Observation is appropriate for **asymptomatic, small cysts** with a characteristic appearance. Patient education should explain the **benign nature** of Nabothian cysts and the lack of need for intervention [^115D8WVZ].

---

### Surgical management

Indications for intervention include symptomatic cysts (discomfort, dyspareunia, fullness), large cysts (> 1 cm), or diagnostic uncertainty. Procedures include **simple aspiration** for symptomatic or large cysts and excision (cystectomy) for persistent or recurrent cysts or when malignancy is suspected [^114GEGTb].

---

## Potential complications

Complications are rare; **infection** is uncommon and presents with erythema, tenderness, or purulent discharge, while **recurrence** is possible after aspiration or incomplete excision. Malignant transformation is **extremely rare**; persistent, enlarging, or atypical lesions require further evaluation [^1117txDm].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **excellent**; Nabothian cysts are benign with minimal risk of complications. Recurrence is uncommon after complete excision but may occur after aspiration alone [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up is **unnecessary** for stable, asymptomatic cysts. Re-evaluation is warranted for new symptoms, cyst enlargement, or changes in appearance [^117B4FjU].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Education should emphasize the **benign nature** of Nabothian cysts and the lack of association with cancer. Counseling should reassure patients that **routine cervical screening** is sufficient and that invasive procedures are not needed unless symptoms develop [^117B4FjU].

---

A visible cervix cyst is **usually a benign nabothian cyst** diagnosed clinically; ultrasound confirms the diagnosis, and no treatment is needed unless symptomatic. Persistent, atypical, or symptomatic lesions may require MRI or biopsy to exclude malignancy [^111rk3ZR].

### Congenital cervical cysts, sinuses, and fistulae in pediatric surgery [^113LbBa2]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital cervical anomalies are essential to consider in the clinical assessment of head and neck masses in children and adults. These lesions can present as palpable cystic masses, infected masses, draining sinuses, or fistulae. Thyroglossal duct cysts are most common, followed by branchial cleft anomalies and dermoid cysts. Other lesions reviewed include median ectopic thyroid, cervical teratomas, and midline cervical clefts. Appropriate diagnosis and management of these lesions requires a thorough understanding of their embryology and anatomy. Correct diagnosis, resolution of infectious issues before definitive therapy, and complete surgical excision are imperative in the prevention of recurrence.

### Novel strategy for the management of cervical multicystic diseases [^111FKzqS]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Two gynecologic radiologists independently assessed the above radiologic features of the tumor, without knowing any of the patients' original diagnosis or clinical information. Based on the morphology and distribution of the cysts, each radiologist made a radiological diagnosis according to the diagnostic imaging algorithm described above. Lesions were classified into four types based on the above-described cyst and solid component patterns. Types 1 to 3 comprised only a multicystic component. Type 1, "lesion confined to the lower portion of the cervix", "macrocystic pattern", or "mixed pattern without cosmos sign", were regarded as suspicious of miscellaneous benign glandular hyperplasia, including a nabothian cyst (NC); type 2, "cosmos pattern or microcystic pattern without diffuse growth and focal mass-like bulging" were regarded as suspicious of possibly LEGH; type 3, a mixed or microcystic pattern exhibiting "diffuse growth", or "focal mass-like bulging" were regarded as suspicious of premalignancy (assumption of atypical LEGH) or possible malignancy; type 4, "sold and cystic pattern", were regarded as suspicious of malignancy (Table 1).

Classification of MRI findings

LEGH lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia

We investigated the diagnostic value of various clinical parameters, including MRI and cytology, and evaluated their usefulness for diagnostic accuracy regarding multicystic diseases of the cervix using a combination of these parameters.

Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables were summarized as mean ± standard deviation and categorical variables as frequency and percentage. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to ascertain whether malignant or atypical LEGH increases in the order of type 4 morphology of MRI. The McNemar's test was used to check whether cytology results were consistent with pathology results. To assess the associations between MRI findings and histopathological diagnosis, Fisher's exact test and the Freeman-Halton test were used. Statistical significance was determined when the p -value was less than 0.05. JMP software, version 16.0, (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA) were used for the statistical analysis.

Methods

Patient Selection

Our study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine and the relevant Boards of all 15 participating hospitals. Eligible patients were those who underwent hysterectomy or conization at the participating hospitals between 2010 and 2019 due to an indication of a multicystic cervical lesion. Clinical records included a Pap smear, a cervical biopsy specimen with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, MRI, and H&E-stained sections of the surgically resected uterus or cone biopsies. The diagnoses, made by each participating hospital, were collected by the Osaka University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Additional patient data, including age, gravidity, past medical and obstetric history, BMI, tumor markers, surgical procedure details, adjuvant therapy, and the results of follow-ups, were retrospectively collected and reviewed.

Pathologic Evaluation

The H&E-stained sections of hysterectomy or conization specimens were re-evaluated by a central pathological review (CPR) consisting of two board-certified pathologists specializing in gynecological pathology and oncology, without access to the case clinical information.

The first pathologist reviewed all of the slides. A second pathologist was consulted only when the first central pathological diagnosis was subsequently found to be discordant with the initial diagnosis made at the participating hospital.

The final diagnosis was made based on the 2020 WHO classification system.GAS was defined as an invasive adenocarcinoma with abundant pale eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm and distinct cell borders, and destructive invasion and moderate to severe nuclear atypia. MDA was categorized as an extremely well-differentiated variant of GAS.LEGH was defined as cyst-like large central glands surrounded by a lobular proliferation of small- to medium-sized glands containing tall columnar mucinous epithelium, sometimes with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, and bland, basally located nuclei. Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and atypical LEGH were defined as follows: (i) AIS is characterized by mucin-producing cells as seen in cases of GAS. The proliferation involves pre-existing normal endocervical glands and lacks haphazard gland crowding or confluence, but intraglandular complexity can occur; (ii) atypical LEGH was defined as tumors with the architecture of prototypical LEGH preserved, characterized by epithelial infoldings, tufts, or papillae, as well as by nuclear hyperchromasia, enlargement, distinct nucleoli, apoptotic bodies, and occasional apical mitoses, but do not suffice as carcinoma. In this limited study, we did not perform additional immunohistochemical diagnostic analysis.

### Multilocular cystic lesions in the uterine cervix: broad spectrum of imaging features and pathologic correlation [^115D8WVZ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article is to describe the broad spectrum and imaging features of multilocular cystic lesions in the uterine cervix from benign lesions, such as uterine cervicitis, endocervical hyperplasia, nabothian cyst, and tunnel cluster, to malignant lesions including adenocarcinoma and adenoma malignum.

Conclusion

Familiarity with the clinical setting and imaging features of multilocular cystic lesions in the uterine cervix can help prevent unnecessary radical surgery before histopathologic proof of malignancy and can facilitate prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment.

### An unusual presentation of an infected vallecular cyst presenting as supraglottitis [^113H9ZKG]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 50-year-old gentleman presented to the emergency department with a 24 h history of stridor, dysphonia, dysphagia and vomiting. On examination, the patient had fever and tachycardic. There was no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. Flexible nasendoscopy and lateral neck x-ray revealed soft tissue swelling around the epiglottis. The swelling subsided with conservative management of intravenous antibiotics and steroids, only to later reveal a vallecular cyst, which was confirmed on microlaryngoscopy. The cyst was subsequently deroofed and sent for biopsy. Histological examination revealed an infected, benign vallecular cyst consisting of a squamous epithelium with underlying lymphoid tissue. In adults, vallecular cysts are usually asymptomatic, but can become infected and initiate acute supraglottitis, potentially leading to life-threatening airway obstruction. The case described here, although rare, highlights how early definitive diagnosis and management of vallecular cysts can lead to significantly improved patient outcomes.

### What steps should be considered in the patient who has had a negative cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism? [^113y7SXQ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

The key to cure of the patient with persistent primary hyperparathyroidism is a clear understanding of the investigations, operative procedure and pathology related to the initial procedure. Reinvestigation and subsequent surgery should be performed in a specialist unit. A logical pathway of increasingly sophisticated localization studies (MIBI, ultrasound, CT/MRI, selective venous catheterization for PTH) will usually guide the surgeon to the missing parathyroid gland/s. Improved preoperative localization can facilitate the use of a minimally invasive small incision approach. The surgeon must have a detailed knowledge of the nuances of parathyroid embryology and a meticulous surgical technique, not only to identify and safely remove the retained gland/s but also do so without causing unnecessary morbidity. Results of re-operation (84–98% cure) from centres of excellence are highly commendable, yet the use of 'new' technology (that includes intra-operative PTH) has not translated into improved outcomes in all cases. Some parathyroid glands are extremely difficult to find! Re-operative parathyroid surgery is a challenge, sometimes easy, and on other occasions extremely difficult.

### Imaging of cystic or cyst-like neck masses [^1137imte]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Cystic or cyst-like neck masses form a unique category within head and neck radiology with unique differential diagnoses. The precise anatomical location and imaging appearances are important for accurate diagnosis and formulating the differential diagnoses of cystic lesions in the neck. In vast majority of cases ultrasound, sometimes supplemented by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), is adequate for pre-treatment assessment. For large, deep-seated lesions assessment using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) often provides useful supplementary information. Radiologists should be aware of imaging findings of common cystic neck masses to help in their appropriate management.

### Cervical thymic cysts in adults [^112nvubt]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Three types of cervical thymic anomalies have been described: ectopia, thymic cyst, and thymoma. Thymic cysts are very rare causes of benign neck masses in adults and are usually not diagnosed before surgery. Their prevalence is less than 1% of all cervical masses, and they are usually noted in childhood. We systematically reviewed the literature concerning cervical thymic cysts (CTCs) in adults.

Summary

We identified 36 adult patients with a CTC. Our analysis included age, gender, cyst size, location, type, symptoms, time from cyst appearance, treatment, pathology, and follow-up. The male/female ratio was 4/5, the mean age was 36 years. Most of the cysts were asymptomatic masses diagnosed by pathology. In only one case did the differential diagnosis include a thymic cyst. Surgery should be considered the treatment of choice, but the size and location of the lesion and its relationship to nearby vital structures should be defined as clearly as possible preoperatively. Excision can be made via a transverse cervical incision. It may be a demanding procedure because of the close anatomical relationship of the CTCs with the carotid sheath and major nerves of the neck (recurrent laryngeal nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, hypoglossic nerve, and phrenic nerve), particularly if there is adherence of the CTC with those structures.

Conclusions

CTCs are uncommon lesions causing neck swelling and are often misdiagnosed preoperatively. Surgical excision and histological examination of the specimen usually makes the diagnosis. The existence of normal thymus gland in the mediastinum should be confirmed intraoperatively, but this is not critical in adult patients. A CTC should be included in the differential diagnosis of cervical cystic masses.

### Novel strategy for the management of cervical multicystic diseases [^112TS6mL]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 180 patients, from 15 hospitals, were initially registered for this study. We subsequently excluded 21 patients with cervical proliferative glandular lesions only incidentally detected as part of surgery performed for some other benign disease. Finally, 159 cases were included in the analysis. Their mean age was 52 years (range 31–80). Among the 159 cases of a cervical multicystic disease diagnosed at the 15 participating hospitals, the preoperative diagnosis was: 19 cases of suspected cancer, 21 cases of suspected benign disease, and 119 cases that were 'suspicious of LEGH' or 'suspicious of LEGH — but MDA cancer cannot be ruled out' (Table 2). Clinical over-diagnosis of malignancy (suspicion of MDA) occurred for 12/19 cases (63.2%) and under-diagnosis of malignancy occurred for 4/11 (36%).

### Cervical ectopic pregnancy diagnosed by point-of-care emergency department ultrasound [^114vCNfa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although rare, cervical ectopic pregnancy (EP) represents a potentially lethal variation of a common first-trimester disease entity.

Case Report

We report a case of low abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding diagnosed as a cervical EP by point-of-care ultrasound.

Conclusion

Familiarity with cervical EP and its sonographic appearance is essential for emergency physicians because it can be easily mistaken for an intrauterine pregnancy or other obstetric/gynecologic pathology, such as an incomplete abortion or nabothian cyst. The management of each of these differs substantially, making accurate diagnosis crucial.

### Management of congenital anomalies of the neck [^111fiAUq]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

This article, although not exhaustive, highlights the most common congenital anomalies of the neck. The diagnostic possibilities for a neck mass are extensive, and congenital malformations account for a minority of neck masses. The misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment of a neck mass may have serious consequences for the patient. Therefore, a standardized and complete approach to the evaluation of neck masses is required. As stressed in this article, a thorough history and physical examination form the cornerstones of such an evaluation. The fact that congenital lesions of the neck have varied manifestations and may present at any age should always be considered.

### Pediatric neck masses [^112wpuTS]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The majority of neck masses in the pediatric population are congenital or inflammatory in origin requiring a thorough understanding of embryology and anatomy of the cervical region. However, malignancy must always be ruled out as they represent 11%-15% of all neck masses in the pediatric population. The initial history and physical are of utmost important to correctly work-up and eventually diagnose the lesion. This article addresses many aspects of the workup, diagnosis and eventual proper surgical or medical management of pediatric neck masses.

### Benign cystic lesions of the vagina: a literature review [^114GEGTb]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Knowledge of the etiology, evaluation and treatment of cystic lesions of the vagina is essential as these lesions are often encountered in urological and gynecological practices.

Materials and Methods

We searched MEDLINE and MeSH for literature from the last 50 years referring to cysts of the vagina. Review of the literature regarding etiology, clinical and pathological diagnosis, prognosis and treatment identified 18 journal articles and 6 books.

Results

Benign cystic lesions of the vagina present a spectrum, from small asymptomatic lesions to cysts large enough to cause urinary obstruction. History, physical examination and radiological imaging, including voiding cystourethrogram and magnetic resonance imaging, are useful in diagnosis. Treatment is determined by the severity of symptoms.

Conclusions

Cystic lesions of the vagina are relatively common and usually represent benign conditions. A vaginal cyst may be an embryological derivative, ectopic tissue or urological abnormality. Awareness of the various diagnoses of benign cystic lesions of the vagina and associated abnormalities will aid in evaluation and treatment.

### Surgical management of cervical degenerative disease: the evidence related to indications, impact, and outcome [^112VXLmS]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Medium credibility.

Congress of Neurological Surgeons guidelines for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma — introduction and methods — describe an update of the evidence-based guideline initially published in 2008 and sponsored by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS). A multidisciplinary writing group addressed imaging, cytoreductive surgery, neuropathology, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and emerging developments; questions from the prior set and new and modified questions were used to guide a literature search since the last guideline search was completed in June 2005, and citations were screened, classified and used as evidence to create recommendations linked to this evidence. Across sixteen sections, 34 questions resulted in eight Level I recommendations, eleven Level II recommendations, and 27 Level III recommendations, with instances where insufficient data was available to answer all or part of a question noted. The guidelines set a benchmark for management and highlight key knowledge gaps, suggesting directions for future basic and clinical research to improve evidence quality and recommendation strength.

### Practice bulletin no. 174: evaluation and management of adnexal masses [^112EY885]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cysts, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACOG 2016 guidelines recommend to recognize that simple cysts < 10 cm in diameter on transvaginal ultrasound obtained by an experienced specialist are likely benign. Consider monitoring these cysts with repeat imaging without surgical intervention, even in postmenopausal patients.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^117DPhAS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Initial assessment

The initial assessment of a clinically evident or incidentally discovered thyroid nodule includes cervical sonography and evaluation of clinical risk factors. Depending on the results that emerge, the use of other diagnostic tools, such as FNAB for cytology and molecular testing, will be indicated for a small subset of the lesions.

(3) The following three special morphologies of the cystic components were evaluated: ① "cosmos sign", an aggregation of small cystic components in the center of the lesions, occasionally seen as a solid-like less hyper-intense area on a T2-weighted image (T2WI) surrounded by many larger cysts, ② "diffuse growth", microcysts distributed diffusely across the entire cervix and involving deeper than half of the cervical wall, ③ "focal mass-like bulging pattern", a mass-like lesion composed of numerous cysts forming a focal outward contour bulge of the cervical wall unilaterally (illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, and Supplemental Table 1). Fig. 1 Definitions of MRI morphological patterns in this study. "Cosmos sign" was defined as an aggregation of small cystic components in the center of the lesion, occasionally seen as a solid-like less hyper-intense area on T2WI, surrounded by many larger cysts. "Diffuse growth" was defined as microcysts distributed diffusely across the entire cervix and deeper than half of the cervical wall. "Focal mass-like bulging pattern" was defined as a mass-like lesion composed of numerous cysts forming a focal outward contour bulge of the cervical wall unilaterally. "Sold and cystic pattern" lesions comprised multiple cysts and a solid component Fig. 2 Typical MR Images.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^11177ySk]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2019 revision of the ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines expands upon the "risk-based" approach introduced in 2012. It addresses the need for simplicity and stability in clinical guidelines while anticipating continued technologic advances in cervical screening methods. This introduction explains why the 2019 revision was needed, describes the general approach of the new guidelines, and outlines briefly how the new approach will work in practice.

### How MRI imaging for an ovarian cyst led to diagnosis of short cervix [^114atkUx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 5
Unmeasurable cervix on ultrasound. A: Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrating funneling of membranes through internal os to external os. B: No measurable cervical length with 0.64cm of dilation

The patient was brought to the operating room for a rescue cerclage at 19 + 4 weeks. On speculum exam, cervix appeared fingertip with visible fetal membranes and on cervical exam was closed and 70% effaced. A McDonald cerclage using a single stitch of 0 prolene was placed with 1 cm of length achieved. Patient tolerated the procedure well and was given indomethacin 50 mg loading dose followed by 25 mg every 6 h for 48 h for post procedure tocolysis. She was discharged with vaginal progesterone nightly and follow up one week later showed a cervical length of 1.0 cm.

Patient presented at 24 + 4 weeks with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes. She was started on latency antibiotics, given betamethasone for fetal lung maturation and started on magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection. She underwent a cesarean section with removal of right adnexal mass at 26 + 2 weeks gestation. The adnexal mass was found to be benign.

### Denosumab: a potential treatment option for aneurysmal bone cyst of the atlas [^1147ZKjr]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) of spine are conventionally treated with en-bloc resection or intralesional excision/curettage and reconstruction or filling of defects with bone cement. For the treatment of upper cervical ABCs, en-bloc resections are often not desirable considering the risk/benefit ratio while the risk of recurrence after intralesional excision is high. Hence, alternative management options are often necessary. We describe our clinical experience with one such treatment alternative-denosumab for the treatment of ABC of Atlas.

Methods and Results

We present a case of 16-year-old boy who presented with neck pain and restriction of neck movements. A large lytic lesion with multiple fluid-fluid interfaces involving vertebral arch of atlas was identified on further imaging. There was destruction of right lateral mass and the lesion was found encasing the right vertebral artery. Core needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of ABC. With no visible CT response after first session of intra-lesional injection of Calcitonin and Methylprednisolone, the patient was treated with denosumab (120 mg SC once-a-month) for a period of 12 months. His symptoms resolved within 7 months of onset of treatment and serial CT scans over 12-month treatment period showed complete ossification of the lesion. Further there was no evidence of recurrence at 12 months after completion of treatment.

Conclusion

Our case report contributes to the accruing evidence on the effectiveness of denosumab for the treatment of spinal ABCs. However, long-term safety, risk of recurrence, optimal duration of treatment and consistency of denosumab are yet to be determined.

### Diagnosis and management of pyriform sinus cyst in neonates: 16-year experience at a single center [^113bcHXj]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

The purpose of this study was to review our experience in diagnosing and managing neonatal pyriform sinus cyst (PSC) and to assess its outcomes.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 38 cases of neonatal PSC from 2001 to 2016. Clinical features, PSC diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes were analyzed.

Results

Cervical masses were detected prenatally in 8 patients (21.1%). Neck cyst and respiratory distress were frequent symptoms among these patients. Preoperative PSC diagnosis was made in 15 cases (39.5%) by esophagography. CT or MRI images showed an air-filled cyst in 22 patients (57.9%). Cyst drainage was performed in 8 infected cases (21.1%). Cyst and fistula excision was performed in 30 cases (78.9%). Fistula excision assisted by endoscopy was required in 13 PSC patients (34.2%). Fistula detection failed in 4 cases (10.5%). Patients aged between 0 to 7days presented with low infection and high cyst removal rate. No fistula recurrence occurred in cases with cyst resection.

Conclusions

CT or MRI images with an air-filled cyst are significant indications in diagnosing PSC. Surgical options for PSC depend on levels of cervical infection. The optimal timing for surgical intervention is between 0 to 7days after birth. Our surgical approaches were effective in treating neonatal PSC.

### Novel strategy for the management of cervical multicystic diseases [^1175roeX]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Malignant and Premalignant Diseases

Of the ten cases with malignant disease, four (40%) showed type 4 morphology, and six (60%) showed type 3. Of nine LEGH with atypia, seven (77.8%), one (11.1%), and one (11.1%) showed type 3, type 2, and type 1 morphology, respectively. The malignancy or atypical LEGH were observed 2.9% (1/35), 2.0% (1/49), 43.3% (13/30), and 100% (4/4) in types 1 to 4, respectively (p < 0.0001 for trend).

When both type 3 or 4 MRI morphologies and abnormal cytology were shown, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and OR for differentiating malignancy or premalignancy were 61.1%, 96.7%, 73.3%, 94.4%, and 46.357, respectively. The P value of the McNemar analysis was 0.366, which means that the findings of MRI morphology and cytology results consistently correlated with benign and malignant pathology results.

### Adult cervical thymic cysts: a narrative review [^114gyePx]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Thymic cysts are rare benign neck masses, accounting for less than 1% of all cervical masses. This study aims to discern different presentations, investigations, and treatment options of thymic cysts in adults by reviewing prior published studies from January 2010 to October 2021 to bridge the knowledge gap since the last review by Michalopoulos in 2011. Moreover, we present a case of a 28-year-old male with a left cervical thymic cyst.

Data Sources

Data were obtained from a literature search using the ScienceDirect, PubMed, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar databases.

Methods and Results

This study retrospectively analyzes reported cases of adult cervical thymic cysts by collecting demographic data, patient presentation, duration, location, size, type of imaging, fine-needle aspiration, and surgical approach. Eighteen patients were included. Cysts were seen on the left (n = 9), right (n = 5), and midline (n = 4). The age of the patients ranged from 19 to 64 years. Most patients present with painless left-sided neck swelling. Computed tomography (CT) was the preferred imaging modality in most cases. Moreover, surgical excision was essential for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. This study did not require institutional review board approval.

Conclusion

Adult cervical thymic cyst is a rare etiology. Nevertheless, a painless left-sided neck mass with no clear lower border should uphold thymic cyst as a differential diagnosis. MRI and CT scans are the preferred imaging modalities for preoperative planning. Surgical excision is mandatory for treatment and histological confirmation. As of October 2021, around 54 cases of adult thymus cysts had been reported to the best of our knowledge and review.

### Thyroglossal duct cyst: an infrequently considered diagnosis in pediatric patients with anterior neck masses [^114hfHje]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a pediatric patient with an anterior neck mass and discuss the evaluation and treatment.

Methods

We present a case report and a discussion of the differential diagnosis of anterior cervical masses. The workup and therapy for an anterior neck mass, which was a thyroglossal duct cyst, are reviewed.

Results

A thyroglossal duct cyst in pediatric patients is an uncommon finding. For establishing a correct diagnosis, surgical confirmation is necessary. Identification is important because of the high incidence of misdiagnosis, recurrent infections, inadequate treatment, and possible neoplastic change.

Conclusion

A thyroglossal duct cyst should be included in the differential diagnosis of an anterior neck mass. Recommended treatment consists of surgical removal of the cyst, the entire thyroglossal duct tract, and the central portion of the hyoid bone.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^111NEr2U]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

4.000000000000000e+00 Colposcopy practice must follow guidance detailed in the ASCCP Colposcopy Standards. Colposcopy with targeted biopsy remains the primary method of detecting precancers requiring treatment. Because patients are managed less aggressively after a colposcopic examination where CIN grade 2 or higher (CIN 2+) is not found, maximizing detection of CIN 2+ at each colposcopy visit is paramount. Evidence-based practice recommends that biopsies be taken of all discrete acetowhite areas, usually 2 to 4 biopsies at each colposcopic examination. For those at lowest risk, defined as less than HSIL cytology, no evidence of HPV 16/18 infection, and a completely normal colposcopic impression (i.e. no acetowhitening, metaplasia, or other visible abnormality, and a fully visualized squamocolumnar junction), untargeted (random) biopsies are not recommended and patients with a completely normal colposcopic impression can be observed without biopsy. To ensure that CIN 2+ is not missed, the ASCCP Colposcopy Standards emphasize the need for biopsies even when the colposcopic impression is normal but any degree of acetowhitening, metaplasia, or other abnormality is present.

2012 Principles Carried Forward

5.000000000000000e+00 The primary goal of screening and management is cancer prevention through detection and treatment of cervical precancer. Numerous population-level studies indicate that incidence and mortality from cervical cancer decrease as detection and treatment of high-grade histologic cervical abnormalities (generally defined as CIN 2+) increases. Timely detection and treatment of the highest grade of precancers (CIN 3/AIS) have been the benchmark used for previous guidelinesand remain the primary goal of the 2019 management guideline; a secondary goal (because of the relative rarity of this finding in the United States) is early diagnosis of cervical cancer to reduce related morbidity and mortality. A patient's risk of having or developing CIN 3+ is estimated based on current and previous results, as well as history of previous precancer treatment. Management recommendations are guided by risk thresholds. Recommendations of routine screening, 1- or 3-year surveillance, colposcopy, or treatment each correspond to a risk stratum. These risk strata (ranges of risk for CIN 3+) are defined by Clinical Action Thresholds that were determined through the consensus process (Section E).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115GfmCT]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Episodes of PID often go unrecognized. Although certain cases are asymptomatic, others are not diagnosed because the patient or the health care provider do not recognize the implications of mild or nonspecific symptoms or signs (e.g. abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge). Even women with mild or asymptomatic PID might be at risk for infertility. Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, health care providers should maintain a low threshold for the clinical diagnosis of PID. The recommendations for diagnosing PID are intended to assist health care providers to recognize when PID should be suspected and when additional information should be obtained to increase diagnostic certainty. Diagnosis and management of other causes of lower abdominal pain (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, or functional pain) are unlikely to be impaired by initiating antimicrobial therapy for PID. Presumptive treatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active young women and other women at risk for STIs if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more of the following three minimum clinical criteria are present on pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness.

More specific criteria for diagnosing PID include endometrial biopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis; transvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging techniques demonstrating thickened, fluid-filled tubes with or without free pelvic fluid or tubo-ovarian complex, or Doppler studies indicating pelvic infection (e.g. tubal hyperemia); and laparoscopic findings consistent with PID. A diagnostic evaluation that includes some of these more extensive procedures might be warranted in certain cases. Endometrial biopsy is warranted for women undergoing laparoscopy who do not have visual evidence of salpingitis because endometritis is the only sign of PID for certain women.

Requiring that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation of empiric treatment can result in insufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis. After deciding whether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also consider the risk profile for STIs. More elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis and management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity. For example, the presence of signs of lower genital tract inflammation (predominance of leukocytes in vaginal secretions, cervical discharge, or cervical friability), in addition to one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of the diagnosis. One or more of the following additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical criteria and support a PID diagnosis:

### The use of MRI in the diagnosis and management of a bulky cervical carcinoma [^111gN5KA]. Gynecologic Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

In the treatment of gynecologic cancer, surgical planning depends on the site and extent of disease. The evaluation of the origin of a large pelvic mass with combined pelvic examination and ultrasound is often adequate. However, the following case report illustrates the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when sonographic findings are indeterminate and the origin of a pelvic mass is unclear.

Case

A 73-year-old woman presented for her first gynecologic exam in over 40 years. On speculum examination the cervix was not visible. A large, mobile pelvic mass was palpated during physical examination. Pelvic ultrasound revealed a large, cystic pelvic mass thought to be ovarian in origin. Surgery for presumed ovarian carcinoma was planned. Because a vaginal Pap smear revealed squamous-cell carcinoma, MRI was performed for further evaluation. MRI demonstrated a blood distended uterus with a large cervical tumor obstructing the endocervical os. After cervical dilatation under sonographic guidance, evacuation of the hematometrium was performed. Multiple biopsies of the cervix confirmed the diagnosis of a bulky Stage IIA squamous-cell carcinoma of the cervix. The patient was subsequently treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Follow-up MRI demonstrated an excellent treatment response. Modified radical hysterectomy was performed demonstrating very small residual tumor.

Conclusions

Magnetic resonance imaging, through multiplanar capabilities and high-contrast resolution, is a valuable tool that can assist the clinician in the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of challenging gynecologic malignancies.

### Prenatal diagnosis of a large, cervical, intraspinal, neurenteric cyst and postnatal outcome [^115g5Lpt]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Neurenteric cysts are rare congenital anomalies derived from the notochord and located in front of the spinal column, mostly at the cervical level. They consist of an intraspinal cystic component that is connected to a mediastinal or thoracic cyst. A case of a cervical, intraspinal, neurenteric cyst, diagnosed at 28 weeks of gestation and operated on at 3 and half months after birth, is reported. Herein, we discuss important features of this case including its rare occurrence, intrauterine diagnosis, and early surgical intervention. In conclusion, the nature of prenatal intradural cysts should be fully evaluated and differentiated between neurenteric cyst and other types of cysts with fetal ultrasonography. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of this potential cyst in fetal ultrasonography in utero. Neurenteric cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cervical intradural cystic lesions. In infants, successful surgery provides a cure in patients with cervical neurenteric cysts.

### Ultrasonographic diagnosis, classification, and treatment of cervical lymphatic malformation in paediatric patients: a retrospective study [^114FwD3B]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cervical lymphatic malformation is the most common lymphatic malformation and cervical vascular malformation in children, with an incidence of 1.2–2.8 per 1000 individuals. It develops prenatally and can be diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography in 50–65% of patients but by postnatal ultrasonography in 90% of patients. It is not typically diagnosed in adults. Surgical and other trauma can destroy the lymphatic drainage system, leading to acquired lymphatic malformation; other causes are also possible. Its clinical manifestations depend on the infiltration location and growth rate, and approximately 15–70% of patients have mild symptoms. Ultrasonographic diagnosis and differential diagnosis are based on intracystic fluid echoic, the thickness of cyst wall, and the cyst location; additionally, medical history and clinical manifestations are helpful for diagnosis.

Cervical lymphatic malformation can present as unilocular or multilocular cysts, and the cyst diameter varies from few millimetres to several centimetres. Therefore, it can be classified as macrocystic, microcystic, or a mixed type according to the cyst diameter. Although cervical lymphatic malformations are benign, they can invade adjacent critical structures, which increases the difficulty of surgical resection and the risk of postoperative recurrence. The malformations may also threaten the function of adjacent or affected tissues, organs, and as a result, appropriate treatment may be avoided. Cervical lymphatic malformations can predispose an individual to complications such as haemorrhage or infection, which further affect respiratory function and endanger life.

Multiple imaging methods should be used to classify and make differential diagnoses of cervical lymphatic malformations, monitor lesion progression, and assess the relationship of the lesion with adjacent structures to guide the optimal treatment method selection, reduce complications and recurrence, and avoid injury.

The aim of this retrospective single-centre study was to explore the ultrasonographic characteristics of patients with cervical lymphatic malformations in southern China and summarise key points of their diagnosis, differential diagnosis, classification, and treatment selection as well as analyse the causes of misdiagnoses and missed diagnoses.

### Novel strategy for the management of cervical multicystic diseases [^111cWKcJ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Image Analysis

We used MRI to categorize malignant potential by classifying the morphology and distribution of cysts, as follows:
The location of the lesion was classified into four parts (upper part, lower part, middle part, and the entire cervix).
The cyst and solid component patterns were categorized into four patterns as well: ① "Microcystic pattern" — only small cysts ≤ 3 mm were present, ② "Macrocystic pattern" — only cysts > 3 mm were present, ③ "Mixed pattern" — admixed microcysts and macrocysts (Supplemental Table 1), ④ "Solid and cystic pattern" — lesion comprised multiple cysts and solid components.

A 'solid component' was defined as a nodular or infiltrative solid tumor area, with diffusion restriction indicated by hyper-intensity on the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and hypo-intensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, relative to the uterine myometrium, suggesting possible malignancy. A solid-like hyper-intensity area seen at the center of a cosmos pattern was not regarded to be a solid component.

### Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome revealing a cervical bronchogenic cyst: a case report [^115Mcmi3]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The respiratory bud develops from the ventral side of the primitive foregut from the 4th week of development. Cervical bronchogenic cyst may result from an abnormal division of the bud and migration to an ectopic localization in the neck region. Other extrathoracic localizations have been described, including subcutaneous and even abdominal sites.

Antenatal discovery of a bronchogenic cyst is rare and localization is generally intrathoracic. One case has been reported of a cervico-mediastinal bronchogenic cyst detected by a cervical mass on prenatal US. Undetected cervical bronchogenic cyst may also cause polyhydramnios by esophageal compression. In both this case and ours, an abnormal fetal heart rate precipitated delivery by cesarean section. Nevertheless, the direct and indirect impact of this malformation on disturbances in fetal monitoring is difficult to establish.

The immediate neonatal respiratory distress of our patient was explained by direct compression of the trachea, causing major difficulties for intubation because the larynx could not be visualized. The use of a video-laryngoscope for intubation can improve the viewing conditions of the upper airways, making it easier to identify the laryngeal inlet. Rigid bronchoscopy or a flexometallic tube can also relieve glottic-subglottic compression, although great caution is required while advancing the scope or the tube. The ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure can also be done if prenatal diagnosis suggests fetal airway obstruction by a neck mass. Its use in this context has mainly been reported for cervical lymphatic malformations and cervical teratomas.

The main differential diagnosis is cystic hygroma, which is more likely in the setting of a multilocular cyst, and more unlikely in the setting of a unilocular cyst. Other differential diagnoses include thymic cyst, branchial cyst and thyroglossal duct cyst, but they are rarely responsible for neonatal respiratory distress. Only histological examination of the resected specimen confirms the diagnosis.

### Cervical lymphangioma: an acquired idiopathic presentation in an adult [^115Jtds9]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Lymphangioma is an uncommon benign pathology, usually reported in children and rarely in adults. In the past, the definitive diagnosis was made intraoperatively and was usually an unexpected finding. However, with today's modern imaging technologies, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the diagnosis can be assumed before intervention, even though the final diagnosis still can be reached only via histopathologic examination. Imaging techniques also can aid in the precise mapping of the lesion and in defining its boundaries with the surrounding vital structures, improving therapeutic success. Various therapeutic options are reported in literature, but complete surgical excision is still considered the best approach. We report a case of cervical lymphangioma of unknown etiology in an 18-year-old man and discuss the presentation, diagnosis, and management of this lesion.

Congenital cervical teratomas are extremely rare tumors with high perinatal mortality and morbidity rates particularly due to compression and distortion of the infant's airway. Hence, these mostly benign malformations require immediate excision, whereas surgery of these tumors is challenging for a multidisciplinary team. We report on a recent case of congenital cervical mature teratoma with total excision and cure. The aim of this case study is to report the authors' experience in managing a case of congenital cervical teratoma to provide a structured approach and help in decision making, once prenatal diagnosis is made.

### Excision of rare adult cervical thymic cyst [^114QZcg2]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Cervical thymic cysts (CTCs) represent 1% of all cervical cystic masses. A review of the literature found that CTCs are typically asymptomatic, with a propensity to be left sided. CTCs often require histological evaluation for diagnosis. A 27-year-old male patient presented to an outpatient otolaryngology clinic with worsening bilateral jaw and neck pain and an incidental right-sided neck mass found on cervical MRI. Preoperative differential diagnosis included venolymphatic malformation versus branchial cleft cyst. Histological examination of the excised specimen provided diagnosis of a CTC. Postoperatively, the patient reported improvement in cervical pain. CTCs are a rare cause of lateral neck mass in young adults. Typical presentation included neck enlargement with no symptoms or in some cases compressive symptoms. It is important to consider CTCs when formulating a differential for a lateral neck mass.

### Inner cyst approach, remove bronchial cervical cyst [^111fgEBD]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Although most cystic lesions in young adults represent a branchial cleft cyst, the bronchial cervical cyst is not rare (Acta Oto-Laryngologica 2010;130:300). Surgical excision is both diagnostic and curative and also eliminates the risk of infection or recurrence. As we have all known, it is hard to protect some important structures in an inflamed tissue, especially in infants. However, a correct approach can avoid this kind of iatrogenic injury. An accurate diagnosis is always by pathologic examination. The diagnosis can be made before operation when finding cartilage in the nodule. We present the preoperative diagnosis by finding gas in the nodule and removed it by inner cyst approach without surrounding tissue injury.

### Obstructive neonatal respiratory distress: infected pyriform sinus cyst [^111Tnq1S]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Infected lateral cervical cysts in newborn are rare. We present the case of a baby born at 41 weeks of gestation. At day 3, persistent cyanosis was noted, and a mass appeared in the left cervical region next to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. No cutaneous sinus was visible. Ultrasound imaging showed no sign of blood flow within the mass and no septae. The mass extended down to the aortic arch and pushed the trachea to the right. A cervical lymphangioma was first suspected. Puncture of the mass evacuated 80 mL of pus, and a drain was put in place. Opacification through the drain showed a tract originating from the left pyriform fossa. Preoperative laryngoscopy and catheterization of the fistula tract confirmed the diagnosis. The cyst was totally excised up to the sinus with the assistance of a guidewire inserted orally through a rigid laryngoscope. This is a rare case of an infected pyriform sinus cyst in the neonatal period.

### Cervical thymic anomalies – the Texas children's hospital experience [^111VRveL]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To review the presentation and management of cervical thymic cysts and ectopic thymic tissue at Texas Children's Hospital over the last 25 years.

Study Design

Case report and case series using retrospective chart review.

Methods

A case report is presented of a recently diagnosed thymic cyst highlighting diagnostic, management, and treatment strategies available for optimizing management of patients with significant mediastinal extension. We then present a retrospective review of cervical thymic anomalies at a tertiary academic medical center over a 25-year span (1983-present). Data extracted include patients' characteristics, clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, surgical management, and postoperative complications.

Results

Fifteen patients were found to have a pathological diagnosis of cervical thymic cyst, and 10 patients had a diagnosis of ectopic thymic tissue in the neck. This is the largest case series of cervical thymic anomalies presented in the literature to date. Patients' characteristics, diagnostic techniques, and treatment strategies are discussed.

Conclusions

Cervical thymic anomalies are a rare but necessary part of the differential diagnosis of a cervical mass. Computed tomography scan can both narrow the preoperative differential diagnosis and aid in surgical planning for thymic cyst excision. A full discussion of the embryology, clinical presentation, and management of cervical thymic cysts and a review of the current literature is presented.

### Ultrasonographic diagnosis, classification, and treatment of cervical lymphatic malformation in paediatric patients: a retrospective study [^114wMsJE]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To explore the imaging features, key diagnostic points, classification, treatment, and prognosis of cervical lymphatic malformation.

Methods

Overall, 320 patients diagnosed with cervical lymphatic malformation were retrospectively analysed in our hospital between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2017. Imaging modalities included colour Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Cervical lymphatic malformations were classified by cyst diameter. Treatments included interventional therapy, surgery, and expectant treatment.

Results

Cervical lymphatic malformation was identified in 320 of 1192 patients with lymphatic malformation. Four were excluded due to misdiagnosis by ultrasonography. Cervical lymphatic malformation was classified as mixed, macrocystic, and microcystic in 184 (57.5%), 117 (36.56%), and 19 (5.94%) patients, respectively. Sixty-four (20%), ten (3.12%), seven (2.19%), and three (0.94%) patients experienced intracystic haemorrhage, infection, concurrent intracystic haemorrhage and infection, and calcification, respectively. Among 260 (81.25%) patients who underwent interventional sclerotherapy, 163 (50.94%) received it once and 96 (30%) received it two or more times. Twenty-eight (8.75%), five (1.56%), and 27 (8.44%) patients underwent surgical resection, interventional sclerotherapy plus surgery, and expectant management, respectively.

Conclusions

Ultrasonography is useful for diagnosing definite cervical lymphatic malformation. Interventional therapy is the first choice for children with confirmed cervical lymphatic malformation.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^1117YbCe]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult cystic neck masses — malignancy prevalence and diagnostic approach: Up to 62% of neck metastases from Waldeyer ring sites are cystic and 10% of malignant cystic neck masses present without an obvious primary tumor; the overall incidence of malignancy in a cystic neck mass is 4% to 24%, increasing to 80% in patients > 40 years old. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) sensitivity is lower in cystic cervical metastases (73%) versus solid neck masses (90%), yet FNA should be used as the first-line modality for histologic assessment and may need to be repeated with image guidance to target solid components. When a primary site is not amenable to biopsy and malignancy is suspected but repeated or image-guided FNA are inadequate or benign, an expedient open excisional biopsy is recommended, and excisional biopsy is preferred for cystic masses to reduce the risk of tumor spillage.

### Novel strategy for the management of cervical multicystic diseases [^1117FuyF]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH) was first described as a benign lobular proliferation of small glands lined by mucin-producing endocervical epithelial cells without nuclear atypia nor stromal invasion. Subsequent studies demonstrated that a proportion of LEGH might be a precursor of gastric-type adenocarcinoma (GAS) and minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA), because there is common gastric differentiation and frequent coexistence of these two conditions. –

GAS and MDA are associated with a significantly lower 5-year overall survival rate compared with that of the usual-type endocervical adenocarcinoma (UEA). – The cause of the poor prognosis for GAS is unclear; however, it may be attributed to a highly infiltrating pattern of growth, retardation of timely diagnosis, and its refractoriness to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. –

Cervical cystic lesions are often difficult to distinguish from malignant lesions in routine clinical practice. Due to the recent spread of transvaginal ultrasound, multicystic lesions are increasingly found by chance, which leads to one of the causes of management confusion in clinical practice. In the past, the presence of cervical cysts led to an over-diagnosis and many cases of unnecessary radical hysterectomy.

Although a management protocol for patients with cervical multilocular lesions has been proposed, few of the underlying studies were based on a sufficiently large case series. A preoperative differential diagnosis between MDA, LEGH, and other cervical multilocular lesions is still problematic in primary clinical practice. In this study, we have retrospectively reviewed a large number of surgically treated cases of multicystic cervical lesions with a suspicion of GAS, MDA, or LEGH. We looked at their imaging and central pathological reviews to investigate the current status of their management, and we researched to develop an algorithm for their improved diagnosis and treatment.

### Congenital midline cervical cleft and thyroglossal duct fibrous cord-like, is there a mixed presentation? [^114SoWhp]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital midline cervical cleft is a rare condition and is frequently misdiagnosed as thyroglossal duct cyst. Otherwise, the combination of congenital midline cervical cleft and thyroglossal duct fibrosis in the same patient is as rare as important to be registered with the intention to inform and offer specific managements details for the literature.

Case Presentation

Eight-year-old boy with simultaneous congenital midline cervical cleft and a thyroglossal duct fibrosis. The anatomic, clinical, radiologic, and pathologic characteristics of the congenital midline cervical cleft are described as well as surgical technique for removal and repair with Z-plasty.

Conclusion

Congenital midline cervical cleft is a rare condition and when diagnosed must be surgically treated as early as possible. Its differential diagnosis is a clinical challenge.

### Novel strategy for the management of cervical multicystic diseases [^114XgamG]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

The presence of a solid component with a diffusion restriction within the lesion is an important finding suggesting malignancy, as described in previous reports. When MRI showed a type 4 morphology along with cellular atypia, the case was diagnosed as a malignancy (correct ratio: 3/3, 100%).

The clinical argument surrounds the management of multicystic lesions without a solid component, as reported previously, which corresponds to type 3 in our MRI category. Few reports focus on the MRI findings of MDA comprising only a cystic component. Omori et al. reported that AIS was identified in postmenopausal women showing a "raspberry-type" lesion with many tiny, closely aggregated cysts. However, in our study, the "raspberry pattern", which corresponds to the microcystic pattern, using our criteria, was not associated with the risk of malignancy. Other useful indicators for differentiating MDA comprising only a cystic component from benign multicystic diseases are unknown. Type 3, exhibiting "diffuse growth" or "focal mass-like bulging", is a newly proposed imaging feature in our criteria. In our cases, 60% (6/10) of the malignant lesions and 77.8% (7/9) of the premalignant lesions showed a type 3 MRI morphology. Lesions with "diffuse growth" or "focal mass-like bulging" were of significantly higher risk of malignancy or premalignancy (43.3%) compared with those with cosmos patterns without these features.

### What is the evidence for endoscopic thyroidectomy in the management of benign thyroid disease? [^11774co2]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

The principal indication for ET remains management of benign thyroid disease. ET using a cervical access is restricted to solitary nodules < 3 cm in diameter and to thyroid lobes up to 20 mL in volume. Larger cysts if preoperatively aspirated may be removed by cervical access. Generally benign nodules < 3 cm do not require surgery, so only small nodules presenting with follicular cytology or small toxic adenomas are eligible. Therefore, 5–12% of patients who require surgical intervention for a thyroid nodule may be selected for ET by cervical approach. Small goiters and limited Graves' disease also may be a potential indication for ET, although they generally do not require surgery. Some contraindications are common to all these techniques: large goiters, invasive malignant tumors, previous cervical operations, and history of neck irradiation. Extracervical access permits larger lesions up to 60 mm in size and enlarged glands (up to 60 mL volume) to be extracted endoscopically and also low-risk carcinomas (to 10–20 mm in size; younger than aged 50 years, node-negative, intrathyroidal) have been assessed by the extracervical approach. Therefore, 34–53% may be treated by indirect ET.

### Cervical bronchogenic cysts: case report and review of the literature [^112FdEzD]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2014). Low credibility.

Pediatric cervical masses can present a diagnostic dilemma given their broad differential diagnosis. We present a 3-year-old girl with a midline anterior neck mass found to have histopathologic findings consistent with a bronchogenic cyst. Although rare, bronchogenic cysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis in both lateral and anterior pediatric cervical masses as their pathophysiology and embryogenesis differ considerably from more common cervical masses. Imaging is an important aspect in the pre-operative work-up, although diagnosis is only made after histopathologic analysis. Complete surgical excision is the definitive treatment.

### Cervical approach to the thoracic inlet in paediatric patients with broncho-pulmonary foregut malformations [^113bF7Bd]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Lesions of the thoracic inlet present a significant challenge to the surgeon due to the difficulty of access and proximity to important neurovascular structures within the region. We describe two cases of benign disease of the thoracic inlet in children, one bronchogenic cyst and an esophageal duplication, and report the cervical approach used to manage them. Both lesions extended from the neck through the thoracic inlet, but demonstrate how benign lesions in this area can be delivered up into a cervical incision, negating the need for the more invasive modified thoracotomies. A cervical approach can be safely and successfully used to approach benign pathology, such as bronchogenic cysts and oesophageal duplications of the thoracic inlet. Careful multidisciplinary planning is required for such procedures.

### Successful management of a massive hemorrhage due to rupture of cystic cervical endometriosis by a loop electrosurgical excision procedure [^114e1EEx]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of cystic cervical endometriosis that caused a massive hemorrhage due to rupture of a cyst and successful management with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).

Design

Case report.

Setting

University Hospital.

Patient

A 37-year-old nulliparous woman.

Intervention(S)

Medical management including surgical treatment.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Clinical follow-up and pathologic diagnosis.

Result(S)

A hemorrhagic cystic cervical mass was excised with emergent LEEP. The mass was found to be cervical endometriosis. There was no evidence of recurrence until 1 year after excision.

Conclusion(S)

Cystic formation of cervical endometriosis — like ovarian endometrioma, which causes a massive hemorrhage due to rupture — is extremely rare, although cervical endometriosis is generally asymptomatic. Hysterectomy is considered in such cases but can be avoided via LEEP that incorporates partial excision of the uterine cervix.

### Management of tarlov cysts: an uncommon but potentially serious spinal column disease-review of the literature and experience with over 1, 000 referrals [^113mnnDC]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Tarlov cysts were thought to be anatomic variants of uncertain etiology and clinical significance when initially described over 80 years ago. They are often detected in routine lumbosacral imaging and generally not reported in a differential diagnosis. There is increasing evidence that at least some Tarlov cysts are symptomatic and can have a significant adverse impact on patients' health and well-being. Women are disproportionately affected with this condition, often presenting with long-standing pain and neurological dysfunctions. Significant gender bias has been a concern in the management of these patients. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on patient selection or management approaches for symptomatic Tarlov cysts. This review article updates information on the prevalence, diagnosis, clinical significance, and treatments of these cysts. Based on these findings and experience with over 1000 patient referrals, a treatment decision algorithm for symptomatic Tarlov cysts was constructed to provide guidance for appropriate management of patients with these complex cysts.

### Congenital cervical cysts, sinuses and fistulae [^112pke7v]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Congenital cervical anomalies are important to consider in the differential of head and neck masses in children and adults. These lesions can present as palpable cystic masses, infected masses, draining sinuses, or fistulae. Thyroglossal duct cysts are most common, followed by branchial cleft anomalies, dermoid cysts, and more rarely median cervical clefts. Other topics discussed include median ectopic thyroid, cervical teratomas, and branchiootorenal syndrome. Appropriate diagnosis and management of these lesions requires a complete understanding of their embryology and anatomy. Correct diagnosis, resolution of infectious issues before definitive therapy, and complete surgical excision are essential to prevent recurrence.

### Misdiagnosed giant parathyroid cyst: differential diagnosis of a neck mass of the central region [^115kdgf7]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

PCs are rare benign lesions of the parathyroid glands that represent less than 0.5% of the parathyroid gland disorders, but they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neck masses, especially in the differential diagnosis of the cystic anterior neck masses.

The first case of PC was reported by Sandstromin 1880, and the first surgical excision of a PC was made in 1905 by Goris.

The masses of the anterior region of the neck can be solid or cystic; the differential diagnosis of cystic cervical masses includes thyroid cyst, thymic cyst, thyroglossal duct cyst, lateral branchial cyst, bronchogenic cyst and PC.

There are two types of PCs, which depend on their ability to secrete hormones: functioning and non-functioning ones. The non-functioning ones are more frequent than the functioning ones. They can present with a wide variety of symptoms, from asymptomatic neck masses to the different clinical manifestations of hyperparathyroidism and can be found from the angle of the mandible until the mediastinum.

Most studies support FNA as the gold standard to distinguish PCs; it shows elevated PTH in the clear water cystic fluid.

The treatment depends on the clinical presentation: non-functioning PCs are first treated with FNA, and then surgically excised if they recurs, while functioning PCs are treated with surgical excision. Careful dissection is the key to successful management, in order to avoid the rupture of the thin wall of the cyst.

In this case, the patient was at first treated for a simple thyroid cyst.

Because of the macroscopic characteristic of the fluid (bright and aqueous), we decided to measure the PTH in the cystic fluid, according to the main literature. The diagnosis was made before surgery. The patient was not subjected to unnecessary procedures and there were no hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. Our diagnostic approach agreed with the other studies described in literature. As Silva et al explained in their paper, it is important to exclude PC during the evaluation of a patient with a neck cystic mass.

Learning points

Parathyroid cysts had to be considered in the differential diagnosis of the anterior cystic neck masses.
Diagnosis is made by the finding of high levels of parathyroid hormone in the cystic fluid.
Surgical treatment is reserved to ones with large size tending to relapse despite needle aspirations.

### Spinal arachnoid cysts in adults: diagnosis and management. A single-center experience [^114SD3Wn]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVEAdult spinal arachnoid cysts (SACs) are rare entities of indistinct etiology that present with pain or myelopathy. Diagnosis is made on imaging studies with varying degrees of specificity. In symptomatic cases, the standard treatment involves surgical exploration and relief of neural tissue compression. The aim of this study was to illustrate features of SACs in adults, surgical management, and outcomes.METHODSThe authors searched medical records for all SACs in adults in the 10-year period ending in December 2016. Radiology and pathology reports were reviewed to exclude other spine cystic disorders. Recurrent or previously treated patients were excluded. Demographic variables (age, sex) and clinical presentation (symptoms, duration, history of infection or trauma, and examination findings) were extracted. Radiological features were collected from radiology reports and direct interpretation of imaging studies. Operative reports and media were reviewed to accurately describe the surgical technique. Finally, patient-reported outcomes were collected at every clinic visit using the SF-36.RESULTSThe authors' search identified 22 patients with SACs (mean age at presentation 53.5 years). Seventeen patients were women, representing an almost 3:1 sex distribution. Symptoms comprised back pain (n = 16, 73%), weakness (n = 10, 45%), gait ataxia (n = 11, 50%), and sphincter dysfunction (n = 4, 18%). The mean duration of symptoms was 15 months. Seven patients (32%) exhibited signs of myelopathy. All patients underwent preoperative MRI; in addition, 6 underwent CT myelography. SACs were located in the thoracic spine (n = 17, 77%), and less commonly in the lumbar spine (n = 3, 14%) and cervical/cervicothoracolumbar region (n = 2, 9%). Based on imaging findings, the cysts were interpreted as intradural SACs (n = 11, 50%), extradural SACs (n = 6, 27%), or ventral spinal cord herniation (n = 2, 9%); findings in 3 patients (14%) were inconclusive. Nineteen patients underwent surgical treatment consisting of laminoplasty in addition to cyst resection (n = 13, 68%), ligation of the connecting pedicle (n = 4, 21%), or fenestration/marsupialization (n = 2, 11%). Postoperatively, patients were followed up for an average of 8.2 months (range 2–30 months). Postoperative MRI showed complete resolution of the SAC in 14 of 16 patients. Patient-reported outcomes showed improvement in SF-36 parameters. One patient suffered a delayed wound infection.CONCLUSIONSIn symptomatic patients with imaging findings suggestive of spinal arachnoid cyst, surgical exploration and complete resection is the treatment of choice. Treatment is usually well tolerated, carries low risks, and provides the best chances for optimal recovery.

### Cervical thoracic duct cyst: a conservative resolution [^111GWj8D]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her 70s presented with an enlarging, asymptomatic palpable mass in the left supraclavicular fossa. The clinical impression was of a lipoma. Imaging showed a cystic lesion with continuity of a tubular structure leading to the carotid sheath. Cytology was consistent with thoracic duct sampling. A diagnosis of the rare entity of a thoracic duct cyst with supraclavicular extension was made. This was managed conservatively via repeated aspirations which reduced the size of the mass.

### How MRI imaging for an ovarian cyst led to diagnosis of short cervix [^115Hj7HK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Backgroud

MRI is a useful diagnostic tool in pregnancy for evaluation of fetal anomalies, placental location and implantation, and abdominal and pelvic structures. Fetal intracranial abnormalities, multiple fetal anomalies and fetal abnormalities that are inconclusive on ultrasound are best assessed via fetal MRI. Placenta accreta is accurately diagnosed on MRI and is of particular use when posterior accreta is suspected and to determine the depth of invasion. In evaluation of adnexal masses, MRI allows for better definition of tissue planes and tissue composition over ultrasound with high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating benign and malignant masses. MRI is also increasingly utilized for acute abdominal pain in the pregnant patient due to its high diagnostic accuracy and safety. In this setting, MRI can diagnose gastrointestinal causes of pain including appendicitis and inflammatory bowel disease, degenerating fibroids, and adnexal masses and torsion.

Adnexal masses are found in 0.05–3.2% of pregnant patients. Persistence of an adnexal mass in pregnancy is more likely when the mass is greater than 5 cm and has complex morphology on ultrasound. In pregnancy, adnexal masses can be surgically removed in the second trimester or expectantly managed.

Abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound is initially used to visualize adnexal masses, with MRI the modality of choice if additional imaging is clinically indicated.

Short cervical length is a marker for preterm birth, which is responsible for significant perinatal morbidity and mortality. Transvaginal ultrasound is used for cervical length assessment and screening is recommended in the second trimester. A rescue cerclage is effective for patients with a very short cervical length < 10 mm.

The presented case demonstrates the findings of unmeasurable cervix during an MRI performed for evaluation of a large adnexal mass.

### Survival from cancer of the uterine cervix in england and wales up to 2001 [^112HjoBS]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment

Carcinoma of the cervix is usually clinically obvious on gynaecological examination and a small biopsy may be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis and determine the histotype. On the occasions when it is screen detected, that is, only detected because the affected woman had a routine cervical smear test, it may not be clinically apparent and may require a colposcopic examination. Under these circumstances the tumour may be very early in its natural history, at the microinvasive stage, and requires a so-called 'cone biopsy' to assess both depth of invasion and lesion width.

There are two main elements in the diagnostic process, which enable optimal treatment planning:
To stage the disease using the FIGO staging system, by evaluating its extent by means of thorough clinical examination, chest X-ray and possibly cystoscopic examination. Magnetic resonance scanning is a valuable supplement to clinical staging particularly in determining the local extent of tumour and identifying obvious node enlargement.
To determine the histotype for example, squamous or adenocarcinoma, the degree of differentiation and the presence of lymph vascular channel involvement.

During the past 20 years, three key developments have taken place in cervical cancer management. The most significant therapeutic advance has been the advent of chemoradiation, in which a relatively small dose of platinum chemotherapy is given weekly, concurrently, with external beam radiation. A number of randomised trials published in 1999 confirmed a significant survival benefit for chemoradiation and this has been the recommended standard of care since 2000 in the United Kingdom. The second development has been fertility sparing surgery, which is most appropriate for women who wish to retain fertility and who have tumours less than 2 cm across. In such cases the uterine corpus can be retained and a successful pregnancy may result. The third development, and in some way the most important, has been the determination and national guidance that the management of cervical cancer should be undertaken by specialised multidisciplinary teams. This has improved access to accurate pathological diagnosis, expert treatment planning, and specialised surgical and non-surgical oncological care. There was evidence in the past that access to expert care was unequal with unequal outcomes but with the full implementation of Improving Outcomes Guidance, this should be resolved.

### Novel strategy for the management of cervical multicystic diseases [^111rk3ZR]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, multicystic lesions with type 3 or 4 MRI morphologies were at high risk of premalignancy or malignancy. When the MRI showed a type 3 or 4 morphology in association with at least AGC in the Pap smear, active management, such as biopsy or conization, or hysterectomy, may be reasonable to address the possibility of premalignancy or malignancy. These diagnostic criteria should be evaluated in future prospective studies.

### Congenital neck masses [^113Yyxcg]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

There are many possible causes of congenital neck masses, with the most common ones being thyroglossal duct cysts, branchial cleft anomalies, and vascular malformations. Most congenital neck masses are asymptomatic in the neonatal period, but depending on the location and the size, they can cause airway obstruction and serious complications at birth. Proper diagnosis is important for optimal treatment planning, and if the airway is compromised, multidisciplinary teamwork is critical for proper airway management. This review summarizes the clinical features, etiology, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of different types of congenital neck masses.

### Thymopharyngeal duct cyst: a case presentation and literature review [^114xuMzE]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of a lateral cystic neck mass includes branchial cleft cysts and lymphangiomas. Cervical thymic cysts are rare, and thymopharyngeal duct cysts, which maintain a connection to the pharynx, are rarer still. We present an interesting case of a 6 year-old male who developed acute onset of a left-sided neck mass. CT and MRI findings revealed a multiloculated cyst closely associated with the left lobe of the thyroid gland with a tract extending up along the carotid sheath to the pyriform sinus. Complete surgical excision was performed. The anatomic location and pathology were consistent with a thymopharyngeal duct cyst. The embryology, clinical presentation, radiologic and pathologic findings, and surgical management of thymopharyngeal duct cysts will be discussed.

Cervical lymphadenopathy (CL) is common in childhood. The aim of this study is to evaluate the etiology, follow-up, and treatment of persistent CL. The authors studied retrospectively 50 children with CL, hospitalized at the Department of Pediatrics and Pediatrics Surgery. Patients underwent ultrasonography. Thirty-six percent presented abnormal ultrasonographic image and underwent excisional biopsy. Biopsies revealed 4 thyroglossal cysts, 3 branchial cysts, 1 hemangioma, 2 sebaceous cysts, 1 dermoid cyst, 5 occurrences of tuberculosis lymphadenitis, 1 occurrence of Bartonella henselae lymphadenopathy, and 1 case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In conclusion, CL is usually a benign finding; bacterial and viral infections are the most common causes. Ultrasonography help in etiology and follow-up of CL.

### Parapharyngeal cyst: considerations on embryology, clinical evaluation, and surgical management [^115RZc3n]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Branchial cleft anomalies represent a common cause of cervical mass in adults. Describing a case report, we reviewed embryology, clinical elements, and treatment options for parapharyngeal congenital cysts. A case of a parapharyngeal cyst mimicking a tonsillar abscess is presented. A second branchial cleft cyst was hypothesized on a clinical and radiologic basis and then confirmed by histologic data. Magnetic resonance imaging provided fundamental information for the study of the parapharyngeal mass and its relationship with surrounding structures. In literature, surgical excision is the recommended therapy. We removed the cyst through a transcervical approach, with no complications or recurrence after 3 years. In our opinion, cervicotomy should be considered the gold standard approach, even for lesions not palpable in the cervical area. When dealing with a parapharyngeal cyst, second branchial cleft anomalies should be considered. Our experience confirms that cervicotomy is a safe approach to parapharyngeal congenital lesions.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^114p1Pzp]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

6.000000000000000e+00 Guidelines apply to all individuals with a cervix. Guidelines apply to women and transgender men with a cervix, including individuals who have undergone supracervical hysterectomy. Risk estimates were validated in individuals of diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds and shown to be comparable. Though not the primary focus of the 2019 guidelines, management recommendations are also provided for patients who have undergone hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and who have a previous diagnosis of histologic HSIL, CIN 2, CIN 2/3, CIN 3, and/or AIS, irrespective of whether the hysterectomy was performed for precancer treatment or another indication.

7.000000000000000e+00 Equal management for equal risk. History and current test results are used to calculate a patient's current and future risk of CIN 3+. Similar risks are managed similarly, regardless of the combination of results/history used to estimate the risk.

8.000000000000000e+00 Balancing benefits and harms. Providing the best care means balancing cancer prevention with overtesting and overtreatment. Preventing all cervical cancers is unfortunately not an achievable goal. Interventions to prevent cervical cancer can cause harm. The 2019 guidelines are designed to maximize cervical cancer prevention and minimize harms from overtesting and overtreating by managing patients according to their current and future risks of CIN 3+. High-risk patients require closer follow-up to maximize detection of CIN 3+, whereas low-risk patients require fewer tests and procedures.

9.000000000000000e+00 Guidelines apply to asymptomatic patients that require management of abnormal cervical screening test results. Patients with symptoms such as abnormal uterine or vaginal bleeding or a visibly abnormal-appearing cervix require appropriate diagnostic testing as this may be a sign of cancer. This evaluation may include cervical cytology, colposcopy, diagnostic imaging, and cervical, endocervical, or endometrial biopsy. Guidelines cannot cover all clinical situations and clinical judgment is advised, especially in those circumstances which are not covered by the 2019 guidelines.

1.000000000000000e+01 Guidelines are intended for use in the United States. Appropriate management may differ in countries with limited follow-up capabilities, less availability of colposcopy, limited pathology infrastructure, or different views of the trade-offs between cancer risk, cost, and overtesting/overtreatment.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^111xBd4q]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bladder cancer - NCCN, more specifically with respect to management of recurrent or persistent disease, NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining the following evaluations in patients with cytology positive, imaging negative, and cystoscopy negative results on follow-up:

- repeat cytology within 3 months

- selected mapping biopsies including transurethral biopsy of the prostate

- cytology of the upper tract

- ureteroscopy

- enhanced cystoscopy (if available); if enhanced cystoscopy is not readily available, proceed to cystoscopy with bladder biopsies with or without uroscopy

- non-urinary tract source (e.g., vagina, cervix, rectum) and referral to gynecology or other specialist, as appropriate.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^112rHnWH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cystic neck mass statement — policy basis and supporting text emphasize avoiding misdiagnosis and outline the recommendation rationale: Risks, harms, costs are the cost of additional diagnostic tests, and the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments express concern by the GDG that some patients receive false reassurance about cystic masses despite studies showing a high rate of malignancy and false-negative biopsies. Intentional vagueness and role of patient preferences are none; exceptions are none; the policy level is recommendation; and there were no differences of opinion. The supporting text states the purpose is to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis of malignant cystic neck masses in adults, notes that the most common cause of a lateral cystic neck mass has traditionally been thought to be a branchial cleft anomaly, yet a single cervical cystic lymph node metastasis can mimic a branchial cleft cyst clinically.

### A rare congenital neck lump [^113KpmCL]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

We describe the case and present a radiological image of a neck lump identified antenatally with ultrasound imaging. Postnatally a left-sided asymptomatic neck lump was identified in the left posterior triangle of the neck. Repeat ultrasound and CT imaging were arranged confirming a cyst adjacent to the cervical oesophagus and displacing the carotid sheath anteriorly. Complete cyst excision was achieved with no complications. Histological analysis identified a 30×22×20 mm cyst with a smooth muscle layer within the cyst wall and a lining of respiratory epithelium. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of cervical duplication cyst (CDC). Proximity to the carotid sheath and oesophagus can make CDC excision potentially dangerous hence preoperative CT scanning was useful to establish the anatomical relations of the cyst in this case.

### Novel strategy for the management of cervical multicystic diseases [^114QtNix]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the clinical practices of diagnosing multicystic cervical lesions as a means to develop a more appropriate diagnostic algorithm for gastric-type adenocarcinoma (GAS) and its precursors.

Methods

Clinical information for 159 surgically treated patients for multicystic disease of the uterine cervix was collected from 15 hospitals. We performed a central review of the MRI and pathological findings. The MRI findings were categorized into four types including two newly proposed imaging features based on the morphology and distribution of cysts, and the diagnosis accuracy was assessed. Among the four MRI types, types 1 and 2 were categorized as benign lesions that included LEGH; type 3 were precancerous lesions (with an assumption of atypical LEGH); and type 4 were malignant lesions.

Results

The central pathological review identified 56 cases of LEGH, seven with GAS, four with another form of carcinoma, and 92 with benign disease. In clinical practice, over-diagnosis of malignancy (suspicion of MDA) occurred for 12/19 cases (63.2%) and under-diagnosis of malignancy occurred for 4/11 (36%). Among the 118 patients who had a preoperative MRI and underwent a hysterectomy, type 3 or 4 MRI findings in conjunction with abnormal cytology were positively indicative of premalignancy or malignancy, with a sensitivity and specificity of 61.1% and 96.7%, respectively.

Conclusions

Although the correct preoperative diagnosis of cervical cancer with a multicystic lesion is challenging, the combination of cytology and MRI findings creates a more appropriate diagnostic algorithm that significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy for differentiating benign disease from premalignancy and malignancy.

### Cervical thoracic duct cyst: importance of preoperative suspicion for appropriate management of left-sided neck mass [^11384dJZ]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Cervical thoracic duct cysts occur infrequently but are an important consideration when evaluating cystic supraclavicular masses. Only 22 cases have been reported to date. We review the clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment of 2 cases of large thoracic duct cysts treated with surgical resection. A high suspicion of thoracic duct cyst based on location, radiographic findings, and fine-needle aspiration results is sufficient evidence for recommendation of surgical excision. However, enlarged cysts, as noted in our cases, can obliterate or attenuate the thoracic duct, making it difficult to identify intraoperatively. A high suspicion of thoracic duct cyst is important for identifying and ligating the duct to prevent complications such as chyle leak or chylothorax.

### How MRI imaging for an ovarian cyst led to diagnosis of short cervix [^117WHuqC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during pregnancy is a growing diagnostic modality for a variety of different indications including fetal anomalies and maternal masses. A literature search did not find any case reports diagnosing a short cervix on MRI before 20 weeks gestation.

Case presentation

A 34-year-old female underwent magnetic resonance imaging for further evaluation of a known ovarian cyst which demonstrated a multiseptated cystic mass measuring 15.5 × 9.9 × 18.5 cm in the right adnexa at 19 weeks gestation. An incidental finding on MRI of "bulging of membranes into the cervical canal to the level of the external os" was noted. The patient had 3 prior full-term cesarean deliveries with no history of short cervix. Ultrasound confirmed dilated cervix with no measurable cervix. The patient underwent a rescue cerclage.

Conclusion

This case describes an unmeasurable cervix diagnosed incidentally during an MRI to characterize a large adnexal mass. In pregnancy, MRI can be a useful imaging modality to evaluate fetal anatomy, placental position and implantation, and abdominal and pelvic structures. In this case, evaluation of the uterus and cervix during imaging for an adnexal mass allowed for detection of an unmeasurable cervix and intervention with a rescue cerclage.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^115L82Lu]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

2006 consensus guidelines — General comments — For certain clinical situations there is limited high-quality evidence, and in these cases the guidelines have been based on consensus expert opinion. Acceptable management strategies reflect an acceptable level of risk of failing to detect high-grade neoplasia or cancer, and it is unreasonable to expect this risk can be reduced to zero; attempts to achieve zero risk could result in greater harm than good, including overtreatment. The guidelines should never substitute for clinical judgment, and clinical judgment should always be used when applying a guideline to an individual patient because it is impossible to develop guidelines that apply to all clinical situations.

### Primary cervical thoracic duct cyst: a case report and review of the literature [^115cJxdt]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Thoracic duct cysts are uncommon entities that are usually found in the thoracic segments of the thoracic duct. The presence of a thoracic duct cyst in the cervical area has been rarely reported. Etiologically, these cysts can arise either as a primary growth or secondary to trauma, obstruction, or inflammation. This entity was first described in 1964, and only 33 cases have been previously reported in literature. Of these, 16 cases involved a primary cyst. We report a new case of a primary thoracic duct cyst, and we discuss its presentation, diagnosis, and management, with an emphasis on meticulous surgical technique. We also review the relevant literature.
