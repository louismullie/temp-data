## Question

When is atropine recommended for bradycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when atropine is recommended for bradycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the bradycardia is hemodynamically significant. Then, I should verify the mechanism of atropine and which bradyarrhythmias it is likely to help. Next, I will review dosing, special populations, and contraindications. After that, I should consider alternatives if atropine fails and outline a practical algorithm. Finally, I will integrate evidence quality and summarize a concise, clinically actionable answer with caveats for exceptions like organophosphate poisoning and pediatric scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: atropine is not for all bradycardia, but for acute symptomatic bradycardia with hemodynamic compromise or concerning symptoms such as hypotension, altered mental status, shock, ischemic chest discomfort, or acute heart failure, where rapid heart rate augmentation is prioritized while reversible causes are addressed in parallel [^113pNuYX] [^113FuZSD].

> I need to check the mechanism next. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist that increases sinus node automaticity and enhances atrioventricular nodal conduction; it works best when the bradycardia is vagally mediated or at the AV nodal level, and is less likely to help infranodal block or wide-complex conduction disease, so I should confirm rhythm and QRS width before assuming benefit [^116qNDHr] [^113ptbdT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dosing. I initially thought the adult dose was 0.5 mg IV every 3–5 minutes to a maximum of 3 mg, but wait, I should verify the most current guidance. The 2025 AHA ALS update specifies 1 mg IV every 3–5 minutes to a maximum of 3 mg, which supersedes older 0.5 mg increments, so I should align with that while noting that many older sources still cite 0.5–1 mg; in ischemic heart disease, total atropine should not exceed 0.03–0.04 mg/kg to avoid excessive tachycardia and ischemia, and in pediatrics the dose is 0.02 mg/kg with a minimum of 0.1 mg and maximum single dose of 0.5 mg, repeatable once [^113q5YFZ] [^113XhQsB] [^115q7m3j].

> Next, I should review special populations and contraindications. In heart transplant recipients without autonomic reinnervation, atropine can cause paradoxical heart block or sinus arrest and should be avoided; in hypothermic bradycardia, atropine is ineffective; in acute inferior MI with suspected nodal ischemia, atropine is reasonable for nodal-level block but should be used cautiously given ischemia risk; in calcium channel blocker or beta-blocker toxicity, atropine may be tried for symptomatic bradycardia but is often insufficient and should not delay calcium, high-dose insulin, and vasopressors [^111uJQDm] [^114cxwLm] [^111AZoA4] [^1132PBQY].

> I will now examine alternatives and escalation. If atropine is ineffective or inappropriate, transcutaneous pacing is a reasonable bridge, and catecholamines such as dopamine 5–20 mcg/kg/min or epinephrine 2–10 mcg/min can be used while preparing for transvenous pacing; in acute MI, temporary pacing is indicated for medically refractory symptomatic bradycardia, and in CCB toxicity, high-dose insulin therapy and vasopressors are first-line beyond atropine [^113pNuYX] [^111AZoA4] [^1132PBQY].

> But wait, what if the bradycardia is toxin-related or pediatric. In organophosphate or carbamate poisoning, atropine is first-line and often requires much larger, rapidly titrated doses to achieve atropinization; in pediatrics, atropine is considered for bradycardia with cardiopulmonary compromise due to increased vagal tone or AV block, with epinephrine as the cornerstone if perfusion remains inadequate despite oxygenation and ventilation, and routine atropine premedication for intubation is not universally required though it may be reasonable in select contexts [^116T7Syu] [^115q7m3j] [^113XxE72].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. First, assess stability and identify reversible causes while supporting ABCs; if there is hemodynamic compromise from bradycardia, give atropine 1 mg IV every 3–5 minutes to a maximum of 3 mg, monitor closely, and if ineffective or contraindicated, escalate to transcutaneous pacing and/or catecholamines while preparing for transvenous pacing; if compromise resolves, observe and treat underlying causes; if there is no compromise, observe, obtain a 12-lead ECG, and address reversible contributors before committing to chronotropes or pacing [^113pNuYX] [^113FuZSD] [^115E52dF].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence. Recommendations are largely Class IIa with Level B-NR or C-LD evidence, reflecting observational data and expert consensus rather than large RCTs; nonetheless, multiple high-quality guidelines converge on the same approach, and a small randomized trial showed dopamine was equivalent to transcutaneous pacing after failed atropine, supporting the escalation strategy when atropine fails [^113FuZSD] [^113BbE6b].

> Final answer, keeping it clinically actionable: atropine is recommended for acute symptomatic bradycardia with hemodynamic compromise or concerning symptoms, typically heart rate less than 50–60 bpm with hypotension, altered mental status, shock, ischemic chest discomfort, or acute heart failure, after ensuring airway and oxygenation and while searching for reversible causes; give 1 mg IV every 3–5 minutes to a maximum of 3 mg, avoid in denervated hearts, use cautiously in ischemia, and escalate to pacing or catecholamines if ineffective or contraindicated [^113pNuYX] [^113hUZRK] [^116qNDHr].

---

Atropine is indicated for **symptomatic bradycardia** with hemodynamic compromise (hypotension, altered mental status, ischemic chest discomfort, or acute heart failure) [^113pNuYX] [^113FuZSD]. It is **not indicated for asymptomatic bradycardia** or bradycardia due to reversible causes (e.g. hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances, drug toxicity) without symptoms [^113pNuYX]. Atropine is ineffective for infranodal (His-Purkinje) block or wide-QRS bradycardias and is contraindicated in patients with **heart transplant without autonomic reinnervation** [^116qNDHr] [^111uJQDm]. The adult dose is 0.5–1 mg IV every 3–5 minutes to a maximum of 3 mg; if ineffective, use transcutaneous pacing or catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine) [^113hUZRK] [^113pNuYX].

---

## Indications for atropine in bradycardia

Atropine is indicated for **symptomatic bradycardia** characterized by:

- **Hemodynamic compromise**: Hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg), altered mental status, ischemic chest discomfort, or acute heart failure [^113pNuYX].

- **Sinus node dysfunction (SND)**: Symptomatic or hemodynamically significant SND [^1139uuRp].

- **Atrioventricular (AV) block**: Second-degree or third-degree AV block at the AV nodal level with symptoms or hemodynamic compromise [^114ufhtJ].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Atropine is **contraindicated or should be used with caution** in the following scenarios:

- **Heart transplant patients**: Atropine is contraindicated in patients with heart transplant without autonomic reinnervation due to paradoxical bradycardia or asystole [^111uJQDm] [^112xx1rS].

- **Infranodal block**: Atropine is ineffective for bradycardia due to infranodal (His-Purkinje) block or wide-QRS bradycardias [^116qNDHr] [^112CSHSL].

- **Ischemic heart disease**: Use cautiously in acute myocardial infarction, as excessive heart rate increase may worsen ischemia [^116qNDHr] [^113XhQsB].

---

## Clinical scenarios where atropine is not recommended

Atropine is **not recommended** in the following scenarios:

- **Asymptomatic bradycardia**: No hemodynamic compromise or symptoms [^113pNuYX].

- **Reversible causes**: Bradycardia due to hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances, or drug toxicity without symptoms [^113pNuYX].

- **Infranodal block**: Wide-QRS bradycardias or infranodal block [^116qNDHr].

---

## Dosage and administration

The **recommended adult dosage** of atropine for bradycardia is:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Dose** | **Frequency** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Symptomatic bradycardia | 0.5–1 mg IV | Every 3–5 minutes | 3 mg |
| Cardiac arrest (bradyasystolic) | 1 mg IV | Every 3–5 minutes | 3 mg |

---

## Alternative therapies

If atropine is ineffective or contraindicated, **alternative therapies** include:

- **Transcutaneous pacing**: Non-invasive, rapid bedside intervention [^113W8dnr].

- **Catecholamines**: Dopamine (5–20 mcg/kg/min) or epinephrine (2–10 mcg/min) [^113hUZRK].

- **Transvenous pacing**: For refractory cases or when transcutaneous pacing is unavailable or ineffective [^117U5z1p].

- **Contraindicated**: Heart transplant without autonomic reinnervation, infranodal block, or wide-QRS bradycardias [^111uJQDm] [^116qNDHr].

- **Not recommended**: Asymptomatic bradycardia or reversible causes without symptoms [^113pNuYX].

- **Dosage**: 0.5–1 mg IV every 3–5 minutes, maximum 3 mg [^113hUZRK].

- **Alternatives**: Transcutaneous pacing, catecholamines, or transvenous pacing if atropine fails [^113pNuYX].

---

Atropine is indicated for **symptomatic bradycardia** with hemodynamic compromise, SND, or AV nodal block, but is contraindicated in heart transplant patients without autonomic reinnervation and ineffective for infranodal block. If atropine fails, use pacing or catecholamines [^113pNuYX].

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — atropine for hemodynamically significant bradycardia and atrioventricular block is described with dosing, efficacy context, and cautions: Atropine enhances atrioventricular nodal conduction and automaticity and is generally given in 0.5- to 1.0-mg IV increments; advanced cardiac life support recommendations advise early use for hemodynamically significant bradycardia, including atrioventricular block, and uncontrolled cohort studies suggest efficacy particularly in acute inferior MI. Atropine is unlikely to improve atrioventricular block at the His bundle or His-Purkinje level and, for this reason, should be used judiciously in patients with atrioventricular block and wide QRS complexes that suggest the presence of significant His Purkinje disease; adverse effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, anhidrosis, urinary retention, delirium, and excessive increase in heart rate may be problematic, particularly in patients with acute MI.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — acute management emphasizes identifying and treating reversible causes, with cautions for special situations. In symptomatic patients presenting with SND, evaluation and treatment of reversible causes is recommended, and potentially reversible contributors include acute MI, atrial tachyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, hypothyroidism, medications, infections, and metabolic abnormalities. Most patients present with chronic complaints that do not require acute treatment, and most causes are chronic and irreversible. In acute care, atropine should not be given in patients after heart transplant, and in patients with drug toxicity and severe symptoms, preparation for pacing should proceed simultaneously with pharmacologic treatment of drug toxicity.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^1132PBQY]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In situations in which there is symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbances, the workgroup suggested using atropine at a dose regimen of 0.5 mg every 3–5 minutes for few doses if needed. This suggestion is supported based on considerations that the therapy may temporarily help, is easily accessible, is inexpensive, and is associated with few risks.

Although fluid resuscitation is commonly used, no formal recommendation was made because no fluid repletion studies were found specifically for CCB poisoning. Nonetheless, the workgroup considered fluid administration as a first-line therapy and continued administration as long as the patient demonstrates evidence of fluid responsiveness (e.g. hemodynamic improvement based on hemodynamic parameters and monitoring devices such as echocardiography after receiving 10–20 mL/kg of crystalloid over 10–15 min).

Therapy for Patients Refractory to First-Line Treatments

For the therapy of CCB-poisoned patients refractory to first-line treatments, the workgroup suggests the use of

Incremental doses of high-dose insulin therapy (up to 10 U/kg/hr) if evidence of myocardial dysfunction is present (2D),
Pacemaker in the presence of unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block, without significant alteration in cardiac inotropism (2D),
IV lipid-emulsion therapy (2D).

Recommendation-specific supportive text — atropine and isoproterenol in sinus bradycardia: In patients with sinus bradycardia, atropine at dosages of 0.5 to 2 mg usually enhances automaticity, but in rare cases can be associated with intra-atrial reentry and or sinus pauses. The sinoatrial node response to atropine is bimodal, lower doses (usually < 0.5 mg) are associated with slower rates and acceleration with higher doses.

For isoproterenol, there are numerous case reports and series describing the salutary use in patients presenting with sinus bradycardia; however, there are no clinical trials or observational series data to support or discourage its use in this setting, and because isoproterenol increases myocardial oxygen demand through beta-1 effects while decreasing coronary perfusion attributable to beta-2 effects, it is best avoided in settings where there is concern for coronary ischemia.

Adult bradycardia with a pulse — management follows a branch algorithm starting with "Assess appropriateness for clinical condition. Heart rate typically < 50/min if bradyarrhythmia". If there is "Cardiopulmonary compromise?" defined by hypotension, acutely altered mental status, signs of shock, ischemic chest discomfort, or acute heart failure, proceed to "Assessment and support" to maintain the patient airway and provide oxygen, assist breathing with positive-pressure ventilation as necessary, attach a cardiorespiratory monitor, and monitor pulse. If no compromise, identify and treat underlying causes, support ABCs, consider oxygen, obtain a 12-lead ECG, and observe. If "Bradycardia persists with cardiopulmonary compromise?" give atropine; if atropine is ineffective, use transcutaneous pacing and/or dopamine or epinephrine infusion, and consider expert consultation and transvenous pacing.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage is individualized by use, refer to the full prescribing information for recommended adult and pediatric dosages (2.2, 2.3).

Patients with Ischemic Heart Disease: Do not exceed 0.04 mg/kg. (2.4, 5.2)

2.1 General Administration

Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact. After initial use, discard unused portion within 24 hours.

Intravenous administration is usually preferred, but subcutaneous, intramuscular, endotracheal, and intraosseous administration are possible.

2.2 Adult Dosage

Table 1: Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients

IV = intravenous; IM = intramuscular; SC = subcutaneous; ET = endotracheal

*Do not rely on atropine in type II second-degree or third-degree AV block with wide QRS complexes because these bradyarrhythmias are not likely to be responsive to reversal of cholinergic effects by atropine. Atropine has no effect on bradycardia in patients with transplanted hearts

Isoproterenol, dopamine, and atropine — clinical considerations: Because isoproterenol increases myocardial oxygen demand and decreases coronary perfusion, it is best avoided where coronary ischemia is a concern and has only a second-line role in resuscitation, with two randomized trials in cardiac arrest showing no improvement in return of spontaneous circulation or survival. In unstable bradycardia refractory to fluids and atropine, a trial of 82 patients randomized to transcutaneous pacing or dopamine showed no difference in survival to hospital discharge or serious adverse events. In heart transplant recipients, atropine at standard clinical doses resulted in paradoxical heart block or sinus arrest in 20% of 25 patients, and parasympathetic reinnervation was far less common, 34% versus 11% in 1 series.

### The therapeutic value of atropine for critical care intubation [^116vSok1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Recent studies of atropine during critical care intubation (CCI) have revealed that neonates frequently experience bradycardia, are infrequently affected by ventricular arrhythmias and conduction disturbances and deaths have not been reported in a series of studies. The indiscriminate use of atropine is unlikely to alter the outcome during neonatal CCI other than reducing the frequency of sinus tachycardia. In contrast, older children experience a similar frequency of bradycardia to neonates and are more frequently affected by ventricular arrhythmias and conduction disturbances. Mortality during CCI is in the order of 0.5%. Atropine has a beneficial effect on arrhythmias and conduction disturbances and may reduce paediatric intensive care unit mortality. The use of atropine for children > 1month of age may positively influence outcomes beyond a reduction in the frequency of sinus bradycardia. There is indirect evidence that atropine should be used for intubation during sepsis. Atropine should be considered when using suxamethonium. The reliance on heart rate as the sole measure of haemodynamic function during CCI is no longer justifiable. Randomised trials of atropine for mortality during CCI in general intensive care unit populations are unlikely to happen. As such, future research should be focused on establishing of a gold standard for haemodynamic decompensation for CCI. Cardiac output or blood pressure are the most likely candidates. The 'lost beat score' requires development but has the potential to be developed to provide an estimation of risk of haemodynamic decompensation from ECG data in real time during CCI.

Adult advanced life support — bradycardia acute management notes that atropine has been shown to be effective for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia in observational studies. In OHCA with a nonshockable rhythm, the addition of atropine following epinephrine was a predictor of survival to hospital admission, whereas in IHCA atropine for nonshockable rhythms did not improve survival. When symptomatic bradycardia is refractory to medical management, cardiac pacing is a reasonable alternative; transcutaneous pacing is noninvasive, can be performed quickly at bedside, and is typically used as a bridge to placement of a temporary transvenous pacing catheter, though it is often painful and may necessitate sedation. If atropine is ineffective, alternative agents to increase heart rate and blood pressure or transcutaneous pacing are reasonable alternatives, and dopamine infusion can also increase heart rate. For severe symptomatic bradycardia causing shock, if no IV or IO access is available, immediate transcutaneous pacing while access is being pursued may be undertaken. A 2006 systematic review involving seven studies of transcutaneous pacing in prehospital settings did not find a benefit compared with standard ALS, although a subgroup analysis from a single trial suggested a possible benefit in patients with symptomatic bradycardia.

Pediatric bradycardia — drug therapy and pacing recommendations state that epinephrine is the cornerstone of drug therapy when bradycardia with inadequate perfusion is present despite adequate oxygenation and ventilation, while transcutaneous or transvenous pacing may be needed for some types of bradycardias and/or if there is no response to drug therapy. For infants and children with bradycardia with inadequate perfusion that is unresponsive to oxygenation and ventilation, drug therapy may begin with epinephrine, and epinephrine may be used for infants and children with bradycardia and poor perfusion that is unresponsive to ventilation and oxygenation. For infants and children with bradycardia with inadequate perfusion in the setting of increased vagal tone or atrioventricular (AV) block, or if there is no response to epinephrine, atropine may be considered; it is reasonable to administer atropine for bradycardia caused by increased vagal tone or cholinergic drug toxicity, and there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of atropine for pediatric cardiac arrest. Transcutaneous pacing may be considered for some types of bradycardias, such as in the setting of complete AV block and/or if there is no response to drug therapy.

Isoproterenol, dopamine, and atropine for bradycardia — key evidence and dosing: Because isoproterenol increases myocardial oxygen demand while decreasing coronary perfusion, it is best avoided in settings where there is concern for coronary ischemia, and from a clinical standpoint it is predominantly used in the electrophysiology laboratory (1–20 mcg/ min intravenously); two RCTs of isoproterenol as adjunctive therapy in the setting of cardiac arrest did not show improved return of spontaneous circulation or survival to hospital discharge. In a trial of 82 patients with unstable bradycardia refractory to intravenous fluid bolus and atropine randomized to transcutaneous pacing or dopamine at doses of 5 mcg/ kg/ min, titrated every 2 minutes by 5 mcg/ kg/ min to a maximum of 20 mcg/ kg/ min, there was no difference in survival to hospital discharge or serious adverse events. In a study of 25 patients who had undergone heart transplant, atropine at standard clinical doses resulted in paradoxical heart block or less commonly sinus arrest in 20%, and evidence for parasympathetic reinnervation after orthotopic heart transplant was far less common, 34% versus 11% in 1 series using heart rate variability response to neck suction to test autonomic responses.

Management of bradycardia — recommendation-specific supportive text: Atropine increases heart rate in both children and adults, and as a vagolytic agent, use is limited to bradycardia with cardiopulmonary compromise due to increased vagal tone or atrioventricular conduction block, but not due to other factors such as hypoxia. Retrospective studies have shown that children who received CPR for bradycardia with cardiopulmonary compromise have better outcomes than children who receive CPR for pulseless cardiac arrest, and although no studies compared outcomes between children with bradycardia and cardiopulmonary compromise who did or did not receive CPR, 1 study reported 8 patients who received drug therapy without CPR, and all survived to hospital discharge. A retrospective, time-dependent propensity–score matched study found that patients who received epinephrine had worse outcomes than those who did not receive epinephrine, while a subsequent retrospective study did not show differences for patients who did or did not receive "early" epinephrine within the first 2 minutes of CPR for bradycardia and cardiopulmonary compromise; due to limitations of these studies, further research is required. There are limited data about transcutaneous pacing for refractory bradycardia, and in patients with complete heart block or sinus node dysfunction who have not responded to oxygenation, ventilation, medications, or CPR, emergency transcutaneous pacing may be considered.

Atropine and catecholamines — mechanism and dosing notes for bradycardia: Atropine is described as "a parasympatholytic drug that blocks the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor", and in the sinus node "increases sinus node automaticity at doses of approximately 0.5 to 2 mg with a half-life of approximately 2 hours". Isoproterenol "is a nonselective beta agonist with both chronotropic and inotropic effects" and in SND infusion studies some patients "may require higher dosages, or may have a vasodilatory effect". Dopamine "is a catecholamine" where "at low doses of 1 to 2 mcg/kg/min, the effect is predominantly vasodilatory, while at doses of 5 to 20 mcg/kg/min, enhanced chronotropy and inotropy predominate", with higher doses requiring caution due to "profound vasoconstriction and proarrhythmias". Epinephrine "is a catecholamine with strong alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic stimulatory effects, including increasing chronotropy, inotropy, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen consumption".

Pediatric Advanced Life Support — Atropine use for emergency intubation — It may be reasonable to use atropine as a premedication to prevent bradycardia in infants and children during emergency intubation (COR 2b, LOE C-LD), and when atropine is used as a premedication for emergency intubation of infants and children, a dose of 0.02 mg/kg with no minimum dose may be considered (COR 2b, LOE C-LD). Supporting evidence notes prospective observational studies in patients < 8 years of age showing associations between atropine pretreatment and decreased ICU mortality after propensity score adjustment and significant acceleration in heart rate without provoking arrhythmias with a decrease in bradycardia, whereas 4 retrospective studies did not demonstrate an association between atropine use and occurrence of bradycardia during the peri-intubation period. Historical dosing data indicate a minimum dose of atropine (0.1 mg) was recommended based on a 1971 series of 79 patients, including 5 aged 6 weeks to 3 years, in which doses ranging from 0.0018 to 0.0036 mg/kg produced a small and statistically insignificant decrease in heart rate; additionally, in a 2015 prospective observational study of 60 infants less than 15 kg who all received < 0.1 mg atropine before intubation, no patient experienced paradoxical bradycardia or arrhythmias.

Pharmacologic support for bradycardia/atrioventricular block — Atropine enhances atrioventricular nodal conduction and automaticity and is generally given in 0.5- to 1.0-mg IV increments; advanced cardiac life support recommendations advise early use for hemodynamically significant bradycardia, including atrioventricular block, yet atropine is unlikely to improve block at the His bundle or His-Purkinje level and should be used judiciously in atrioventricular block with wide QRS complexes, with adverse effects including dry mouth, blurred vision, anhidrosis, urinary retention, and delirium, and excessive increase in heart rate may be problematic in acute MI. Beta-adrenergic agonists (isoproterenol, dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine) enhance atrioventricular nodal and His-Purkinje conduction; dopamine was equivalent to transcutaneous pacing in 1 small randomized trial of unstable bradycardia unresponsive to atropine, and isoproterenol elicited an escape rhythm in 68% of pacemaker-dependent patients undergoing generator replacement, but adverse effects may include ventricular arrhythmias and induction of coronary ischemia and isoproterenol may exacerbate hypotension. Aminophylline, a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has limited evidence with several small series of up to 8 patients showing prompt reversal of atrioventricular block without adverse effects, while larger studies are lacking and a large randomized trial and a systematic review showed no benefit for aminophylline in out-of-hospital brady-asystolic cardiac arrest.

### Bradycardia during critical care intubation: mechanisms, significance and atropine [^114bneBj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Bradycardia occurs during the intubation of some critically ill children as a result of vagal stimulation due to hypoxia and/or laryngeal stimulation; such 'stable' bradycardia is accompanied by selective vasoconstriction. Some induction drugs also induce bradycardia which may be accompanied by vasodilatation which is also a feature of certain pathologies, which influence the progression to 'unstable' bradycardia, which does not respond to re-oxygenation and a pause in laryngoscopy. Preintubation atropine diminishes the overall incidence of stable bradycardia during routine anaesthesia. However, clinical studies of critical care intubation show that atropine does not prevent all episodes of bradycardia and specifically cannot affect vasodilatation. As such, there is insufficient evidence to support a recommendation for the indiscriminate use of atropine for intubation during critical care illness, including simple neonatal respiratory distress. Atropine is appropriate during septic or late stage hypovolaemic shock where abnormal vasomotor tone and bradycardia may potentially set up a negative feedback loop of cardiac hypo-oxygenation and hypoperfusion and during premedication when using suxamethonium.

Cardiovascular bradycardia — EMS key considerations include observing for decreased end-organ perfusion signs such as chest pain, shortness of breath, decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or other signs of shock/hypotension. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplant will not respond to atropine. Consider potential culprit medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers/anti-depressants, digoxin, and clonidine, and consider hyperkalemia in the patient with wide complex bradycardia. The differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction, hypoxia, pacemaker failure, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, athletes, head injury with increased intracranial pressure, stroke, spinal cord lesion, sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks, overdose, and cholinergic nerve agents. Bradycardia should be managed via the least invasive manner possible, escalating care as needed. Third-degree heart block or the denervated heart (as in cardiac transplant) may not respond to atropine and in these cases, proceed quickly to chronotropic agents (such as epinephrine or dopamine) or transcutaneous pacing. Dopamine is not indicated for pediatric patients. Be aware of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of bradycardia in adult patients. When dosing medications for pediatric patients, dose should be weight-based for non-obese patients and based on ideal body weight for obese patients. Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, recent research suggests that patients in cardiogenic or septic shock treated with norepinephrine have a lower mortality rate compared to those treated with dopamine. Caution: Norepinephrine can theoretically cause reflex bradycardia.

Bradyarrhythmia and asystole management during cardiac arrest — After recognizing bradyarrhythmic or asystolic arrest, focus first on cardiorespiratory control (continue CPR, intubate, intravenous access), reconfirm rhythm in 2 leads if possible, and address reversible causes; pacing is usually ineffective, but reversal of hypoxemia, acidosis, or electrolyte imbalances may help; epinephrine 1.0 mg intravenously every 3 to 5 min is commonly used; for asystole and pulseless electrical activity, atropine 1.0 mg intravenously/intraosseously every 3 to 5 min up to a total of 3 doses or 0.03 to 0.04 mg/kg is recommended; for bradycardia, atropine 0.5 mg intravenously/intraosseously every 3 to 5 min up to a total dose of 0.04 mg/kg is recommended; sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg may be tried for known or suspected preexisting hyperkalemia or bicarbonate-responsive acidosis.

Pediatric bradycardia with a pulse algorithm — Patients with bradycardia are evaluated for "Cardiopulmonary compromise?" (acutely altered mental status, signs of shock, hypotension). If compromise is present, provide assessment and support to maintain a patent airway, assist breathing with positive pressure ventilation and oxygen as necessary, and use a cardiac monitor to identify rhythm while monitoring pulse, BP, and oximetry; if not present, support ABCs, consider oxygen, observe, obtain a 12-Lead ECG, and identify and treat underlying causes. Start CPR if HR < 60/min despite oxygenation and ventilation. If bradycardia persists, continue CPR if HR < 60 beats per min, obtain IV/IO access, give epinephrine, give atropine for increased vagal tone or primary AV block, consider transthoracic/transvenous pacing, and identify and treat underlying causes. Check pulse every 2 minutes; if "Pulse present?" is answered no, go to Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Algorithm. Possible causes listed are hypothermia, hypoxia, and medications.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 bradycardia guideline — acute medical management dosing for bradycardia attributable to SND or atrioventricular block includes the following regimens: For symptomatic sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular block, atropine 0.5–1 mg IV (may be repeated every 3–5 min to a maximum dose of 3 mg). Dopamine 5 to 20 mcg/kg/min IV, starting at 5 mcg/kg/min and increasing by 5 mcg/kg/min every 2 min, and dosages of > 20 mcg/kg/min may result in vasoconstriction or arrhythmias. Isoproterenol 20–60 mcg IV bolus followed doses of 10–20 mcg, or infusion of 1–20 mcg/min based on heart rate response. Epinephrine 2–10 mcg/min IV or 0.01–0.5 mcg/kg/min IV titrated to desired effect; dosage for advanced cardiac life support is 2 to 10 mcg/min with titration to hemodynamic response. For calcium channel blocker overdose, 10% calcium chloride 1–2 g IV every 10–20 min or an infusion of 0.2–0.4 mL/kg/h is listed. High dose insulin therapy consists of an IV bolus of 1 unit/kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 units/kg/h with instruction to follow glucose and potassium levels. For digoxin overdose, digoxin antibody fragment dosage is dependent on amount ingested or known digoxin concentration, and one vial binds approximately 0.5 mg of digoxin.

### Administration of atropine in the setting of acute myocardial infarction: potentiation of the ischemic process? [^111qiXiA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Atropine has also been suggested to potentially worsen the ischemic situation in patients who are in the midst of acute coronary ischemia. We report the case of a female patient with ischemic chest pain and third degree atrioventricular block who developed acute myocardial infarction (AMI) immediately after atropine administration. The use of atropine in this instance remains a reasonable option and should be strongly considered-despite this apparent complication. Undoubtedly in some cases, acute ischemia is intensified by hypoperfusion attributable to vagally mediated bradyarrhythmia; atropine is the antidote for such situations. An awareness of this potential adverse reaction coupled with a prudent selection of candidates for atropine therapy will show the risk/benefit ratio in each individual patient and, therefore, guide the clinician.

### Is oxygen required before atropine administration in organophosphorus or carbamate pesticide poisoning? – A cohort study [^1169y6vJ]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Rapid administration of atropine can be life-saving. The evidence reported here indicates that its administration should not be held back by the lack of oxygen therapy, since atropine will reduce fluid in the lungs and improve oxygenisationas well as treat hypotension and bradycardia. We recommend that oxygen is provided as soon as possible to all moderate-to-severely poisoned patients but that its absence does not slow or prevent the provision of atropine. This guidance was already given by Fernando in 1989and was implicit in the key review published by Namba in 1971. It has become more commonplace over the last few years.

The recommendation for provision of oxygen before atropine has been in the cardiology literature since the 1970s. There is evidence to show that atropine can have adverse effect in patients following cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction. However, we have been unable to find any discussion comparing the focal ischaemia found in myocardial infarction with the global ischaemia found in pesticide poisoning. The relevance of these data to young previously fit patients with normal hearts and anticholinesterase poisoning seems less certain.

Contrary to the very limited human data, five animal studies have been published. However, only two looked at pesticide poisoning, and these were with unformulated TEPP and parathion active ingredients (rather than the formulated agricultural pesticides that people ingest). Three studied dysrhythmias after atropine treatment in OP nerve agent poisoning. Ventricular dysrhythmias only occurred in dogs and not in other species. In response Hayes stated: 'the fact that no reports of cases of sudden death following administration of atropine have been found indicates that there may be a marked species difference so that the danger of giving atropine in the presence of cyanosis in human cases is small or simply that few, if any, patients have the degree of cyanosis involved in the animal studies'.

### Atropine versus placebo for neonatal nonemergent intubation: a randomized clinical trial [^116sBUGC]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the rates of severe bradycardia (< 80/min for > 10 seconds) between neonates who received atropine-fentanyl-succinylcholine (atropine/standard of care group) vs placebo-fentanyl-succinylcholine (placebo/intervention group) before orotracheal intubation.

Study Design

A multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of neonates receiving non-emergent intubation. Randomization was by computer generated tables with random block size, stratified by PMA at randomization (< 34 weeks and ≥ 34 weeks). Primary outcome was severe bradycardia during the whole procedure (from administration of the study medication until completion of last successful intubation). Secondary outcomes included any bradycardia (< 100/min for > 10 seconds), number and duration of intubation attempts and hypoxemia (< 80% for > 10 seconds). Safety outcomes included profound bradycardia (< 60/min for > 10 seconds) and receipt of chest compression or epinephrine. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.

Results

Seventy-three intubation events (60 infants) were randomized to administration of atropine (n = 24) or placebo (n = 49). Multiple attempts occurred in 33% of the events. No safety events occurred in either group. Severe bradycardia during the whole procedure was significantly higher in the placebo compared with the atropine group; RR 6.3 (95% CI 1.2–34.1). The placebo group had significantly higher rates and duration of overall bradycardia, but lower rates and duration of hypoxemia compared with the atropine group, probably related to the lower proportion of multiple attempts (27% vs 46%, p 0.09) and longer time to successful intubation (394 vs 283 seconds, p 0.08).

Conclusions

Among neonates receiving premedication for non-emergent intubation, atropine significantly reduced the rates and duration of severe and overall bradycardia compared with placebo.

### Neostigmine [^115S9Ddb]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

- **Bradycardia**: Atropine or glycopyrrolate should be administered prior to neostigmine methylsulfate injection to lessen risk of bradycardia. (5.1)

- **Serious Reactions with Coexisting Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute coronary syndrome or myasthenia gravis. (5.2)

- **Neuromuscular Dysfunction**: Can occur if large doses of neostigmine methylsulfate injection are administered when neuromuscular blockade is minimal; reduce dose if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is nearly complete. (5.4)

5.1. Bradycardia

Neostigmine has been associated with bradycardia. Atropine sulfate or glycopyrrolate should be administered prior to neostigmine methylsulfate injection to lessen the risk of bradycardia [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2. Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Certain Coexisting Conditions

Neostigmine methylsulfate injection should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute coronary syndrome or myasthenia gravis. Because of the known pharmacology of neostigmine methylsulfate as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia, hypotension or dysrhythmia would be anticipated. In patients with certain cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias or recent acute coronary syndrome, the risk of blood pressure and heart rate complications may be increased. Risk of these complications may also be increased in patients with myasthenia gravis. Standard antagonism with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) is generally successful to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular complications.

5.3. Hypersensitivity

Because of the possibility of hypersensitivity, atropine and medications to treat anaphylaxis should be readily available.

5.4. Neuromuscular Dysfunction

Large doses of neostigmine methylsulfate injection administered when neuromuscular blockade is minimal can produce neuromuscular dysfunction. The dose of neostigmine methylsulfate injection should be reduced if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is nearly complete.

5.5. Cholinergic Crisis

It is important to differentiate between myasthenic crisis and cholinergic crisis caused by overdosage of neostigmine methylsulfate injection. Both conditions result in extreme muscle weakness but require radically different treatment [see Overdosage (10)]

### Resuscitation after birth and beyond in the neonatal intensive care unit: NRP or PALS? [^116PbJtj]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Identification of pulse – Salient points of divergence

NRP does not distinguish the resuscitation of infants with severe bradycardia (HR < 60 bpm), asystole, and pulseless electrical activity (PEA). NRP has a common approach toward different etiologies of cardiac arrest. PALS recommendations for severe bradycardia with a pulse are distinct from asystole/PEA. The choice of these approaches depends on identifying the brachial pulse in the infants. The identification of pulses in severe bradycardia determines whether the initial resuscitative efforts are being targeted toward optimizing oxygenation and ventilation versus analyzing the rhythm with an automated external defibrillator (AED) and starting high-quality CPR. NRP recommends epinephrine, preferably intravascular if the HR is < 60 bpm despite 1 min of coordinated effective PPV + CC. In a similar situation, pediatric guidelines recommend epinephrine and atropine.

### Deliberate fingolimod overdose presenting with delayed hypotension and bradycardia responsive to atropine [^116r5i2g]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fingolimod is an immunomodulating agent used in multiple sclerosis (MS). It is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist prescribed for relapsing forms of MS to delay onset of physical disability. As fingolimod is known to cause first-dose bradycardia, telemetry is recommended for the first 6 h post-dose. We present the first reported case of deliberate fingolimod overdose requiring atropine administration for bradycardia and hemodynamic instability.

Case Report

A 33-year-old woman ingested 14 mg of fingolimod and 2 g of phenoxymethylpenicillin. After presenting to the emergency department 19 h later, she was initially hemodynamically stable (heart rate (HR) 60, blood pressure (BP) 113/89 mmHg). Two hours later, she then developed bradycardia (HR 48) and hypotension (87/57 mmHg). Despite intravenous fluids, stabilisation was only achieved after administration of atropine (300 μg). She was then admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further monitoring where another episode of bradycardia and hypotension required atropine. She was monitored in the ICU for 48 h and then discharged on day 5 with no further episodes.

Discussion

Fingolimod is known to cause bradycardia in the first 6 h post first therapeutic dose. Following intentional overdose, onset of bradycardia occurred at 21 h post-ingestion and was associated with hypotension. Atropine was successful in treating bradycardia and associated hypotension.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^113D7UxS]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a management approach for adults with calcium channel blocker poisoning.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

Following the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II instrument, initial voting statements were constructed based on summaries outlining the evidence, risks, and benefits.

Data Synthesis

We recommend 1) for asymptomatic patients, observation and consideration of decontamination following a potentially toxic calcium channel blocker ingestion (1D); 2) as first-line therapies (prioritized based on desired effect), IV calcium (1D), high-dose insulin therapy (1D-2D), and norepinephrine and/or epinephrine (1D). We also suggest dobutamine or epinephrine in the presence of cardiogenic shock (2D) and atropine in the presence of symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbance (2D); 3) in patients refractory to the first-line treatments, we suggest incremental doses of high-dose insulin therapy if myocardial dysfunction is present (2D), IV lipid-emulsion therapy (2D), and using a pacemaker in the presence of unstable bradycardia or high-grade arteriovenous block without significant alteration in cardiac inotropism (2D); 4) in patients with refractory shock or who are periarrest, we recommend incremental doses of high-dose insulin (1D) and IV lipid-emulsion therapy (1D) if not already tried. We suggest venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, if available, when refractory shock has a significant cardiogenic component (2D), and using pacemaker in the presence of unstable bradycardia or high-grade arteriovenous block in the absence of myocardial dysfunction (2D) if not already tried; 5) in patients with cardiac arrest, we recommend IV calcium in addition to the standard advanced cardiac life-support (1D), lipid-emulsion therapy (1D), and we suggest venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation if available (2D).

Conclusion

We offer recommendations for the stepwise management of calcium channel blocker toxicity. For all interventions, the level of evidence was very low.

### Incidence of bradycardia and the use of atropine in pediatric rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department [^1158wyME]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Bradycardia during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is an uncommon but serious adverse effect encountered in pediatric intubations. Atropine has historically been used in the pediatric population as RSI premedication to prevent bradycardia, especially when using succinylcholine as an induction agent. The objective of this analysis was to identify the incidence of bradycardia with or without atropine use.

Methods

This single-center, retrospective, observational case series reviewed pediatric patients up to 18 years old requiring intubation from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018. Bradycardia was determined by analyzing heart rates associated with time during and up to 5 minutes after intubation.

Results

A total of 62 patients were included. Three (4.8%) patients experienced a bradycardic event during intubation. A total of 15 (24.2%) patients received atropine for pretreatment of RSI. Incidence of bradycardia was similar between those who received atropine and those who did not. An increasing trend in atropine use was shown throughout the assessment period, yet only 18 (29%) patients met criteria for atropine pretreatment based on the 2015 Pediatric Advanced Life Support guideline recommendations for RSI.

Conclusion

Bradycardia incidence was low in pediatric patients undergoing RSI in our emergency department. Use of atropine or succinylcholine did not affect the incidence of bradycardia during pediatric intubation over this study period. Our results show a low incidence of bradycardia and support the 2015 Pediatric Advanced Life Support Guideline recommendation of limiting the use of atropine premedication in pediatric intubations.

### Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI) international consensus statement on perioperative arterial pressure management [^113wvmcJ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypotension can result from several underlying physiological processes acting alone or in combination. Vasodilation, hypovolaemia, bradycardia, and low cardiac output are all modifiable causes of hypotension. Vasodilation can be reversed by vasopressors such as phenylephrine or norepinephrine. Hypovolaemia can be treated with intravascular fluid administration using a variety of different types of fluids including crystalloid and colloid solutions or blood. Bradycardia is typically pharmacologically managed with anticholinergic agents such as atropine or glycopyrronium; when not responsive to these agents, epinephrine or isoprenaline might be necessary. A pacemaker can be used to manage profound bradycardia. Finally, low cardiac output due to acute or chronic myocardial dysfunction can be treated with positive inotropic agents such as dobutamine or epinephrine.

Consensus statement 2: In general surgery, there is no association between intraoperative systolic arterial pressures between 120 and 200 mm Hg and acute kidney injury and myocardial injury (low-quality evidence).

Consensus recommendation 4: If intraoperative hypertension is treated, we recommend caution to avoid hypotension (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

A single-centre observational analysis reported no relationship between intraoperative systolic arterial pressures of 120–200 mm Hg and myocardial injury. In contrast, many analyses report associations between hypotension and myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, and death, although trial evidence remains equivocal.

Some degree of hypertension should prompt treatment. However, given that reasonable levels of hypertension appear relatively benign, available data suggest that hypertension should be treated incrementally, if at all, with the goal of avoiding hypotension, which undoubtedly causes organ injury at some level.

Consensus statement 3: Continuous intraoperative arterial pressure monitoring helps clinicians reduce the severity and duration of hypotension compared to intermittent arterial pressure monitoring (high-quality evidence).

### Is oxygen required before atropine administration in organophosphorus or carbamate pesticide poisoning? – A cohort study [^114vRz5L]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Adequate atropinisation is key for the management of OP and carbamate poisoning and should be done early, with appropriate titration and monitoring of developing adverse events. Currently, we can find no evidence to support the claim that oxygen must be given before atropine. It is likely that in hospitals where oxygen is not available, early administration of atropine during resuscitation is life-saving. Guidelines for management of OP and carbamate poisoning should recommend early atropinisation of patients, whether oxygen is available or not.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Acute medical therapy synopsis for SND-related bradycardia — Atropine facilitates sinoatrial conduction and increases sinus node automaticity at doses of approximately 0.5 to 2 mg with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. Isoproterenol is a nonselective beta agonist with both chronotropic and inotropic effects on cardiac myocytes, enhancing sinus and atrioventricular nodal function without exerting a vasopressor effect, and in patients with SND undergoing isoproterenol infusion in the electrophysiology laboratory setting, heart rate increases similar to normal controls are described, although some patients do not demonstrate a robust heart rate response, may require higher dosages, or may have a vasodilatory effect. Dopamine is a catecholamine with mixed alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and dopaminergic effects; at low doses of 1 to 2 mcg/kg/min the effect is predominantly vasodilatory, while at doses of 5 to 20 mcg/kg/min enhanced chronotropy and inotropy predominate, and higher doses may be required for a chronotropic response but must be used judiciously because of the association with profound vasoconstriction and proarrhythmias.

### Pediatric rapid sequence intubation: incidence of reflex bradycardia and effects of pretreatment with atropine [^112L7gag]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) recommends atropine as adjunctive therapy to prevent reflex bradycardia prior to laryngoscopy/tracheal intubation (L/TI) in pediatric patients.

Objective

To describe the incidence of reflex bradycardia and its relationship to the administration of atropine during L/TI in a Pediatric Emergency Department.

Design/Methods

A retrospective cohort study was designed through review of records of all patients who received L/TI in the ED at an urban children's hospital from January 1997 to March 2001. Patients meeting inclusion criteria were placed into cohorts defined by whether they had received atropine prior to L/TI or not.

Results

One hundred sixty-three patients received L/TI during the study period. One hundred forty-three patients met inclusion criteria. Sixty-eight patients received atropine (atropine group) prior to L/TI. Seventy-two percent of atropine group patients met ACEP criteria for atropine pretreatment. Seventy-five patients did not receive atropine pretreatment (no-atropine group). Forty-three percent of no-atropine group patients met ACEP criteria for pretreatment with atropine. The atropine group was younger [mean 22.5 vs. 36.4 months, P = 0.003, 95% CI (-28.5, 0.70)], averaged the same number of intubation attempts [1.6 vs. 1.5, P = 0.941, 95% CI 0.1 (-0.3,0.4)], and had normal or elevated HR for age prior to L/TI (mean 159 bpm). Hypoxia occurred more often in the atropine group [28% vs. 16%, P = 0.046, 95% CI for difference (0.3, 27.1)]. Bradycardia was noted in 6 patients during L/TI; 3 in the atropine group and 3 in the no-atropine group.

Conclusion

Atropine is not routinely administered prior to L/TI in this pediatric ED. Pretreatment with atropine did not prevent bradycardia in all cases. These data suggest that use of atropine prior to L/TI may not be required for all pediatric patients. Some patients will experience bradycardia regardless of atropine pretreatment.

### Response to dr. masaya miyauchi and dr. teruhiko imamura, clinical implication of COVID-19 associated bradycardia [^115dc33a]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Thank you Dr. Imamura and Colleagues. We appreciate your input and thoughts on further studying bradycardia and COVID‐19. Our large‐scale multicenter retrospective study included over 1000 patients with COVID‐19, and found that absolute bradycardia was noted in 24.9% of the study cohort and these individuals were found to have a significant increase in mortality.

We agree with you that differentiating the type of bradycardia in a patient is important to determine the etiology, and ultimately, the appropriate treatment. However, the data included in our study was obtained from March, 2020 to August, 2020 during the early phase of the pandemic when staff exposure to COVID patients was limited. As a result, echocardiogram and 12‐lead EKG's were typically completed only once during admission, if indicated. As this was a retrospective study, we had to examine whatever data and tests had been collected. We believe that in the future a prospective study evaluating the etiology of bradycardia with these tests is important to obtain thorough diagnosis and treatment.

Given the high prevalence of absolute bradycardia in our study population, clinicians should carefully consider next steps in treating absolute bradycardia in the inpatient setting. The European Society of Cardiology suggested an initial trial of isoprenaline and atropine, and if bradycardia is sustained, temporary pacing should be considered. However, a recent Italian paper proposed an early permanent pacemaker implantation to avoid the increased risk of infection that exists when a temporary pacemaker is placed. Brignole et al reported that a temporary pacemaker before a permanent pacemaker implantation is 2.5 times more likely to develop a risk of infection versus the latter. Chintz et al had seven patients with COVID‐19 that developed bradyarrhythmias in which they placed three temporary and four leadless pacemakers. Despite placing the pacemakers, they noted a short term morbidity and subsequent death due to COVID‐19 complications in five out of seven patients. Based on the current literature available and the novel analysis in our study, it is important that that the international community research the next steps to address bradycardia and COVID‐19.

A future study, specifically a retrospective cohort separating pre‐existing heart failure from those without pre‐existing heart failure may help to differentiate respiratory failure versus heart failure as the cause of mortality. As for myocarditis in COVID‐19; The CDC has recently reported that myocarditis post mRNA COVID‐19 vaccination is a well‐known complication.

We look forward to any further input and suggestions that Dr. Imamura and Colleagues may have.

### The use of atropine in a nerve agent response with specific reference to children: are current guidelines too cautious? [^112cFnxV]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

This review examines the potential use of nerve agents by a terrorist organisation against a civilian population, which has become an increasingly apparent threat in the UK. Present guidelines for the use of atropine, particularly in children, following such an event are unclear. No precise agreement exists on the most appropriate dose of atropine, or the frequency with which it should be administered. This uncertainty leaves children vulnerable as potentially life-saving treatment may be crucially delayed. Guidelines must be standardised to allow rapid antidotal delivery and maximise the potential for survivors. This review examines the issues currently surrounding the use of atropine in children following a nerve agent attack and propose strategies for treating exposed children.

### Atropine sulfate for treatment of bradycardia in a patient with morbid obesity: what may happen when you least expect it [^112yyhmk]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 74-year-old morbidly obese man was scheduled for surgical repair of an incisional ventral hernia. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl, and maintained with desflurane. A second dose of fentanyl 0.2mg, given before starting surgery, resulted in sinus bradycardia and mild decrease of arterial blood pressure. Atropine sulfate 0.5mg was administered. One minute later, the ECG rhythm on the monitor changed to third degree atrioventricular block with a ventricular response rate of 40 beats/min associated with marked hypotension. Isoproterenol 0.02mg reverted the atrioventricular block to sinus rhythm. Cardiac enzymes and ECG ruled out acute myocardial ischaemia. The surgical procedure and the recovery from anaesthesia were uneventful. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day. For the treatment of bradycardia atropine sulfate should be adjusted at least to lean body weight in order to avoid paradoxical heart rate response in patients with obesity.

### Clonidine hci [^114wi9cD]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Cardiac Effects: Epidural clonidine frequently causes decreases in heart rate. Symptomatic bradycardia can be treated with atropine. Rarely, atrioventricular block greater than first degree has been reported. Clonidine does not alter the hemodynamic response to exercise, but may mask the increase in heart rate associated with hypovolemia.

Respiratory Depression and Sedation: Clonidine administration may result in sedation through the activation of alpha-adrenoceptors in the brainstem. High doses of clonidine cause sedation and ventilatory abnormalities that are usually mild. Tolerance to these effects can develop with chronic administration. These effects have been reported with bolus doses that are significantly larger than the infusion rate recommended for treating cancer pain.

Depression: Depression has been seen in a small percentage of patients treated with oral or transdermal clonidine. Depression commonly occurs in cancer patients and may be exacerbated by treatment with clonidine. Patients, especially those with a known history of affective disorders, should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of depression.

Pain of Visceral or Somatic Origin: In the clinical investigations, at doses tested, clonidine hydrochloride injection was most effective in well-localized, "neuropathic" pain that was characterized as electrical, burning, or shooting in nature, and which was localized to a dermatomal or peripheral nerve distribution. Clonidine hydrochloride injection may be less effective, or possibly ineffective in the treatment of pain that is diffuse, poorly localized, or visceral in origin.

### Part 1: executive summary: 2010 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^115dPi1p]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

The goal of therapy for bradycardia or tachycardia is to rapidly identify and treat patients who are hemodynamically unstable or symptomatic due to the arrhythmia. Drugs or, when appropriate, pacing may be used to control unstable or symptomatic bradycardia. Cardioversion or drugs or both may be used to control unstable or symptomatic tachycardia. ACLS providers should closely monitor stable patients pending expert consultation and should be prepared to aggressively treat those with evidence of decompensation.
