## Question

How is histoplasmosis diagnosed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose histoplasmosis across severities and immune states. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify which diagnostic modality is first-line in severe or disseminated disease versus mild pulmonary disease. Next, I will examine antigen testing performance, specimen selection, and limitations. After that, I should review serology performance and when it helps. Then, I will consider histopathology and culture as gold standards and their trade-offs. I will also assess molecular testing and special populations like pediatrics and pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and monitoring plan, ensuring I double-check cross-reactivity and access issues before concluding [^113rvAbo] [^11292J3s].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability because diagnostic yield and test selection hinge on severity, immune status, and epidemiology. In endemic regions or after high-risk exposures, pretest probability is higher, and in immunocompromised hosts, disseminated disease is more likely, which shifts testing toward antigen detection rather than serology; conversely, in immunocompetent patients with mild pulmonary disease, serology may perform well, so I need to ensure I tailor the panel accordingly [^114Jde3Y] [^11292J3s] [^115zTx8A].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the first-line test in suspected disseminated or severe acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. The ATS strongly recommends Histoplasma antigen in urine or serum as the initial diagnostic test when timely diagnosis is critical, given its high sensitivity and rapid turnaround, with urine often having slightly higher sensitivity than serum in pooled analyses, so I should order both urine and serum antigen when suspicion is high and time matters [^114Jde3Y] [^1165b3tP] [^112Z7Dee].

> Wait, let me verify the performance characteristics before I overstate this. Meta-analytic data show overall antigen sensitivity around 81% and specificity near 98–99%, with higher sensitivity in disseminated disease and lower in acute pulmonary outbreaks; importantly, combining urine and serum antigen testing can raise sensitivity to about 93% in acute pulmonary disease, and adding antibody testing can push sensitivity to roughly 96%, so I should consider combined testing when a single assay is negative but suspicion remains high [^112Z7Dee] [^114YHAqh] [^115jRqau].

> I need to check specimen selection and ancillary matrices next. Urine antigen is noninvasive and often most sensitive, serum antigen is comparable and useful when urine is unobtainable, and antigen can also be detected in BAL and CSF for pulmonary and CNS disease respectively; in suspected meningitis, CSF antigen and antibody testing markedly outperform culture, so I should include CSF antigen and antibody when CNS involvement is suspected [^11292J3s] [^1165b3tP] [^1123FBBg].

> But wait, what about limitations and cross-reactivity; I should double-check those. Antigen assays cross-react with other endemic mycoses, especially blastomycosis and paracoccidioidomycosis, and false positives can occur, so a positive antigen in the right clinical context is compelling, but unexpected positives should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses; also, antigen levels correlate with disease burden and can be used to monitor response, with higher levels predicting more severe disease and falling levels indicating treatment effect [^113rvAbo] [^117H7keS].

> Next, I should review serology because in immunocompetent patients with pulmonary disease, antibodies can be informative. Complement fixation and immunodiffusion are traditional, with CF more sensitive but less specific, and newer EIAs report about 87% sensitivity for IgG and 67% for IgM; however, serology is less reliable in immunocompromised hosts and early after exposure, so I need to ensure I do not rely on serology alone in those settings [^115zTx8A] [^116JsJ56] [^114Jde3Y].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of histopathology and culture because they remain the definitive standards despite slow turnaround. Demonstration of small budding yeasts in tissue with GMS or calcofluor white provides rapid, specific evidence, but sensitivity is limited in disseminated disease and lower in pulmonary disease; culture is highly specific and can be obtained from blood, bone marrow, BAL, or tissue, yet it may take 1–4 weeks and requires appropriate media and safety precautions, so I should send cultures when feasible but not delay therapy in severe disease awaiting culture [^114GfsWj] [^1156YcxB] [^116uYQTZ].

> I will now examine molecular testing, since I initially thought PCR was not ready for clinical use; wait, I should verify newer data. Traditional PCR had limited sensitivity, but a validated RT-qPCR assay demonstrated approximately 98% sensitivity across specimen types and 92% in blood for disseminated disease, suggesting a promising role where available; LAMP assays are being explored for low-resource settings, though clinical validation remains limited, so I should consider molecular testing when accessible while recognizing platform variability [^1146K2ft] [^112WpVGE] [^1156YcxB].

> Let me consider special populations and syndromes to ensure I do not miss nuances. In children, antigen testing has lower sensitivity than in adults, so combining antigen and serology is important; in pregnancy, diagnosis is the same, but treatment choices differ, so I should coordinate with maternal-fetal medicine; in advanced HIV, antigen testing is highly sensitive and WHO-endorsed, and I should maintain a high index of suspicion given frequent TB mimicry and high mortality when diagnosis is delayed [^115eAMU2] [^113EP3bZ] [^1142ZCWD].

> I should double-check the practical diagnostic algorithm before concluding. For immunocompromised hosts or severe disease, start with urine and serum antigen, add CSF antigen and antibody if CNS disease is suspected, obtain BAL antigen if bronchoscopy is performed, and send blood and bone marrow cultures; if antigen is negative but suspicion remains high, add serology and consider tissue biopsy with histopathology and culture. For immunocompetent patients with mild pulmonary disease, begin with serology and add antigen testing to improve yield; if serology and antigen are discordant, consider bronchoscopy with BAL antigen and histopathology, and send cultures when feasible [^114Jde3Y] [^11292J3s] [^114GfsWj].

> Next, I should review how to use antigen for monitoring because that influences follow-up. Antigen levels decline with effective therapy and rise with relapse, so serial antigen testing during treatment and for 12 months after completion is reasonable in disseminated disease or high-risk hosts; however, I need to ensure I do not prolong therapy solely for low-level persistent antigenuria in the absence of clinical activity, as guidelines advise against overtreatment in that scenario [^116bWzbp] [^113FDPNL] [^117H7keS].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address access and implementation issues, since delays in testing can be lethal in disseminated disease. Limited availability of antigen assays outside reference laboratories and cross-reactivity concerns hinder rapid diagnosis in some regions; training programs and diagnostic hubs have shown increased case detection, and emerging lateral flow antigen assays may expand access, so I should advocate for local capacity where histoplasmosis is endemic and consider sending specimens to reference labs when needed [^113rvAbo] [^11187sLq] [^1162ZVhH].

Histoplasmosis diagnosis relies on a **multimodal approach** [^114Jde3Y] that includes antigen detection, serology, culture, and histopathology, with test selection tailored to clinical context and immune status [^1156YcxB]. Antigen testing in urine or serum is the **most sensitive rapid test** [^114Jde3Y], especially in disseminated or acute pulmonary disease [^11292J3s], and is recommended as first-line in immunocompromised patients [^1142ZCWD]. Serology is useful in immunocompetent patients with pulmonary disease [^115zTx8A], but may be falsely negative early or in immunosuppressed hosts [^116w7sTN]. Culture is the **diagnostic gold standard** [^114J1pT5] but is slow and less sensitive [^111ugLV4]; histopathology provides rapid tissue diagnosis when available [^111ugLV4]. PCR is promising [^1146K2ft] but not yet widely available or standardized [^1156YcxB]. Combining antigen and antibody testing improves diagnostic yield [^115jRqau], and antigen levels can be used to monitor treatment response [^113rvAbo].

---

## Clinical presentation and risk factors

Histoplasmosis spans asymptomatic infection to severe disseminated disease; presentation depends on exposure, inoculum, and host immunity [^113uwkAq]. Immunocompromised patients — particularly those with HIV/AIDS — are at **high risk for severe disease** [^116YQePp]. Exposure to bird or bat droppings, especially in endemic regions such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, is a key risk factor [^1132bvk6].

## Diagnostic methods

### Antigen detection and serological testing

Key characteristics of antigen detection and serological testing:

| **Aspect** | **Antigen detection** | **Serological testing** |
|-|-|-|
| Principle | Detects Histoplasma polysaccharide antigen in urine, serum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [^11292J3s] | Detects IgG and IgM antibodies to Histoplasma antigens [^115zTx8A] |
| Sensitivity and specificity | High sensitivity (81–95%) [^114YHAqh] [^1121cF4K] and specificity (98–99%) [^112Z7Dee], especially in disseminated and acute pulmonary disease [^1173zfRX] | Sensitivity 80–95% in immunocompetent patients with pulmonary disease [^115zTx8A]; lower in immunocompromised patients (18–45%) [^116JsJ56] |
| Clinical utility | Rapid, noninvasive, and recommended as first-line in immunocompromised patients [^1156YcxB] [^1165b3tP] and severe disease [^114J1pT5] | Useful in immunocompetent patients with pulmonary disease [^114Jde3Y]; combining antigen and antibody testing improves diagnostic yield [^115jRqau] |
| Limitations | False positives from cross-reactivity with other endemic mycoses (e.g. blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis) [^113rvAbo]; sensitivity lower in chronic or localized disease [^1165b3tP] | Antibodies may take 2–6 weeks to develop [^116w7sTN]; false negatives early or in immunosuppressed hosts [^116w7sTN] |

---

### Culture

Culture is the **diagnostic gold standard** [^114J1pT5], isolating Histoplasma from blood, bone marrow, BAL, or tissue [^1165b3tP]. Sensitivity is high in disseminated disease, especially in immunocompromised patients, but lower in localized or chronic disease [^115fSc55]. Turnaround is slow (1–6 weeks), limiting utility for rapid diagnosis [^notfound].

---

### Histopathology

Histopathology provides rapid tissue diagnosis by identifying characteristic yeast forms (2–4 µm) on GMS or Wright-Giemsa stains [^114GfsWj]. Sensitivity is limited and depends on specimen quality and fungal burden; it is higher in disseminated disease and lower in localized pulmonary disease [^111ugLV4].

---

### Molecular methods (PCR)

PCR detects **Histoplasma DNA** in clinical specimens [^1146K2ft]. Sensitivity and specificity vary by assay and specimen; some RT-qPCR assays show **high sensitivity (97.7%) and specificity (99%)** [^1146K2ft]. Availability is limited and assays are **not yet standardized** for widespread clinical use [^1156YcxB].

---

## Diagnostic approach by clinical scenario

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|
| Immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV/AIDS) | - Antigen testing (urine/serum) [^1165b3tP] <br/> - Culture [^1165b3tP] <br/> - Histopathology if available [^114GfsWj] |
| Immunocompetent patients with pulmonary disease | - Serology [^114Jde3Y] <br/> - Antigen testing if serology negative [^notfound] <br/> - Culture/histopathology if suspicion remains high [^1156YcxB] |
| Chronic or localized disease | - Serology [^1165b3tP] <br/> - Culture [^114J1pT5] <br/> - Histopathology [^114GfsWj] |
| CNS involvement | - CSF antigen and antibody testing [^1123FBBg] <br/> - Culture [^1165b3tP] <br/> - PCR if available [^1146K2ft] |

---

## Monitoring treatment response

Antigen levels decline with effective therapy and rise with relapse, making antigen testing useful for **monitoring response** [^113rvAbo]. Serial antigen testing is recommended during treatment and for 12 months after completion to detect relapse [^116bWzbp].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Cross-reactivity**: Antigen tests may cross-react with other endemic mycoses, causing false positives [^113rvAbo].

- **Limited availability**: Antigen and PCR tests may not be available in resource-limited settings, delaying diagnosis [^116PgTQB].

- **Delayed seroconversion**: Antibodies may take weeks to develop, causing false negatives early in infection [^116w7sTN].

---

Histoplasmosis diagnosis requires a **multimodal approach** [^114Jde3Y], with antigen testing as the most sensitive rapid method, especially in immunocompromised patients [^116w7sTN]. Serology, culture, and histopathology remain important, and PCR is promising but not yet widely available [^116w7sTN]. Combining antigen and antibody testing improves diagnostic yield [^115jRqau], and antigen levels can guide treatment monitoring [^113rvAbo].

### Improvements in diagnosis of histoplasmosis [^111ugLV4]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

Understanding the uses and limitations of a battery of laboratory methods is essential to diagnose histoplasmosis. Antigen detection and serology are valuable adjuncts to histopathology and culture. Improvements incorporated into the second-generation Histoplasma antigen assay have increased its sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of histoplasmosis. More recently, the antigen assay has been modified to provide quantitation, which improves reproducibility and facilitates monitoring antigen clearance during treatment. Furthermore, detection of antigen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid increases the sensitivity for diagnosis of pulmonary histoplasmosis. Serological tests for antibodies are also useful, but may be falsely negative in immunosuppressed patients. In addition, elevated antibody titres persist for several years following initial infection, complicating their interpretation. Although histopathology may provide for rapid diagnosis, its sensitivity is < 50% in patients with disseminated disease and even lower in pulmonary histoplasmosis. Polymerase chain reaction has been described, but sensitivity is less than that of histopathology. Culture, although highly specific, has notable limitations, including insensitivity, a need for invasive procedures and delayed growth. This review provides the background for understanding the role of a battery of diagnostic methods in histoplasmosis. Tests facilitating a rapid diagnosis are expected to improve the outcome in patients with severe disease.

### Laboratory diagnostics for histoplasmosis [^1156YcxB]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of histoplasmosis is based on a multifaceted approach that includes clinical, radiographic, and laboratory evidence of disease. The gold standards for laboratory diagnosis include demonstration of yeast on pathological examination of tissue and isolation of the mold in the culture of clinical specimens; however, antigen detection has provided a rapid, noninvasive, and highly sensitive method for diagnosis and is a useful marker of treatment response. Molecular methods with improved sensitivity on clinical specimens are being developed but are not yet ready for widespread clinical use. This review synthesizes currently available laboratory diagnostics for histoplasmosis, with an emphasis on complexities of testing and performance in various clinical contexts.

The diagnosis of histoplasmosis depends on recognition of the different clinical manifestations of infection, accompanied by knowledge of the accuracy and limitations of tests used for diagnosis of fungal infections. Although most infections are asymptomatic, histoplasmosis can be severe, or even fatal, in patients who have experienced a heavy exposure, have underlying immune defects, or develop progressive disease that is not recognized and treated. This article provides an up-to-date clinical review of histoplasmosis, focusing on recognition, diagnosis, and management.

### Histoplasmosis [^113uwkAq]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Histoplasmosis is the most prevalent endemic fungal infection in North America. The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic, self-limited illness to a life-threatening progressive disseminated disease. Chronic manifestations of healed infection can also be problematic. Clinical presentation depends on the infectious load, underlying immune status, and lung function. The preferred diagnostic methods and treatment options vary with clinical scenario and severity of illness. New diagnostic tools and treatment options are now available in clinical practice. We present an overview of this important endemic mycosis with emphasis on diagnosis and treatment recommendations for the different clinical syndromes of histoplasmosis.

Background

Histoplasmosis is the most prevalent endemic mycosis in North America. With the continually expanding at-risk population and widening areas of endemicity, the need to better understand the optimal diagnostic methods for histoplasmosis is pressing. The mortality in histoplasmosis is estimated to be 5% in children and 8% in adults. Fungal cultures are the gold standard test to confirm the diagnosis. However, they can be technically challenging and are time consuming. Rapid diagnosis is essential in patients with severe infections such as disseminated and severe acute pulmonary histoplasmosis to allow for early initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy, potentially improving outcomes.

Antigen and antibody detection are currently the most widely accepted non–culture-based methods to diagnose histoplasmosis. Their diagnostic yields depend on the clinical presentations, infectious burden, immune status, and timing in relation to the infection. The laboratory methods used to detect Histoplasma antigen and antibodies have been updated in the last decade to include quantitative methods and lower thresholds of detection that have improved their sensitivity and allowed for comparison of titers and monitoring response to treatment. Cross-reactivity with other endemic fungal pathogens is problematic. Histoplasma antigen was studied mostly in patients with disseminated histoplasmosis, whereas studies of antibodies examined patients with predominantly pulmonary histoplasmosis.

Histoplasmosis testing recommendations and implementation — directive statements and use cases are as follows: "We recommend the use of the Histoplasma antigen in urine or serum for rapid diagnosis of suspected disseminated and acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, in which timely diagnosis and treatment are paramount to outcome (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)". Technical remark notes that "the urine and serum antigen testing results were comparable… we would not limit the testing to either sample source. Therefore, we prefer to use urine or serum. To date, there are no convincing data for combining both". Additionally, "We suggest the use of Histoplasma serologies in immunocompetent patients with suspected pulmonary histoplasmosis. Adding Histoplasma antigen to serological testing might improve the diagnostic yield (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)". Antigen testing "appears to be most useful in patients with high fungal burden (i.e., those with disseminated or acute pulmonary histoplasmosis), in whom antibody detection is not as reliable… and those unable to mount an antibody response due to immunosuppression", and "Combining antibody and antigen testing further improves the diagnostic yield in pulmonary histoplasmosis". Beyond urine and serum, "Histoplasma antigen can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid… and in BAL". Using antigen testing in an endemic setting, "In a hypothetical population of 1,000… with a prevalence of 10%", results would be "81 true-positive… 19 false-negative… 885 true-negative… and 15 false-positive", with "a positive predictive value of 84% and a negative predictive value of 98%"; in an outbreak with prevalence "as high as 25%", yields would be "204 true positives, 46 false negatives, 13 false positives", and "a positive predictive value of 94% and a negative predictive value of 94%".

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) histoplasmosis guideline update — scope, topics, and methods are outlined: As the first part of an update, the panel presents 4 updated recommendations spanning treatment of asymptomatic Histoplasma pulmonary nodules (histoplasmomas), mild acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, and moderate acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, based on systematic literature reviews and a GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rating certainty and strength. The scope includes treatment of asymptomatic Histoplasma pulmonary nodules (histoplasmomas) and mild or moderate acute pulmonary histoplasmosis; available evidence for children, adults, and pregnant people was reviewed, and newborns and patients with African histoplasmosis or possible ocular histoplasmosis syndrome were excluded. Background context notes that histoplasmosis is caused by infection with the thermally dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, occurs through inhalation of H. capsulatum with worldwide distribution but hyperendemic areas such as the midwestern United States, and that disease severity ranges from asymptomatic to severe depending on inoculum and cell-mediated immune function; definitions of asymptomatic pulmonary histoplasmosis and mild, moderate, and severe acute pulmonary histoplasmosis appear in Table 1.

### Disseminated histoplasmosis in a nonendemic area [^113La8Dq]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Health care providers in the areas where histoplasmosis is not endemic can benefit greatly from understanding the clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of disseminated histoplasmosis as patients from the endemic areas may travel to and require medical attention in areas of low disease prevalence. Use of effective diagnostic tools such as Histoplasma antigen detection can aid in providing timely and appropriate therapy.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with histoplasmosis: 2007 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111gqBQB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with histoplasmosis were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace the previous treatment guidelines published in 2000 (Clin Infect Dis 2000; 30:688–95). The guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have these infections or may be at risk for them. Since 2000, several new antifungal agents have become available, and clinical trials and case series have increased our understanding of the management of histoplasmosis. Advances in immunosuppressive treatment for inflammatory disorders have created new questions about the approach to prevention and treatment of histoplasmosis. New information, based on publications from the period 1999–2006, are incorporated into this guideline document. In addition, the panel added recommendations for management of histoplasmosis in children for those aspects that differ from aspects in adults.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of the endemic mycoses: an initiative of the European Confederation of Medical Mycology in cooperation with the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology [^116zeTf5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The global burden of the endemic mycoses (blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, emergomycosis, histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, sporotrichosis, and talaromycosis) continues to rise yearly and these infectious diseases remain a leading cause of patient morbidity and mortality worldwide. Management of the associated pathogens requires a thorough understanding of the epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic methods and performance characteristics in different patient populations, and treatment options unique to each infection. Guidance on the management of these infections has the potential to improve prognosis. The recommendations outlined in this Review are part of the "One World, One Guideline" initiative of the European Confederation of Medical Mycology. Experts from 23 countries contributed to the development of these guidelines. The aim of this Review is to provide an up-to-date consensus and practical guidance in clinical decision making, by engaging physicians and scientists involved in various aspects of clinical management.

### Diagnosis of histoplasmosis in immunosuppressed patients [^112s5VjR]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To define the most appropriate studies for making a diagnosis of histoplasmosis in immunosuppressed patients.

Recent Findings

As is true of all fungal infections in immunosuppressed patients, heightened awareness of the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of histoplasmosis is essential in making an early diagnosis. Increasingly, Histoplasma antigen detection is used to help establish a diagnosis of histoplasmosis. Most of the reported data are on patients with AIDS, but limited data suggest the usefulness of this assay in other immunosuppressed patients as well. False positive reactions occur with other fungal infections, especially blastomycosis, and patients who have histoplasmosis may have a false positive serum Aspergillus galactomannan assay. The identification of the yeast phase of Histoplasma capsulatum in tissue biopsy samples and, uncommonly, in circulating blood phagocytes is also helpful in establishing a diagnosis quickly. PCR techniques have yet to prove useful for the rapid diagnosis of histoplasmosis, and serology is often negative in immunosuppressed patients. Culture remains definitive and should always be performed to confirm the results of the rapid diagnostic studies.

Summary

Rapid techniques, mostly antigen detection in serum and urine and histopathological identification of Histoplasma capsulatum in tissues, are the most important rapid diagnostic tests for histoplasmosis in immunosuppressed patients.

### Multistate epidemiology of histoplasmosis, United States, 2011–2014 [^1163JpG4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

This multistate comparison of histoplasmosis surveillance data is a first step toward an updated understanding of the burden of this disease in the United States. Other actions that would improve our understanding of histoplasmosis include expanding the number of states in which it is reportable and making it nationally notifiable. Although underreporting of milder cases might explain the high severity of disease among reported cases, the fact that laboratory-based reporting is common suggests that at least some of the skewed disease spectrum results from underdiagnosis. Increased awareness about histoplasmosis among the public, the public health community, and healthcare providers could improve diagnosis, leading to appropriate treatment and better patient outcomes and reducing harm from administering multiple courses of antibacterial drugs ineffective against fungi, as commonly occurs for coccidioidomycosis. To identify populations at highest risk and opportunities for prevention, additional study of the incidence and epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory features of histoplasmosis cases nationwide is needed.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113rvAbo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Histoplasmosis antigen testing — diagnostic performance, monitoring utility, and limitations are described as follows: an immunocompromised patient with suspected histoplasmosis (0.5 pretest probability) would result in a posttest probability of 0.98, given the positive likelihood ratio of 43.2. The positive predictive value of an antigen level greater than 16 pg/ml was 88% for moderate to severe histoplasmosis, for which patients need to be treated with amphotericin B on an inpatient basis. Antigen levels can also be used to monitor patients because levels decrease with effective therapy, and their increase predicts relapse. Key limitations are cross-reactivity with other endemic mycoses and restricted availability; Histoplasma antigen is detected in the majority of patients with other endemic fungal infections, and the test is offered by few reference laboratories, potentially delaying results. Expanding local access using prepackaged kits or newer platforms will have an impact on rapid diagnosis, especially in resource-limited areas.

### Histoplasmosis [^116caTAw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Although histoplasmosis is highly endemic in certain regions of the Americas, disease may be seen globally and should not be overlooked in patients with unexplained pulmonary or systemic illnesses. Most patients exhibit pulmonary signs and symptoms, accompanied by radiographic abnormalities, which often are mistaken for community-acquired pneumonia caused by bacterial or viral agents. Once a diagnosis is considered, a panel of mycologic and non-culture-based assays is adequate to establish a diagnosis in a few days to a week in most patients. Once diagnosed, the treatment is highly effective even in immunocompromised patients.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

As the first part of an update to the clinical practice guideline on the management of histoplasmosis in adults, children, and pregnant people, developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, we present 4 updated recommendations. These recommendations span treatment of asymptomatic Histoplasma pulmonary nodules (histoplasmomas), mild acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, and moderate acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. The panel's recommendations are based on evidence derived from systematic literature reviews and adhere to a standardized methodology for rating the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendation according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.

Histoplasma serologies (antibody detection)

Fewer studies examining the use of Histoplasma serologies met our inclusion criteria. The yield of Histoplasma serology depends on the immune status of the patient and the timing of testing in relation to the infection. The sensitivity of serology in immunocompetent patients with pulmonary histoplasmosis ranges between 80% and 95%, in contrast to the unacceptably low sensitivity in recipients of organ transplants (18%) and those with HIV–AIDS (45%). The specificity of Histoplasma serology is excellent, given the low levels of background false positivity (< 5%) in residents of endemic areas outside periods of outbreaks.

Although complement fixation (CF) and gel diffusions are the predominantly used methods for Histoplasma serology, more recent enzyme immunoassay (EIA)-based quantitative assays are currently available to measure serum levels of IgG and IgM, with sensitivity of 87% for IgG and 67% for IgM and specificity of 95% and 96%, respectively.

Recommendations

We recommend the use of Histoplasma antigen in urine or serum for rapid diagnosis of suspected disseminated and acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, in which timely diagnosis and treatment are paramount to outcome (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
- Technical remark: The systematic review which we cited showed that the urine and serum antigen testing results were comparable. There are more data for the use of Histoplasma antigen in urine, but at this time, we would not limit the testing to either sample source. Therefore, we prefer to state urine or serum. To date, there are no convincing data for combining both.

We suggest the use of Histoplasma serologies in immunocompetent patients with suspected pulmonary histoplasmosis. Adding Histoplasma antigen to serological testing might improve the diagnostic yield (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis — severity definitions for clinical decision support: Asymptomatic pulmonary histoplasmosis is asymptomatic but has evidence of recent onset or active infection. Mild acute pulmonary histoplasmosis has mild symptoms that do not interfere with normal activities. Moderate acute pulmonary histoplasmosis has symptoms significant enough to interfere with normal activities and may require low-flow oxygen supplementation or hospitalization. Severe acute pulmonary histoplasmosis includes respiratory failure requiring substantial supplemental oxygen, significant weight loss and/or malaise, and requires hospitalization with possible intensive care. These definitions are intended as guidance; clinical assessment should drive care decisions.

### Overview of histoplasmosis [^1122HSDo]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Histoplasmosis is an endemic infection in most of the United States and can be found worldwide. The spectrum of this illness ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe disseminated disease. Life-threatening illness is usually associated with an immunocompromised state; however, 20 percent of severe illnesses result from a heavy inoculum in healthy persons. Culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis but requires a lengthy incubation period. Fungal staining produces quicker results than culture but is less sensitive. Testing for antigen and antibodies is rapid and sensitive when used for particular disease presentations. An advantage of antigen detection is its usefulness in monitoring disease therapy. Antifungal therapy is indicated in chronic or disseminated disease and severe, acute infection. Amphotericin B is the agent of choice in severe cases; however, patients must be monitored for nephrotoxicity and hypokalemia. Itraconazole is effective in moderate disease and is well tolerated, even with long-term use. Hepatotoxicity, the most severe adverse effect of itraconazole, is uncommon and usually transient.

### How many have died from undiagnosed human immunodeficiency virus-associated histoplasmosis, a treatable disease? Time to act [^111hxjRQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated disseminated Histoplasma capsulatum capsulatum infection often mimics tuberculosis. This disease is well know in the United States but is dramatically underdiagnosed in Central and South America. In the Amazon region, given the available incidence data and the regional HIV prevalence, it is expected that, every year, 1,500 cases of histoplasmosis affect HIV patients in that region alone. Given the mortality in undiagnosed patients, at least 600 patients would be expected to die from an undiagnosed but treatable disease. The lack of a simple diagnostic tool and the lack of awareness by clinicians spiral in a vicious cycle and made a major problem invisible for 30 years. The HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome community should tackle this problem now to prevent numerous avoidable deaths from HIV-associated histoplasmosis in the region and elsewhere.

### The other side of the coin of pulmonary fungal diseases: toward new paradigms [^116PgTQB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In countries with high incidences of pulmonary fungal diseases, delay in diagnosis remains a critical barrier to their timely management. The scarcity of sensitive diagnostic tests, such as antigen-specific detection and real-time PCR, limits the ability of health systems to identify infections such as invasive aspergillosis and disseminated histoplasmosis early. In resource-limited regions, reliance on conventional methods, such as microbiological cultures and histological stains, leads to lower sensitivity and prolonged response times, delaying the initiation of antifungal treatment and increasing mortality. Investment in inaccessible diagnostic technologies and strengthening laboratory infrastructure are essential strategies to reduce the burden of these infections in vulnerable settings.

In summary, pulmonary fungal diseases represent a growing public health threat, especially in resource-limited countries where inequalities in access to treatment require comprehensive surveillance strategies, investment in new therapies, and strengthening of health systems. The lack of sensitive diagnostic tools and underreporting in high-incidence regions underestimate their burden. In addition, interaction with viral pandemics has exacerbated their impact. Addressing these deficiencies is crucial to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with these infections, and healthcare professionals' role in this cannot be overstated.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^117NGekP]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis — laboratory methods and performance for histoplasmosis include culture, histopathologic, serologic, antigen-detection, and molecular techniques, but each has limitations. Histoplasmin skin tests are no longer available and were not useful in diagnosing disseminated disease. Although isolation of the fungus using culture is diagnostic, it often requires invasive procedures, is insensitive, and may take 10 to 30 days for growth to occur; lysis-centrifugation facilitates growth of H. capsulatum and a DNA probe permits prompt identification of isolates. Histopathologic demonstration of typical yeast forms in tissue specimens, bone marrow, or peripheral blood can be performed rapidly and, when positive, is highly suggestive of active infection, but results are positive in only 12% to 43% of adults with PDH. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA probes to detect H. capsulatum DNA in tissues and body fluids have been developed, but neither is sufficiently sensitive and DNA probes may lack adequate specificity.

Implications for Public Health Practice

Increased awareness is needed to improve prompt diagnosis and treatment of coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis, particularly during periods of increased incidence of other respiratory diseases. To reduce misdiagnosis of these three fungal infections, standardized diagnostic guidance and informational resources for pan-respiratory testing, including fungal diseases, are needed and could be incorporated into broader respiratory disease awareness and preparedness efforts. Education to help clinicians distinguish fungal pneumonia from other respiratory infections might improve accurate diagnosis. Enhanced and expanded surveillance can also improve understanding of risk factors and epidemiologic trends to help guide efforts to raise awareness and improve diagnosis, management, and patient outcomes.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We planned to synthesize the study types in order of priority. At each stage, if we found a sufficient number of studies to allow a high‐certainty synthesis, we did not intend to progress further. As we did not find sufficient evidence to allow high‐certainty synthesis, our review includes the following study types:

randomized controlled trials (RCTs);
quasi‐RCTs/non‐RCTs;
prospective cohort studies;
retrospective cohort studies;
single arm cohort studies.

We excluded case reports and case series.

Types of participants

HIV‐positive children, adolescents, and adults with a clinical diagnosis of PDH.

Types of interventions

We aimed to make the following comparisons.

Types of outcome measures

We collected data on key outcomes, as summarized in the table below.

Where possible, we collected dichotomous and time‐to‐event data for relevant outcomes. We also collected data on mortality, and severe adverse events, including type and frequency.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

We developed our search strategy with the assistance of the Information Specialist, Vittoria Lutje. We searched the following databases on 20 March 2020 using the search terms and strategy described in Appendix 1: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 3, published in the Cochrane Library); MEDLINE (PubMed, from 1966); Embase (Ovid, from 1947); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED, from 1900), Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S, from 1900), and BIOSIS Previews (from 1926) (all three using the Web of Science platform). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ISRCTN registry to identify ongoing studies.

Searching other resources

We examined reference lists of relevant studies and reviews.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Two review authors (MM and PH) screened the titles and abstracts of the search results to determine eligibility using Covidence. We did not perform double screening as we prepared the review rapidly to inform a guidelines meeting. We each assessed a random sample of the other author's screening. There were no disagreements. Both review authors screened the full texts of potentially eligible studies, and resolved any disagreement by discussion. At the time of full‐text screening, we categorized the studies by study design.

### Histoplasmosis-related healthcare use, diagnosis, and treatment in a commercially insured population, United States [^116jM2yz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Infections with Histoplasma can range from asymptomatic to life-threatening acute pulmonary or disseminated disease. Histoplasmosis can be challenging to diagnose and is widely underrecognized. We analyzed insurance claims data to better characterize histoplasmosis testing and treatment practices and its burden on patients.

Methods

We used the IBM MarketScan Research Databases to identify patients with histoplasmosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 115.00–115.99) during 2012–2014. We analyzed claims in the 3 months before to the 1 year after diagnosis and examined differences between patients with probable (hospitalized or > 1 outpatient visit) and suspected (1 outpatient visit) histoplasmosis.

Results

Among 1935 patients (943 probable, 992 suspected), 54% had codes for symptoms or findings consistent with histoplasmosis and 35% had ≥ 2 healthcare visits in the 3 months before diagnosis. Overall, 646 (33%) had any fungal-specific laboratory test: histoplasmosis antibody test (n = 349 [18%]), Histoplasma antigen test (n = 349 [18%]), fungal smear (n = 294 [15%]), or fungal culture (n = 223 [12%]); 464 (24%) had a biopsy. Forty-nine percent of probable patients and 10% of suspected patients were prescribed antifungal medication in the outpatient setting. In total, 19% were hospitalized. Patients' last histoplasmosis-associated healthcare visits occurred a median of 6 months after diagnosis.

Conclusions

Some histoplasmosis patients experienced severe disease, apparent diagnostic delays, and prolonged illness, whereas other patients lacked symptoms and were likely diagnosed incidentally (eg, via biopsy). Low rates of histoplasmosis-specific testing also suggest incidental diagnoses and low provider suspicion, highlighting the need for improved awareness about this disease.

### Role of histology in the diagnosis of infectious causes of granulomatous lung disease [^111isP2i]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Histologic examination and microbiologic cultures are the gold standards for the diagnosis of infectious granulomatous lung diseases. Although biopsies require invasive procedures, they often yield information that cannot be obtained by other methods. The aims of this article are to outline the major infections that cause granulomatous inflammation in the lung and to familiarize clinicians with the utility of histologic examination in their diagnosis.

Recent Findings

The histopathologic features of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis and granulomatous Pneumocystis pneumonia have been described in detail, the relative contributions of histology and microbiologic cultures in the diagnosis of blastomycosis have been delineated, and Cryptococcus gattii has emerged as a significant cause of granulomatous pulmonary nodules.

Summary

The major infectious causes of granulomatous lung disease are mycobacteria and fungi. Histologic examination is particularly important in the diagnosis of pulmonary granulomatous infections when clinical, radiologic and serologic findings are nonspecific. Histology and microbiology play complementary but distinct roles in diagnosis. For organisms that grow slowly in cultures, histology has the additional advantage of being able to provide a rapid diagnosis.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for histoplasmosis, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, PAHO/WHO 2020 guidelines recommend to define severe or moderately severe histoplasmosis as the presence of at least one sign or symptom involving vital organs:

- respiratory or circulatory failure

- neurological signs

- renal failure

- coagulation anomalies

- general alteration of the WHO performance status > 2, in which the person is confined to a bed or chair for more than half the waking hours and only capable of limited self-care.

### Epidemiology of histoplasmosis outbreaks, United States, 1938–2013 [^116gEeBh]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Historically, skin testing, environmental testing, and decontamination of environmental material with formalin often played central roles in histoplasmosis outbreak investigation and control but are currently of limited or no relevance. The histoplasmin skin test was frequently used as an epidemiologic tool in outbreak investigations to test patients (either during the outbreak or as part of clinical follow-up) or other exposed persons or to establish skin-test positivity rates within a specific geographic area or population. Nevertheless, the skin test was not a useful diagnostic test because of concern about cross-reactivity with other endemic mycoses, and the reagents have not been commercially available in the United States since 2000. Similarly, environmental recovery of H. capsulatum from outbreak settings contributed substantially to knowledge of this species' natural habitat and provided essential epidemiologic linkage between cases and exposure settings. However, the current utility of environmental testing for H. capsulatum in outbreak situations is less clear because traditional culture-based detection methods are resource intensive, and detection of the organism in the environment likely would not change public health recommendations for outbreak control. Molecular methods to detect H. capsulatum in environmental samples appear promising but are not yet widely used. As these technologies advance, they may serve as faster, less expensive methods to analyze environmental samples than culture-based methods. Use of formalin to decontaminate contaminated soil or other environmental material is no longer recommended because this substance is a health hazard and use is impractical for large areas or settings such as caves.

Overall, outbreak-associated cases likely represent a small proportion of histoplasmosis cases. Histoplasmosis is reportable to public health authorities in 10 states, but passive surveillance almost certainly underestimates the true number of diagnosed cases in these areas. Histoplasmosis is often described as the most common endemic mycosis in the United States. This description is perhaps accurate on the basis of the potentially large number of asymptomatic infections suggested by the nationwide skin test surveys of the 1940s–1950s; however, current estimates of symptomatic cases and of the economic and public health effects caused by histoplasmosis are unavailable. Future work is needed to better define the true burden of both outbreak-associated and sporadic cases of histoplasmosis. Increased awareness among healthcare providers, public health and occupational safety professionals, and the public is also needed so that appropriate methods can be used to reduce exposures in known endemic areas during disruption of bird or bat droppings or other contaminated material.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117H7keS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to its excellent diagnostic yield, Histoplasma antigen can also be used to gauge the severity of the infection because its level correlates with severity of illness; in one study, the positive predictive value of an antigen level greater than 16 pg/ml was 88% for moderate to severe histoplasmosis, for which patients need to be treated with amphotericin B on an inpatient basis. Antigen levels can also be used to monitor patients' progress while receiving antifungal therapy because levels decrease with effective therapy, and their increase predicts relapse.

The two major limitations of Histoplasma antigen are the cross-reactivity with other endemic mycoses and the availability of testing being restricted to reference laboratories in the United States. Histoplasma antigen is detected in the majority of patients with other endemic fungal infections, including blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and talaromycosis. The limited commercial availability of the test is a major limitation, especially in endemic areas outside the United States, such as Latin America and Africa. Currently, the test is offered by few reference laboratories, which may delay testing and results reporting, which in turn limits its utility for rapid diagnosis in severe infections.

Future research

Large studies of simultaneous testing of antigens and antibodies in various forms of histoplasmosis are needed to better define their respective roles in the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease while treatment is administered. Furthermore, the newer serological testing of IgG and IgM will need to be tested in larger and more heterogeneous groups of patients with histoplasmosis to better define its diagnostic role. Molecular methods have been developed for the identification of Histoplasma in culture and in biological samples, but they have not been well validated in large clinical cohorts of histoplasmosis. Such testing might prove very useful, especially if made available for local laboratory testing.

The ability to perform antigen testing at local laboratories using prepackaged testing kits or newer testing platforms will have an impact on the rapid diagnosis of histoplasmosis in endemic areas that are not in close proximity to reference laboratories, especially in resource-limited areas.

### Mapping histoplasma capsulatum exposure, United States [^1124drzC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The accurate diagnosis of histoplasmosis is challenging and often requires a battery of antigen detection, serology, and histopathology studies. Serologic tests are imperfect and, although often specific, can have low sensitivity, particularly for immunosuppressed patients. Knowledge of the distribution of H. capsulatum exposure and histoplasmosis infection is also critical for the appropriate regional use of imaging to diagnose fungal lung disease in immunocompromised persons and persons with lung malignancies. Investigators have questioned the utility of FDG-PET for diagnosing lung nodules in regions where granulomatous disease is prevalent. A recent meta-analysis concluded that FDG-PET was less specific for diagnosing malignancy in populations where lung mycosis is endemic than in those where it is not.

In conclusion, we generated a detailed suitability map for Histoplasma exposure east of the Rocky Mountains, an approach that can be updated as land use changes. Our suitability map may provide a detailed prediction of the risk for acute histoplasmosis infection, including areas of new endemicity. Accurate mapping of Histoplamosis exposure may also aid in the interpretation of chest images, particularly in the context of lung cancer screening programs. Future work might add elevation, soil moisture, water-holding capacity, and geologic data into the suitability model. Suitability score models have the potential to be applied to other infectious agents strongly associated with geographic-specific vectors, with the promise to inform healthcare and improve public health assessments and interventions.

Regarding medical management for histoplasmosis, more specifically with respect to management of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, mild-to-moderate, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering antifungal treatment in immunocompromised adult or pediatric patients presenting with mild or moderate acute pulmonary histoplasmosis at moderate-to-high risk of progression to disseminated disease.

### Systematic review of prevalence of histoplasma antigenuria in persons with HIV in Latin America and Africa [^116YQePp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Histoplasmosis is an endemic fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. In immunocompetent persons, histoplasmosis is often asymptomatic or localized to the pulmonary system. However, in immunocompromised persons, histoplasmosis can manifest in a progressive disseminated form that is an AIDS-defining illness. Even with prompt treatment, disseminated histoplasmosis has a high mortality rate. Given historically limited awareness of the disease and poor diagnostic capacity, histoplasmosis has been underdiagnosed, and the true global burden remains unknown. Although well documented in much of the Americas, with recent studies showing prevalence rates up to 30% in some areas of Central America, histoplasmosis is also considered endemic in parts of Africa and Asia, and expanding regions of endemicity have been recognized in the past decade. Given the potential illness and death from HIV-associated histoplasmosis, a critical need exists for improved diagnostics and treatments.

In persons with HIV, histoplasmosis can be difficult to detect because the signs and symptoms of disseminated histoplasmosis closely mimic those of disseminated tuberculosis (TB), increasing risk of misdiagnosis and undertreatment, especially in regions where both diseases are endemic. Histopathology and culture provide the most accurate methods for diagnosing histoplasmosis, but resource-limited settings often lack the personnel and laboratory infrastructure to use these methods.

Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), where available, have bridged this diagnostic gap by enabling detection of Histoplasma antigen in both urine and serum samples. The first EIA test, developed by MiraVista Diagnostics, is 95% sensitive in urine samples, but this test is not a viable option for low- and middle-income countries because samples can be processed only at 1 reference laboratory in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. Optimum Imaging Diagnostics has also developed a urine histoplasmosis sandwich EIA using rabbit monoclonal antibodies that has a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 32%. The IMMY Alpha test is a US Food and Drug Administation–approved polyclonal antibody ELISA that has 62%–81% sensitivity and 96%–97% specificity. IMMY subsequently developed the Clarus Histoplasma galactomannan assay, a monoclonal antibody test, for use on urine samples; sensitivity is 91% and specificity is 91%. Advent of urinary EIA screening tests might offer a feasible testing strategy, especially in endemic settings, for earlier detection of active histoplasmosis infection than with other testing strategies. The historical absence of sufficiently sensitive rapid testing that can be routinely performed in resource-limited settings has led to a dearth of accurate prevalence data on the global burden of histoplasmosis.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

IDSA 2025 histoplasmosis guideline — pregnancy considerations indicate that treatment of pregnant individuals should only be considered after carefully weighing the potential benefits versus harms of treatment, ideally in consultation with a maternal fetal medicine specialist and an infectious diseases specialist, as these cases are rare, complex, and highly variable. If treatment is necessary, azoles should be avoided in the first trimester when possible and liposomal amphotericin B used instead.

### Systematic review of prevalence of histoplasma antigenuria in persons with HIV in Latin America and Africa [^1121cF4K]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Histoplasma antigenuria prevalence among asymptomatic persons with HIV was 5%. The clinical significance of asymptomatic Histoplasma antigenuria among persons with HIV is unknown, and further research is required to investigate whether antifungal therapy is required or a watch-and-wait policy alongside antiretroviral therapy with immune reconstitution is sufficient among persons in that group. Those results could be false positives; they could indicate that patients with a low antigen burden who are undergoing antiretroviral therapy might not require antifungal therapy; or they could represent early dissemination that would progress without antifungal treatment.

Clinical studies and studies on the burden of histoplasmosis disease are hampered by a historical lack of histoplasmosis diagnostics. Although culture and histopathology are the most accurate methods for diagnosis, many resource-limited settings do not have the laboratory capacity or staffing to perform these tests. Furthermore, culture results require several weeks, which is clinically impractical. Antigen detection assays for histoplasmosis have 95% sensitivity (95% CI 94%–97%) and 97% specificity (95% CI 97%–98%) and are found to be most accurate among persons with HIV in whom fungal burden is generally highest. Access to point-of-care, rapid antigen assays that do not require laboratory infrastructure would enable better characterization of histoplasmosis burden in limited resource settings, where the burden of advanced HIV disease is highest. Two companies, Optimum Imaging Diagnostics and MiraVista, have now produced lateral flow assays that have European Union CE marks, which indicates that a product has been assessed by the manufacturer and deemed to meet European Union safety, health, and environmental protection requirements; however, those products have not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Another company, IMMY, is developing a lateral flow assay, but it has not yet been tested clinically. Further development and testing of these assays is necessary. Beyond the role of antigen testing to provide updated epidemiologic data, rapid antigen tests have the potential to improve clinical management among persons with advanced HIV disease and symptomatic histoplasmosis. If clinical trials demonstrate survival benefit from histoplasmosis screening and treatment among asymptomatic persons with advanced HIV disease, a rapid, point-of-care assay would be essential for diagnosis of cryptococcal diseases.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^114gCamL]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Histoplasmosis in HIV-infected children — diagnosis summarizes available tests and limitations. Histoplasmin skin tests are no longer available and were not useful in diagnosing disseminated disease. Although isolation of the fungus using culture is diagnostic, it often requires invasive procedures, is insensitive, and may take 10 to 30 days for growth to occur; lysis-centrifugation methodology facilitates growth of H. capsulatum, and a DNA probe permits prompt identification of isolates. Histopathologic demonstration of typical yeast forms in tissue specimens, bone marrow, or peripheral blood can be performed rapidly and, when positive, is highly suggestive of active infection; however, results are positive in only 12% to 43% of adults with PDH. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA probes have been developed to detect H. capsulatum DNA in tissues and body fluids, but neither is sufficiently sensitive and DNA probes may lack adequate specificity.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1165b3tP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Histoplasmosis — diagnosis in HIV emphasizes antigen detection, with detection of Histoplasma antigen in blood or urine being a sensitive method for rapid diagnosis of disseminated and acute pulmonary histoplasmosis but insensitive for chronic pulmonary infection. In a study using a newer quantitative assay, Histoplasma antigen was detected in 100% of urine samples and 92% of serum samples from people with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis, and antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may also be useful method for diagnosis of pulmonary histoplasmosis; in severe disseminated disease, peripheral blood smears can show organisms engulfed by white blood cells and biopsy often demonstrates characteristic 2 to 4 μm budding yeast cells. Culture of H. capsulatum from blood, bone marrow, respiratory secretions, or other sites is possible in > 85% of patients with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis but requires several weeks to grow, while serologic tests are less useful than antigen assays in AIDS-related disseminated disease but may help in pulmonary disease with reasonably intact immune responses. For central nervous system (CNS) disease, usual cerebrospinal fluid findings are lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low glucose; fungal stains are usually negative and cultures are positive in a minority of cases, with a review including patients with HIV reporting cultures positive in 38% of patients. Histoplasma antigen can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a far greater number of cases and antibodies are seen in approximately one-half of cases, and a positive antigen or antibody test result from CSF is diagnostic for histoplasmosis; if specific tests are negative, a presumptive diagnosis of Histoplasma meningitis is appropriate when the patient has disseminated histoplasmosis and findings of CNS infection not attributable to another cause.

### Systematic review of prevalence of histoplasma antigenuria in persons with HIV in Latin America and Africa [^114ZmHUz]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease associated with substantial mortality rates among persons with advanced HIV disease. Our systematic review synthesized data on the global prevalence of Histoplasma­ -caused antigenuria in persons with HIV. We searched PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases on January 3, 2023, to identify cross-sectional and cohort studies evaluating Histoplasma antigenuria prevalence among adults with HIV infection. We calculated point estimates and 95% CIs to summarize prevalence. Of 1,294 studies screened, we included 15. We found Histoplasma antigenuria among 581/5,096 (11%; 95% CI 11%–12%) persons with HIV and 483/3,789 persons with advanced HIV disease (13%; 95% CI 12%–14%). Among persons with HIV and symptoms consistent with histoplasmosis, Histoplasma antigenuria prevalence was 14% (95% CI 13%–15%; 502/3,631 participants). We determined that persons with advanced HIV disease, inpatients, and symptomatic persons might benefit from a systematic approach to early detection of histoplasmosis using urine antigen testing.

Histoplasmosis antigen detection — diagnostic accuracy and study context are as follows: A meta-analysis of Histoplasma antigen testing included "a total of nine studies… with a total of 1,029 cases and 2,195 controls", and "Overall, the sensitivity of Histoplasma antigen detection was 81.4% (95% CI, 79.1–83.8%), and the specificity was 98.9% (95% CI, 97.7–99.7%)". Sensitivity was "slightly higher for antigenemia (83.9%; 95% CI, 80.5–87%) than for antigenuria (79.5%; 95% CI, 76.3–82.4%)", with "a positive likelihood ratio of 4.32 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.18", an "odds ratio of 321 (95% CI, 118–875)" and "an area under the curve of 0.98". In outbreak-related acute pulmonary histoplasmosis studies not pooled in the meta-analysis, "Sensitivity of Histoplasma antigen was lower… (64–68%)… however, combining urine and serum antigen testing increased the sensitivity significantly to 93%", and "combining antigen and antibody testing further increased the sensitivity to 96.3% in acute pulmonary histoplasmosis".

### Development of an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) to aid diagnosis of histoplasmosis [^1179CswG]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Establishing diagnosis of latent and active histoplasmosis is challenging. Interferon gamma-release assays (IGRAs) may provide evidence of latent and active infection. An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay was developed using yeast cell lysate (YCL) antigen prepared from a representative North American Histoplasma capsulatum strain. Assay parameters were optimized by measuring responses in healthy volunteers with and without Histoplasma infection. Assay performance as an aid for diagnosing histoplasmosis was assessed in a prospective cohort of 88 people with suspected or confirmed infection, and 44 healthy controls enrolled in two centers in North America (2013 to 2018). Antigen specificity of IFN-γ release was demonstrated using ELISpot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antigen-evoked, single-cell mRNA expression by memory T cells was shown using flow cytometry. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was estimated at 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.5% to 99.9%). At optimal cutoff, sensitivity was 77.2% (95% CI: 54.6% to 92.2%) and specificity was 100% (95% CI: 89.7% to 100%). Sixteen of 44 healthy volunteers (36.4%) from a region of hyperendemicity had positive responses, suggesting detection of previously unrecognized (latent) infection. The ELISpot assay is sensitive and specific as an aid to diagnose H. capsulatum infection and disease, supporting proof of concept and further development.

Future research

The uncertain role of biomarkers such as BDG for the early identification of IC in suspected ICU cases is primarily due to two unanswered questions. The first is the biomarkers' ability to detect IC and differentiate infection from colonization. Other blood tests, among them antibodies against Candida albicans germ tube and Candida PCR, appear to share BDG's problems with specificity in the often heavily colonized ICU population. The NOBICS clinical trial (Novel Biomarker in Invasive Candidiasis/Candida Sepsis; identifier NCT02801682) being conducted in Austria aims to evaluate the ability of various cytokine and noncytokine serological assays to detect early IC in the ICU while minimizing false positivity in colonized patients. In addition to the development of novel biomarkers, future research should include understanding and overcoming the specificity limitations of currently available serological tests as well as investigation into possible combined approaches that might consist of multiple biomarkers with or without a clinical prediction rule. The other open question is whether BDG-triggered empirical antifungal therapy improves clinically relevant outcomes in the critically ill population. Multiple German centers are currently collaborating in a clinical trial of culture-based antifungal therapy versus BDG-based treatment of IC in patients with sepsis or septic shock (CandiSep [(1,3)-β — Glucan Based Diagnosis of Invasive Candida Infection in Sepsis], identifier NCT02734550). The primary endpoint of this trial is 28-day mortality. Additional laboratory research for newer testing modalities for candidiasis are also currently underway.

Question 4

Should diagnosis of the common endemic mycoses (i.e. histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis) be based on serology and antigen testing?

Histoplasmosis

### Prevalence of histoplasmosis among persons with advanced HIV disease, Nigeria [^113XKxZy]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Much remains to be elucidated about histoplasmosis in Nigeria, but this study confirms that it is certainly underreported among persons with HIV and AIDS, partly obscured by a diagnosis of tuberculosis, a disease with several manifestations in common with histoplasmosis. Further research using highly sensitive diagnostic approaches such as PCR and bone marrow examination is needed to gain insight into the precise epidemiology of the disease in Nigeria. To encourage proactive searching for histoplasmosis, use of specific diagnostic tools, including culturing, needs to be scaled up and management guidelines for AHD patients revised. After diagnosis, patients should be treated with appropriate antifungal agents, following the 2020 WHO guidelines. Patients suspected or confirmed to have tuberculosis should be investigated for histoplasmosis as well. Development of a molecular test in an easy-to-use format, such as the GeneXpert platform, that could be deployed in HIV treatment centers would be welcome.

In conclusion, histoplasmosis is not uncommon among AHD patients in Nigeria. Therefore, Histoplasma antigen screening should be included in the AHD package of care as a matter of urgent need to improve efficiency of diagnosis and reduce illness and death from histoplasmosis in an at-risk population.

### Treating progressive disseminated histoplasmosis in people living with HIV [^115RrT3z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) is a serious fungal infection that affects people living with HIV. The best way to treat the condition is unclear.

Objectives

We assessed evidence in three areas of equipoise.

1. Induction. To compare efficacy and safety of initial therapy with liposomal amphotericin B versus initial therapy with alternative antifungals.

2. Maintenance. To compare efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy with 12 months of oral antifungal treatment with shorter durations of maintenance therapy.

3. Antiretroviral therapy (ART). To compare the outcomes of early initiation versus delayed initiation of ART.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane CENTRAL; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (Ovid); Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science, and BIOSIS Previews (all three in the Web of Science); the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ISRCTN registry, all up to 20 March 2020.

Selection criteria

We evaluated studies assessing the use of liposomal amphotericin B and alternative antifungals for induction therapy; studies assessing the duration of antifungals for maintenance therapy; and studies assessing the timing of ART. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), single‐arm trials, prospective cohort studies, and single‐arm cohort studies.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors assessed eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data, and assessed certainty of evidence. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess risk of bias in randomized studies, and ROBINS‐I tool to assess risk of bias in non‐randomized studies. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main results

We identified 17 individual studies. We judged eight studies to be at critical risk of bias, and removed these from the analysis.

1. Induction

We found one RCT which compared liposomal amphotericin B to deoxycholate amphotericin B. Compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B may have higher clinical success rates (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11; 1 study, 80 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B has lower rates of nephrotoxicity (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 study, 77 participants; high‐certainty evidence). We found very low‐certainty evidence to inform comparisons between amphotericin B formulations and azoles for induction therapy.

2. Maintenance

We found no eligible study that compared less than 12 months of oral antifungal treatment to 12 months or greater for maintenance therapy.

For both induction and maintenance, fluconazole performed poorly in comparison to other azoles.

3. ART

We found one study, in which one out of seven participants in the 'early' arm and none of the three participants in the 'late' arm died.

Authors' conclusions

Liposomal amphotericin B appears to be a better choice compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B for treating PDH in people with HIV; and fluconazole performed poorly compared to other azoles. Other treatment choices for induction, maintenance, and when to start ART have no evidence, or very low certainty evidence. PDH needs prospective comparative trials to help inform clinical decisions.

### CARE-radiology statement explanation and elaboration: reporting guideline for radiological case reports [^1128YByG]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Explanation and elaboration

Title

1a. The diagnosis or phenomenon of focus should appear in the title.

1b. The diagnostic method(s) should be included in the title, such as CT and MRI.

1c. The words 'case report' should be included in the title.

Explanation: The title enables the reader to quickly identify the main content and design of the study. Radiology case reports should highlight the type of diagnostic method (e.g. CT and MRI) and reflect the study type (case report) in the title.

Example: Case report: incidental finding of COVID-19 infection after positron emission tomography/CT imaging in a patient with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis and recurring fever.

Keywords

2a. Keywords (3–6) that identify the study as a case report, along with the relevant diagnoses and diagnostic test or approach, should be presented.

2b. Keywords should avoid general and plural terms and multiple concepts; Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms or International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision disease categories are suggested; only use abbreviations firmly established in the field.

Explanation: Keywords should accurately reflect the main content and topic of the article. Keywords for radiology case reports should include 'case report', as well as the relevant disease name, pathological diagnosis or symptoms, and the method of diagnosis. Keywords should generally be MeSH or easily understood words. Abbreviations are not recommended unless they are widely recognised.

Example: ' Keywords: Case report; Delayed graft function; Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging; Kidney transplantation; Renal vein thrombosis'.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115fSc55]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Histoplasma diagnostics in HIV — antigen assays and culture: In people with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis, a quantitative enzyme immunoassay (EIA) detected antigen in 100% of urine samples and 92% of serum samples; another monoclonal antibody EIA had a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 91%; and a urine lateral flow assay had a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 96%. Antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may also be a useful method for the diagnosis of pulmonary histoplasmosis. Histopathology often shows small yeast cells 2 to 4 μm in diameter, and in > 85% of people with HIV and disseminated histoplasmosis H. capsulatum can be cultured from blood, bone marrow, respiratory secretions, or other involved sites, although growth requires several weeks before final results can be interpreted.

### Recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of histoplasmosis complicating tumor necrosis factor blocker therapy [^115Qof4B]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Life-threatening histoplasmosis is one of the most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. Delays in considering the diagnosis may lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Most affected patients present with pneumonitis, usually accompanied by additional signs of progressive dissemination, or with signs of progressive dissemination alone. The diagnosis often can be promptly established using antigen detection or direct examination of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. If histoplasmosis is diagnosed promptly, antifungal therapy is highly effective. After a favorable clinical response, the safety of both discontinuation of antifungal therapy and the resumption of TNF blocker remains undetermined. The management of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome that may follow discontinuation of TNF blockers also requires investigation. Prescribers should become aware of the recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of histoplasmosis and educate recipients about decreasing their risk of exposure and both recognizing and reporting signs of early infection.

### Implementation of a training course increased the diagnosis of histoplasmosis in Colombia [^11187sLq]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Histoplasmosis causes a significant mortality, especially persons living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) from developing countries where access to both appropriate diagnostic methods and antiretroviral therapy are limited. A total of 81 physicians assigned to 17 Colombian departments (states) received training in the clinical, epidemiological, and diagnostic aspects of histoplasmosis. Once this training was received and during the period of October 2009-November 2012, these physicians sent biological samples for immunodiagnostic, mycological, and molecular tests from their patients with suspicion of histoplasmosis. A total of 1,536 samples from 768 patients were evaluated. Of the 768 patients studied, 463 (60%) were HIV positive, 214 (28%) HIV negative, and in 91 (12%) this diagnosis was unknown, and 538 (70%) were males. The 1,536 specimens studied comprised 722 sera, 439 blood samples, and 241 urines, which were tested by immunodiffusion (ID), culture, and antigenuria, respectively; in addition, 134 specimens were tested by performing a molecular assay. Histoplasmosis was diagnosed in 133 patients (17%). After the training, we observed more diagnoses from 27 to 44 cases per year. In this study, a significantly increased number of histoplasmosis cases reported by year were observed after implementing an educational training program.

### Epidemiology of histoplasmosis outbreaks, United States, 1938–2013 [^115p2RQ9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In our analysis, the percentage (66%) of symptomatic patients with positive laboratory results likely underrepresents the true percentage of patients who would test positive because only a subset of ill persons were selected for or received laboratory testing during some outbreak investigations. Although we were unable to evaluate the type of diagnostic tests on an individual level, serologic tests are the most commonly used diagnostic method for acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. Complement fixation and immunodiffusion tests for histoplasmosis are each ≈80% sensitive, but antibodies can take up to 6 weeks to develop. A small number of reports in this analysis included cases with low complement fixation titers (> 1:8). Although titers in this range are weak diagnostic evidence on their own, compatible signs, symptoms, and shared exposures strengthen the suspicion for histoplasmosis. Histoplasma antigen detection tests were first developed in the mid-1980s and are also useful for detecting acute disease, particularly among persons with immunocompromising conditions, disseminated histoplasmosis, or intense exposures.

Several examples show the potential for large histoplasmosis outbreaks. The outbreak with the most reported symptomatic cases (n = 383) occurred in 1970, when a group of junior high students in Ohio raked and swept a central courtyard where birds had roosted. A similarly large (but unusually prolonged and severe) citywide windborne outbreak of 381 symptomatic cases occurred during September 1978–August 1979 in Indianapolis, Indiana, where 2 activities and settings were suspected outbreak sources: demolition of an amusement park and construction of a tennis stadium. A serosurvey performed as part of that investigation revealed a large number of presumably asymptomatic persons who had laboratory evidence of acute histoplasmosis; the authors of the report extrapolated that > 100,000 persons were infected.

### Evaluation of a new histoplasma spp. quantitative RT-PCR assay [^1146K2ft]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2021). Medium credibility.

Laboratory diagnosis of histoplasmosis is based on various methods, including microscopy, culture, antigen, and DNA detection of Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum or Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii. To improve sensitivity of existing real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays, we developed a new RT-qPCR assay that allows amplification of whole nucleic acids of Histoplasma spp. validated on suspected cases. The limit of detection was 20 copies, and the specificity against 114 fungal isolates/species was restricted to Histoplasma spp. Whole nucleic acids of 1319 prospectively collected consecutive samples from 907 patients suspected of having histoplasmosis were tested routinely between May 2015 and May 2019 in parallel with standard diagnostic procedures performed in parallel. Forty-four had proven histoplasmosis attributable to H. capsulatum var. capsulatum (n = 40) or H. capsulatum var. duboisii (n = 4) infections. The results of RT-qPCR were positive in 43 of 44 patients (97.7% sensitivity) in at least one specimen. Nine of 863 cases (99% specificity) were RT-qPCR positive and therefore classified as possible cases. RT-qPCR was positive in 13 of 30 (43.3%) blood samples tested in proven cases. A positive RT-qPCR result in blood was significantly associated with H. capsulatum var. capsulatum progressively disseminated histoplasmosis with a positive RT-qPCR result in 92.3% of the immunocompromised patients with disseminated disease. This new Histoplasma RT-qPCR assay enabling amplification of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum and H. capsulatum var. duboisii is highly sensitive and allows the diagnosis of histoplasmosis advantageously from blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

### Improved diagnosis of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis by combining antigen and antibody detection [^115jRqau]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis can be severe, especially following heavy inoculum exposure. Rapid diagnosis is critical and often possible by detection of antigen, but this test may be falsely negative in 17% of such cases. Antibody detection by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) may increase sensitivity and permit the measurement of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) classes of antibodies separately.

Methods

Microplates coated with Histoplasma antigen were used for testing of serum from patients with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis and controls in the MVista Histoplasma antibody EIA. Results for IgG and IgM were reported independently.

Results

IgG antibodies were detected in 87.5%, IgM antibodies in 67.5%, and IgG and/or IgM antibodies in 88.8% of patients with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis in this assay, while immunodiffusion, complement fixation, and antigen testing showed sensitivities of 55.0%, 73.1%, and 67.5%, respectively (n = 80). Combining antigen and antibody detection increased the sensitivity to 96.3%.

Conclusions

The MVista Histoplasma antibody EIA offers increased sensitivity over current antibody tests while also allowing separate detection of IgG and IgM antibodies and complementing antigen detection. Combining antigen and EIA antibody testing provides an optimal method for diagnosis of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1173zfRX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale and implementation considerations

Histoplasma antigen appears to be most useful in patients with high fungal burden (i.e. those with disseminated or acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, in whom antibody detection is not as reliable, especially early after the exposure and in those unable to mount an antibody response due to immunosuppression). Histoplasma antigen testing is available in specialized centers or through mail-in reference laboratories. Combining antibody and antigen testing further improves the diagnostic yield in pulmonary histoplasmosis. In addition to serum and urine, Histoplasma antigen can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid in Histoplasma meningitis and in BAL in pulmonary histoplasmosis.

In a hypothetical population of 1,000 random patients who reside in an endemic area with a prevalence of 10%, testing for Histoplasma antigen would yield 81 true-positive results, 19 false-negative results, 15 false-positive results, and 885 true-negative results, with a positive predictive value of 0.84 and a negative predictive value of 0.50. During a period of outbreak when the prevalence in the at-risk population can be as high as 25%, the yield would be 204 true positives, 46 false positives, 13 false positives, and 737 true negatives, with a positive predictive value of 0.94 and a negative predictive value of 0.50. However, a positive Histoplasma antigen in an immunocompromised patient with suspected histoplasmosis (0.5 pretest probability) would result in a posttest probability of 0.98, given the positive likelihood ratio of 43.2.

### Development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for detection of histoplasma capsulatum DNA in clinical samples [^112WpVGE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Improved methods for the detection of Histoplasma capsulatum are needed in regions with limited resources in which the organism is endemic, where delayed diagnosis of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) results in high mortality rates. We have investigated the use of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to facilitate rapid inexpensive molecular diagnosis of this disease. Primers for LAMP were designed to amplify the Hcp100 locus of H. capsulatum. The sensitivity and limit of detection were evaluated using DNA extracted from 91 clinical isolates of known geographic subspecies, while the assay specificity was determined using DNA extracted from 50 other fungi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Urine specimens (n = 6) collected from HIV-positive individuals with culture- and antigen-proven histoplasmosis were evaluated using the LAMP assay. Specimens from healthy persons (n = 10) without evidence of histoplasmosis were used as assay controls. The Hcp100 LAMP assay was 100% sensitive and specific when tested with DNA extracted from culture isolates. The median limit of detection was ≤ 6 genomes (range, 1 to 300 genomes) for all except one geographic subspecies. The LAMP assay detected Hcp100 in 67% of antigen-positive urine specimens (4/6 specimens), and results were negative for Hcp100 in all healthy control urine specimens. We have shown that the Hcp100 LAMP assay is a rapid affordable assay that can be used to expedite culture confirmation of H. capsulatum in regions in which PDH is endemic. Further, our results indicate proof of the concept that the assay can be used to detect Histoplasma DNA in urine. Further evaluation of this assay using body fluid samples from a larger patient population is warranted.

### NASPGHAN clinical report: surveillance, diagnosis, and prevention of infectious diseases in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors [^111TEc1a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Medium credibility.

Histoplasmosis — diagnostic testing and screening before anti-TNFα therapy are specified: If histoplasmosis is suspected, diagnostic testing should include evaluation of histopathology, fungal blood and tissue cultures, antigen detection in both urine and blood, and serologic testing, with the highest diagnostic sensitivity achieved when both urine and serum antigen testing are performed concomitantly; antigen testing can also be performed on BAL fluid. Diagnostic testing should include antibody testing by both complement fixation and immunodiffusion methods, and negative results do not eliminate histoplasmosis because both antigen tests and serology testing may be negative in the setting of active infection. At this time, there are no data to support routine screening with serologic testing or antigen detection, and risk factor assessment is encouraged before starting anti-TNFα therapy in all patients; if significant recent exposure or symptoms of active or recent (in the previous 2 years) histoplasmosis are elicited, additional testing may be recommended, including a chest radiograph. Patients with history, clinical, or laboratory findings suggestive of active histoplasmosis should receive antifungal therapy with itraconazole for ≥ 3 months before starting anti-TNFα therapy, and antifungal therapy should be continued for ≥ 1 year if anti-TNFα therapy must be used, with continued surveillance of symptoms and urinary antigen level monitoring (every 3 months and as clinically indicated).

Regarding medical management for histoplasmosis, more specifically with respect to management of asymptomatic pulmonary nodules, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to avoid initiating routine treatment for histoplasmosis to prevent reactivation in adult and pediatric patients with asymptomatic non-calcified pulmonary nodules related to histoplasmosis (histoplasmomas), with no evidence of other active sites, or in asymptomatic patients with known untreated prior infection.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113WNSJd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary of Recommendations

- In patients with severe immunocompromise, such as those with neutropenia or hematological malignancy or recipients of hematological stem cell or solid organ transplants presenting with unexplained lung infiltrates suspected of IPA, we recommend the use of serum GM testing (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
- In patients suspected of invasive fungal diseases, including those with a negative serum GM but strong risk factors for invasive aspergillosis or positive serum GM but confounding factors for false-positive GM results (e.g. those patients undergoing chemotherapy or at risk for mucositis, in which cross-reactive epitopes from other fungi or bacteria can penetrate the intestinal mucosa, causing positivity of the test), we recommend BAL testing with GM (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
- In patients with severe immunocompromise, such as those with hematological malignancy or recipients of hematological stem cell or solid organ transplants, who are suspected of having IPA, we recommend the use of blood or serum Aspergillus PCR testing (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
- In patients with severe immunocompromise, such as those with hematological malignancy or recipients of hematological stem cell or solid organ transplants who are suspected of having IPA, we recommend the inclusion of Aspergillus PCR in BAL testing as part of the evaluation (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
- In patients with severe immunocompromise, such as those with hematological malignancy or recipients of hematological stem cell or solid organ transplants who are strongly suspected of having IPA but in whom the result of PCR testing for Aspergillus is negative, we suggest consideration of biopsy and/or additional testing with or without additional PCR or GM testing (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).
- In critically ill patients in whom there is clinical concern for IC, we suggest not relying solely on results of serum BDG testing alone for diagnostic decision-making (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).
- We recommend the use of Histoplasma antigen in urine or serum for rapid diagnosis of suspected disseminated and acute pulmonary histoplasmosis when timely diagnosis and treatment are of paramount importance to outcome (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
- We suggest the use of Histoplasma serologies in immunocompetent patients with suspected pulmonary histoplasmosis. Adding Histoplasma antigen to serological testing might improve the diagnostic yield (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
- In patients with appropriate geographic exposure and illness compatible with infection or pneumonia due to blastomycosis, we suggest using more than one diagnostic test, including direct visualization and culture of sputum BAL or other biopsy material, urine antigen testing, and serum antibody testing. The current evidence cannot support a single best test as being sensitive enough to be ordered in isolation from other testing. The approach should be tailored on the basis of severity of illness, the clinical context, and the availability of tests (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
- In patients with suspected blastomycosis, we suggest that serum antibody testing specifically directed against the anti–BAD-1 (anti– Blastomyces adhesin 1) antigen for blastomycosis be used together with clinical and epidemiological data to establish the diagnosis (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).
- In patients with suspected blastomycosis, particularly in immunocompromised patients, we suggest that urinary antigen testing for blastomycosis be used together with clinical and epidemiological data to establish the diagnosis (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
- In patients with appropriate geographic exposure and illness compatible with infection or pneumonia due to coccidioidomycosis, we suggest using more than one diagnostic test, including direct visualization and culture of sputum BAL or other biopsy material, urine and serum antigen testing, and serology (serum antibody testing). The current evidence cannot support a single best test. The approach should be tailored on the basis of severity of illness, the clinical context, and the availability of tests (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
- In patients with suspected coccidioidomycosis, particularly in immunocompromised patients, we suggest performing urinary and serum antigen testing to aid in establishing the diagnosis (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
- In patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from the endemic area for coccidioidomycosis, we suggest initial serological testing with close clinical follow-up and serial testing (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Comparative performance of the laboratory assays used by a diagnostic laboratory hub for opportunistic infections in people living with HIV [^1162ZVhH]. AIDS (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated the comparative performance of different assays used in a Diagnostic Laboratory Hub that linked 13 HIV healthcare facilities for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis, and describing its functions in Guatemala compared with other National Reference Laboratories.

Methods

The following diagnostic techniques were analyzed in 24 months (2017–2018) in a cohort of patients with HIV: smear microscopy, mycobacterial and fungal cultures, isolator blood culture, PCR assays, and antigen detection tests.

Results

A total of 4245 patients were included, 716 (16.2%) had an opportunistic infection: 249 (34.7%) TB, 40 (5.6%) nontuberculous mycobacteria, 227 (31.7%) histoplasmosis, 138 (19.3%) cryptococcosis, and 62 (8.6%) had multiple opportunistic infections. Two hundred sixty-three [92.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 89–95.1] of TB cases were diagnosed by PCR. Urine antigen assay detected 94% (95% CI, 89–96) of the disseminated histoplasmosis cases. A lateral flow assay to detect cryptococcal antigen diagnosed 97% (95% CI, 93.3–98.7%) of the cryptococcal cases. In 85 patients (51.5%) with a cerobrospinal fluid sample, cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed in 55 (64.7%), of which 18 (32.7%) were only detected by cryptococcal antigen.

Conclusion

Validated commercial antigen tests, as used in this program, should be the new gold standard for histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis diagnosis. In their absence, 35% of disseminated histoplasmosis and 32.7% of cryptococcal meningitis cases would have been missed. Patients with multiple opportunistic infections were frequently diagnosed and strategies should be designed to screen patients irrespective of their clinical presentation. In low resource settings, Diagnostic Laboratory Hubs can deliver quality diagnostics services in record time at affordable prices.

Regarding medical management for histoplasmosis, more specifically with respect to management of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, mild-to-moderate, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer itraconazole as the preferred antifungal agent:

|Situation|Guidance|
|-|-|
|Adults|- 200 mg TID for 3 days, then 200 mg BID for 6–12 weeks|
|Children|- 5 mg/kg/dose (up to 200 mg/dose) TID for 3 days, then 5 mg/kg/dose BID (up to 400 mg daily) for 6–12 weeks|
|Super-bioavailable itraconazole for adults|- 130 mg TID for 3 days, then 130 mg BID for 6–12 weeks.|

### Improved diagnosis of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis by combining antigen and antibody detection [^114xusR4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis following heavy exposure is characterized by systemic and respiratory symptoms typically beginning 5 days to 3 weeks following exposure. Chest radiograph and/or computed tomographic scanning typically show diffuse interstitial and/or alveolar infiltrates, usually accompanied by hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The illness is often severe, and sometimes fatal.

The diagnosis of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis is often suspected when multiple individuals present with similar clinical findings following a common activity involving disturbance of a site contaminated with bird or bat guano. However, diagnosis becomes more complicated if the exposed individuals disperse and are unaware that others have similar illness, if a single individual is exposed, or if the individual was not directly involved in the activity that led to exposure. Once suspected, the diagnosis of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis can usually be established promptly by detection of antigen in the urine or serum. In one study, antigen was present in 83% of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis cases, but 38% would have been missed if only urine was tested. An antibody assay could assist in the diagnosis of cases with negative antigen results, especially those with mild to moderate disease.

### Disseminated histoplasmosis in persons with HIV / AIDS, Southern Brazil, 2010–2019 [^114zitWc]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

We evaluated disseminated histoplasmosis (DH) in HIV patients over 10 years in southern Brazil. The incidence was 12 cases/1,000 hospitalizations (2010–2019); the mortality rate was 35%. Tuberculosis frequently obscured the diagnosis of DH. We emphasize the need in our region to suspect and investigate DH using more sensitive methods.

### Disseminated histoplasmosis in persons with HIV / AIDS, Southern Brazil, 2010–2019 [^116XHgXe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Disseminated histoplasmosis (DH) is an AIDS-defining disease and one of the major causes of death in persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) (mortality rate ranging from 13% to 48%). DH is a neglected disease because of its nonspecific symptoms, frequent misdiagnosis as tuberculosis (TB), and limited access to sensitive diagnostic methods.

Worsening this scenario, an epidemic of AIDS is underway in Brazil; > 800,000 new cases have been diagnosed in recent decades. Therefore, efforts are necessary to understand the epidemiology of DH/AIDS co-infection in the areas to which these diseases are endemic. We evaluated the clinical and epidemiologic profile of patients with DH/AIDS co-infection in a reference service for PLHIV over 10 years in southern Brazil and compared the incidence in periods before and after an internal hospital improvement of DH investigation.

### Diagnostic value of culture and serological tests in the diagnosis of histoplasmosis in HIV and non-HIV Colombian patients [^112wmYDE]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2013). Low credibility.

We determined the value of culture and serological tests used to diagnose histoplasmosis. The medical records of 391 histoplasmosis patients were analyzed. Diagnosis of the mycosis was assessed by culture, complement fixation, and immunodiffusion tests; 310 patients (79.5%) were male, and 184 patients (47.1%) were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Positivity value for cultures was 35.7% (74/207), reactivity of serological tests was 95.2% (160/168), and a combination of both methodologies was 16.9% (35/207) for non-HIV patients. Positivity value for cultures was 75.0% (138/184), reactivity of serological tests was 92.4% (85/92), and a combination of both methodologies was 26.0% (48/184) for HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients; 48.1% (102/212) of extrapulmonary samples from HIV/AIDS patients yielded positive cultures compared with 23.1% (49/212) in non-HIV patients. Lymphocyte counts made for 33.1% (61/184) of HIV/AIDS patients showed a trend to low CD4+ numbers and higher proportion of positive cultures. These results indicate that culture is the most reliable fungal diagnostic method for HIV/AIDS patients, and contrary to what is generally believed, serological assays are useful for diagnosing histoplasmosis in these patients.

Table 3.
Key Infectious and Noninfectious Differential Diagnoses for Granulomatous Lesions within Commonly Biopsied Sites

Table 4.
Key Differential Diagnoses for Sarcoidosis within Individual Organ Systems

Tuberculosis (TB) and atypical mycobacterial infections can mimic sarcoidosis. These infections can be screened for by staining biopsies for acid-fast bacilli and latent TB infection can be detected by performing IFN-γ release assay testing or delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testing to TB antigens, as was previously recommended as a standard approach in patients with suspected sarcoidosis. It should be noted that false-negative IFN-γ release or skin test results can occur in those with acutely active forms of TB or sarcoidosis due to concurrent T-cell anergy; thus, negative test results should be interpreted with caution. When possible, sputum smear and culture for acid-fast bacilli and molecular testing for mycobacterial species is encouraged for patients residing in areas endemic for TB. Fungal infections (e.g. histoplasmosis) should also be considered in those with suspected sarcoidosis, including staining biopsies for fungal infections. Tissue culture, culture of BAL fluid, antigen detection in urine and/or blood, and serologic tests for fungal-specific antibodies may be used to confirm the diagnosis.

Histoplasma antigens

A recent meta-analysis examined the diagnostic yield of Histoplasma antigen. A total of nine studies were analyzed, including seven on urine antigen and six on serum antigen with a total of 1,029 cases and 2,195 controls. Disseminated histoplasmosis was the predominant diagnosis, followed by pulmonary histoplasmosis. All patients with the disseminated infection were immunocompromised. Overall, the sensitivity of Histoplasma antigen detection was 81.4% (95% CI, 79.1–83.5%), and the specificity was 98.3% (95% CI, 97.7–98.7%). The overall sensitivity was slightly higher for antigenemia (83.9%; 95% CI, 80.5–87%) than for antigenuria (79.5%; 95% CI, 76.3–82.4%). Specificities were comparable in serum and urine. On the basis of a positive likelihood ratio of 43.2 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.18, Histoplasma antigen was determined to be an excellent discriminator between healthy and ill individuals, with an odds ratio of 321 (95% CI, 118–875) and an area under the curve of 0.98.

Two additional studies of Histoplasma antigen met our inclusion criteria but were not included in this meta-analysis. Both studies examined patients with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis as part of outbreak investigations with significant overlap in their patient populations. Sensitivity of Histoplasma antigen was lower in these studies (64–68%) than in the meta-analysis. However, combining urine and serum antigen testing increased the sensitivity significantly to 93%. Similarly, combining antigen and antibody testing further increased the sensitivity to 96.3% in acute pulmonary histoplasmosis.

### Antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for diagnosis of fungal pneumonia [^111yFaub]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to describe important findings published during the past 18 months using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for diagnosis of pulmonary mycoses.

Recent Findings

Clinical studies and meta-analysis have established a high sensitivity and specificity for Aspergillus galactomannan testing of BAL specimens for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, superior to that observed with other diagnostic methods. Similar findings have been reported in histoplasmosis and blastomycosis.

Summary

Fungal antigen testing of BAL specimens is recommended if bronchoscopy is performed for diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in patient groups at risk for aspergillosis or the endemic mycoses if the diagnosis cannot be established by evaluation of sputum specimens or detection of antigen in the urine or serum.

### Histoplasmosis of the upper extremities: clinical case, treatment algorithm, and systematic review [^115fMc3o]. Hand (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Histoplasmosis of the upper extremities is extremely rare, and there is no consensus in its management. The aim of this study was to present a case report and literature review of histoplasmosis in the upper extremities to provide the best treatment recommendation and to increase awareness of this disease. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases with the search terms "(Tenosynovitis AND histoplasmosis)" OR "(Upper limbs AND histoplasmosis)" OR "(Upper extremities AND histoplasmosis)" OR "((finger OR arm OR hand OR forearm OR wrist) AND histoplasmosis)". Manuscripts were included in the study if they described diagnosis of histoplasmosis in the bone, joint, synovia, or tendons of the upper extremities. Results: In all, 14 manuscripts and 15 cases of histoplasmosis of the upper extremities from 1992 to 2015 met the inclusion criteria. Eight (53.3%) patients were diagnosed with tenosynovitis, 5 (33.3%) with osteomyelitis, 1 (6.7%) with carpal tunnel syndrome, and 1 (6.7%) with joint wrist abscess. Immunosuppression, travel history, previous diagnosis with histoplasmosis, and persistent symptoms may suggest infectious causes. Surgery and medical treatment together are recommended to optimize outcomes compared with single treatment alone. Conclusions: Histoplasmosis of the upper extremities may have various clinical presentations, including tenosynovitis, osteomyelitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and joint wrist abscess. The type of surgical approach may depend on the etiology of disease. Increased awareness and knowledge of the clinical signs, symptoms, and effective treatment modalities will help decrease possible complications, such as tendon rupture and functional impairment of the upper extremities.

### Pediatric histoplasmosis in an area of endemicity: a contemporary analysis [^115eAMU2]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Data on pediatric histoplasmosis have been limited to those from outbreak and case reports. We sought to evaluate the contemporary clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and outcomes in children with histoplasmosis living in an area of endemicity.

Methods

This study was a single-center retrospective review of proven and probable cases of histoplasmosis in children aged 0 to 18 years between April 2008 and April 2014. Case ascertainment was ensured by us using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes cross-referenced with laboratory, microbiology, and histopathology tests that detected Histoplasma capsulatum. Demographics, diagnostics, clinical management, and outcomes were evaluated.

Results

Seventy-three children with histoplasmosis (41 males; median age, 13 years [range, 3–18 years]) were diagnosed with proven (n = 17 [23%]) or probable (n = 56 [77%]) histoplasmosis, which manifested as pulmonary (n = 52 [71%]) or disseminated (n = 21 [29%]) disease. Symptoms at presentation were nonspecific; the examination of 21 (29%) patients revealed abnormal physical findings. Detection of H capsulatum by serologic methods occurred in 93% (63 of 68) of the patients tested. Histoplasma antigen in blood or urine was detected in 42% (20 of 48) and 28% (15 of 53) of the patients tested, respectively. The 16 (22%) patients who were immunocompromised had significantly higher rates of disseminated disease (56% vs 21%, respectively; p = 0.01), antigenuria (62% vs 18%, respectively; p = 0.004), and antigenemia (69% vs 31%, respectively; p = 0.02) and longer durations of antigenuria (403 vs 120 days, respectively; p = 0.003) and antigenemia (451 vs 149 days, respectively; P < .0001) than did the immunocompetent children.

Conclusions

Pediatric histoplasmosis manifests most frequently as pulmonary disease. The highest diagnostic yield was achieved when multiple diagnostic modalities were used. Presentation with disseminated disease and evidence of antigenemia, antigenuria, and delayed antigen clearance were more likely to be seen in immunocompromised children.

### Improved diagnosis of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis by combining antigen and antibody detection [^117G19Py]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The MVista antibody EIA offers advantages over the currently available tests for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. In this study, increased sensitivity compared to ID, CF, and antigen testing was shown. This result was demonstrated despite the requirement that patients have a positive result in at least 1 of those tests for inclusion in the study, which could potentially artificially inflate their sensitivities. In addition, this assay offers separate detection of IgG and IgM antibodies. This assay may aid in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, which can be difficult to diagnose due to false-negative results in antigen tests, ID, CF, and cytopathology and histopathology of respiratory specimens.

The MVista antibody EIA showed high sensitivity (88.8%) in this study. The sensitivity was 76.7% in the clinical cases, which is similar to that reported previously. The current study included cases that were identified during epidemiological investigations of large outbreaks. The sensitivity for detection of IgG or IgM antibody was 76.7% in clinical cases compared with 96.0% in the epidemiological cases. The difference in antibody sensitivity between these 2 groups can likely be attributed to the length of time between exposure and testing and perhaps the severity of infection. Patients exposed to a larger amount of inoculum may present for clinical care sooner, before antibody levels become detectable. Similarly, antigen sensitivity may also be influenced by exposure to a larger amount of inoculum, which likely causes more extensive pulmonary disease and a higher fungal burden, and thus higher antigen concentrations. The highest sensitivity was achieved by testing for antigen and IgG and IgM antibody — 96.3% overall, 90% for clinical cases, and 100% for epidemiological cases — emphasizing the importance of testing for both.

Positivity within healthy or clinical controls and patients with other mycoses occurs in most methods used for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. In this study, 2 control patients from the endemic area showed high IgG results. This is likely attributed to a recent but unrecognized infection within the past 1–2 years, as previous studies have shown background positivity rates by CF of up to 5%. Cross-reactivity in specimens from patients with blastomycosis was 20%, a significant improvement over antigen detection, where cross-reactivity is almost universal. Furthermore, positive results in patients with blastomycosis and coccidioidomycosis were all low, with unit values between 10.6 and 28.6, whereas 78.8% of patients with histoplasmosis had IgG or IgM levels > 30 units (Figure 2).

### Clinical overview of histoplasmosis… [^116w7sTN]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Common symptoms of histoplasmosis include fever, cough, and malaise and are typically self-limiting.
- Chronic disseminated and severe cases require antifungals. Histoplasmaantigen detection in urine and/or serum is one of the most sensitive diagnostic methods.
- Presumed Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome may be a long-term complication.
- Refer to CDC's algorithm to guide diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis Histoplasma antigen detection in urine or serum is the most widely used and most sensitive method. Other methods include antibody tests, culture, and microscopy. The most appropriate diagnostic test may depend on clinical manifestation and severity. Enzyme immunoassay typically performed on urine or serum but can also be used on cerebrospinal fluid or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Urine antigen testing may have the highest sensitivity of non-invasive diagnostic tests and the quickest turnaround.

Development of antibodies to Histoplasma can take 2 to 6 weeks. Antibody tests are not as useful as antigen detection tests for diagnosing acute histoplasmosis. This is especially true in immunosuppressed persons, who may not mount a strong immune response. However, antibody tests can be used in combination with antigen tests to increase sensitivity. Tests for the presence of H and M. These persist for months to years after the infection has resolved; precipitin bands; ~80% sensitivity. Complement-fixing antibodies may take up to 6 weeks to appear after infection. CF is more sensitive but less specific than immunodiffusion. Can be performed on tissue, blood, and other body fluids, but may take up to 6 weeks to become positive; most useful in the diagnosis of the severe forms of histoplasmosis. A commercially available DNA probe can be used to confirm.

For detection of budding yeast in tissue or body fluids. It has low sensitivity but can provide a quick proven diagnosis if positive. PCR for detection of Histoplasma directly from clinical specimens is not widely available; however, it can be performed on serum, tissue, or BAL fluid and is promising.

### Evaluating histoplasmosis… [^1132bvk6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Determining a work-related case of histoplasmosis can be difficult, but there are questions healthcare providers can ask to help.
- Providers should consider a histoplasmosis diagnosis for patients who report activities exposing them to soil with bird or bat droppings. Overview Healthcare providers should consider histoplasmosis as a diagnosis in patients with a compatible illness who have occupations or participate in activities exposing them to soil that contains bird or bat droppings. This is especially true in areas where Histoplasma is common. Determining a work-related case Determining whether a histoplasmosis case is work-related can be difficult if the case is not clearly associated with an outbreak. Healthcare providers should ask patients with histoplasmosis about their occupation, work activities, and other outdoor activities. In certain states, healthcare providers and laboratories must report histoplasmosis cases to public health authorities.

Collecting information about industry and occupation as part of routine public health surveillance for histoplasmosis is also important for identifying work-related histoplasmosis. Evaluation The most common way to test for histoplasmosis is taking a blood or urine sample and sending it to a laboratory for testing. These tests can detect Histoplasma antibodies or antigen. Other diagnosis methods include taking a sample of fluid from the patient's respiratory tract or a tissue biopsy to either:

- Examine under a microscope
- See if Histoplasmawill grow in culture from these samples Healthcare providers can also consider imaging tests such as chest x-rays or CT scans. Find more information about the specific types of tests for histoplasmosis at Information for Healthcare Professionals about Histoplasmosis.
