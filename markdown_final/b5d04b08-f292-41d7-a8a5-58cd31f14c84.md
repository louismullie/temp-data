## Question

Should people younger than 40 take statins

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether people younger than 40 years should take statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, and under what circumstances statins might be appropriate in this age group. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality guideline positions and whether they even address adults under 40. Then, I should verify the evidence gaps and why recommendations are limited in this age group. Next, I will examine the exceptions where statins are recommended regardless of age, such as severe hypercholesterolemia. After that, I should review special populations like people with HIV and diabetes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and outline what to do while the evidence remains insufficient for broad under‑40 recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the scope of authoritative recommendations. The USPSTF 2022 recommendation explicitly applies to adults aged 40 to 75 years and does not provide a recommendation for adults younger than 40, reflecting insufficient evidence for this age group, so I should not overextend those conclusions to under‑40 adults without justification [^115HRh7E] [^1153NaTP]. Similarly, the 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guideline emphasizes lifestyle and lifetime risk assessment for ages 20 to 39, reserving pharmacotherapy for select high‑risk phenotypes rather than routine statin use, which reinforces a conservative approach in younger adults [^116TMavT] [^115steWo].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for this gap. The USPSTF identifies determining the efficacy and safety of long‑term statin use in adults younger than 40 as a priority research need, underscoring that randomized outcome data are sparse in this group and that current risk tools like the Pooled Cohort Equations are not validated for under‑40 risk estimation, which limits evidence‑based thresholds for treatment decisions [^1153NaTP] [^117P6WJH]. I should double‑check that this validation concern is echoed by cardiology guidance; yes, ACC/AHA notes that 10‑year risk tools perform poorly in younger adults and that lifetime risk framing is preferred in 20 to 39, again arguing against routine statin initiation solely on a 10‑year risk basis in this age band [^116TMavT] [^117P6WJH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there are clear exceptions where statins are indicated regardless of age. I need to ensure I capture severe hypercholesterolemia correctly: ACC/AHA recommends high‑intensity statin therapy for adults aged 20 to 75 years with LDL‑C ≥ 190 mg/dL, and this age‑inclusive threshold means that adults under 40 with LDL‑C ≥ 190 mg/dL should start a high‑intensity statin after excluding secondary causes, typically representing familial hypercholesterolemia or other genetic dyslipidemias [^111QWr6D] [^111CzrrQ]. Let me reconsider whether any other age‑independent triggers exist; diabetes in younger adults can be a risk‑enhancing context, but formal statin recommendations still anchor to age 40 to 75 in most guidance, so under‑40 diabetes alone is not an automatic indication without additional high‑risk features or very high LDL‑C [^116DoW87].

> Next, I should review special populations where the under‑40 evidence base is evolving. In people with HIV, I initially thought REPRIEVE might have included adults under 40, but wait, I should verify the age range; REPRIEVE enrolled ages 40 to 75, so it cannot directly inform under‑40 decisions, and current HIV guidance states evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against statins in those under 40, favoring lifestyle modification and individualized consideration when HIV‑specific risk enhancers are present [^115ZXa3h] [^117DRocY]. I need to check whether any HIV panels suggest earlier use; some expert updates note that statins may be considered in select younger patients with strong risk enhancers, but this remains off‑label and evidence‑limited, reinforcing shared decision‑making rather than routine initiation under 40 [^111tBK7b].

> I will now examine diabetes as a special case. The ADA Standards of Care emphasize statin therapy beginning at age 40 to 75 and allow consideration of statins in younger adults with additional ASCVD risk factors, but there are no robust RCT outcome data for primary prevention statins specifically in 20 to 39‑year‑olds with diabetes, so decisions should be individualized and anchored in lifetime risk, LDL‑C severity, and family history rather than 10‑year risk alone [^116DoW87] [^117R4UBz]. Let me verify that this aligns with broader prevention guidance; yes, ACC/AHA similarly focuses pharmacotherapy for ages 40 to 75 and uses lifetime risk framing for 20 to 39, again avoiding blanket statin use under 40 without compelling risk enhancers [^116TMavT].

> But wait, what about lifetime risk modeling and long‑horizon benefit — could that justify earlier statins in some under‑40 adults with high LDL‑C? Modeling studies suggest that a long‑term benefit approach can identify younger individuals with high LDL‑C who accrue substantial expected absolute risk reduction over decades, yet these are modeling analyses and not randomized outcome trials, so they can inform discussion but should not override the current absence of direct outcome evidence in under‑40 cohorts [^1175ya2m]. I should confirm that guidelines still prioritize lifestyle and risk‑enhancer assessment in 20 to 39 rather than drug therapy; ACC/AHA does emphasize lifestyle and lifetime risk, with pharmacotherapy reserved for select high‑risk phenotypes, which is consistent with a cautious stance [^116TMavT].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach while staying evidence‑concordant. For adults under 40, the default should be aggressive lifestyle modification and periodic risk factor assessment every 4 to 6 years, with pharmacologic therapy considered only in exceptional circumstances such as LDL‑C ≥ 190 mg/dL, or in the presence of strong risk enhancers like long‑standing HIV with low CD4 nadir, or diabetes with multiple additional risk factors after a careful clinician‑patient discussion of uncertainty and long‑term risk [^116TMavT] [^115ZXa3h] [^116DoW87]. I should double‑check that this aligns with patient preference data; surveys show many patients require relatively high 10‑year risk thresholds before accepting statins, reinforcing shared decision‑making when benefits are uncertain in younger adults [^114CrXmX].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Routine statin therapy is not recommended for adults younger than 40 years for primary prevention because of insufficient evidence and lack of validated risk tools in this age group. However, high‑intensity statins are indicated for ages 20 and older with LDL‑C ≥ 190 mg/dL, and in select under‑40 patients with compelling risk enhancers, statins may be considered after shared decision‑making that acknowledges the evidence gap and emphasizes lifestyle as first‑line therapy [^115HRh7E] [^111QWr6D] [^116TMavT].

---

Routine statins are **not recommended for adults under 40** for primary prevention because of insufficient evidence of net benefit [^1153NaTP] and potential long-term harms [^1151kqFX]. Statins are only considered in **select high-risk cases** — such as familial hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL) [^111QWr6D], diabetes with additional risk factors [^116DoW87], or a very high lifetime ASCVD risk — after lifestyle therapy and shared decision-making [^116TMavT]. For most under 40, prioritize diet, exercise, and weight control [^115steWo]; use statins only when risk is clearly high and lifestyle has failed [^116TMavT].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

- **USPSTF 2022**: Recommends statins for adults 40–75 with ≥ 1 CVD risk factor and ≥ 10% 10-year risk; insufficient evidence for or against initiation in adults ≥ 76 [^113Sp72L] [^115HRh7E].
- **ACC/AHA 2019**: Emphasizes lifestyle and lifetime risk for ages 20–39; consider statins only for very high LDL-C (≥ 190 mg/dL) [^111QWr6D], diabetes with additional risk factors [^111QWr6D], or very high lifetime ASCVD risk.
- **ESC/EAS 2019**: Recommends statins for primary prevention in adults ≥ 40 with elevated LDL-C or high ASCVD risk; no routine recommendation for adults < 40.

---

## Evidence for statin use in adults under 40

- **Limited direct evidence**: Few RCTs include adults < 40, and those that do focus on high-risk groups (e.g. familial hypercholesterolemia) [^1153NaTP].
- **Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)**: High-intensity statins are recommended for LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL regardless of age due to high lifetime ASCVD risk [^115steWo].
- **Diabetes**: Consider statins in 20–39 with diabetes and additional risk factors after lifestyle therapy [^116DoW87].
- **Lifetime risk models**: May identify younger individuals with high long-term risk, but evidence for early statin initiation is limited [^1175ya2m].

---

## Potential benefits and risks

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **LDL-C lowering** — statins reduce LDL-C and may slow atherogenesis even in younger adults — and **long-term risk reduction**, as early initiation could theoretically lower lifetime ASCVD risk, though long-term data are limited [^1175ya2m].

---

### Risks

- **Adverse effects**: Myalgias, liver enzyme elevations, and rare myopathies; long-term safety in younger adults is uncertain [^115njx6s].
- **Diabetes risk**: Slightly increased risk of new-onset diabetes, particularly with high-intensity statins [^111tBK7b].
- **Psychological impact**: Labeling and long-term medication use may affect adherence and quality of life [^notfound].

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

Generic statins are inexpensive, but in low-risk younger adults the **absolute benefit is small** [^1176EN33], and the number needed to treat is high; therefore, cost-effectiveness is unfavorable unless lifetime risk is very high [^notfound].

---

## Alternative strategies for cardiovascular risk reduction

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Diet, exercise, weight control, and smoking cessation are first-line for adults under 40 [^115steWo].
- **Risk assessment**: Use lifetime risk models and consider family history, lipid levels, and diabetes to guide decisions [^1167FpAL].
- **Monitoring**: Reassess risk every 4–6 years and consider statins only if risk becomes high [^111Ksvaj].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| General population < 40 years | - Lifestyle therapy <br/> - No routine statins |
| LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (FH) | High-intensity statin regardless of age |
| Diabetes (20–39 years) | Consider statins if additional risk factors |
| Very high lifetime ASCVD risk | Consider statins after shared decision-making |

---

Routine statins are **not recommended for adults under 40** for primary prevention; reserve them for high-risk cases after lifestyle therapy and shared decision-making [^116TMavT].

### Statinopause [^115kh8SZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention. The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines represent a fundamental shift in how statins will be prescribed. The new guidelines recommend statins for nearly all older patients up to age 75 years, including healthy adults with low normal lipid levels and no atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors other than age. Under the 2013 guidelines, age becomes a main determinant for initiating statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults. Specifically, according to the new guidelines, white males aged 63–75, white females aged 71–75, African American males aged 66–75, and African American females aged 70–75 with optimal risk factors would be recommended for statin treatment for primary prevention. Based on the new guidelines, one could term these older adults as having "statin deficiency", a condition warranting statin treatment. We call this putative condition of age-related statin deficiency "statinopause". After careful examination of the trial evidence, we find very little support for the new recommendations for primary prevention. The lack of evidence underscores the need for clinical trials to determine the risks and benefits of statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults.

### Using age-and sex-specific risk thresholds to guide statin therapy: one size may not fit all [^116Jad8d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

New cholesterol guidelines emphasize 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) to identify adults eligible for statin therapy as primary prevention. Whether these CVD risk thresholds should be individualized by age and sex has not been explored.

Objectives

This study evaluated the potential impact of incorporating age- and sex-specific CVD risk thresholds into current cholesterol guidelines.

Methods

Using data from the Framingham Offspring Study, this study assessed current treatment recommendations among age- and sex-specific groups in 3,685 participants free of CVD. Then, it evaluated how varying age- and sex-specific 10-year CVD risk thresholds for statin treatment affect the sensitivity and specificity for incident 10-year CVD events.

Results

Basing statin therapy recommendations on a 10-year fixed risk threshold of 7.5% results in lower statin consideration among women than men (63% vs. 33%; p < 0.0001), yet most of the study participants who were 66 to 75 years of age were recommended for statin treatment (90.3%). The fixed 7.5% threshold had relatively low sensitivity for capturing 10-year events in younger women and men (40 to 55 years of age). Sensitivity of the recommendations was substantially improved when the treatment threshold was reduced to 5% in participants who were 40 to 55 years of age. Among older adults (66 to 75 years of age), specificity was poor, but when the treatment threshold was raised to 10% in women and 15% in men, specificity significantly improved, with minimal loss in sensitivity.

Conclusions

Cholesterol treatment recommendations could be improved by using individualized age- and sex-specific CVD risk thresholds.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113znMzi]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Background on statin use for ASCVD prevention in people with HIV indicates that findings from the Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV (REPRIEVE) have provided evidence to support specific recommendations for statin therapy as primary ASCVD prevention in people with HIV aged 40 to 75 years in the United States. The 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety Guidelines for the general population recommend statin therapy for all people at high 10-year ASCVD risk (defined as ≥ 20%), and for people at intermediate risk (i.e., ≥ 7.5% to < 20%) or borderline risk (i.e., 5% to < 7.5%), it is recommended to prescribe statin therapy based on shared decision-making. The AHA/ACC/Multisociety Guidelines identify HIV as a potential "risk enhancer" that should influence discussions on the use of statin therapy among those at borderline or intermediate risk, and prior to the REPRIEVE trial, no formal recommendations had been issued for people with HIV at low-to-intermediate ASCVD risk (i.e., < 20%).

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116iJYWW]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Statin therapy as primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in people with HIV — For those aged 40–75 years with 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%, the Panel recommends initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy (AI); recommended options are pitavastatin 4 mg once daily (AI), atorvastatin 20 mg once daily (AII), and rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily (AII). When 10-year ASCVD risk estimates are < 5%, the Panel favors initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy (CI), using the same options for moderate-intensity statin therapy as recommended for 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%. The absolute benefit from statin therapy is modest in this population; therefore, the decision to initiate a statin should take into account the presence or absence of HIV-related factors that can increase ASCVD risk. For people aged < 40 years, data are insufficient to recommend for or against statin therapy as primary prevention of ASCVD in people with HIV. Estimates are based on the ASCVD Risk Estimator from the American College of Cardiology (ACC).

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1133bjK4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Lipid abnormalities and cardiovascular risk — All patients with HIV should undergo atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment, and statin intensity is tied to risk thresholds and specific doses. High-intensity statins '(atorvastatin 40–80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg daily) are recommended for persons with a 10-year ASCVD risk above 20%', while 'at least moderate-intensity statins (specifically, pitavastatin 4 mg daily, atorvastatin 20 mg daily, and rosuvastatin 10 mg daily) are recommended for persons with HIV and at lower risk'.The document notes that 'there are no validated cardiovascular risk assessment tools for use in people with HIV, and the default is to use the pooled cohort equations from the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines', and, based on recent evidence, statin use is 'now recommended in people with HIV aged ≥ 40 years, assuming no known allergy to statins or other contraindications'

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115HpJdw]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) evidence assessment — The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit, and concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to less than 10% has at least a small net benefit; it concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

AHA/ACC 2018 cholesterol guideline — risk stratification and LDL-C reduction targets in primary prevention specify that adults 40 to 75 years can be classified as borderline risk (10-year ASCVD risk 5% to < 7.5%), intermediate-risk (7.5% to < 20%), and high-risk (≥ 20%); for intermediate-risk patients, moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy should be considered, and if a statin is given, LDL-C should be reduced by ≥ 30% and optimally by ≥ 50%. When uncertainty exists, CAC scoring is especially useful in older adults, and a CAC score of zero revises ASCVD risk downward and selects adults who show reduced benefit from starting a statin.

### Lifetime effects and cost-effectiveness of statin therapy for older people in the United kingdom: a modelling study [^112o3NEv]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Statins are widely available generically and a cornerstone in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. High-quality randomised evidence has shown that statins reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischaemic stroke by about one quarter for every 1 mmol/L reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). More intensive statin regimens achieve larger reductions in LDL-C and prevent more atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. However, there is less definitive evidence for statin benefit among older patients without CVD historyand guidelines stop short of making specific recommendations on initiating statins for primary CVD prevention in older people. Despite the growing proportion of older people (people ≥ 70 years old make up about 30% of those over the age of 40 years in the UK) and the markedly higher cardiovascular risk with increasing age, lower statin use is reported.

Evidence for treatments' long-term effects and cost-effectiveness guides healthcare decisions in many countries and healthcare systems, including in the UK. Such evidence ensures that by implementing cost-effective treatments, healthcare systems efficiently use their resources to maximise population health. Previous evidence has indicated that statin therapy is likely to be cost-effective for older people, but the estimates were sensitive to further adverse effects of statins or lower statin effectiveness. A recent individual participant data meta-analysis of large statin trials strengthened the evidence for efficacy and safety of statins in older people. Therefore, we set out to reassess the lifetime effects and cost-effectiveness of statin therapy in people ≥ 70 years old in the contemporary UK population, in categories by prior CVD, sex and LDL-C level, using this evidenceand a new UK CVD microsimulation model.

### A long-term benefit approach vs standard risk-based approaches for statin eligibility in primary prevention [^1175ya2m]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

A 10-year benefit-based approach to statin therapy in primary prevention includes younger individuals with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and prevents more cardiovascular events than a risk-based approach. However, a 10-year treatment duration likely underestimates the expected benefits of statins.

Objective

To model the impact of a 30-year benefit approach to select individuals for statin therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) data set included samples of the US population from the 2009–2010, 2011–2012, and 2013–2014 data collection cycles. Individuals between 40 to 60 years old who did not have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or LDL-C levels greater than 190 mg/dL and who were not taking statins were included. Data analysis took place from November 2017 to August 2018.

Exposures

We calculated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 10-year and 30-year absolute risk reduction (10-year ARR and 30-year ARR) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for each individual.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Number of individuals meeting eligibility for statins based on 10-year (atherosclerotic) cardiovascular disease risk, 10-year ARR, or 30-year ARR.

Results

A total of 1688 individuals were included, representing 56.6 million US individuals. Statin eligibility based on 7.5% CVR10 was 9.5%; based on 2.3% 10-year ARR, 13.0%, and based on 15% 30-year ARR, 17.5%. The 10-year risk, 10-year benefit, and 30-year benefit approaches all led to similar acceptable mean absolute risk reductions at 30 years, with the benefit-based approaches better able to avoid treatment of individuals with low expected benefit. Individuals who met statin eligibility based solely on the 30-year ARR threshold of 15% or greater were younger (mean age, 50 [95% CI, 48–52] years) and more likely to be women (43% [95% CI, 26%-59%]) than those recommended with a 10-year ARR threshold of 2.3% or greater (mean age, 56 [95% CI, 54–57] years; 22% [95% CI, 10%-34%] women). This group also had lower 10-year risk (mean risk, 4.7% [95% CI, 4.4%-5.1%]) and higher LDL-C levels (mean level, 149 mg/dL [95% CI, 142–155 mg/dL]) than those recommended with a 10-year ARR threshold of 2.3% or greater (mean risk, 9.3% [95% CI, 8.3%-10.2%]; mean LDL-C levels, 110 [103–118] mg/dL). Preventable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in 10 and 30 years were highest using the 30-year benefit approach (296 000 at 10 years and 2.03 million at 30 years) and lowest based on 10-year risk (204 000 at 10 years and 1.18 million at 30 years).

Conclusions and Relevance

A long-term benefit approach to statin eligibility identifies nearly 1 in 6 individuals as having a high degree of expected long-term benefit of statins, with a number needed to treat of less than 7. This approach identifies younger individuals with higher LDL-C levels who would not be currently recommended for treatment and may provide a more optimal approach for determining statin eligibility in primary prevention.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115FFUSv]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rationale — primary prevention statins in adults with risk factors: In adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (eg, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking), the USPSTF finds convincing evidence of benefit and concludes with moderate certainty that net benefit is at least moderate when the estimated 10-year CVD event risk is 10% or greater and at least small when risk is 7.5% to less than 10%. The USPSTF states that harms in adults 40 to 75 years are at most small and that evidence is inadequate for benefits and harms in adults 76 years or older; for the small-benefit group, it states the decision to initiate statin therapy should depend on individual patient preference. The USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms for adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111tBK7b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

HIV primary care — statin use thresholds, intensities, and REPRIEVE safety signal — Benefit rises with higher ASCVD risk, with the number needed to treat within 5 years decreasing from 130 and above for scores below 5% to 53 or lower for scores of 5% and above, and the recommendation for statin use is stronger for those with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 5% and higher. High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for those with risk greater than 20%, while at least moderate-intensity statin therapy is now recommended for those with lower risk, and statins may be considered in people with HIV younger than the REPRIEVE population (aged < 40 years) with additional risk factors. In REPRIEVE, a slightly higher risk of diabetes occurred with pitavastatin than placebo (6.0% vs 4.7%), and treatment-limiting grade 3 or higher muscle symptoms were seen in 2.3% of the pitavastatin group and 1.5% of the placebo group. High-intensity statins include atorvastatin 40–80 mg and rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, while moderate-intensity options include pitavastatin 4 mg, atorvastatin 10–20 mg, and rosuvastatin 10 mg (all taken daily), and caution should be used when prescribing statins with protease inhibitors (PIs), cobicistat, and some nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111KzxVa]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease risk management in diabetes — risk‑based statin therapy and LDL targets state that the evidence is strong for people with diabetes aged 40–75 years, and current guidelines recommend that in people with diabetes who are at higher cardiovascular risk, especially those with one or more ASCVD risk factors, high-intensity statin therapy should be prescribed to reduce LDL cholesterol by ≥ 50% from baseline and to achieve the recommended LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). Since baseline LDL cholesterol may be difficult to ascertain in practice, a focus on an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) rather than percent reduction in LDL cholesterol is recommended, and it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy if LDL goal is not achieved; while there are no randomized controlled trials specifically assessing cardiovascular outcomes of adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statin therapy in primary prevention, a meta-analysis suggests that there is a cardiovascular benefit of adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to treatment for people at high risk.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol guideline and implications for healthy people 2020 cardiovascular disease prevention goals [^116ZyzwG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

A prior analysis indicated that full implementation of the 2013 Cholesterol Guideline would prevent an additional ≈475 000 cardiovascular events over 10 years compared with full implementation of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP)‐3 Guideline. 9 A cost‐effectiveness analysis suggested that lowering the threshold for intervention from a 10‐year ASCVD risk (ASCVD 10) from ≥ 7.5% to ≥ 3.0% would prevent an additional 161 650 ASCVD events over 10 years and was cost effective, especially with low‐cost statins. 11 In both reports, only adults aged 40 to 75 years were included, and statins were assumed to reduce CHD by 25% and stroke by 17%, given a 39‐mg/dL reduction in low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C).

The 2013 Cholesterol Guideline extends to a broader age range than 40 to 75 years for adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) ≥ 190 mg/dL. 6 Moreover, the percentage and absolute reduction in LDL‐C are dose dependent with high‐intensity statins more effective than moderate‐intensity statins in reducing ASCVD, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 although adverse effects also increase. 16, 17, 18, 19 The current and previous cholesterol guidelines also identified a favorable risk:benefit ratio for statins in adults aged ≥ 75 years with clinical ASCVD. 6, 20, 21

Given the importance of ASCVD prevention, we examined the impact of implementing the 2013 Cholesterol Guideline on 2 key outcomes. One outcome was to estimate the number of ASCVD events that could be prevented in the United States by providing statins to currently untreated but statin‐eligible adults 21 to 79 years old. A second outcome was to calculate absolute risk reduction (ARR) and 10‐year number needed‐to‐treat (NNT) to prevent a major ASCVD event. This information is important for assessing clinical resource requirements and risk:benefit ratio. Study findings have potentially important implications for healthcare delivery, policy, and payment to enhance cardiovascular health promotion and disease prevention.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines recently published its 2018 recommendations on management of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in people with diabetes. For primary prevention, moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended for those aged 40–75 years, with a preference for high-intensity statin treatment for older subjects and for those with higher estimated risk or risk-enhancing factors following a patient-clinician discussion. Statin therapy may be reasonable in adults < 40 years or > 75 years of age where there is less evidence for benefit. For people with diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, high-intensity statin therapy is recommended. The majority of these subjects have very high risk, and an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is recommended. If this target is not achieved, ezetimibe and/or a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor may be added.

### Comparing eligibility for statin therapy for primary prevention under 2022 USPSTF recommendations and the 2018 AHA / ACC / multi-society guideline recommendations: from national health and nutrition examination survey [^115mjdgd]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The United States Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF) recently released recommendations for statin therapy eligibility for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We report the proportion and the absolute number of US adults who would be eligible for statin therapy under these recommendations and compare them with the previously published 2018 American Heart Association (AHA)/ American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ Multisociety (MS) Cholesterol guidelines.

Methods

We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–2020 of adults aged 40–75 years without prevalent self-reported atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol < 190 mg/dL. The 2022 USPSTF recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥ 10% and ≥ 1 CVD risk factor (diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or smoking). The 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guideline recommends considering statin therapy for primary prevention for those with diabetes mellitus, or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20% or 10-year ASCVD risk 7.5 to < 20% after accounting for risk-enhancers and shared decision making. Survey recommended weights were used to project these proportions to national estimates.

Results

Among 1799 participants eligible for this study, the weighted mean age was 56.0 ± 0.5 years, with 53.0% women (95% confidence interval [CI] 49.7, 56.3), and 10.6% self-reported NH Black individuals (95% CI 7.7, 14.3). The weighted mean 10-year ASCVD risk was 9.6 ± 0.3%. The 2022 USPSTF recommendations and the 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guidelines indicated eligibility for statin therapy in 31.8% (95% CI 28.6, 35.1) and 46.8% (95% CI 43.0, 50.5) adults, respectively. These represent 33.7 million (95% CI 30.4, 37.2) and 49.7 million (95% CI 45.7, 53.7) adults, respectively. For those with diabetes mellitus, 2022 USPSTF recommended statin therapy in 63.0% (95% CI 52.1, 72.7) adults as compared with all adults with diabetes aged 40–75 years under the 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guidelines.

Conclusion

In this analysis of the nationally representative US population from 2017 to 2020, approximately 15% (~16.0 million) fewer adults were eligible for statin therapy for primary prevention under the 2022 USPSTF recommendations as compared to the 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guideline.

### Cholesterol management: ACC / AHA updates guideline… [^114mpP3Y]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

- Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus.
- Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. SEVERE HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended for patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg per dL or greater. DIABETES MELLITUS Based on high-quality evidence from RCTs, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for all patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus. High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin. A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended. Selected Moderate-Strength Recommendations Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, the addition of nonstatin drug therapy should be considered at a threshold LDL-C level of at least 70 mg per dL on maximal statin therapy in patients with ASCVD at very high risk. Moderate-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years without diabetes who have a 10-year risk of 7. 5% to
19. 9% and risk-enhancing factors start or intensify statin therapy. If the CAC score is zero, statin therapy should be withheld or delayed unless the patient is a cigarette smoker, has diabetes, or has a strong family history of premature ASCVD. A CAC score of 1 to 99 suggests statin therapy, particularly for patients 55 years and older.

If the CAC score is 100 or greater or in the 75th percentile or greater, statin therapy is indicated for any patient unless otherwise deferred by the outcome of the physician–patient risk discussion.

### Evaluation and treatment of older patients with hypercholesterolemia: a clinical review [^114st4NK]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypercholesterolemia is common among people older than 80 years. Substantial functional heterogeneity exists among older patients, and decision making for statin use differs in older patients relative to younger ones.

Objective

To discuss the presentation, modifying factors, and treatment of hypercholesterolemia (usually with statins) among persons older than 80 years.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE and other sources were searched from January 1990 to June 2014. Personal libraries and a hand search of reference lists from guidelines and reviews from January 2000 to June 2014 were also used.

Findings

No randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of statin or any other hypocholesterolemic medication included persons older than 80 years at baseline. Findings from 75- to 80-year-old patients enrolled in RCTs and information from observational studies support statin treatment for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and probably in patients with diabetes without ASCVD. Harms from statin drugs are not increased in older patients, so the use of these agents for primary prevention is possible. Because people older than 80 years are biologically heterogeneous with varying life expectancy, may have frailty or comorbid conditions, and may take multiple medications, the decision to treat with statins must be individualized.

Conclusions and Relevance

Ideally, treatment of hypercholesterolemia for patients at risk of ASCVD should start before they turn 80 years old. No RCT evidence exists to guide statin initiation after age 80 years. Decisions to use statins in older individuals are made individually and are not supported by high-quality evidence.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^1167FpAL]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk (2019 ACC/AHA) — For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of ASCVD by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10‑year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk‑enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (eg, statin therapy). In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10‑year ASCVD risk) or selected adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10‑year ASCVD risk), if risk‑based decisions for preventive interventions (eg, statin therapy) remain uncertain, it is reasonable to measure a coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician–patient risk discussion. For adults 20 to 39 years of age and for those 40 to 59 years of age who have < 7.5% 10‑year ASCVD risk, estimating lifetime or 30‑year ASCVD risk may be considered; among those at borderline (5% to < 7.5%) and intermediate (≥ 7.5% to < 20%) risk, further testing to document subclinical coronary atherosclerosis is reasonable to more accurately reclassify the risk estimate upward or downward.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1176EN33]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Risk–benefit gradient and patient discussion — The likelihood that a patient will benefit from statin use depends on their absolute risk of having a future CVD event, the higher a person's 10-year risk of a CVD event, the greater the chance of benefit from statin use, and thus the expected benefit of statin therapy for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater exceeds the expected benefit for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%; clinicians should discuss with patients the potential risk of having a CVD event and the expected benefits and harms of statin therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Primary prevention — adult risk categories, statins, and coronary artery calcium (CAC): Three higher-risk categories are severe hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and adults 40 to 75 years; patients with severe hypercholesterolemia or diabetes mellitus aged 40 to 75 years are candidates for immediate statin therapy without further risk assessment, and adults with diabetes mellitus should start with a moderate-intensity statin with possible escalation to high-intensity as risk factors accrue. In other adults 40 to 75 years, 10-year ASCVD risk should guide therapy; when risk is uncertain or statin therapy is problematic, measuring CAC can help refine risk, and a CAC score equal to zero is useful for reclassifying to lower risk, often allowing statin therapy to be withheld or postponed unless higher risk conditions are present. For patients > 75 years, RCT evidence for statins is not strong, necessitating clinician-patient risk discussion to decide on initiation or continuation.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### Primary prevention with statins in the Elderly [^112EBHgP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in high-income countries is mostly borne by the elderly. With increasing life expectancy, clear guidance on sensible use of statin therapy to prevent a first and potentially devastating ASCVD event is critically important to ensure a healthy aging population. Since 2013, 5 major North American and European guidelines on statin use in primary prevention of ASCVD have been released by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society. Guidance on using statin therapy in primary ASCVD prevention in the growing elderly population (> 65 years of age) differs markedly. The authors discuss the discrepant recommendations, place them into the context of available evidence, and identify circumstances in which uncertainty may hamper the appropriate use of statins in the elderly.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive evidence in older adults: An RCT enrolling 5 084 men and women 70 to 82 years of age showed no benefit from pravastatin 40 mg/d versus placebo in the primary-prevention subgroup. Another RCT using pravastatin 40 mg per day versus usual care in older adults showed no statin benefit but had concerns about adherence and drop-in statin therapy in the usual-care arm. A meta-analysis combining JUPITER and HOPE-3 in those ≥ 70 years of age showed a statistically significant 26% RRR for nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death, and a prospective cohort of healthy older patients (age ≥ 70 years) who used statins showed significantly lower risk of death but nonsignificant cardiovascular event reduction. Clinician–patient discussion of risk versus benefit remains particularly important with inconsistent support and few data for adults > 80 years of age, and statins may be indicated, if after a clinician–patient discussion, the potential for benefit is thought to outweigh the risks of adverse effects, drug–drug interactions, and cost.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115RDxGq]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — statin primary prevention recommendations state that the USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater; the USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for adults aged 40 to 75 years with 1 or more CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 7.5% to less than 10%, noting that the likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater; and for adults 76 years or older the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality.

### Application of new cholesterol guidelines to a population-based sample [^115F1cN3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

The 2013 guidelines of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC-AHA) for the treatment of cholesterol expand the indications for statin therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Methods

Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys of 2005 to 2010, we estimated the number, and summarized the risk-factor profile, of persons for whom statin therapy would be recommended (i.e., eligible persons) under the new ACC-AHA guidelines, as compared with the guidelines of the Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program, and extrapolated the results to a population of 115.4 million U.S. adults between the ages of 40 and 75 years.

Results

As compared with the ATP-III guidelines, the new guidelines would increase the number of U.S. adults receiving or eligible for statin therapy from 43.2 million (37.5%) to 56.0 million (48.6%). Most of this increase in numbers (10.4 million of 12.8 million) would occur among adults without cardiovascular disease. Among adults between the ages of 60 and 75 years without cardiovascular disease who are not receiving statin therapy, the percentage who would be eligible for such therapy would increase from 30.4% to 87.4% among men and from 21.2% to 53.6% among women. This effect would be driven largely by an increased number of adults who would be classified solely on the basis of their 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event. Those who would be newly eligible for statin therapy include more men than women and persons with a higher blood pressure but a markedly lower level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. As compared with the ATP-III guidelines, the new guidelines would recommend statin therapy for more adults who would be expected to have future cardiovascular events (higher sensitivity) but would also include many adults who would not have future events (lower specificity).

Conclusions

The new ACC-AHA guidelines for the management of cholesterol would increase the number of adults who would be eligible for statin therapy by 12.8 million, with the increase seen mostly among older adults without cardiovascular disease. (Funded by the Duke Clinical Research Institute and others.).

### Sex differences in the intensity of statin prescriptions at initiation in a primary care setting [^11524Kz8]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) provide similar recommendations for the use of statins in both women and men. In this study, we assessed sex differences in the intensity of statin prescriptions at initiation and in the achievement of treatment targets, among individuals without and with CVD, in a primary care setting.

Methods

Electronic health record data from statin users were extracted from the PHARMO Data Network. Poisson regressions were used to investigate sex differences in statin intensity and in the achievement of treatment targets. Analyses were stratified by age group, disease status and/or CVD risk category.

Results

We included 82714 individuals (46%women) aged 40–99 years old. In both sexes, the proportion of individuals with a dispensed prescription for high-intensity statin at initiation increased between 2011 and 2020. Women were less likely to be prescribed high-intensity statins as compared with men, both in the subgroups without a history of CVD (risk ratio (RR) 0.69 (95% CI: 0.63 to 0.75)) and with CVD (RR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.74 to 0.81)). Women were less likely than men to achieve target levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol following statin initiation in the subgroup without CVD (RR 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.00)) and with a history of CVD (RR 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89 to 0.98)).

Conclusion

Compared with men, women were less likely to be prescribed high-intensity statins at initiation and to achieve treatment targets, both in people without and with a history of CVD, and independent of differences in other individual and clinical characteristics.

Other major guideline documents — older patients: The 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline includes different treatment regimens for individuals > 75 years of age compared to younger persons, recommending moderate intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in those > 75 years versus high intensity in younger individuals, using the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations and provider–patient discussion for primary prevention without a specific intensity recommendation for those > 75 years. The International Atherosclerosis Society recommends for persons > 65 years the use of short-term (10-year) Framingham risk scoring (recalibrated for country) to estimate CHD risk and elevation of the estimated value by 1/3 to estimate total ASCVD risk, suggesting statins for moderately-high or high estimated risk while considering polypharmacy, drug–drug interactions, and cost. The European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology advocate secondary prevention in the same manner as in younger patients (class I, level of evidence B), starting at low dosage and titrating to the same targets (class I, level of evidence C), and recommend primary prevention for those with 1 or more additional risk factors aside from age (class IIb, level of evidence B). The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends statins without specific upper age cutoffs for secondary prevention and, for primary prevention, 10-year Framingham scoring for men ages 40–75 years and for women ages 50–75 years.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk — recommendations for adults. For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk-enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (e.g., statin therapy). In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) or selected adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), if risk-based decisions for preventive interventions remain uncertain, it is reasonable to measure a coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician–patient risk discussion. For adults 20 to 39 years of age and for those 40 to 59 years of age who have < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk, estimating lifetime or 30-year ASCVD risk may be considered.

Research needs and gaps — Priority evidence gaps include determining the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins for primary prevention in adults 76 years or older; establishing the efficacy and safety of long-term statin use in adults younger than 40 years and the effects of earlier vs delayed initiation in persons with an estimated high long-term (longer than 10 years, lifetime) risk of CVD; conducting trials that directly compare titration to target lipid levels vs fixed-dose therapy and higher- vs lower-intensity statins powered for clinical outcomes; definitively determining whether statin therapy is associated with increased risk of diabetes in primary prevention populations; and clarifying the role of patient preferences across the spectrum of CVD risk.

### CVD risk, patient age factor into statin recommendation… [^114V988p]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

September 12, 2022, 1: 25 p. m. News Staff — People ages 40 to 75 at high risk for cardiovascular disease should initiate statin use to prevent a heart attack or stroke, while those in the same age range at increased risk for CVD should consult a family physician or other primary care clinician to determine whether taking a statin is appropriate, according to an updated recommendation from the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. The update, which contains three recommendations overall, also says more research is needed to determine whether people 76 or older should start taking a statin for CVD prevention. The AAFP is reviewing the final recommendation statement, final evidence review and evidence summary, which were released Aug. 23, to determine the Academy's stance. The recommendation statement is generally consistent with the task force's 2016 recommendation on the topic.

"Statins effectively and safely prevent first heart attacks and strokes for some people, " task force member John Wong, M. D., said in a USPSTF bulletin. "Whether someone should start taking a statin depends on their age and their risk for having a first heart attack or stroke. " The recommendations apply to adults 40 or older with no history, sign or symptom of CVD who are not already taking statins. They do. Adults ages 40 to 75 were considered at high risk if they had any CVD risk factor and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater, and at increased risk if they had any CVD risk factor and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7. 5% to less than 10%. The task force found that in adults at increased risk but with no history of CVD events, statin therapy significantly reduced the risk of clinical outcomes such as stroke or heart attack by 22% to 33%, while also significantly reducing the risks of all-cause mortality and composite cardiovascular outcomes.

Statin use also was found to reduce the risk for cardiovascular mortality, although this association was not statistically significant. Overall, statin therapy appeared to benefit a wide range of demographic and clinical populations, and was not significantly associated with increased risk of serious adverse events or diabetes. The task force responded to comments on drafts by clarifying language on the use of coronary artery calcium scores to determine statin use and emphasizing the need for more research to improve CVD risk prediction in all racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups.

### Effectiveness of statins as primary prevention in people with different cardiovascular risk: a population-based cohort study [^114ZfXdR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Study Highlights

New guidelines to manage dyslipidemia recommend individualized prevention measures to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and focus on two benefit groups: first, secondary prevention patients, diabetics, and patients with one or more cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, or smoking) or with chronic kidney disease; and second, individuals with 10‐year cardiovascular risk estimates. 1, 2, 3, 4 These guidelines have lowered the estimated 10‐year cardiovascular risk threshold to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. In primary prevention, European guidelines recommend treatment in individuals with 5% or higher risk on the SCORE 10‐year fatal cardiovascular risk chart and in those with low (< 5%) risk and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels between 2.6 and 4 mmol/L. 4 US guidelines recommend treatment for individuals aged 40–75 years with 10‐year risk scores 7.5%; each guide, however, with different levels of evidence. 1, 2 In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests statin treatment in primary prevention for people with 10% risk. 3 The definition of high cardiovascular risk varies across guidelines and depends on the risk function used, the endpoints considered, the reference population, and the presence of comorbidities. These recommendations are based on the results from previous meta‐analyses 5, 6 and recent clinical trials, 7 which show that the efficacy of statins is similar in high and intermediate cardiovascular risk populations.

These threshold recommendations are controversial for several reasons. First, the population eligible for lifetime statin therapy would increase substantially. Second, the focus is on relative rather than absolute risk reduction. 8, 9, 10 Finally, the randomization of the clinical trials upon which the guidelines are based did not take baseline cardiovascular risk into account.

As participants in clinical trials may not represent the general population because specific groups (statin‐intolerant or poorly adherent, diabetics, women, young people) are often excluded, 11 data from electronic medical records can be used to provide population‐based evidence for cardiovascular risk management decisions and to evaluate treatment effectiveness in real‐life clinical conditions. 12

The aim of the present study was to analyze the effectiveness of statins in a general population according to their coronary risk estimation.

ACC/AHA primary prevention — age-focused synopsis states that young adults 20 to 39 years should prioritize estimating lifetime risk and healthy lifestyle, with drug therapy only for select patients with moderately high LDL-C (≥ 160 mg/dL) or very high LDL-C (≥ 190 mg/dL); adults 40 to 75 years should use 10-year ASCVD risk to guide therapy; and for patients > 75 years, assessment of risk status and a clinician–patient risk discussion determine whether to continue or initiate statin treatment.

### Statins in primary prevention in people over 80 years [^116rdehk]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the much older population (≥ 80 years), the management of cardiovascular diseases requires specific research to avoid a plain transposition of medical practice from younger populations. Whether statins are useful in primary prevention in this population is not clear. The 3 intricate issues requiring attention are (1) the impact of hypercholesterolemia on mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in subjects > 80 years, (2) the efficacy of statins to prevent cardiovascular events at this age, and (3) the safety and tolerance of statins in this population. Three systematic reviews were performed using a search on EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases including publication until January 2021. Among the 7,617 references identified, 29 were finally retained. Regarding the first objective (16 studies, 121,250 participants), 7 studies (10,241 participants) did not find total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels associated with an increased rate of major cardiovascular events in octogenarians. A total of 6 studies (14,493 participants) found increased levels associated with events, whereas 3 studies (96,516 participants) found the opposite, with increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events with lower levels of cholesterol. In 8 studies (436,005 participants) addressing the efficacy of statins, most did not indicate a significant decrease in the rate of major cardiovascular events in these subjects. Finally, regarding tolerance (9 studies, 217,088 participants), the most important side effects in this population were muscular, hepatic, and gastrointestinal disorders. These events were more frequent than in the younger population. In conclusion, in the absence of convincing evidence, the benefit of statins in primary prevention for much older patients is not certain. Their prescription in this setting should only be considered case by case, taking into consideration physiological status, co-morbidities, level of risk, and expected life expectancy. Specific trials are mandatory.

Regarding preventative measures for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to statin therapy, USPSTF 2022 guidelines recommend to consider initiating statins for primary prevention of CVDs in selected 40–75 years old adults with ≥ 1 CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5–10%.

4.5 Statin eligibility

Nearly half of the individuals in the present analysis were classified as statin not recommended according to the 2019 ACC/AHA 2019 guidelines. The most common reason for this classification was a 10‐year ASCVD risk < 5% (29%), followed by age < 40 without risk enhancers (11%), and a 10‐year ASCVD risk of 5%–7.5% without risk enhancers (6.5%). Over half of the individuals in the present analysis were classified as statin not recommended according to the 2022 USPSTF guidelines for either a 10‐year ASCVD risk < 7.5% (47.1%) or age < 40 (11.5%). The ACC/AHA 2019 guidelines were better able to classify high‐risk individuals by implementing a lower 10‐year ASCVD risk threshold to consider statin initiation (5% vs. 7.5%), a lower LDL‐C threshold to consider statin initiation (160 vs. 190 mg/dL) and by incorporating an early family history of CAD as a risk enhancer.

Both guidelines rely on the PCE to calculate baseline 10‐year ASCVD risk, which is likely poorly calibrated for younger individuals, driving the underclassification of ASCVD risk in this cohort. The Partners Young‐MI registry examined statin eligibility according to the 2013 ACC/AHA and the 2016 USPSTF guidelines with similar findings with 52% and 71% of the cohort classified as statin not recommended.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114zkBRW]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF assessment of magnitude of net benefit — The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit; with an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% has at least a small net benefit and the decision to initiate therapy should depend on individual patient preference; and in adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms.

### Recommendations for (discontinuation of) statin treatment in older adults: review of guidelines [^115128CK]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Up to the age of approximately 75 years, the effectiveness of cardiovascular preventive medication is undisputed and, together with lifestyle interventions, significantly reduces the impact of cardiovascular disease. 1, 2, 3 Also, for vital adults aged 75 to 85 years, there is evidence that the benefits of statins generally outweigh the risks, especially in secondary prevention. 4, 5 However, when confronted with declining health status and the development of complex health problems, the use of preventive medications with long‐term effects might become of questionable benefit; on the one hand, treatment priorities shift and life expectancy shortens, while on the other hand, the risks of adverse effects increase due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, polypharmacy, and multimorbidity, 6, 7, 8, 9 especially in old age. These risks can be influenced positively by decreasing medication prescriptions. In addition, high‐quality evidence is not yet available for either primary or secondary statin‐based prevention in people aged 85 years and older or in those with complex health problems (as they are currently excluded from trials). 10 In a recent meta‐analysis of the efficacy and safety of statins for primary cardiovascular disease prevention in older adults, which included data from 28 trials, only 8% of all patients were aged older than 75 years at enrollment. 5 As statins are one of the most commonly used drugs in the older population, with a prevalence ranging between 18% and 45%, 11, 12 with concerns about the benefits, they have been identified as possible candidates for deprescribing (the process of tapering or stopping inappropriate medication) by both clinicians and patients. 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 In a modified Delphi approach, physicians, pharmacists, and nurses prioritized statins in the top three of a list of medication classes where evidence‐based deprescribing guidelines would be of benefit to clinicians because of concerns about benefit given the lack of older patients in trials, the lack of clarity around ongoing indication and when they can be stopped, as well as an emerging recognition of adverse effects and overtreatment of low‐risk patients. 14

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112koD5g]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC/Multisociety cholesterol prevention thresholds — general population guidance applicable to people with HIV — state that statins are recommended for high-risk adults defined as ages 40 to 75 years with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimate of ≥ 20%, and for ages 20 to 75 years with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL; in this setting an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% should be achieved, which typically requires high-intensity statin therapy, and for diabetes mellitus the guidelines recommend at least a moderate-intensity statin with additional risk assessment to inform consideration of initiating a high-intensity statin; these general population guidelines should inform the management of people with HIV who meet these criteria.

Primary prevention — age- and condition-specific branches identify additional statin pathways. Pediatric prevention emphasizes "Age 0–19 Lifestyle to prevent or reduce ASCVD". For young adults, "Age 20–39 y" advises to "Estimate lifetime risk to encourage lifestyle to reduce ASCVD risk" and to "Consider statin if family history premature ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.1 mmol/L)". Very high LDL-C is addressed with "LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) No risk assessment; High-intensity statin (Class I)". Older adults follow "Age > 75 y Clinical assessment, Risk discussion". For diabetes at ages "40–75 y", guidance states "Moderate-intensity statin (Class I)" and "Risk assessment to consider high-intensity statin (Class IIa)".

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1152jSna]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Statin therapy recommendations and risk considerations in people with HIV aged 40 to 75 years — The Panel's decision to recommend the use of at least moderate‑intensity statin therapy includes a strong recommendation for those with a 10‑year ASCVD risk score ≥ 5% to < 20% (AI). For those aged 40 to 75 years with low estimated ASCVD risk (< 5%), additional HIV‑related factors may be important to consider, and the Panel favors initiating at least moderate‑intensity statin therapy for those with a 10‑year ASCVD risk score < 5% (CI). Risk‑enhancing factors include history of prolonged HIV viremia and/or delayed ART initiation, low current or nadir CD4 count (< 350 cells/mm3), HIV treatment failure or nonadherence, and lipodystrophy/lipoatrophy, while people initiating ART at higher CD4 counts (e.g., > 500 cells/mm3) are likely to be at lower absolute ASCVD risk. Shared decision‑making should take into account the benefits along with side effects, costs, drug–drug interaction potential, and other patient‑centered factors, and for people at low (< 5%) 10‑year ASCVD risk it is particularly important to weigh potential benefits against risks.

### Lifetime cost effectiveness of simvastatin in a range of risk groups and age groups derived from a randomised trial of 20, 536 people [^115K8Wwd]. BMJ (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the cost effectiveness of 40 mg simvastatin daily continued for life in people of different ages with differing risks of vascular disease.

Design

A model developed from a randomised trial was used to estimate lifetime risks of vascular events and costs of treatment and hospital admissions in the United Kingdom.

Setting

69 hospitals in the UK.

Participants

20,536 men and women (aged 40–80) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes.

Interventions

40 mg simvastatin daily versus placebo for an average of 5 years.

Main Outcome Measures

Cost effectiveness of 40 mg simvastatin daily expressed as additional cost per life year gained. Major vascular event defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary disease, any stroke, or revascularisation procedure. Results were extrapolated to younger and older age groups at lower risk of vascular disease than were studied directly, as well as to lifetime treatment.

Results

At the April 2005 UK price of 4.87 pounds sterling (7 euros; 9 dollars) per 28 day pack of generic 40 mg simvastatin, lifetime treatment was cost saving in most age groups and vascular disease risk groups studied directly. Gains in life expectancy and cost savings decreased with increasing age and with decreasing risk of vascular disease. People aged 40–49 with 5 year risks of major vascular events of 42% and 12% at start of treatment gained 2.49 and 1.67 life years, respectively. Treatment with statins remained cost saving or cost less than 2500 pounds sterling per life year gained in people as young as 35 years or as old as 85 with 5 year risks of a major vascular event as low as 5% at the start of treatment.

Conclusions

Treatment with statins is cost effective in a wider population than is routinely treated at present.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1154zz9h]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in older people with HIV — People with HIV have about a twofold higher ASCVD risk and are diagnosed about a decade younger than people without HIV; ASCVD risk prediction tools for the general population tend to underestimate risk, and the relative increase is greater among women with HIV than age-matched men with HIV. In the general population, statin therapy is recommended for all people at high 10-year ASCVD risk (defined as ≥ 20%). For people with HIV, recent REPRIEVE trial findings provided evidence for statin primary prevention at low-to-intermediate ASCVD risk (i.e., < 20%); in those aged 40 to 75 years on antiretroviral therapy (ART), pitavastatin 4 mg daily was associated with a 35% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events over a median follow-up of 5 years. Results from REPRIEVE informed the Panel's recommendation on the use of at least moderate-intensity statin therapy as primary prevention among people with HIV age 40 to 75 years, with a stronger recommendation for those with ASCVD risk score ≥ 5%.

### Statin wars: have we been misled about the evidence? A narrative review [^117Jpx93]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Statins are the most widely prescribed, cholesterol-lowering drugs in the world. Despite the expiration of their patents, revenue for statins is expected to rise, with total sales on track to reach an estimated US$1trillion by 2020. A bitter dispute has erupted among doctors over suggestions that statins should be prescribed to millions of healthy people at low risk of heart disease. There are concerns that the benefits have been exaggerated and the risks have been underplayed. Also, the raw data on the efficacy and safety of statins are being kept secret and have not been subjected to scrutiny by other scientists. This lack of transparency has led to an erosion of public confidence. Doctors and patients are being misled about the true benefits and harms of statins, and it is now a matter of urgency that the raw data from the clinical trials are released.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^112K9zq7]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated dyslipidemia in pediatric patients — monitoring and management recommendations include the following: Repeat fasting lipid profile (FLP) 4 weeks after increasing doses of antihyperlipidemic agents. Refer to Statin Therapy in People With HIV in the Adult and Adolescent Guidelines for additional recommendations on statin therapy for people with HIV who are aged < 40 years. The long-term risks of lipid abnormalities in children who are receiving ART are unclear. However, persistent dyslipidemia in children may lead to premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Because of the burden of collecting fasting blood samples, some practitioners routinely measure cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) from nonfasting blood samples and follow up abnormal values with a test done in the fasted state. Refer to the NHLBI guidelines: Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents. The Adult and Adolescent Guidelines states: "There are insufficient data to inform whether risk enhancers, such as HIV-related factors, would favor statin therapy among people under 40 years of age. However, some younger people with HIV may be at increased ASCVD risk — particularly those with a very long duration of HIV infection (e.g., due to perinatal exposure)".

### Screening and statin use in… [^112TjC8L]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events and mortality by at least a small amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to 10%. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to conclude whether initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older who are not already taking a statin is beneficial in reducing the incidence of CVD events and mortality. POTENTIAL HARMS OF STATIN USE The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of low- to moderate-dose statin use in adults aged 40 to 75 years are small.

Randomized, clinical trials of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events have largely used low and moderate doses; under these conditions, statin use was not associated with serious adverse events such as cancer, severely elevated liver enzyme levels, or severe muscle-related harms. USPSTF ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit.

The USPSTF concludes that adults who smoke or have dyslipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension and a 10% or greater 10-year CVD event risk should be offered a low- to moderate-dose statin. Adults with diabetes or dyslipidemia and a 20% or greater 10-year CVD event risk are most likely to benefit from statin use.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^1171i962]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk — 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guideline: For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk-enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (e.g., statin therapy).

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115HRh7E]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and death in the US and is the cause of more than 1 of every 4 deaths. Coronary heart disease is the single leading cause of death and accounts for 43% of deaths attributable to CVD in the US. In 2019, an estimated 558 000 deaths were caused by coronary heart disease and 109 000 deaths were caused by ischemic stroke.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of statins for reducing CVD-related morbidity or mortality or all-cause mortality.

Population

Adults 40 years or older without a history of known CVD and who do not have signs and symptoms of CVD.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to less than 10% has at least a small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%. The likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater. (C recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older.

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^115pQySq]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Table 1
ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations

These guidelines are based on numerous trials showing a benefit for statin therapy both as primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Trials like the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), proved beyond doubt that patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for CVD should be treated with a statin, apparently disregarding their initial LDL cholesterol level. However, most of these trials did not set a goal LDL cholesterol level for treatment but examined the effect of a predetermined statin dose on the outcome. Extrapolated from these trials and from epidemiologic data, a goal LDL of 100 mg% seems adequate for the majority of patients. Yet because of the problematic interpretation of clinical trial data that was not inherent in its basic structure, alternative treatment goals have arisen, including a reduction of LDL by 40% (in patients where LDL reduction could not reach the 100 mg% goal) or a reduction below 70 mg% (in very-high-risk patients — those with prior cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes).

Some questions are raised from these guidelines. First, the overall efficacy of statin use for primary prevention raises the question who should not get a statin, i.e. what is the evidence for their use as primary prevention in diabetic individuals. Should a statin be given on an LDL-based treat-to-target goal (as stated in the guidelines, reduce the LDL below 100 mg%), existence of other vascular risk factors, age, or regardless of the measured cholesterol at predetermined doses (similar to current use of aspirin).

The second question is what is the evidence for the target LDL in secondary prevention in high-risk diabetic individuals — how aggressive should we be, and should we limit ourselves to an LDL-targeted therapy versus a comprehensive high-dose statin strategy. Again there is the question of the target LDL versus the "evidence-based" fixed dose?

### 2019 vs. 2016 ESC / EAS statin guidelines for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113FCGyS]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

The 2019 vs. 2016 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) dyslipidaemia guidelines contains new recommendations for primary prevention with statins; however, the potential impact of these changes is unclear. We compared the 2019 and 2016 guidelines regarding statin eligibility and potential impact on prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in the general population.

Methods and Results

We examined 45750 individuals aged 40–75 from the Copenhagen General Population Study, all free of ASCVD and statin use at baseline. During the 9.2-year follow-up, 3337 experienced ASCVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death). For Class I/A recommendations, 32.3% (95% confidence interval: 31.8–32.7) and 15.4% (15.1–15.7) of individuals were statin eligible according to the 2019 and 2016 guidelines. The increased statin eligibility by the 2019 guidelines was explained by lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) thresholds alone (explaining 33.2%), older age range alone (49.4%), older age range in combination with lower LDL-C thresholds (14.7%), and updated SCORE risk algorithm (2.8%). If fully implemented, the estimated percentage of ASCVD events that can be prevented by using high-intensity statins for 10years were 25% and 11% with the 2019 and 2016 guidelines. Mainly because of older age range in the 2019 guidelines, the corresponding estimated numbers needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one ASCVD event were 19 and 20.

Conclusion

Due to lower LDL-C threshold and older age range, the 2019 vs. 2016 ESC/EAS guidelines doubles the number of individuals eligible for primary prevention with statins. This considerably improves the potential for ASCVD prevention in the general population, with similar NNT to prevent one event.

Cholesterol management scope and therapies — The primary sources of evidence are randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and most RCTs in this area have been performed with statins as the only cholesterol-lowering drug; newer cholesterol-lowering agents include ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors, and their use is limited mainly to secondary prevention in patients at very high risk of new ASCVD events, while most other patients with ASCVD are treated with statins alone; in primary prevention, treatment recommendations are endorsed for patients with severe hypercholesterolemia and in adults 40 to 75 years of age with either diabetes mellitus or at higher ASCVD risk.

Lipid management for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in people with diabetes — age‑stratified recommendations specify: in people 20–39 years of age, consider statin therapy if there are additional ASCVD risk factors. In people 40–75 years of age, use moderate-intensity statin therapy in those without ASCVD risk factors, and use a high-intensity statin in those with ≥ 1 ASCVD risk factor, with an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L); it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy if LDL goal is not achieved, and use bempedoic acid for those who are statin intolerant. In people > 75 years of age, continue current statin therapy or consider initiating a moderate-intensity statin after weighing benefits and risks.

### Refining statin prescribing in lower-risk individuals: informing risk / benefit decisions [^1122Jvkr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, as well as those from the Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense and the Joint British Societies all recommended treating more people with statins than previous guidelines. In each guideline, the decision-making process began with an assessment of overall cardiovascular risk. Each group proposed updated treatment thresholds, and all of them lowered the threshold compared with earlier guidelines. Since release of these new guidelines in 2013 and 2014, additional evidence has emerged to suggest a rationale for extending statin consideration to an even larger proportion of asymptomatic adults-even those with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk below 7.5%. This review discusses new findings since 2013 and proposes strategies emanating from the current guidelines to help clinicians and patients make more informed decisions about long-term statin use, especially pertinent to lower-risk patients.

Top 10 take-home messages — risk discussion for primary prevention: In adults 40 to 75 years of age evaluated for primary ASCVD prevention, have a clinician-patient risk discussion before starting statin therapy; risk discussion should include a review of major risk factors, the presence of risk-enhancing factors, the potential benefits of lifestyle and statin therapies, the potential for adverse effects and drug-drug interactions, consideration of costs of statin therapy, and patient preferences and values in shared decision-making.

### Protocol for analyses of adverse event data from randomized controlled trials of statin therapy [^115njx6s]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines have extended statin therapy recommendations to wider primary prevention populations, such as people who have a 10% or greater 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease (UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline) or those aged 40 to 75 years with a 7.5% or higher risk for myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death or stroke within 10 years (American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guideline). This has resulted in public debate about potential adverse effects of statins. Concern has arisen, chiefly based on reports from nonrandomized observational studies of routine healthcare data, about associations between statin use and higher rates of a wide range of adverse events, including muscle pain (ie, myalgia, as distinct from myopathy) or weakness, hepatic dysfunction, cataracts, depression, impaired cognition, sleep disturbance, and acute kidney injury. There have also been reports from such studies of associations between statin use and lower rates of various nonvascular events, such as cancer, respiratory conditions, fractures, and Parkinson's disease. However, such associations in nonrandomized observational studies could be due to differences between the people who do and do not take statins in their underlying risks of having particular health outcomes or in the reporting and detection of health outcomes.

### Statin cost-effectiveness in the United States for people at different vascular risk levels [^115HC27n]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Statins reduce the rates of heart attacks, strokes, and revascularization procedures (ie, major vascular events) in a wide range of circumstances. Randomized controlled trial data from 20,536 adults have been used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of prescribing statin therapy in the United States for people at different levels of vascular disease risk and to explore whether wider use of generic statins beyond the populations currently recommended for treatment in clinical guidelines is indicated.

Methods and Results

Randomized controlled trial data, an internally validated vascular disease model, and US costs of statin therapy and other medical care were used to project lifetime risks of vascular events and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 40 mg simvastatin daily. For an average of 5 years, allocation to simvastatin reduced the estimated US costs of hospitalizations for vascular events by approximately 20% (95% CI, 15 to 24) in the different subcategories of participants studied. At a daily cost of $1 for 40 mg generic simvastatin, the estimated costs of preventing a vascular death within the 5-year study period ranged from a net saving of $1300 (95% CI, $15,600 saving to $13,200 cost) among participants with a 42% 5-year major vascular event risk to a net cost of $216,500 ($123,700 to $460,000 cost) among those with a 12% 5-year risk. The costs per life year gained with lifetime simvastatin treatment ranged from $2500 (-$40 to $3820) in people aged 40 to 49 years with a 42% 5-year major vascular event risk to $10,990 ($9430 to $14,700) in people aged 70 years and older with a 12% 5-year risk.

Conclusions

Treatment with generic simvastatin appears to be cost-effective for a much wider population in the United States than that recommended by current guidelines.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111QWr6D]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Do statins reduce mortality in older people? Findings from a longitudinal study using primary care records [^113hqdy2]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Assess whether statins reduce mortality in the general population aged 60 years and above.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Primary care practices contributing to The Health Improvement Network database, England and Wales, 1990–2017.

Participants

Cohort who turned age 60 between 1990 and 2000 with no previous cardiovascular disease or statin prescription and followed up until 2017.

Results

Current statin prescription was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality from age 65 years onward, with greater reductions seen at older ages. The adjusted HRs of mortality associated with statin prescription at ages 65, 70, 75, 80 and 85 years were 0.76 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.81), 0.71 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.75), 0.68 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.72), 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.73) and 0.54 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.92), respectively. The adjusted HRs did not vary by sex or cardiac risk.

Conclusions

Using regularly updated clinical information on sequential treatment decisions in older people, mortality predictions were updated every 6 months until age 85 years in a combined primary and secondary prevention population. The consistent mortality reduction of statins from age 65 years onward supports their use where clinically indicated at age 75 and older, where there has been particular uncertainty of the benefits.

Cardiovascular complications in people with HIV — ASCVD prevention and risk factor management states that statin therapy is recommended for all people with HIV aged 40–75 years and in additional clinical scenarios for other age groups to reduce the risk of ASCVD and major adverse cardiovascular events; the use of immunomodulatory therapy to reduce HIV-associated ASCVD risk is not recommended except in a clinical trial (AII); before initiating or changing ARV drugs or concomitant medications, clinicians should carefully assess for potential interactions (AIII) because some drugs prescribed to prevent or treat CVD may have clinically significant interactions with certain ARV drugs; all people with HIV should be counselled about ways to reduce CVD risk through behavioral modifications; and optimal management of comorbidities remains important to further reduce CVD risk among people with HIV.

When a statin is used, "LDL-C levels should be reduced by ≥ 30% and optimally by ≥ 50%". Regarding CAC, "CAC scoring is especially useful in older adults to improve specificity", and "A CAC score of zero revises ASCVD risk downward and selects adults who show little benefit from starting a statin".

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113Qxnuf]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Suggestions for practice regarding the I statement — adults older than 75 years: According to national mortality data, heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were respectively the first and fourth leading causes of death in adults 65 years or older in 2018, yet trial data on benefits in persons older than 75 years are limited, and available evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against initiating statins for primary prevention in this age group. Evidence on potential harms specifically in adults 76 years or older is limited, while trials in the general adult population show statins are not associated with an increased risk of myalgia, elevated alanine aminotransferase level, or cognitive harms.

### Diabetes dyslipidemia [^111UR396]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence also recently updated its guidance and now advises clinicians to offer statin treatment for primary prevention to adults with type 1 diabetes who are over 40 years, have had diabetes for more than 10 years, or have established nephropathy or other cardiovascular risk factors. These guidelines also recommend statin therapy for primary prevention in type 2 diabetes if the 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease is estimated to be greater than 10% using the QRISK2 assessment tool.

In conclusion, statin treatment should effectively be considered for all people with diabetes aged over 40 years or younger if additional cardiovascular risk factors are present, a position recently supported by the Joint British Societies.

### The efficiency of cardiovascular risk assessment: do the right patients get statin treatment? [^111qwnX3]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Over 100 000 patients used statins and had follow-up for over 5 years. The 5-year observed CVD risk during statin treatment (as estimated using Kaplan–Meier life tables) was, on average, 8.9% (95% CI 8.7% to 9.0%). There was a strong reduction in observed CVD risks over calendar time: observed 5-year risks were 17.0% (95% CI 16.3% to 17.7%) for patients starting statins in 1993 to 1999, 12.4% (95% CI 12.1% to 12.8%) in 2000–2002, 8.6% (95% CI 8.4% to 8.8%) in 2003–2005 and 7.1% (95% CI 6.9% to 7.3%) in 2006–2008.

Discussion

We found that patients at high risk of CVD were prescribed statins more frequently in recent years. However, the rate of prescribing to low-risk patients also increased. The targeting of statins to high-risk patients has become less efficient in recent years, as both the CVD risks as predicted at baseline by the risk scores and the actual risks during statin treatment have reduced over time.

Use of statins in actual clinical practice

A large number of the patients who initiated statin treatment were found to have low CVD risks as predicted by the scores. Extrapolating these numbers to the UK population, about 600 000 patients may have been prescribed a statin since 2007 despite having a CVD risk below 15% with any of the risk scores. Over 2.8 million patients received statin while having a predicted 10-year CVD risk of over 15%. About 850 000 did not receive a statin despite having a 10-year CVD risk of over 15%. The audit strategy for measuring compliance to the NICE guidance for primary CVD prevention describes the following criteria: (1) a systematic strategy is in place to identify people aged 40–74 years who are likely to be at high CVD risk, (2) there is a process to prioritise people based on an estimate of their CVD risk before undertaking full formal risk assessment (based on data recorded in the electronic health records). The results in this present study suggest that GPs have indeed been undertaking more CVD risk assessments (as reflected by the increases in statin prescribing and recording of risk factors) but that the approaches in how high CVD risk is assessed vary between practices.

### Association of statin use in older people primary prevention group with risk of cardiovascular events and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^111yBric]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality worldwide. More than 80% of the overall CVD death occurs in older people (aged ≥ 65 years). In 2015, people aged ≥ 65 years represented 8.5% (617.1 million) of the global population (7.3 billion). In 2030, this percentage is projected to reach 12% (1 billion) of the world population. In Europe, it is projected that almost 25% of its population will be aged ≥ 65 years by 2030, higher than any of the other continents. Therefore, efforts at the prevention of CVD in older people are important and will influence global healthcare policies.

The consideration of statins for primary CVD prevention in older people represents a dilemma in clinical practice unlike the secondary prevention, which is well-established and supported by a level (A) evidence, according to the most recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines. Current evidence on the use of statins for primary prevention of CVD in older people (especially those aged > 75 years) is still lacking. Statin therapy for primary prevention in people aged > 75 years (at high risk) was supported by level (B) evidence and considered as a class IIb recommendation in the 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines on dyslipidemias. The 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines advocate statins for primary prevention in older people aged ≤ 75 years (i.e. 65 to 75 years) as a class I recommendation, which is unlike the 2016 guidelines with a class ΙΙa recommendation and level (B) evidence. This change in recommendation class was based on an individual participant level-meta-analysis from 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by the "Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration" that reported a significant 39% proportional reduction [rate ratio (RR) 0.61; 99% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.73] in major vascular events for every 1 mmol/L drop in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by statins (or more intensive statin therapy) in participants without vascular disease, aged > 65 and ≤ 70 years. This beneficial effect of statins was statistically insignificant for primary prevention in participants aged > 70 years.

### Drug insight: statin use in the elderly [^113hGSUw]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

The elderly represent a notable proportion of patients who present with myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes. This subgroup of patients also experiences a higher incidence of adverse outcomes than younger age-groups, and, therefore, has more to gain from effective, evidence-based therapies. The efficacy of statins in secondary cardiovascular disease prevention is firmly established. The starting of therapy soon after an acute coronary event has been shown to provide added benefit. Uncertainties about the effectiveness of statins in the elderly, however, have resulted in their underuse in this population. In this review we evaluate the evidence for statin use in this important and increasingly large group of patients.

### Patient preference distribution for use of statin therapy [^114CrXmX]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are patients' preferences for use of statin therapy for primary prevention across the spectrum of estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk?

Findings

Of the 304 adults who participated in this survey study, the proportion who would want statin therapy after reviewing personalized benefit and harm information was 51% or less for risk categories under 20%. The minimum risk threshold had to increase to 20% before 75% of respondents in that risk group would want statin therapy.

Meaning

The results of this survey did not note a risk threshold that would justify a standard for or against the use of statin therapy; the preference distribution suggests a broad range of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk to recommend shared decision-making.

### Antiretroviral drugs for treatment and prevention of HIV in adults: 2024 recommendations of the international antiviral society-USA panel [^115PHgx1]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Primary prevention of ASCVD with statins in adults with HIV — data from the REPRIEVE trial have changed the approach to primary prevention; REPRIEVE, a placebo-controlled trial of pitavastatin (4 mg daily) in people with HIV aged 40 to 75 years receiving antiretroviral therapy demonstrated a 36% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events for the pitavastatin group; based on existing recommendations for the general population, persons with a risk estimate of 20% or higher, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L) or higher, should receive a high-intensity statin, and those with diabetes should receive at least a moderate-intensity statin; based on results from the REPRIEVE trial, a statin at at least moderate intensity is recommended for persons with HIV aged 40 to 75 years with ASCVD risk estimates of 5% or higher; people with HIV younger than 40 years were not included in the REPRIEVE trial and general population guidelines should be followed when considering statin initiation in this group; moderate-intensity doses of atorvastatin (20 mg) or rosuvastatin (10 mg) may be substituted for pitavastatin, and when prescribing statins, especially with protease inhibitors or cobicistat, attention must be paid to cytochrome P-450–related drug-drug interactions and drug transporter interactions.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113Sp72L]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for statins in primary prevention — The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater (B recommendation). The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% (C recommendation), and states that the likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older (I statement).

### Estimated impact of US preventive services task force recommendations on use and cost of statins for cardiovascular disease prevention [^1175HcXN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released new recommendations on statin use for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates USPSTF recommendations with an "A" or "B" grade receive insurance coverage without copayment. We assessed the potential impact of these recommendations.

Objective

To assess the US population meeting criteria for statin use and factors associated with use, and calculate associated costs.

Design and Measures

We estimated 10-year ASCVD event risk scores from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data using Pooled Cohort Equations from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and applied them to Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data. We estimated the population meeting USPSTF criteria and calculated the number of statin prescription fills and out-of-pocket and total costs. We assessed associations between statin use and sociodemographic and health characteristics and national trends in use from 1996 to 2014.

Participants

A nationally representative sample of people aged ≥ 40 years, representing 150 million people living in the USA.

Key Results

Of 26.8 million adults recommended for statins, only 41.8% were taking them. Female sex, Hispanic ethnicity, uninsured status, or living in the South was associated with lower odds of using statins. Under ACA, people with private insurance would avoid out-of-pocket cost of $9 for each generic prescription, resulting in savings of approximately $44 in annual costs. ACA's mandate for insurance coverage would result in a $193 million shift in out-of-pocket cost for statins from patients to private insurers.

Conclusions

New USPSTF recommendations may result in decreased out-of-pocket costs and expanded access to statins. Previous research has shown that eliminating copayments increased adherence and decreased rates of ASCVD events without increasing overall healthcare costs. Future research will determine whether the USPSTF's recommendations will result in similar findings.

### Do statins reduce mortality in older people? Findings from a longitudinal study using primary care records [^111HNhR3]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study showed significant absolute and relative reductions in all-cause mortality associated with statins for primary and secondary prevention of CVD at all ages over 65 years, including those at age 75 or older, in routine clinical practice over 25 years. This supports the use of statins, where clinically indicated and after discussion of the potential risks and benefits with the patient, in those aged over 75 years.

Primary ASCVD prevention risk discussion — In adults 40 to 75 years of age evaluated for primary prevention, have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting statin therapy, covering major risk factors, risk-enhancing factors, potential benefits of lifestyle and statin therapies, potential adverse effects and drug–drug interactions, costs of statin therapy, and patient preferences and values in shared decision-making.

### Comparison of recommended eligibility for primary prevention statin therapy based on the US preventive services task force recommendations vs the ACC / AHA guidelines [^115pJVLU]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

There are important differences among guideline recommendations for using statin therapy in primary prevention. New recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) emphasize therapy based on the presence of 1 or more cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and a 10-year global CVD risk of 10% or greater.

Objective

To determine the difference in eligibility for primary prevention statin treatment among US adults, assuming full application of USPSTF recommendations compared with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines.

Design, Setting, and Participants

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (2009–2014) were used to assess statin eligibility under the 2016 USPSTF recommendations vs the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines among a nationally representative sample of 3416 US adults aged 40 to 75 years with fasting lipid data and triglyceride levels of 400 mg/dL or less, without prior CVD.

Exposures

The 2016 USPSTF recommendations vs 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Eligibility for primary prevention statin therapy.

Results

Among the US primary prevention population represented by 3416 individuals in NHANES, the median weighted age was 53 years (interquartile range, 46–61), and 53% (95% CI, 52%-55%) were women. Along with the 21.5% (95% CI, 19.3%-23.7%) of patients who reported currently taking lipid-lowering medication, full implementation of the USPSTF recommendations would be associated with initiation of statin therapy in an additional 15.8% (95% CI, 14.0%-17.5%) of patients, compared with an additional 24.3% (95% CI, 22.3%-26.3%) of patients who would be recommended for statin initiation under full implementation of the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. Among the 8.9% of individuals in the primary prevention population who would be recommended for statins by ACC/AHA guidelines but not by USPSTF recommendations, 55% would be adults aged 40 to 59 years with a mean 30-year cardiovascular risk greater than 30%, and 28% would have diabetes.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this sample of US adults from 2009–2014, adherence to the 2016 USPSTF recommendations for statin therapy, compared with the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines, could lead to a lower number of individuals recommended for primary prevention statin therapy, including many younger adults with high mean long-term CVD risk.

Key recommendations for the general population (including people with HIV) — For people aged 40–75 years with high (≥ 20%) 10-year ASCVD risk estimates, initiate high-intensity statin therapy. For people aged 20–75 years with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dL, initiate high-intensity statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose. For people aged 40–75 years with diabetes mellitus, initiate at least moderate-intensity statin therapy and perform further risk assessment to consider using a high-intensity statin. Recommendations are based on AHA/ACC/Multisociety Guidelines.

Cholesterol reduction — statin initiation and targets (ages 40–75): In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL, we recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction of ≥ 50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 70 to 189 mg/dL, we recommend a 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should be calculated; without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, we recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve either a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal < 100 mg/dL or a reduction of ≥ 50%, and with a 10-year risk of 5% to 7.5%, we recommend moderate statin therapy as an option to achieve either a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal < 130 mg/dL or a reduction of 30% to 50% after consideration of risk reduction, adverse events, drug interactions, and individual preferences.

Cardiovascular complications in people with HIV — ASCVD risk stratification specifies that for people with HIV aged 40–75 years, 10-year ASCVD risk score should be calculated using the Pooled Cohort Equations (or PCE) at least annually to inform management, including whenever lipids are measured or in certain clinical scenarios that may affect ASCVD risk (BIII), and that lipid screening should be performed in people with HIV (AIII) with suggested frequencies including at entry into care or at ART initiation, 3–6 months after ART initiation once viral suppression is achieved, annually for those aged ≥ 40 years or receiving statin therapy, every 1–3 years for those aged < 40 years and not on statin therapy, and with changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors; it also states there is insufficient evidence to support using inflammatory biomarkers for ASCVD risk stratification and notes additional considerations for women with HIV including greater underprediction of ASCVD by risk scores than men with HIV.
