## Question

How should Keflex be dosed for a nipple piercing infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Keflex should be dosed for an adult with a nipple piercing infection, with attention to pathogens, dosing, renal adjustments, special populations, monitoring, and when not to use Keflex [^1168v5nK] [^116sX1X2]. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely infection type and causative organisms [^1146Pfoc]. Then, I should verify whether cephalexin is an appropriate empiric choice for those organisms and this anatomic site [^116sX1X2] [^1146Pfoc]. Next, I will determine adult dosing and duration, with a bias toward regimens validated for skin and soft tissue infections, and then adjust for renal function where needed [^1168v5nK] [^116LHVZ9] [^112bZTkR]. After that, I should consider special populations such as pregnancy and lactation, screen for allergies and drug interactions, and finally outline monitoring, escalation triggers, and patient education [^116sX1X2] [^113UyiEp] [^1146Pfoc]. I will keep checking each step against FDA labeling and IDSA guidance to self-verify accuracy and scope [^1168v5nK] [^1146Pfoc] [^116sX1X2].

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and likely pathogens, because choice of Keflex hinges on this [^1146Pfoc]. Nipple piercing infections are skin and soft tissue infections, with the most common bacteria being methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci, though Pseudomonas aeruginosa can occur, especially with exposure to contaminated aftercare solutions or water, and atypical mycobacteria are rare considerations in delayed or nonhealing presentations [^111YGZBF] [^111JY1TT] [^1177wgPP]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because the presence of green drainage, malodor, water exposure, or outbreak links should raise suspicion for Pseudomonas where Keflex would be inadequate [^111YGZBF] [^116Lj4jm] [^111JY1TT].

> I need to ensure Keflex is being used for an appropriate indication, since cephalexin is active against MSSA and Streptococcus but not against MRSA or Pseudomonas [^116sX1X2]. IDSA guidance supports a first-generation cephalosporin for uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis without MRSA risk factors, aligning with Keflex when MSSA and streptococci are likely and no pseudomonal risk is present [^1146Pfoc]. But wait, what if the infection is purulent, recurrent, or the patient has MRSA risk factors, or there is strong concern for water exposure or contaminated aftercare solution, in which case empiric coverage should shift toward an anti-MRSA or antipseudomonal agent rather than Keflex until culture results clarify [^1146Pfoc] [^111YGZBF] [^111JY1TT].

> Next, I should review adult dosing and duration for uncomplicated MSSA or streptococcal SSTI at the nipple, and I need to double-check the label details [^1168v5nK]. For adults with normal renal function, the FDA-labeled skin and soft tissue infection dosing is cephalexin 500 mg orally four times daily for 7 to 14 days, with acceptable alternatives of 500 mg twice daily or 250 mg four times daily when illness is milder or for tolerability, although QID is preferred when disease is more extensive or at higher risk of complications at body modification sites [^1168v5nK] [^112eXHDZ] [^112aLdjy]. Wait, I initially thought the nipple was relatively avascular and that alone justified higher dosing, but I should correct that because avascularity concerns in piercing complications are classically described for auricular cartilage, not the nipple, and here the rationale for choosing the QID regimen is the labeled dosing for SSTI severity and the higher risk of jewelry tract infection and abscess formation rather than a uniquely avascular blood supply at the nipple [^111YGZBF] [^1168v5nK].

> I will now examine renal dosing adjustments, because accumulation can increase adverse effects and seizures with beta-lactams in renal impairment [^113UyiEp]. Let me first confirm that no dose change is needed if creatinine clearance is greater than 60 mL per minute, and then scale down as function declines, keeping within maximal daily allowances [^116LHVZ9]. For CrCl 30 to 59 mL per minute, do not exceed 1 g per day, often dosed 250 to 500 mg twice daily depending on severity, and for CrCl 15 to 29 mL per minute use 250 mg per dose with twice or three times daily frequency at most [^112bZTkR] [^113bcM3J]. For CrCl 5 to 14 mL per minute use 250 mg once daily, and for CrCl 1 to 4 mL per minute use 250 mg every 48 to 60 hours, while in peritoneal dialysis 250 to 500 mg every 12 to 24 hours is typical and in intermittent hemodialysis the same range is used but doses should be given after dialysis, with no clear guidance for continuous renal replacement therapy [^116GDChX] [^115wfJ2B] [^111y53Jb] [^113dHGL8] [^113exr3Z]. I should double-check creatinine clearance before prescribing and document the calculation to support dosing choices [^112bZTkR].

> Let me consider special populations, especially pregnancy and lactation, because counseling can affect both safety and adherence [^1112Bfzt]. Cephalexin is commonly used for lactational mastitis and is generally compatible with breastfeeding, which supports its safety profile in lactating adults when the infant's direct exposure to infected drainage is avoided and the mother's systemic therapy is indicated by bacterial infection signs [^116sX1X2] [^1112Bfzt]. Hold on, I initially advised pump and discard from the infected breast as a blanket rule, but I should verify and nuance that because pump and discard guidance is specific to active herpes lesions on the breast where direct breastfeeding is contraindicated until lesions clear, whereas for a localized bacterial piercing tract infection with open drainage the safer course is to avoid infant contact with the affected nipple until the tract is healed while continuing to feed from the other breast or expressed milk that is not contaminated by drainage, aligning practice contextually to avoid neonatal exposure to infected material [^115cXrfQ] [^1112Bfzt].

> I need to check for contraindications and drug interactions to prevent harm, and I should confirm a thorough allergy history to beta-lactams before starting therapy [^113UyiEp]. Cephalexin can rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, can increase metformin levels, can prolong prothrombin time especially with nutritional deficiency or hepatic or renal impairment or prolonged antibacterial use, and can lower seizure threshold in renal impairment, so medication reconciliation and risk counseling are necessary [^113UyiEp]. I should also confirm the absence of prior severe delayed reactions to penicillins or cephalosporins, which would steer me away from cephalexin and toward non–beta-lactam options if present [^113UyiEp].

> Let me first confirm that a bacterial infection is proven or strongly suspected, because antibiotics should not be prescribed for noninfectious dermatitis or purely traumatic irritation from jewelry, which can mimic infection at the nipple [^114doobY] [^1112Bfzt]. If local findings point to dermatitis or eczema without warmth, tenderness, purulence, or spreading erythema, supportive care and topical therapies may be more appropriate, reserving Keflex for true bacterial involvement based on clinical judgment or culture when feasible [^1112Bfzt] [^114doobY].

> Next, I should review monitoring and reassessment, since early response guides whether to stay the course or broaden coverage or pursue procedures like drainage [^1146Pfoc]. I will re-evaluate within 48 to 72 hours to ensure decreasing pain, erythema, and drainage, and if not improving I should obtain or review cultures, consider incision and drainage if an abscess is present, and broaden empiric therapy toward MRSA or Pseudomonas based on risk factors like purulence, prior antibiotic exposure, or known contaminated aftercare solution exposure or water exposure history [^1146Pfoc] [^111YGZBF] [^111JY1TT]. Hold on, I should verify that culture from a piercing tract or drainage is feasible before adjusting antibiotics, and I should involve surgical or breast specialists if there is deep tissue involvement or systemic toxicity [^1146Pfoc].

> I will now examine adverse effect surveillance, because recognizing early warning signs limits morbidity and prompts regimen changes when needed [^113UyiEp]. Common reactions include rash, while serious risks include Clostridioides difficile infection, drug-induced hemolytic anemia, severe cutaneous reactions, neurotoxicity in renal dysfunction, and coagulation changes, and patients should be instructed to report severe diarrhea, mucocutaneous lesions, bleeding, confusion, or seizures immediately [^111kmy2G] [^115nh87R] [^113UyiEp]. I should double-check renal function during therapy if the clinical course is prolonged or if toxicity is suspected, particularly in older adults or those on nephrotoxic drugs [^113UyiEp].

> For patient education, I need to ensure they complete the full 7 to 14 day course unless instructed otherwise, avoid skipping doses, and avoid risky aftercare practices that may seed Pseudomonas, such as using nonsterile solutions or exposing the site to pools or freshwater during healing [^1168v5nK] [^114doobY] [^111YGZBF] [^111JY1TT]. I should confirm they will seek care urgently for fever, rapidly spreading redness, severe pain, or new purulence and that they understand wound hygiene with gentle saline cleansing and removal of jewelry only if advised clinically, as premature removal can sometimes trap infection whereas established abscess requires drainage for source control [^1146Pfoc] [^111YGZBF].

> Final recommendation after verification is as follows, with the explicit caveat that this assumes an uncomplicated nipple piercing infection due to MSSA or Streptococcus in an adult with normal renal function and no beta-lactam allergy, and without MRSA or Pseudomonas risk factors or systemic toxicity, in which case prescribe cephalexin 500 mg orally four times daily for 7 to 14 days and reassess at 48 to 72 hours to confirm response and adjust if needed [^1168v5nK] [^1146Pfoc].

---

For a nipple piercing infection, the standard Keflex (cephalexin) dose is **500 mg orally every 6 hours (QID) for 7–14 days** [^1168v5nK]. Use the full 14 days for severe or slow-resolving infections. Adjust dosing for renal impairment: for **CrCl 30–59 mL/min**, max 1 g/day [^112bZTkR]; for **CrCl 15–29 mL/min**, 250 mg BID–TID [^113bcM3J]; for **CrCl 5–14 mL/min**, 250 mg once daily [^116GDChX]; and for **CrCl 1–4 mL/min**, 250 mg every 48–60 hours [^115wfJ2B]. Monitor for allergic reactions, C. difficile, and superinfections [^113UyiEp] [^115nh87R]; consider MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage if risk factors or severe infection are present [^1146Pfoc] [^111YGZBF].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

- **Standard adult dose**: 500 mg orally every 6 hours (QID) for 7–14 days [^1168v5nK] [^116sX1X2].
- **Alternative dosing**: 500 mg orally every 12 hours (BID) for mild infections, but QID is preferred for piercing infections [^112eXHDZ].
- **Duration**: 7–14 days; use 14 days for severe or slow-resolving infections [^1168v5nK].

---

## Clinical considerations

### Pathogens commonly associated with nipple piercing infections

- **Staphylococcus aureus**: Most common, including MRSA [^1146Pfoc] [^111aZ4mp].
- **Streptococcus pyogenes**: Common skin pathogen [^1146Pfoc].
- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**: Associated with contaminated aftercare solutions [^111YGZBF] [^116Lj4jm].
- **Atypical mycobacteria**: Rare, consider if poor response to standard therapy [^1177wgPP] [^1112Bfzt].

---

### Indications for antibiotic therapy

Initiate **antibiotics** for localized infection — characterized by erythema, warmth, swelling, or purulent discharge — and for systemic manifestations such as fever, chills, or malaise. Use a lower threshold in **immunocompromised patients**, and treat if infection persists despite conservative local care [^1146Pfoc] [^114doobY].

---

### Contraindications and precautions

Cephalexin is **contraindicated** in patients with **hypersensitivity to cephalosporins or penicillins**. In renal impairment, **adjust the dose** as outlined below [^112bZTkR] [^113bcM3J] [^116GDChX] [^115wfJ2B]. Monitor for C. difficile–associated diarrhea and colitis [^113UyiEp] and for superinfection with fungal or resistant bacterial overgrowth [^115nh87R].

---

## Adjustments for renal impairment

| **Creatinine clearance (CrCl)** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|
| > 60 mL/min | No adjustment [^116LHVZ9] |
| 30–59 mL/min | Max 1 g/day [^112bZTkR] |
| 15–29 mL/min | 250 mg BID–TID [^113bcM3J] |
| 5–14 mL/min | 250 mg once daily [^116GDChX] |
| 1–4 mL/min | 250 mg every 48–60 hours [^115wfJ2B] |

---

## Potential complications and side effects

- **Allergic reactions**: Rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis [^113UyiEp].
- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, C. difficile colitis [^113UyiEp] [^115nh87R].
- **Hematologic**: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia [^113UyiEp] [^115nh87R].
- **Renal**: Interstitial nephritis, renal failure [^113UyiEp] [^115nh87R].
- **Neurologic**: Seizures (especially with renal impairment) [^113UyiEp].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Cephalexin is highly effective for MSSA and streptococcal infections [^1168v5nK] [^116sX1X2]; it **does not reliably cover MRSA**, so choose alternatives when MRSA is suspected [^1146Pfoc]. It also **lacks activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa** [^111YGZBF] [^111aZ4mp] and **atypical mycobacteria** [^1177wgPP]; use alternative agents if these pathogens are suspected.

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

For **suspected MRSA**, consider clindamycin, doxycycline, TMP-SMX, or linezolid [^1146Pfoc] [^11168A2z]. For **Pseudomonas coverage**, use ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin [^111aZ4mp] [^111YGZBF]; for **atypical mycobacterial infections**, use clarithromycin or azithromycin combined with ethambutol.

---

## Patient education and adherence

Advise patients to **complete the full antibiotic course** even if symptoms improve and to promptly report severe side effects [^114V38zv] [^111zhWAe]. During treatment, **avoid irritants** such as alcohol, harsh soaps, and swimming [^116BgEGg] [^111YGZBF]. Arrange follow-up, and reassess if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours.

---

Keflex is appropriate for nipple piercing infections when MSSA or streptococci are likely; use **500 mg QID for 7–14 days** and adjust for renal function [^1168v5nK] [^112bZTkR]. Consider MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage if risk factors or severe infection are present [^1146Pfoc] [^111YGZBF].

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^111YGZBF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Sporadic bacterial infections are a relatively common occurrence after nonmedical body piercing procedures, such as ear piercing. Localized infections occur at 10%–30% of new piercing sites, most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Complications of piercing-related infections can range from minor superficial skin infections to abscess formation and necrosis requiring surgical intervention. Severe infections tend to occur in more avascular areas, such as auricular cartilage.

P. aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium commonly found in natural and built wet environments and is a well-established cause of sporadic piercing-related infections. Infections tend to occur, on average, 2–4 weeks after piercing procedures and have historically been attributed to exposure of piercing sites to swimming pools and fresh water, lack of adequate preoperative/intraoperative antisepsis of piercing sites, poor hand hygiene, and using contaminated solutions during or after piercing procedures. However, limited reports exist on P. aeruginosa infection outbreaks related to piercing.

In late April 2021, the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District Public Health Unit in Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), Australia, was notified by an ear, nose, and throat clinician that three patients had sought treatment for P. aeruginosa infections at two local hospital emergency departments after ear piercings. All piercings took place on April 1, 2021, at a newly opened skin penetration facility located in southeastern Sydney.

### Skin diseases of the breast and nipple: Inflammatory and infectious diseases [^1112Bfzt]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Certain dermatologic conditions are unique to the breast and nipple, whereas others may incidentally involve these structures. All require a nuanced approach to diagnosis and treatment because of the functional, sexual, and aesthetic importance of this area. The lactating patient requires special management because certain treatment options are contraindicated. All dermatologic conditions involving the breast and nipple require careful evaluation because malignancy of the breast can be mistaken for a benign condition or may trigger the development of certain dermatologic conditions.

The second article in this continuing medical education series reviews both common and uncommon inflammatory and infectious conditions of the breast and nipple. It provides insight into both the diagnosis and treatment of this heterogeneous group of diseases. For the purposes of this article, these conditions are categorized into four distinct groups:

1. **Dermatitis**: Various forms of dermatitis can affect the breast and nipple, necessitating tailored approaches to treatment due to the sensitive nature of the area.

2. **Radiation-induced changes**: These changes are significant in patients who have undergone radiation therapy, impacting both the appearance and health of the breast.

3. **Mastitis**: An inflammation of breast tissue that sometimes involves an infection, requiring careful management especially in lactating individuals.

4. **Miscellaneous dermatologic conditions**: This includes other less common dermatologic conditions affecting the breast and nipple, each needing specific consideration in clinical practice.

### Nipple piercing may be contraindicated in male patients with chest implants [^1143F51t]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The authors present a man who underwent chest augmentation and nipple piercing. The patient developed a chronic nipple infection, which led to unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures, serious implant infection, and eventually urgent explantation. This unfavorable scenario illustrates the distinct features of the procedure in men, which include close proximity of the nipple to the implant and reduced awareness by healthcare providers. Based on this case, the authors recommend avoiding nipple piercing in men with chest implants.

Piercing the skin for cosmetic reasons can be dangerous in young adults who have previously undergone surgery for congenital defects of the heart. We report the case of a 24-year-old man in whom coarctation of the aorta had been corrected 15 years earlier. Two months after piercing his left nipple without antibiotic prophylaxis, he developed a local mastitis, followed by bacterial endocarditis that required replacement of the aortic valve.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^111JY1TT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

After receiving the WGS analyses, we refined case definitions to be more specific. We used the confirmed case definition to determine associations with the suspected product, whereas the other case definitions tracked case incidence over time and assisted with ongoing case finding.

- **Confirmed case**: Defined as a person in Australia with a body piercing infection caused by P. aeruginosa who had a piercing date after February 1, 2021, and ST988 detected in a clinical isolate.

- **Probable case**: Defined as a person in Australia with a body piercing infection caused by P. aeruginosa who had a piercing date after February 1, 2021, but sequencing and typing data for a clinical isolate were not available. Additionally, either the piercing was performed at a franchise A store and the person used Protat aftercare solution, or P. aeruginosa ST988 was isolated from their aftercare product, regardless of the store attended or product used.

- **Suspected case**: Defined as a person in Australia with a body piercing infection caused by P. aeruginosa who had a piercing date after February 1, 2021, but the piercing location or aftercare information is incomplete.

### Breast implant infections: Is cefazolin enough [^11534hwD]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Bacterial infection is a well-known risk of breast implant surgery, occurring in 2.0 to 2.5 percent of cosmetic cases and up to 20 percent of reconstructive cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a first-generation cephalosporin for perioperative prophylaxis; however, no guidelines exist for the empiric treatment of established breast implant infections. A recent increase in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections has prompted interest in using alternative antibiotics with anti-methicillin-resistant S. aureus activity for both prophylactic and empiric therapy. The goal of the present study was to assess the bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility of breast implant-related infections at two tertiary care hospitals in the Texas Medical Center to determine whether a baseline for empiric therapy for breast implant infections could be established.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of patients who developed periprosthetic infections within one month after breast implant placement between 2001 and 2006 was completed. One hundred six patients with 116 infected breasts were identified. Patients were included in the study only if they had documented culture data.

- **Results**: Thirty-one breasts in 26 patients met inclusion criteria. Sixty-seven percent of the infected breasts had S. aureus infections; of these, 68 percent were methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections and 32 percent were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infections. We noted Gram-negative rods and sterile cultures in 6 percent and 26 percent of breasts, respectively.

### Body piercing: Complications and prevention of health risks [^116BgEGg]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Body and earlobe piercing are common practices in the United States today. Minor complications, including infection and bleeding, occur frequently and, although rare, major complications have been reported. Healthcare professionals should be cognizant of the medical consequences of body piercing. Complications vary depending on the body-piercing site, materials used, experience of the practitioner, hygiene regimens, and aftercare by the recipient. Localized infections are common. Systemic infections, such as viral hepatitis and toxic shock syndrome, and distant infections, such as endocarditis and brain abscesses, have been reported. Other general complications include allergic contact dermatitis (e.g. from nickel or latex), bleeding, scarring and keloid formation, nerve damage, and interference with medical procedures such as intubation and blood/organ donation.

- **Site-specific complications**: Oral piercings may lead to difficulty speaking and eating, excessive salivation, and dental problems. Oral and nasal piercings may be aspirated or become embedded, requiring surgical removal. Piercing tracts in the ear, nipple, and navel are prone to tearing. Galactorrhea may be caused by stimulation from a nipple piercing. Genital piercings may lead to infertility secondary to infection and obstruction of the urethra secondary to scar formation. In men, priapism and fistula formation may occur. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and have a piercing or are considering obtaining one need to be aware of the rare complications that may affect them or their child.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: Cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: A randomized treatment trial [^116MR4b9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Recruitment began at two hospitals in November 2001, two others in February 2002, and a fifth hospital in June 2002. Recruitment was slow as few women had damaged nipples. During the months of the trial, the rate of recruitment decreased rather than increased. Additionally, the flucloxacillin supplied by CSL was labeled to be used before the end of November 2002. Therefore, it was decided to stop recruiting once a twelve-month recruiting period had elapsed. The trial stopped recruiting on November 14, 2002.

Of the 158 women referred to the study as possible participants, 48 women were eligible (i.e. they had a cracked nipple, were not allergic to penicillin, did not have concurrent "nipple thrush", and had adequate English). Twenty-six of these women refused (10 were not interested, 9 didn't want to take antibiotics, 7 other reasons given). Therefore, 22 were potentially eligible in that they had at least one cracked nipple and consented to take part in the trial if the results of the nipple swab confirmed S. aureus. Thirteen of the nipple cultures were positive, and ten women were randomized to receive flucloxacillin (n = 5) or placebo capsules (n = 5). Two women had already developed mastitis prior to receiving the results, and the third woman had developed a rash and did not want to take the capsules. All women were followed up at one week and six weeks. Of the ten women in the RCT, one woman in the placebo group developed mastitis (not in the first week of the trial, baby was 32 days old, 28 days after randomization). Three women reported that they had not taken the capsules.

### Kalliga [^114mrLqb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The dosage of Kalliga™ for the initial cycle of therapy is one white to off-white "active" tablet administered daily from the first day through the 21st day of the menstrual cycle, counting the first day of menstrual flow as "Day 1". Tablets are taken without interruption as follows: one white to off-white "active" tablet daily for 21 days, then one green "reminder" tablet daily for 7 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started, and a white to off-white "active" tablet is taken the next day.

Use of Kalliga™ for contraception may be initiated four weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed. When the tablets are administered during the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered. See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS concerning thromboembolic disease. See also PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers. If the patient starts on Kalliga™ postpartum and has not yet had a period, she should be instructed to use another method of contraception until a white to off-white "active" tablet has been taken daily for seven days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered. If the patient misses one white to off-white "active" tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the white to off-white "active" tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two white to off-white "active" tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two white to off-white "active" tablets the day she remembers and two white to.

### Improving the correct prescription and dosage of gentamicin [^112FNi87]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Gentamicin is an antibiotic from the class of aminoglycosides. It is used predominantly to treat gram-negative infections, particularly urinary, biliary, and abdominal, but it does have some anti-staphylococcal activity as well. Gentamicin is being used increasingly in clinical care because of its lack of 'diffogenicity' — causing Clostridium difficile infections. However, there are a number of problems associated with it. Gentamicin is potentially nephrotoxic and ototoxic if given incorrectly.

A patient is given a dose according to their body weight. If they are obese, they are dosed according to a corrected body weight. The patient's renal function will also determine the dosage in mg/kg. Once a patient is given gentamicin and is due to receive subsequent doses, they must have a level taken 6–14 hours after the initial dose. This measurement will demonstrate how well their kidneys are clearing the antibiotic, as it is renally excreted.

- **Once-daily extended interval regime**: This method is replacing the traditional method of administering gentamicin more than once a day, depending on peak and trough levels. It is presumed to be a safer and more effective way of giving the antibiotic.

Calculating the correct dose of gentamicin depends on calculating the patient's ideal body weight, followed by the corrected body weight, and finally their creatinine clearance. By not following this protocol, significant variation can occur in dosing and subsequent prescription.

### Haemophilus aphrophilus endocarditis after tongue piercing [^113x8wfa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

In the United States, body piercing is becoming increasingly common and is mainly performed by unlicensed practitioners. Only 26% of states have regulatory authority over tattooing establishments, and only six of these states exercise authority over body-piercing establishments. Piercing occurs in regulated and unregulated shops, department stores, jewelry shops, homes, or physicians' offices. Generally, no antibiotic is used, and sterilization methods vary.

Studies show that ear piercing can cause cephalic tetanus (a local form of tetanus caused by wounds or other head and neck infections), Pseudomonas infections, or perichondrial auricular abscesses, especially with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tongue or oral piercing can cause Ludwig's angina or may be complicated by normal oral flora, such as Haemophilus aphrophilus. Genital piercing may result in Escherichia coli infection and may increase the risk for sexually transmitted diseases through tissue damage and exposure, as well as unwanted pregnancy due to condom rupture. Systemic infections, such as toxic shock syndrome or sepsis, have also been reported.

Among noninfectious cases, granulomatous perichondritis of the nasal ala, sarcoid-like foreign body reaction from multiple piercings, and paraphimosis from a distal penis pierce have been reported. Additionally, speech impairment and difficulties in chewing and swallowing from oral jewelry have been noted. Metal-associated problems include allergy (especially to nickel), eczematous rash, and lymphocytoma. We describe an incidence of H. aphrophilus endocarditis following tongue piercing.

### Easy-ceft1g [^112JuMjT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Pediatric patients**: For the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg given once a day or in equally divided doses twice a day. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams. For the treatment of acute bacterial otitis media, a single intramuscular dose of 50 mg/kg, not to exceed 1 gram, is recommended (see indications and usage). For serious miscellaneous infections other than meningitis, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg, administered in divided doses every 12 hours. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams. In the treatment of meningitis, it is recommended that the initial therapeutic dose be 100 mg/kg, not to exceed 4 grams. Thereafter, a total daily dose of 100 mg/kg/day, not to exceed 4 grams daily, is recommended. The daily dose may be administered once a day or in equally divided doses every 12 hours. The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 14 days.

- **Adults**: The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day or in equally divided doses twice a day, depending on the type and severity of infection. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams. If Chlamydia trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, as ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism. For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended. For preoperative use as surgical prophylaxis, a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is advised.

### Cefazolin [^112jqJg2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Dosage adjustment for patients with reduced renal function: Cefazolin for Injection, USP may be used in patients with reduced renal function with the following dosage adjustments. Patients with a creatinine clearance of 55 mL/min or greater, or a serum creatinine of 1.5 mg% or less, can be given full doses. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 35 to 54 mL/min or serum creatinine of 1.6 to 3.0 mg% can also be given full doses, but the dosage should be restricted to at least 8-hour intervals. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 11 to 34 mL/min or serum creatinine of 3.1 to 4.5 mg% should be given half the usual dose every 12 hours. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 10 mL/min or less or serum creatinine of 4.6 mg% or greater should be given half the usual dose every 18 to 24 hours. All reduced dosage recommendations apply after an initial loading dose appropriate to the severity of the infection. Patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis: see clinical pharmacology.

- **Pediatric dosage**: In pediatric patients, a total daily dosage of 25 to 50 mg per kg (approximately 10 to 20 mg per pound) of body weight, divided into 3 or 4 equal doses, is effective for most mild to moderately severe infections. The total daily dosage may be increased to 100 mg per kg (45 mg per pound) of body weight for severe infections. Since safety for use in premature infants and neonates has not been established, the use of Cefazolin for Injection, USP in these patients is not recommended.

In pediatric patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 70 to 40 mL/min)…

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: Cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: A randomized treatment trial [^114D3RWB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

As we intended to recruit over 500 women, we planned a multi-centered trial involving several public and private maternity hospitals in inner Melbourne. All hospitals provide a breastfeeding clinic staffed with International Board Certified Lactation Consultants for women experiencing breastfeeding difficulties following hospital discharge. The public hospitals, where women tend to have shorter hospital stays, also offer home visits by domiciliary midwives post-discharge. It was anticipated that there would be replication in the requirements of the hospital ethics committees and logistical difficulties for one researcher (LA) to conduct the study across multiple sites.

Each hospital had its own research ethics committee (or committees) and different forms to submit at the time of this study. Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committees at La Trobe University (20/11/2000), Royal Women's Hospital (6/9/2000), Mercy Hospital for Women (12/2/2001), Frances Perry House (23/8/2001), Freemasons Maternity Hospital (15/3/2001), and Cabrini Private Hospital (24/04/02). One private hospital did not appear to have a procedure in place to address a research proposal. Negotiations continued with this hospital from late 2000 until mid-2002 when the hospital insisted that we sign a Sponsor Indemnity Form, which the university advised against.

The researcher visited the postnatal wards and breastfeeding clinics of these hospitals each day or every other day and asked a senior member of the nursing staff if there were any breastfeeding women with damaged nipples in the ward.

### Cefoxitin [^111zhWAe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The total daily dose should be reduced when cefoxitin for injection is administered to patients with transient or persistent reduction of urinary output due to renal insufficiency (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), because high and prolonged serum antibiotic concentrations can occur in such individuals from usual doses. Antibiotics, including cephalosporins, should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. As with other antibiotics, prolonged use of cefoxitin for injection may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. Prescribing cefoxitin for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including cefoxitin for injection, should only be used to treat bacterial infections as they do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When cefoxitin for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood of resistance development.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^1179Po4u]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

In total, we identified 13 case-patients who had P. aeruginosa-positive clinical isolates belonging to ST988. Two of these case-patients had clinical samples taken from two different sites. Of these 13 case-patients with ST988 P. aeruginosa infections, 10 had used the implicated batch, and one had used two different batches of Protat aftercare solution. Information was not available for two cases. The case-patient with an ST247 P. aeruginosa infection had used a different aftercare solution batch.

We reinterviewed the case-patient who reported using two different batches of Protat aftercare solution to confirm batch numbers. That case-patient had purchased those bottles 6 and 12 months earlier after other piercings and confirmed that additional aftercare solutions had not been purchased at the time of the latest piercing. However, a product was used in-store on their ear during the piercing procedure, and the case-patient was likely exposed to the implicated batch at that time.

### Fortaz [^114KN8Xc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

The usual adult dosage is 1 gram administered intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 to 12 hours. The dosage and route should be determined by the susceptibility of the causative organisms, the severity of infection, and the condition and renal function of the patient.

- **Dosage guidelines**: No adjustment in dosage is required for patients with hepatic dysfunction. For patients with impaired renal function, ceftazidime is excreted by the kidneys, almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Therefore, in patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 50 mL/min), it is recommended that the dosage of ceftazidime be reduced to compensate for its slower excretion. In patients with suspected renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram of Fortaz may be given. An estimate of GFR should be made to determine the appropriate maintenance dosage.

	- **Dosage adjustment for renal impairment**: When only serum creatinine is available, Cockcroft's equation may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function. In patients with severe infections who would normally receive 6 grams of Fortaz daily were it not for renal insufficiency, the unit dose may be increased by 50% or the dosing frequency may be increased appropriately. Further dosing should be determined by therapeutic monitoring, severity of the infection, and susceptibility of the organisms involved.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^116Lj4jm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We retrieved 11 unopened bottles of Protat aftercare solution from various chain stores in Sydney and Wollongong on May 14, 2021 (9 with the implicated batch number and 2 with different batch numbers). Samples from 3 unopened bottles of the implicated batch were positive for P. aeruginosa (850–2,000 CFU/mL); the remaining bottles had no growth. We received additional samples from 48 unopened Protat aftercare bottles with the implicated batch number from South Australia; 10 of those bottles were cultured and had no bacterial growth.

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed for 28 bacteria isolates (16 isolates from clinical samples, 3 from unopened bottles of Protat aftercare solution, and 9 from opened bottles of Protat aftercare solution). Twenty-seven of those isolates were P. aeruginosa and belonged to ST988. ST988 is a rare type that has not been identified previously in local isolate collections. Analysis identified 0–9 single-nucleotide polymorphism differences between the 27 isolate genomes (sequences with < 25 single-nucleotide differences were regarded as a genomically linked cluster). Cluster analysis showed that all 27 submitted ST988 isolates were genomically linked. The remaining P. aeruginosa isolate was from a clinical sample.

### Monitoring and educational feedback to improve the compliance of tattooists and body piercers with infection control standards: A randomized controlled trial [^111jDSpG]. American Journal of Infection Control (2004). High credibility.

Blood-borne viruses present a significant health and economic burden for both developed and developing countries and can be transmitted through tattooing and piercing. Limited data exist concerning intervention strategies for increasing skin penetration operators' compliance with infection control standards. This study evaluated the efficacy and acceptability of an educational feedback intervention for tattooists and piercers.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted in Sydney, NSW, Australia, among 37 tattooing and body-piercing premises in 2002.

No effects were found in terms of improved knowledge. However, there was a significantly greater increase in the experimental group in the perceived risk of being detected and penalized for noncompliance. There was a significantly greater improvement in the demonstration of 2 of 3 infection control procedures and a nonsignificant trend toward greater improvement in inspection scores in the experimental group. The odds of compliance were significantly higher in the experimental group for 2 of the 3 demonstration practices and in 2 of 5 observed infection control practices.

These findings contribute new information concerning alternative approaches to increasing tattooists' and piercers' compliance with infection control regulations and guidelines.

### The hole picture: Risks, decision making, purpose, regulations, and the future of body piercing [^114QRci1]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Can it be said that body piercing is ubiquitous, found across all socioeconomic groups? The major concentration is among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 30 years, with some studies indicating that 50% of the population in this age group has body piercings. Commonly identified physical risks include bleeding, tissue trauma, and bacterial infections; psychosocial risks encompass unhappiness, low self-esteem, and disappointment. The Health Belief Model is employed to explain decision-making processes. The purposes for body piercing consistently center on personal expression (self-identity) and uniqueness.

- **International and US body piercing regulations**: These are discussed, leading to the need for tracking complications globally and the standardization of regulations. Proactive health education for clients and health providers remains a priority.

### Surgical procedure for reversal of nipple piercing [^111sn6ae]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Body piercing of the nipples for adornment with jewelry has increased worldwide. Many patients later regret their decision and request reversal, along with a desire to maintain their ability to breastfeed. The surgeon must remove the epithelial tunnel with minimum damage to adjacent ducts. The simple technique described uses the patient's jewelry post as a guide and a common disposable biopsy punch. Slid over the post, the punch excises the epithelial tunnel core with minimal harm to surrounding structures.

### Enhanced identification of postoperative infections among outpatients [^111s42wa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The study focuses on infections of the breast and nipple associated with childbirth. These are classified as either specified or unspecified and further categorized based on the timing of the condition (antepartum, postpartum, or unspecified):

- **Specified infections**:
	- 675.81: Other specified infection of the breast and nipple associated with childbirth, delivered, with or without mention of antepartum condition
	- 675.82: Other specified infection of the breast and nipple associated with childbirth, delivered, with mention of postpartum complication
	- 675.83: Other specified infection of the breast and nipple, antepartum
	- 675.84: Other specified infection of the breast and nipple, postpartum

- **Unspecified infections**:
	- 675.9: Unspecified infection of the breast and nipple associated with childbirth
	- 675.90: Unspecified infection of the breast and nipple, unspecified as to prenatal or postnatal episode
	- 675.91: Unspecified infection of the breast and nipple associated with childbirth, delivered, with or without mention of antepartum condition
	- 675.92: Unspecified infection of the breast and nipple associated with childbirth, delivered, with mention of postpartum complication
	- 675.93: Unspecified infection of the breast and nipple, antepartum
	- 675.94: Unspecified infection of the breast and nipple, postpartum

These classifications help in understanding and identifying the timing and specification of infections, which is crucial for effective treatment and management.

### Effect of nipple shield use on milk removal: a mechanistic study [^115ZE5HB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Breastfeeding mothers of term healthy infants aged 1 to 6 months were recruited through the Australian Breastfeeding Association and international board certified lactation consultants. These consultants were based either at the Breastfeeding Centre of Western Australia, King Edward Memorial Hospital, or in the community between August 2016 and July 2018. Participants were predominantly breastfeeding, defined as feeding ≤ 1 bottle of infant formula per day, and had previous experience with breast pumps. The study included two groups:

	- **Pain Group (PG)**: This included mothers using a nipple shield to manage unexplained nipple pain and experiencing persistent pain despite professional lactation advice.

	- **Control Group (CG)**: This included mothers without breastfeeding pain or difficulties.

- **Exclusion criteria for both PG and CG**: Mothers with diagnosed causes of nipple pain, such as infection or nipple vasospasm, prior breast or nipple surgeries, piercings, mothers under 18 years of age, non-English speakers needing assistance, births before 37 weeks' gestation, infants with oral anomalies, prior oral surgeries, or diagnosed health conditions.

Mothers completed a demographic questionnaire at recruitment. The study received approval from The University of Western Australia (RA/4/1/7863), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to participation.

### A new method for inverted nipple treatment with diamond-shaped dermal flaps and acellular dermal matrix: a preliminary study [^116zi5hc]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with inverted nipples experience various uncomfortable complications, including recurring infections. When the severity level of an inverted nipple is higher than grade II, as classified by Han and Hong, surgical correction is required. Many methods have been proposed to treat the inverted nipple. However, even after treatment, recurrence has always posed a problem. Thus, we propose a new method using the diamond-shaped dermal flap with acellular dermal matrix to treat the inverted nipple.

- **Method**: Between March 2019 and February 2022, a total of five patients with grade III inverted nipples were studied. Two diamond-shaped flaps were designed at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions of the nipple. This dermal flap was elevated and wrapped around the nipple column at the nipple base. The lactiferous ducts in females were all divided. Additionally, acellular dermal matrix was inserted to fill the dead space of the nipple base. The nipple height and scar evaluation were conducted at 6 months and 12 months postoperatively. Overall satisfaction and complications were also assessed at the last visit.

- **Results**: The inverted nipple was resolved, and no complications, such as hematoma, infection, and necrosis, were reported. The projection was maintained without any recurrence, with a slight decrease of 1.5 mm (a reduction of 20%) in median value. There were no major or minor complications found except for a few small scars, and the patient was satisfied with the esthetic outcomes during the follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: This is a fast and simple technique for the surgical correction of inverted nipples.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^113Aud5H]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

In April 2021, the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District Public Health Unit (Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) was notified of three patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections secondary to skin piercings performed at the same salon. Active case finding through laboratories, clinician alerts, and monitoring hospital visits for piercing-related infections identified additional cases across New South Wales, and consumers were alerted. We identified 13 confirmed and 40 probable case-patients and linked clinical isolates by genomic sequencing. Ten confirmed case-patients had used the same brand and batch of aftercare solution. We isolated P. aeruginosa from opened and unopened bottles of this solution batch that matched the outbreak strain identified by genomic sequencing. Piercing-related infections returned to baseline levels after this solution batch was recalled. Early outbreak detection and source attribution via genomic sequencing are crucial for controlling outbreaks linked to contaminated products. Manufacturing standards for nonsterile cosmetic products and guidance for piercing aftercare warrant review.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). This information is intended to aid in the safe and effective use of this medication. It is not a disclosure of all administration instructions or all possible adverse or unintended effects.

- **Important administration instructions**: Instruct patients to discontinue Bryhali Lotion when psoriasis is controlled. Inform patients that Bryhali Lotion is to be used as directed by the physician and should not be used for longer than the prescribed time period. Total dosage should not exceed 50 grams per week [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Instruct patients to avoid bandaging, wrapping, or otherwise occluding the treatment area(s), unless directed by their physician. Advise patients to avoid use on the face, groin, or axillae [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Inform patients that Bryhali Lotion is for external use only. Advise patients that Bryhali Lotion is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Breastfeeding women should not apply Bryhali Lotion directly to the nipple and areola to avoid directly exposing the infant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

- **Effects on endocrine system**: Bryhali Lotion may cause HPA axis suppression. Advise patients that the use of topical corticosteroids, including Bryhali Lotion, may require periodic evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Topical corticosteroids may have other endocrine effects.

### Is chronic nipple piercing associated with hyperprolactinemia [^111mHCGW]. Pituitary (2013). Low credibility.

Literature on hyperprolactinemia in the setting of a nipple piercing is limited to individuals with concomitant breast or chest wall infection. It is unclear if chronic nipple stimulation from a piercing alone can cause sustained elevations of serum prolactin. Nipple piercing is emerging as a more mainstream societal form of body art, and the answer to this clinical question would potentially alter patient management. Our aim was to assess serum prolactin levels in subjects with nipple piercings.

Inclusion criteria were as follows: men and women aged 18 years or older with nipple piercings present for more than 6 months. Exclusion criteria included: women who are pregnant, lactating, or less than 6 months postpartum; subjects on medications known to increase prolactin levels; those with chest wall or breast infections at the time of phlebotomy or conditions known to be associated with hyperprolactinemia. Three men and eight women were enrolled. Median ages for men and women were 33 years (range 24–42) and 27 years (range 23–42), respectively. All except one subject had bilateral piercings. The median interval from nipple piercing to blood draw was 4.0 years (range 2.0–12.0).

None of the subjects had hyperprolactinemia. Median prolactin levels for men and women were 5.6 ng/mL (range 3.8–7.4) and 8.0 ng/mL (range 2.8–10.9), respectively. Our results suggest that, in the absence of any concomitant infection, chronic nipple piercing is not associated with hyperprolactinemia.

### Body piercing complicated by atypical mycobacterial infections [^1177wgPP]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Body piercing is a growing trend, especially among young people, but the literature on complications of piercing consists mostly of case reports involving ear piercing. Previously reported complications of piercing include contact dermatitis, keloids, traumatic tearing, viral transmission, and bacterial infections. We report two patients who presented with atypical mycobacterial infections at body piercing sites. It is important to recognize the association of piercing and mycobacterial infections so that tissue can be obtained for histopathologic examination and appropriate culture.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If ofloxacin otic solution ear drops are not used for the full duration prescribed by the doctor, the infection may be more likely to return.

- **Missed dose**:
	- **Ear Canal Infection**: It is important to take the drops every day. If you miss a dose scheduled for earlier in the day (e.g. 8 AM), take that day's dose as soon as possible, then return to your regular daily dosing schedule.
	- **Middle Ear Infection**: If a dose is missed, give it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and return to the regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose unless the doctor has instructed you to do so. If the infection does not improve after one week, consult your doctor. If you experience two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended to see your doctor for further evaluation.

- **Activities to avoid while using ofloxacin otic solution**: The infected ear(s) should remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet, and avoid swimming unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

### Silicone nipple shields: An innovative postoperative dressing technique after nipple reconstruction [^1153JNkz]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The newly reconstructed nipple is extremely sensitive to mechanical pressure and shearing forces, which can cause flap necrosis and sloughing of the skin, eventually promoting infection. Available dressing solutions are cumbersome, inefficient, displeasing, or otherwise not readily obtainable.

- **Methods**: In this study, 10 patients with newly reconstructed nipples were instructed to use breastfeeding nipple shields as the sole means of nipple dressing after the reconstruction procedure.

- **Results**: No complications were observed overall. Patients reported full adherence to the postoperative dressing regimen as well as ease of use, availability, low costs, and pleasing aesthetic appearance under garments.

- **Discussion**: Silicone breastfeeding nipple shields offer an efficient, affable, cheap, widely available, and aesthetically pleasing form of postoperative dressing for reconstructed nipples. Their use may enhance patient compliance with the dressing regimen and lower the postoperative complication rate.

### Dicloxacillin sodium [^114V38zv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including dicloxacillin sodium capsules, should only be used to treat bacterial infections; they do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When dicloxacillin sodium capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by dicloxacillin sodium capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics and usually subsides when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes, after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever), even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Patients receiving penicillins should be given the following information and instructions by the physician: They should be informed that penicillin is an antibacterial agent that works with the body's natural defenses to control certain types of infections. Patients should also be advised not to take the drug if they have previously had an allergic reaction to any form of penicillin and to inform the physician accordingly.

### Gonal-f [^112AQHSq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise women not to breastfeed because the secretion of prolactin during lactation can result in an inadequate response to ovarian stimulation with Gonal-F [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

- **Dosing and use of Gonal-F multi dose**: Instruct women and men on the correct usage and dosing of Gonal-F [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4, 2.5)]. Caution against changing the dosage or the schedule of administration unless instructed to do so by a healthcare provider.

- **Duration and necessary monitoring in patients undergoing therapy with Gonal-F**: Prior to beginning therapy with Gonal-F, inform women and men about the time commitment and monitoring procedures necessary for treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4, 2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

- **Instructions regarding a missed dose**: Inform women and men that if they miss or forget to take a dose of Gonal-F, they should not double the next dose. Instead, they should call their healthcare provider for further dosing instructions.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: Cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: A randomized treatment trial [^112Q5Ewc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Participation: Not all the women who were eligible for the trial were interested in taking part (see Figure 1, ROBIn Trial Profile). Some women expressed a reluctance to take antibiotics, while others were overwhelmed with the difficulties they were experiencing and preferred not to participate in a trial. The researchers had previously conducted studies involving breastfeeding women, which had high rates of participation, and had expected women to be more interested in taking part in a trial that aimed to prevent mastitis. However, we should have expected a lower participation rate, as this study involved the possibility of taking a medication, particularly an antibiotic.

- **Less than anticipated incidence of cracked nipples**: A total of approximately 17,000 women give birth in these hospitals each year. We estimated that 80% of women start breastfeeding, 5% develop cracked nipple(s), 80% would be eligible, and 95% would agree to participate, thus there would be 537 eligible women per year. We anticipated that we would recruit approximately ten women with cracked nipples per week. It would therefore take 57 weeks (57 × 10) to recruit the total sample.

However, recruitment was slow, as very few women were identified with damaged nipples. Hospital staff made unsolicited remarks that nipple damage was seen much less frequently than in the past. Midwives have been trained to help women position the baby and attach the baby at the breast; women are reporting the presence of nipple pain, and any nipple damage is usually identified at an early stage.

### Diagnosis and management of a herpes nipple infection that resulted in neonatal HSV encephalitis [^117PBZQH]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Nipple dermatitis and pain are common postpartum issues with several aetiologies. Symptoms may be due to modifiable factors such as improper latch techniques or flange size. Other causes include dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, or infectious aetiologies such as HSV, bacterial infections, or candida. After a thorough history is obtained, a thorough physical exam, including a breast exam, is necessary to identify any swelling, erythema, ulcers, fissures, vesicles, or masses.

The most common cause of nipple fissure is poor latch technique, which includes suboptimal infant positioning and either excessive or inadequate sucking by the neonate. Similarly, incorrect use of a breast pump or a poorly fitted flange can cause nipple trauma and pain, which can be addressed with the help of lactation specialists. Our patient had preterm infants and had attempted direct breastfeeding during her hospital course but was primarily pumping to express breastmilk, putting her at increased risk of nipple trauma.

Pre-existing skin breakdown at the nipple can serve as the entry point for pathogens; conversely, inflammation and irritation due to infection can precipitate nipple cracking. Our patient had some erythema at the site of the fissure, but in the absence of streaking erythema, purulent discharge, or systemic symptoms, secondary or bacterial infection was lower on the differential. Further, her symptoms were not consistent with candidiasis since the patient did not have burning or constant breast pain, no recent antibiotic use, and no history of recent vaginal thrush.

### Complications of body piercing [^111aZ4mp]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The trend of body piercing at sites other than the earlobe has grown in popularity in the past decade. The tongue, lips, nose, eyebrows, nipples, navel, and genitals may be pierced. Complications of body piercing include local and systemic infections, poor cosmesis, and foreign body rejection. Swelling and tooth fracture are common problems after tongue piercing. Minor infections, allergic contact dermatitis, keloid formation, and traumatic tearing may occur after piercing of the earlobe. "High" ear piercing through the ear cartilage is associated with more serious infections and disfigurement. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are advised for the treatment of auricular perichondritis because of their antipseudomonal activity. Many complications from piercing are body-site-specific or related to the piercing technique used. Navel, nipple, and genital piercings often have prolonged healing times. Family physicians should be prepared to address complications of body piercing and provide accurate information to patients.

### Diagnosis and management of a herpes nipple infection that resulted in neonatal HSV encephalitis [^115cXrfQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

It is important to identify active herpetic lesions of the breast in a lactating person as this is a contraindication to breastfeeding. However, in patients with a prior history of HSV, if there are no active lesions on the breast, then direct breastfeeding is considered safe. For those who develop herpes nipple infections, limited data are available regarding the optimal treatment of the breast lesions and the timing of resuming breastfeeding. Recommendations for mothers who wish to continue breastfeeding with an active herpes infection of the breast include maintaining expressing/pumping and discarding the milk until the infection has been cleared.

Here, we present the work-up and management of a primigravida in her 30s who presented to our institution's postpartum clinic approximately 3 weeks after delivery via low transverse caesarean section. She delivered dichorionic diamniotic twins at 33 weeks of gestation and reported a painful cracked nipple at this visit. She had no known history of HSV, but her twin neonates were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) for disseminated HSV prior to the onset of visible maternal lesions.

### Jasmiel [^113SEPMm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any of the above conditions, as they can recommend another method of birth control. Birth control pills do not protect you against any sexually transmitted disease, including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Do not skip any pills, even if you do not have sex often. If you miss a period, you could be pregnant. However, some women miss periods or have light periods while on birth control pills, even when they are not pregnant. Contact your healthcare provider for advice if you think you are pregnant, miss one period and have not taken your birth control pills every day, or miss two periods in a row.

Birth control pills should not be taken during pregnancy. However, birth control pills taken by accident during pregnancy are not known to cause birth defects.

You should stop taking Jasmiel at least four weeks before you have major surgery and not restart it until at least two weeks after the surgery due to an increased risk of blood clots.

If you are breastfeeding, consider another birth control method until you are ready to stop breastfeeding. Birth control pills that contain estrogen, like Jasmiel, may decrease the amount of milk you produce. A small amount of the pill's hormones may pass into breast milk.

### Cefotaxime [^115E5gXX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For adults, the dosage and route of administration should be determined by the susceptibility of the causative organisms, the severity of the infection, and the condition of the patient. Cefotaxime may be administered intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV) after reconstitution. The maximum daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams. If C. trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added because cefotaxime sodium has no activity against this organism.

To prevent postoperative infection in contaminated or potentially contaminated surgery, a single 1 gram dose is recommended, administered IM or IV 30 to 90 minutes prior to the start of surgery. In cesarean section patients, the first dose of 1 gram is administered intravenously as soon as the umbilical cord is clamped. The second and third doses should be given as 1 gram intravenously or intramuscularly at 6 and 12 hours after the first dose.

For neonates, infants, and children, the following dosage schedule is recommended:

- **Neonates (birth to 1 month)**:
	- **0–1 week of age**: 50 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours IV.
	- **1–4 weeks of age**: 50 mg/kg per dose every 8 hours IV.
It is not necessary to differentiate between premature and normal-gestational age infants.

- **Infants and children (1 month to 12 years)**:
	- For body weights less than 50 kg, the recommended daily dose is 50 to 180 mg/kg IM or IV, divided into four to six equal doses. Higher dosages should be used for more severe or serious infections, including meningitis. For body weights 50 kg or more, the usual adult dosage should be used.

### Fuzeon [^114U5Eg6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

To assure the safe and effective use of Fuzeon, the following information and instructions should be given to patients:

- **Injection site reactions**: Inform patients that injection site reactions occur in almost all patients taking Fuzeon. Patients must be familiar with the Fuzeon Injection Instructions for instructions on how to appropriately inject Fuzeon and how to carefully monitor for signs or symptoms of cellulitis or local infection. Instruct patients when to contact their healthcare provider about these reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Administration with Biojector 2000**: Inform patients that nerve pain (neuralgia and/or paresthesia) associated with administration at anatomical sites where large nerves course close to the skin, bruising, and hematomas have occurred with use of the Biojector 2000 needle-free device for administration of Fuzeon [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Post-injection bleeding**: Advise patients about the risk of post-injection bleeding if they are receiving anticoagulants or have coagulation disorders such as hemophilia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Systemic hypersensitivity**: Advise patients of the possibility of a systemic hypersensitivity reaction to Fuzeon. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and immediately seek medical evaluation if they develop signs or symptoms of systemic hypersensitivity such as combinations of rash, fever, nausea and vomiting, chills, rigors, and/or hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions].

### Investigation of infection control practices and knowledge of hepatitis C among body-piercing practitioners [^117HoYhB]. American Journal of Infection Control (2003). Low credibility.

Body piercing has become increasingly popular, leading to concerns about the associated risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission during piercing. Many body-piercing practitioners (BPPs) have recently entered the industry; however, little is known about their training and understanding of HCV transmission. This study measured BPP knowledge about HCV and infection control procedures. It also tested for HCV contamination within body-piercing establishments.

- **Methods**: BPPs completed a questionnaire about the number and type of piercings performed, their methods for disposing of and reprocessing piercing equipment, and their training and knowledge of HCV. Environmental swabs were collected and tested for HCV RNA.

- **Results**: BPPs at 35 establishments were recruited. A total of 31 BPPs had training as a BPP, ranging from 1 hour to 6 years (median: 15 days). Reprocessing of equipment was variable; 8 establishments inadequately reprocessed piercing guns and 4 inadequately reprocessed forceps or guiding equipment. All BPPs were aware of HCV, but many did not know how the virus was transmitted. A total of 19 BPPs performed extra cleaning after piercing a customer known to be HCV positive. No environmental swabs tested were positive for HCV RNA.

- **Conclusions**: This study showed that many BPPs had inadequate training and lacked knowledge and understanding of HCV transmission, infection control, and universal precautions. To reduce the risk of HCV transmission, BPPs should be required to undergo formal training in infection control before being registered as BPPs.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^111GRgo9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

The first limitation of our study is that not all suspected case-patients had clinical isolates collected, and not all probable cases had isolates retained for further characterization. Second, not all consumers kept their bottles of aftercare solution or could recall the brand or batch number. Third, not all emergency departments in NSW are covered by PHREDDS; thus, some cases might have been missed. Nevertheless, sufficient evidence was available to issue timely clinician and consumer alerts and, eventually, a product recall, which prevented further infections.

Multiple outbreaks of P. aeruginosa infections from at least two continents have been caused by piercing aftercare products, suggesting that higher manufacturing standards might be required for such solutions. In Australia, although these solutions are applied to recently penetrated skin, they are generally not regulated as therapeutic goods. Consumers expect aftercare solutions to be sterile, yet manufacturing processes reviewed in this investigation indicated that sterility could not be assured despite the manufacturer's intentions. Management of this outbreak has shown the importance of quality control and sterility assurance in manufacturing such solutions. Existing measures routinely and effectively imposed on regulated therapeutic goods to reduce contamination risk should also be applied to aftercare solutions, such as objectionable organism and microbial risk assessments and sterility testing and control. Early detection of pathogen clusters linked to contaminated products and source attribution is crucial.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^117XT97L]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Methods

- **Initial case definitions**: Initially, broad case definitions were used to increase the sensitivity of active case finding. A confirmed case-patient was defined as a person who had a P. aeruginosa infection following a recent ear piercing. A probable case-patient was identified as someone who had no cultures taken or culture growth but had attended the implicated facility, other facilities of the same franchise, or used the same brand of aftercare solution.

- **Emergency department syndromic surveillance**: The NSW Public Health Rapid Emergency, Disease, and Syndromic Surveillance (PHREDSS) system monitors treatment sought at most public hospital emergency departments in the state in near real-time. Patients are coded according to their illness and discharge destination (e.g. admitted or discharged home). Potential infection cases were identified at hospitals via PHREDSS by using keyword searches.

- **Initial investigations**: Information was obtained on procedures performed on confirmed case-patients, aftercare solutions used, notifications and complaints, and client lists from the initially implicated piercing salon. Additional cases of piercing-related infections in residents of Greater Sydney, Wollongong, and Newcastle were identified by examining the PHREDSS database.

- **Statewide investigations and case finding**: Starting April 30, 2021, weekly PHREDSS line lists of emergency department visits and admissions for piercing-related infections were provided to other public health units (PHUs) across NSW.

### Correction of inverted nipple: An alternative method using continuous elastic outside distraction [^115Qu4Bi]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Inverted nipple, which is defined as a nipple located on a plane lower than the areola, presents both functional and cosmetic problems. It is a source of repeated irritation and inflammation and interferes with nursing. In addition, its abnormal appearance may cause psychological distress. Considering its underlying pathophysiologic components and severity, a number of techniques have been introduced for the correction of this anomaly.

Most of these techniques involve extensive skin incision around the nipple, which may jeopardize the blood and nerve supply to the nipple or create an aesthetically objectionable amount of scar tissue. For correcting the inverted nipple, the authors introduce an alternative, simple method using continuous elastic outside distraction. Compared with other methods using outside distraction, the authors used an adjustable elastic instrument made of steel wire, spring, and plastic syringe; continuous distraction of the inverted nipples; and sustaining for 3 to 6 months.

From August 2002 to December 2003, 14 patients (26 nipples) were treated. Twelve patients had bilateral inverted nipples. Patient ages at operation ranged from 14 to 40 years (mean age, 24 years). All nipples were congenital, and they had no previous operation. Six nipples were grade I, nine nipples were grade II, and 11 nipples were grade III, according to the classification of inverted nipple by Han and Hong. The mean follow-up period was 7.3 months (range, 3–12 months). Follow-up examinations revealed no evidence of recurrence of inversion. There were no complications associated with the surgery.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^1129LnQd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

In April 2021, the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District Public Health Unit (Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) was notified of three patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections secondary to skin piercings performed at the same salon. Active case finding through laboratories, clinician alerts, and monitoring hospital visits for piercing-related infections identified additional cases across New South Wales, and consumers were alerted. We identified 13 confirmed and 40 probable case-patients and linked clinical isolates by genomic sequencing. Ten confirmed case-patients had used the same brand and batch of aftercare solution. We isolated P. aeruginosa from opened and unopened bottles of this solution batch that matched the outbreak strain identified by genomic sequencing. Piercing-related infections returned to baseline levels after this solution batch was recalled. Early outbreak detection and source attribution via genomic sequencing are crucial for controlling outbreaks linked to contaminated products. Manufacturing standards for nonsterile cosmetic products and guidance for piercing aftercare warrant review.

### Zyvox [^11168A2z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adult patients with clinically documented complicated skin and skin structure infections were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy trial. This trial compared medications administered intravenously and then orally for a total of 10 to 21 days of treatment. One group received Zyvox I.V. Injection 600 mg every 12 hours followed by Zyvox Tablets 600 mg every 12 hours. The other group received oxacillin 2 g every 6 hours intravenously, followed by dicloxacillin 500 mg every 6 hours orally. Patients could receive concomitant aztreonam if clinically indicated.

In total, 400 linezolid-treated and 419 oxacillin-treated patients were enrolled. Among these, 245 (61%) linezolid-treated patients and 242 (58%) oxacillin-treated patients were clinically evaluable. The cure rates in these clinically evaluable patients were 90% for linezolid-treated patients and 85% for oxacillin-treated patients. A modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis included 316 linezolid-treated patients and 313 oxacillin-treated patients who met all criteria for study entry. In the MITT analysis, the cure rates were 86% for linezolid-treated patients and 82% for oxacillin-treated patients. The cure rates by pathogen for microbiologically evaluable patients are provided in Table 13.

A separate study offered additional data on the use of Zyvox in treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. This study was a randomized, open-label trial conducted in hospitalized adult patients.
