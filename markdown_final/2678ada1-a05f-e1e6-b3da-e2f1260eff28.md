## Question

how long before procedure should heparin drip be stopped

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long before a procedure a therapeutic-dose intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) drip should be stopped. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of UFH and how dose intensity affects half-life. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines recommend for pre-procedural interruption. Next, I will consider procedure-specific nuances and whether any exceptions extend the interval. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation and confirm post-procedural resumption guidance to keep the plan complete.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology, because timing hinges on it. UFH exhibits a dose-dependent elimination half-life of roughly 30–120 minutes, with higher anticoagulant intensity (higher aPTT or anti-Xa) tending toward the longer end of that range; this dose dependence is why a fixed interval is reasonable despite interpatient variability [^113LAAPz].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline consensus before jumping to a number. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) 2022 perioperative guideline explicitly recommends stopping therapeutic-dose IV UFH at least 4 hours before an elective surgery or procedure, and this is echoed in multiple ACCP summaries and executive communications, reflecting a conditional recommendation with very low certainty but grounded in pharmacokinetic reasoning and clinical practice [^117NPHGc] [^115vNp4z] [^112V33gj] [^112gYjuA].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any credible sources advocate a longer interval. Some ACCP sections note that, based on half-life, stopping 4–6 hours before surgery can eliminate residual anticoagulant effect, which aligns with the same pharmacokinetic logic and supports extending to 6 hours in higher-intensity infusions or when bleeding risk is very high, though the formal recommendation remains ≥ 4 hours [^115vNp4z].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating UFH with LMWH. LMWH has a longer half-life and different guidance; ACCP suggests holding the last LMWH dose about 24 hours pre-procedure, which is not applicable to IV UFH and should not be mixed up here [^111vx8Ht] [^115ELG6o].

> Next, I should review procedure-specific contexts. For neurointerventional procedures, some stroke protocols prohibit IV heparin for 24 hours post-thrombectomy and rely on heparinized flush rather than systemic UFH, but that pertains to intra- and post-procedural management, not pre-procedural interruption, so it doesn't change the ≥ 4-hour rule for stopping a drip before an elective case [^116mGyeG] [^116KbAtf].

> Let me synthesize the practical answer. For a patient on a therapeutic-dose IV UFH infusion, the standard recommendation is to stop the infusion at least 4 hours before the scheduled procedure. In patients at very high bleeding risk or when the infusion has been particularly intense, extending to 6 hours is reasonable but not mandated by guidelines, and the decision should be individualized and coordinated with the procedural team [^117NPHGc] [^115vNp4z].

> I should confirm post-procedural planning because it influences pre-procedural decisions. ACCP suggests resuming therapeutic-dose IV UFH no sooner than 24 hours after the procedure once hemostasis is secured, which reinforces the principle of minimizing bleeding exposure and explains why stopping ≥ 4 hours pre-procedure is typically sufficient to mitigate intra-procedural bleeding risk [^1127LBdM] [^116ko8a3].

> Final check and bottom line: stop the therapeutic-dose IV heparin drip at least 4 hours before the procedure, consider 6 hours if bleeding risk is very high or the anticoagulant intensity has been high, and coordinate resumption for at least 24 hours post-procedure once hemostasis is confirmed. This balances pharmacokinetics, guideline recommendations, and procedural safety [^117NPHGc] [^115vNp4z] [^1127LBdM].

---

Stop the heparin drip **≥ 4 hours before the procedure** [^117NPHGc] to minimize bleeding risk, as this interval aligns with UFH's half-life and allows clotting to normalize [^115vNp4z]. For high bleeding risk or neuraxial procedures, **extend to 6 hours** if feasible, and confirm hemostasis before restarting anticoagulation post-procedure [^115vNp4z] [^1127LBdM].

---

## Pharmacokinetic rationale

UFH has a **dose-dependent half-life** of about 30–120 minutes [^113LAAPz]; stopping ≥ 4 hours before a procedure typically allows clotting to return to baseline, though this varies with dose and aPTT/anti-Xa activity [^115vNp4z].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

ACCP 2022 recommends stopping therapeutic-dose IV UFH **≥ 4 hours before elective procedures** [^117NPHGc] to reduce bleeding, with conditional, very low-certainty evidence [^115vNp4z]. Some guidance allows 4–6 hours based on pharmacokinetics and procedural bleeding risk [^115vNp4z].

---

## Procedure-specific considerations

- **High bleeding risk or neuraxial anesthesia**: Consider stopping 6 hours pre-procedure if feasible, balancing thrombotic risk [^115vNp4z].
- **Low bleeding risk**: 4 hours is usually sufficient [^117NPHGc].
- **Emergency procedures**: Use clinical judgment; protamine reversal may be needed if immediate reversal is required [^117FPr8h].

---

## Post-procedural management

Resume UFH **≥ 24 hours post-procedure** once hemostasis is secured, adjusting to procedural bleeding risk and patient factors [^1127LBdM] [^116ko8a3].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended interruption** |
|-|-|
| Standard elective procedure | ≥ 4 hours [^117NPHGc] |
| High bleeding risk or neuraxial anesthesia | 6 hours (if feasible) [^115vNp4z] |
| Emergency procedure | Clinical judgment; consider protamine reversal [^117FPr8h] |

---

Stopping the heparin drip **≥ 4 hours before the procedure** is the standard recommendation, with extension to 6 hours for high bleeding risk or neuraxial procedures, and resumption after hemostasis is confirmed [^117NPHGc] [^115vNp4z] [^1127LBdM].

### The variable use of heparin through intravenous bolus and flush fluid systems during endovascular stroke treatment, a world-wide survey [^112aRAtx]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Use of heparin during EVT varies widely among physicians worldwide. The amount of heparin administered through flush fluids is mostly unknown but can reach high levels if not paying attention. Neurointerventionalists who perform EVT for AIS should be aware of this, especially when using high drip rates, multiple infusion bags, and during long procedures. Studying optimal heparin levels in flush fluids would be needed in future research, while heparin flush doses should be considered in trials regarding periprocedural anticoagulants. This survey underlines the need for guidelines or recommendations on heparin use, either as bolus or in flush fluids, during EVT for AIS.

a Responders could select different options for this question, therefore the total number exceeds 231

Number of infusion bags / lines

The majority of respondents who administered heparinized flush fluids used three infusion bags (75/148; 50.7%), while 12/148 (8.1%) used four infusion bags during the procedure.

Preferred drip rate for flush fluids heparin

Among the participants, 168 treating physicians administer heparinized flush fluid alone and 36 in combination with an IV bolus. Of the 204 responders that use heparin in flush fluids, 148 (72.5%) answered the question on how and how much they set their preferred drip rate. The majority (135/148; 91.2%) set their drip rate manually. As to the question of what drip rate the interventionists preferred when they set their drip rate automatically 132 answered, of which 61 (46%) indicated a rate of 0.5 drips per second (i.e. 90 mL/h); 43 (32.6%) indicated a rate of 1 drip per second (i.e. 180 mL/h); 10 (7.6%) indicated a rate of 2 drips per second (i.e. 360 mL/h); 15 (11.4%) indicated a rate of 1 drip per 5 s (i.e. 36 mL/h) and 3 (2.3%) indicated that they state their rate according to the heart rate (Fig. 1).

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic medications… [^1136WZW8]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Vitamin K Antagonist Medications For patients taking the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, continue the medication if bleeding risk is minimal. With low to moderate or high bleeding risk, stop warfarin; patients with high thrombosis risk should receive heparin before and after surgery. In patients who are at low to moderate risk for thromboembolism, no bridging with heparin is recommended. For atrial fibrillation, the benefits of bridging are less certain because the stroke risk over a few days is low. Warfarin should be stopped at least five days before the procedure and restarted 12 to 24 hours after the procedure if hemostasis has been obtained. Heparin bridging can occur with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. If intravenous unfractionated heparin is used, heparin should be stopped at least four hours before the procedure and restarted at least 24 hours after the procedure.

If low-molecular-weight heparin is used, give one-half the daily dosage 24 hours before the procedure, and wait at least 24 hours after surgery to give the first postoperative dose of low-molecular-weight heparin. If the surgery has a high bleeding risk, wait 48 to 72 hours before restarting heparin to ensure hemostasis. Management of Antiplatelet Medications Continuing aspirin is recommended for all noncardiac surgery. If stopping aspirin, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends stopping within seven days of surgery. P2Y. 12 platelet receptor inhibitors should be stopped before surgery. Stop clopidogrel five days before surgery, ticagrelor three to five days before surgery, and prasugrel seven to 10 days before surgery. All P2Y 12 inhibitors can be restarted within 24 hours of surgery if hemostasis has been obtained. 12 inhibitor and continue aspirin therapy.

Bridging these gaps with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications does not improve outcomes. Because these medications can be held one to two days before surgery and restarted one to two days after surgery, bridging with heparin is not recommended, unlike with warfarin. The other interesting recommendation is to continue aspirin through the surgery because of little, if any, increase in bleeding. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Assistant Medical Editor.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: management of individuals with bleeding or thrombotic disorders undergoing abortion [^116ufVzy]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Anticoagulation bridging — who and how to bridge — should be used selectively for high thrombotic risk. If an individual is particularly high risk (e.g., pulmonary embolus within the last 3 months, severe thrombophilia, or artificial heart valve), bridging anticoagulation in the form of intravenous or low molecular weight heparin can be employed only after multidisciplinary discussion. Bridging is advised when the INR is down to 2, unfractionated heparin should be stopped 6 hours before the procedure and low molecular weight heparin should be held on the morning of the procedure, and both can be restarted 6–12 hours after the procedure unless hemostasis intervention is needed.

Different interruption and resumption timings of antithrombotic drugs under risk classifications

Peri-procedural management of antithrombotics ● Low-risk procedures: ○ Consensus across guidelines: Continue ASA (monotherapy or as part of DAPT) and warfarin. ○ DOACs (ASGE/JGES/APAGE) ● Generally recommend continuation. ● BSGE Exception: Suggests discontinuation, with timing adjusted by creatinine clearance. ● High-risk procedures: ○ ASA (all guidelines): Continued. ○ Non-ASA Antiplatelets (e.g. thienopyridines): Discontinued (detailed in). ○ Warfarin (all guidelines): Held preprocedure with LMWH/heparin bridging. Restarted post-procedure, resumption timing varies among the guidelines. ○ JGES-Specific Approach: Supports cilostazol as an alternative to ASA in select cases. ○ DOACs: ● ASGE/ESGE/APAGE: Discontinuation based on CrCl, no bridging recommended. ● JGES: Bridging advised in certain cases. ● Post-procedural resumption (all guidelines): Once hemostasis confirmed.
Bridging and international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring ● Warfarin bridging (all guidelines): ○ LMWH/heparin substitution before high-risk procedures. ○ Variability in bridging duration. ● INR assessment (all guidelines): ○ Preprocedure INR check mandatory to guide discontinuation. ○ Heparin stopped once INR therapeutic post-procedure.

### Factors in initial anticoagulation choice in hospitalized patients with pulmonary embolism [^113eWcMY]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Fear of Decompensation

Fear of decompensation and/or bleeding from the PE was a central factor associated with UFH use cited by participants. Participants voiced less concern for or knowledge of iatrogenic bleeding caused by the anticoagulant and instead worried about how to manage bleeding should it arise. Those who used an LMWH-dominant approach did not voice this fear, noting that few patients ultimately require catheter-directed treatment or rescue therapy. Furthermore, they reported working in systems in which LMWH was not a contraindication to either thrombolysis or catheter-directed treatment. Nearly all participants specifically cited the quick off of UFH, valuing the short half-life of UFH, and cited that UFH afforded the ability for any procedures a patient may need even if none was anticipated.

Misperception of Pharmacology of Anticoagulants

In many cases, participants reported choosing UFH because they perceived it to be stronger and have a quicker onset of action than other anticoagulants. The maxim "quick on, quick off" (ie, near-immediate achievement of therapeutic effect and fast wearing off once medication is stopped) was used nearly ubiquitously by participants. The perception among participants was that because UFH was given intravenously, it achieved therapeutic anticoagulation nearly immediately. The perception of UFH as stronger than other anticoagulants was particularly valued when clinicians were worried about substantial clot burden or potential decompensation. As an emergency medicine physician from a community practice in the South said, "[UFH] is an [intravenous] drip. So, in my mind, it's gonna be quicker".

Toward the end of many interviews, several participants reconsidered their statements on the quick on of UFH. For example, a hospitalist from a hybrid practice in the Midwest, who stated at the beginning of the interview, "You're already anticoagulated as soon as you start [UFH] and there's minimal follow up" later in the interview stated, "I would actually consider people who are on LMWH therapeutic more quickly than those who are on UFH, because you have to check… you know, because of needing to keep an eye on the PTTs [partial thromboplastin times]… sometimes people don't really budge after their initial dosing".

### The bridging conundrum: perioperative management of direct oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism [^1111NE6p]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are currently treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Before an invasive procedure or surgery, clinicians face the challenging decision of how to best manage DOACs. Should the DOAC be held, for how long, and are there instances where bridging with other anticoagulants should be considered? Although clinical trials indicate that most patients taking DOACs for atrial fibrillation do not require bridging anticoagulation, the optimal strategy for patients with a history of VTE is undefined. In this review, we present a case-based discussion for DOAC interruption perioperatively in patients receiving anticoagulation for management of VTE.

### Liver biopsy [^116Xuvh4]. Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Liver biopsy medication management highlights that an important issue surrounds management of antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant drugs, that little data are available to guide timing of discontinuation and the general consensus is that these medications should be discontinued from several to 10 days prior to the procedure, and that it is generally recommended that warfarin should be discontinued at least 5 days before the scheduled procedure with the decision to obtain a preprocedure PT individualized; extrapolation from other organs may not be appropriate, newer antiplatelet agent data are inadequate to make firm recommendations, any decision to stop anticlotting drugs should be handled on a case-by-case basis with risks weighed, patients should take other prescribed drugs the morning of the procedure with a few sips of water, data on peri-biopsy heparin use are lacking though these compounds are generally short-acting and can be stopped in a shorter period than warfarin or antiplatelet medications, and for diabetes mellitus it is recommended that the patient continue antidiabetic therapy with possible insulin dose adjustment particularly if the patient is made NPO (that is, nothing peroral) prior to the biopsy.

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^1118PP1p]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy, to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging, but their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1124McrQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The risk and benefit of periprocedural heparin bridging is not completely clarified. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation prior to invasive procedures or surgery. Heparin bridging was associated with lower risks of thromboembolism and bleeding compared to non-bridging. PubMed, Ovid and Elsevier, and Cochrane Library (2000–2016) were searched for English-language studies. Studies comparing interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging and continuous oral anticoagulation in patients at moderate-to-high thromboembolic risk before invasive procedures were included. Primary outcomes were thromboembolic events and bleeding events. Mantel-Haenszel method and random-effects models were used to analyze the pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for thromboembolic and bleeding risks. Eighteen studies (six randomized controlled trials and 12 cohort studies) were included (N = 23364). There was no difference in thromboembolic risk between bridged and non-bridged patients (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.61–2.58; RCTs: RR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.23–2.24; cohorts: RR: 1.45, 95% CI: 0.63–3.37). However, bridging anticoagulation was associated with higher risk of overall bleeding (RR: 2.83, 95% CI: 2.00–4.01; RCTs: RR: 2.24, 95% CI: 0.99–5.09; cohorts: RR: 3.09, 95% CI: 2.07–4.62) and major bleeding (RR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.78–5.06; RCTs: RR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.29–4.76; cohorts: RR: 3.22, 95% CI: 1.65–6.32). Bridging anticoagulation was associated with increased bleeding risk compared to non-bridging. Thromboembolism risk was similar between two strategies. Our results do not support routine use of bridging during anticoagulation interruption.

"The heparin dose should be adjusted to maintain an ACT of at least 300–350 seconds throughout the procedure", with "Approximately one-third of the Task Force" using "a target ACT of 350 seconds". "It is also recommended that heparinized saline be infused continuously through each transseptal sheath". "Heparin infusion can be discontinued… when the ACT is less than 200–250 seconds", or "the heparin effect can be reversed with protamine", an approach "used by approximately 50% of Task Force members", though "Controlled data to support either of these specific suggestions are lacking".

### To measure or not to measure direct oral anticoagulants before surgery or invasive procedures [^113Q36mY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) may need interruption of treatment before surgery or invasive procedures. Owing to their favorable pharmacokinetics, DOAC could be interrupted for a fixed number of days before surgery or invasive procedures without laboratory testing. However, there are a number of issues that raise concerns about the safety of this strategy. In contrast, laboratory testing prior to surgery or invasive procedures would provide a direct assessment of the residual drug concentration and minimize the risk of bleeding. This forum is aimed at discussing the pros and cons of the two strategies and fostering discussion on this important issue. Overall, the laboratory strategy appears superior in terms of patient safety and should be considered in patients undergoing surgical or invasive procedures.

Abstract

The risk and benefit of periprocedural heparin bridging is not completely clarified. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation prior to invasive procedures or surgery. Heparin bridging was associated with lower risks of thromboembolism and bleeding compared to non‐bridging. PubMed, Ovid and Elsevier, and Cochrane Library (2000‐2016) were searched for English‐language studies. Studies comparing interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging and continuous oral anticoagulation in patients at moderate‐to‐high thromboembolic risk before invasive procedures were included. Primary outcomes were thromboembolic events and bleeding events. Mantel‐Haenszel method and random‐effects models were used to analyze the pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for thromboembolic and bleeding risks. Eighteen studies (six randomized controlled trials and 12 cohort studies) were included (N = 23 364). There was no difference in thromboembolic risk between bridged and non‐bridged patients (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.61‐2.58; RCTs: RR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.23‐2.24; cohorts: RR: 1.45, 95% CI: 0.63‐3.37). However, bridging anticoagulation was associated with higher risk of overall bleeding (RR: 2.83, 95% CI: 2.00‐4.01; RCTs: RR: 2.24, 95% CI: 0.99‐5.09; cohorts: RR: 3.09, 95% CI: 2.07‐4.62) and major bleeding (RR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.78‐5.06; RCTs: RR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.29‐4.76; cohorts: RR: 3.22, 95% CI: 1.65‐6.32). Bridging anticoagulation was associated with increased bleeding risk compared to non‐bridging. Thromboembolism risk was similar between two strategies. Our results do not support routine use of bridging during anticoagulation interruption.

Atrial fibrillation ablation — intraprocedural heparin management recommends administration prior to or immediately following transseptal puncture and titration to a target activated clotting time (ACT) of 300 seconds or greater (Class I, LOE B-NR). Seventy-seven percent of the writing group members administer heparin prior to the transseptal puncture, and ACT should be checked at 10–15 minute intervals until therapeutic anticoagulation is achieved, then at 15–30 minute intervals during the procedure. A large-center protocol cited uses an initial heparin bolus of 50 units per kg for patients therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin, 75 units per kg if not anticoagulated prior to ablation, and 120 units per kg for those on a NOAC who have held one to two doses, with dosing adjusted to maintain an ACT of at least 300–350 seconds. One-third of the writing group routinely employs a target ACT of > 350 seconds, and heparin infusion can be discontinued once all catheters are removed from the LA with sheaths removed when the ACT is less than 200–250 seconds.

### Perioperative management of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xsBwQ]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of patients who are receiving chronic oral anticoagulation therapy and require an elective surgery or an invasive procedure is a common clinical scenario.

Research Question

What is the best available evidence to support the development of American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term vitamin K agonist (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and require elective surgery or procedures?

Study Design and Methods

A literature search including multiple databases from database inception through July 16, 2020, was performed. Meta-analyses were conducted when appropriate.

Results

In patients receiving VKA (warfarin) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, shorter (< 3 days) VKA interruption is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. In patients who required VKA interruption, heparin bridging (mostly with low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]) was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of major bleed, representing a very low certainty of evidence (COE). Compared with DOAC interruption 1 to 4 days before surgery, continuing DOACs may be associated with higher risk of bleeding demonstrated in some, but not all studies. In patients who needed DOAC interruption, bridging with LMWH may be associated with a statistically significant increased risk of bleeding, representing a low COE.

Interpretation

The certainty in the evidence supporting the perioperative management of anticoagulants remains limited. No high-quality evidence exists to support the practice of heparin bridging during the interruption of VKA or DOAC therapy for an elective surgery or procedure, or for the practice of interrupting VKA therapy for minor procedures, including cardiac device implantation, or continuation of a DOAC vs short-term interruption of a DOAC in the perioperative period.

Communication and standardization of perioperative management — It is important to have alignment of the proposed management plan among the health-care team and that it is communicated to and agreed upon by the surgeon/proceduralist, so as to avoid miscommunication that may lead to adverse outcomes or a delay of the surgery/procedure, which can be facilitated with perioperative antithrombotic clinics that can be administered in-person or virtually and with the support of online tools. At an institutional level, harmonization of perioperative anticoagulant management care paths that encompass multiple specialties will facilitate standardization of patient management. Standardized management is important because unstructured usual care varies widely, and if anticoagulants are not managed with evidence-based protocols or guidelines in the perioperative clinical setting, patients may be exposed to as much as a 0.5% to 1.0% excess risk for disabling stroke (based on a benchmark risk ≤ 0.5%) and a 3% to 6% excess risk for serious bleeding (based on a benchmark risk ≤ 1.5%), if anticoagulant interruption is too short or too long or if excessive heparin bridging is used.

Intraprocedural Anticoagulation

Optimal anticoagulation using heparin with close attention to maintaining therapeutic dosing during the procedure is important. It is recommended that heparin be administered prior to or immediately following transseptal puncture during AF ablation procedures and adjusted to achieve and maintain a target activated clotting time (ACT) of 300 seconds or greater (Class I, LOE B-NR, Table 4). It has been observed that thrombi can form on the transseptal sheath and/or the electrode catheter almost immediately after crossing the septum and that early heparinization substantially decreases this risk. A recent meta-analysis of more than 7000 patients supports this recommendation, showing that performing ablation of AF with a target ACT > 300 seconds decreases the risk of thromboembolic complications without increasing the risk of bleeding. Seventy-seven percent of the writing group members administer heparin prior to the transseptal puncture. A heparin loading dose should be administered initially, followed by a standard heparin infusion. The ACT level should be checked at 10–15 minute intervals until therapeutic anticoagulation is achieved, and then at 15–30 minute intervals for the duration of the procedure. Patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) require less heparin and reach the target ACT faster compared with NOACs; thus, when using anticoagulation strategies with the latter, more frequent ACT monitoring and higher heparin doses should be used. This recent report from a large-volume medication center employs an initial heparin bolus of 50 units per kg in patients who are therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin, 75 units per kg in patients who are not anticoagulated prior to ablation, and 120 units per kg for patients who are anticoagulated on a NOAC and have held one to two doses. A survey of the writing group showed great variability in loading protocols for heparin prior to an ablation procedure. The heparin dose should be adjusted to maintain an ACT of at least 300–350 seconds throughout the procedure. One-third of the writing group members routinely employ a target ACT of > 350 seconds. Heparinized saline should be infused continuously through each transseptal sheath to further reduce the risk of thrombi. The risk of systemic embolization of thrombus formed on a sheath can be reduced by withdrawing the sheath to the RA once a catheter is positioned in the LA. Heparin infusion can be discontinued once all catheters are removed from the LA, and the sheaths removed from the groin when the ACT is less than 200–250 seconds. Sheaths can be removed during full anticoagulation by employing a figure-of-eight suture. Alternatively, the heparin effect can be reversed with protamine (Class IIa, LOE B-NR, Table 4). This approach is used by 70% of the writing group members.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nZcRy]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

An estimated 2.5 million patients use oral anticoagulants for the prevention of arterial thromboembolic events in North America, and one‐tenth of them require temporary interruption in preparation for an elective procedure or surgery. 1, 2 However, the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation is not completely clarified for patients who need an anticoagulation interruption before invasive procedures. Two main concerns remain unsolved, the risk of thromboembolism, and the risk of bleeding. 1, 2

To reduce the bleeding risk for patients undergoing invasive procedures, oral anticoagulant is typically interrupted prior to the procedure, and then continued when hemostasis is achieved postprocedurally. 1, 2 Because the interruption of anticoagulation may expose patients to the risk of thromboembolism, heparin bridging (unfractionated heparin [UFH] or low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH]) is administered to minimize the period of inadequate level of anticoagulation. 1, 2 It is of great importance to confirm whether bridging therapy reduces thromboembolic risk and to ascertain the safety of bridging therapy in relation to bleeding risk. 3

There have been many published articles related to bridging anticoagulation, 4, 5 but the quality of evidence with best practices is uneven across studies. Current guidelines from the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association suggest bridging anticoagulation used in patients with a high thrombosis risk, such as certain mechanical valve prostheses or recent pulmonary embolism during interruption of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy. 3 However, these recommendations are primarily based on observational studies and experts' opinions. 3

Although Siegal and colleagues concluded that bridging anticoagulation increases bleeding risk and produces similar thromboembolic risk, their review included only one underpowered randomized trial together with some observational studies with no control arm to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging therapy. 6 To better clarify the risk and benefit of bridging therapy, we updated the current published data and conducted a meta‐analysis to compare the periprocedural thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks between patients receiving interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging therapy and continuous oral anticoagulation.

Delaying restart of anticoagulation — algorithm for post-bleed management in patients on oral anticoagulants details sequential decision points and actions. If the answer to "Is the patient willing to restart anticoagulation at this time?" is no, proceed to "Initiate clinician/patient discussion (see Table 7)". If yes, ask "Is an urgent surgical/ invasive procedure planned?"; for yes, "Suggest delaying restart of anticoagulation until procedure performed". If no, evaluate "Did bleeding occur at a critical site (see Table 1)?" and "Has sufficient time passed to consider restarting anticoagulation?"; if no to the latter, "• Ensure plan for follow-up on a specific date to address restarting anticoagulation
- Consider nonpharmacologic therapies". If time has passed, assess "Is the patient at high risk of rebleeding?"; if no, "Suggest restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 5)". If yes, determine "Is the patient at low/moderate thrombotic risk?"; for yes, actions include "• Consider patient values/preferences
- If indicated, start temporary anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis
- Delay anticoagulation for a short duration and reassess". If no (high thrombotic risk), the box "Patient is at high thrombotic risk:" advises "• Consider patient values/preferences
- If indicated, start temporary parenteral anticoagulation with IV heparin or pharmacological VTE prophylaxis until bleeding risk decreases
- If the patient is a candidate, consider nonpharmacological therapies".

2.2	Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety

Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium according to the patient's coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation time approximately every 4 hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times the normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value.

Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy.

Strategies listed are to "Assess personal and family history for bleeding diathesis", "Stop anticoagulants before the scheduled procedure" including "Stop aspirin at least 1 wk before procedure", "Stop nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents several days before (to ensure 4–5 half-lives have elapsed)", "Stop warfarin and consider switch to heparin in advance of procedure", and "Stop heparin before procedure". Pre-biopsy labs are specified: "Check complete blood count and coagulation parameters before biopsy" with "Bleeding time? — controversial". Kidney function checks are included: "Use equation to estimate GFR". For abnormal bleeding time and/or low GFR, "Consider administration of ddAVP", with dosing "0.3 μg/kg given in 50 mL of saline over 15–30 min immediately before procedure". Blood pressure control is addressed: "Control blood pressure on day of procedure" and "May give oral agents before procedure to decrease blood pressure".

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — interruption of anticoagulation for procedures is addressed as follows: In patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, it is generally appropriate to substitute unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent thromboembolism; in patients with AF without mechanical valves, anticoagulation may be interrupted for a period of up to 1 wk for surgical or diagnostic procedures that carry a risk of bleeding without substituting heparin, with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin administered intravenously or subcutaneously in high-risk patients or when longer interruption is required. Low-molecular-weight heparins have pharmacological advantages including more predictable bioavailability (greater than 90% after subcutaneous injection).

2.4	Pediatric Use

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients:

2.5	Cardiovascular Surgery

Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes.

2.6	Converting to Warfarin

To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.7	Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin

For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered.

2.8	Extracorporeal Dialysis

Follow equipment manufacturer's operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available.

Initiation of anticoagulation prior to abortion — timing and regimen: Individuals who meet the criteria for antenatal anticoagulation should be initiated on anticoagulation if the abortion procedure is not going to take place in the immediate future, and there is not enough evidence to recommend delaying a procedure specifically to start anticoagulation.

### Outpatient management of anticoagulation therapy [^113f8nWk]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The Seventh American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy provides guidelines for outpatient management of anticoagulation therapy. The ACCP guidelines recommend short-term warfarin therapy, with the goal of maintaining an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.5 ± 0.5, after major orthopedic surgery. Therapy for venous thromboembolism includes an INR of 2.5 ± 0.5, with the length of therapy determined by associated conditions. For patients with atrial fibrillation, the INR is maintained at 2.5 ± 0.5 indefinitely; for most patients with mechanical valves, the recommended INR is 3.0 ± 0.5 indefinitely. Use of outpatient low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is as safe and effective as inpatient unfractionated heparin for treatment of venous thromboembolism. The ACCP recommends starting warfarin with unfractionated heparin or LMWH for at least five days and continuing until a therapeutic INR is achieved. Because patients with venous thromboembolism and cancer who have been treated with LMWH have a survival advantage that extends beyond their venous thromboembolism treatment, the ACCP recommends beginning their therapy with three to six months of LMWH. When invasive procedures require the interruption of oral anticoagulation therapy, recommendations for bridge therapy are determined by balancing the risk of bleeding against the risk of thromboembolism. Patients at higher risk of thromboembolization should stop warfarin therapy four to five days before surgery and start LMWH or unfractionated heparin two to three days before surgery.

### Use of heparinized saline flush during endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke; a survey of clinical practice in the Netherlands [^116KbAtf]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Twenty-eight out of 79 interventionists from 17 comprehensive Dutch stroke centers (35%) completed the survey.

Experience of the responders

Thirteen interventionists had 1–5-years experience in neuro-intervention. Eleven had 5–10-years experience and 4 had more than 10 years experience in the field of neuro-intervention.

Heparin concentration

Twenty-one participants responded to which concentration of heparin they used in the flush fluids. For the non-responders, we used heparin concentrations derived from colleague responders from the same center (if available) or from known heparin concentration from an earlier conducted center-based survey (Benali et al.). Two out of 28 interventionists use 25.000 IU/L saline flush, 6 use 10.000 IU/L, 10 use 5.000 IU/L, 2 interventionists use 1000 IU/L, and 8 interventionists use no heparin in flush fluids during EVT.

Number of infusion lines

Five interventionists completed the survey with two different options; for calculations of total heparin dose, we only included the maximal number. Sixteen participants use 3 infusion bags during the procedure (one on the (balloon) guiding catheter and / or one on the aspiration catheter and / or one on the microcatheter), 5 interventionists use 2 bags (on the (balloon) guiding catheter, aspiration catheter or microcatheter) and 7 use only 1 bag (on the (balloon) guiding catheter).

Timing of connection of the infusion bag

Twenty-six interventionists connected the infusion bag immediately at the start of the procedure. Two interventionists connected the infusion bag after catheterization of the common carotid artery. We did not include the time-delay from groin puncture to carotid artery catheterization (time of using catheter without flush) in our final calculations of total dose, because of the small number and potentially short time delay.

Drip rate

All the participating interventionists set up their dripping speed manually. The most often set drip rate was 1 drip per second (0,05 ml/sec) (n = 18), followed by 0,5 drip per second (0,025 ml/sec) (n = 10); 2 drips per second (0,1 ml/sec) (n = 2) and 1 drip per 5 s (0,01 mL /sec) (n = 1).

Hemorrhage

Inform patients that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding, that they may bruise and/or bleed more easily when they are treated with heparin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Prior to Surgery

Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are receiving heparin before any surgery is scheduled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia

Inform patients of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Hypersensitivity

Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Other Medications

Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Anticoagulants

Warfarin and heparin

For low-risk endoscopic procedures we suggest that warfarin therapy should be continued (low quality evidence, moderate recommendation). It should be ensured that the INR does not exceed the therapeutic range in the week prior to the procedure (low quality evidence, strong recommendation).

Tell the patient to continue warfarin and check the INR during the week before the endoscopy.
If the INR result is within the therapeutic range then continue with the usual daily dose.
If the INR result is above the therapeutic range, but less than 5, then reduce the daily warfarin dose until the INR returns to within the therapeutic range.
If the INR is greater than 5 then defer the endoscopy and contact the anticoagulation clinic, or a medical practitioner, for advice.

For high-risk endoscopic procedures in patients at low thrombotic risk, we recommend discontinuing warfarin for 5 days before the procedure (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). Check INR prior to the procedure to ensure < 1.5 (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).

Stop warfarin for 5 days before the endoscopy.
Check the INR prior to the procedure to ensure its value is < 1.5.
On the day of the procedure restart warfarin with the usual daily dose that night.
Check INR 1 week later to ensure adequate anticoagulation.

For high-risk endoscopic procedures in patients at high thrombotic risk, we recommend that warfarin should be temporarily discontinued and substituted with LMWH (moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation).

Warfarin should be stopped for 5 days before the procedure.
Two days after stopping warfarin commence daily therapeutic dose of LMWH.
Administer the last dose of LMWH at least 24 hours prior to the procedure.
Check the INR prior to the procedure to ensure its value is < 1.5.
Warfarin can be resumed on the day of the procedure with the usual dose that night.
Restart the daily therapeutic dose of LMWH on the day after the procedure.
Continue LMWH until a satisfactory INR is achieved.

Updated literature searches were conducted on the use of warfarin and heparin in patients undergoing endoscopy. There were no new data to indicate a change to the existing protocols above. Any new data relevant to interventional therapy are discussed in the sections on specific endoscopic procedures.

Perioperative anticoagulant management — periprocedural timing and bridging: The periprocedural period has been defined as beginning 1 week prior to the procedure and ending 4 weeks following the procedure, constituting a 5-week interval when most thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications occur. In preparation for invasive procedures, the oral anticoagulant is often discontinued for several days to allow hemostasis, and preprocedural "bridging" with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) leverages short-acting pharmacology to shorten interruption and reduce periprocedural thromboembolism.

Valvular heart disease — planned interruption of VKA and bridging — When interruption of oral VKA therapy is deemed necessary, the agent is usually stopped 3 to 4 days before the procedure and restarted postoperatively as soon as bleeding risk allows; bridging with intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is started when the INR falls below the therapeutic threshold (ie, 2.0 or 2.5), usually 36 to 48 hours before surgery, and is stopped 4 to 6 hours (intravenous UFH) or 12 hours (subcutaneous LMWH) before the procedure. There are no randomized comparative-effectiveness trials in adequate numbers of prosthetic heart valve patients, evidence derives mostly from cohort studies with poor or no comparator groups, and in other patient groups bridging therapy exposes patients to higher bleeding risks without reducing thromboembolism; accordingly, decisions about bridging should be individualized and account for the tradeoffs between thrombosis and bleeding.

Hypersensitivity

Inform patients that generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Other Medications

Because of the risk of hemorrhage, advise patients to inform their physicians and dentists of all medications they are taking, including non-prescription medications, and before starting any new medication [see Drug Interactions (7)].

For the oral and maxillofacial surgeon, many patients will be on heparin products during surgery. So far, there is no standardized approach to treating anticoagulated patients during oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures. When a patient is on heparin therapy, heparin may be stopped 4 to 6 hours before surgery and resumed once hemostasis is achieved, usually within 24 hours. If low-molecular-weight heparin is administered, the treatment is generally stopped at least 12 hours before surgery and then resumed in a similar fashion. Local measures are generally enough to provide adequate hemostasis.

With the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, no strong evidence to support bridging exists currently. These anticoagulants have a shorter half-life and faster onset making the benefits of bridging less obvious. A study from the European Dresden registry from 2014 demonstrated that in patients taking nonvitamin K antagonists, heparin bridging did not reduce cardiovascular events, and major bleeding again was more frequent with bridging than without. Additionally, the HASBLED scoring system used to gauge the risk of hemorrhage can also be used to estimate risk of hemorrhage heparin bridging during warfarin cessation. Recommendations are unclear regarding the efficacy and need for bridging with DOACs.

Re-initiation of oral anticoagulation: The decision to restart anticoagulation after a procedure is again determined by weighing the risks for thromboembolism against that of hemorrhage. If hemostasis is assured after the procedure, vitamin K antagonists can be restarted 6–24 hours after surgery as therapeutic levels will take several days to reach. If periprocedural bridging is being used, patients at low risk of bleeding can resume bridging at 24 hours and those at higher bleed risk at 48–72 hours for all high-risk patients. Non-vitamin K antagonists could potentially be resumed after 6–24 hours in patients with low bleeding risk if hemostasis is assured, bearing in mind that these agents have a much faster time of onset. Those with higher bleeding risk should wait 48–72 hours prior to restarting and could be considered for bridging with heparin if the risk of thromboembolism is also high.

### Use of heparinized saline flush during endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke; a survey of clinical practice in the Netherlands [^115ezN9k]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and introduction

During endovascular treatment (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), catheters are continuously flushed, using saline infusion fluids, to avoid thrombus formation during the procedure and thus to reduce the risk for distal embolization. These flush fluids are often heparinized. In an earlier study, we showed wide variance in used heparin concentrations in flush fluids and investigated its potential impact on functional and technical outcome (Benali et al.). The true impact of heparinized flush fluids however depends on more than the concentration alone. Dripping rate, number of infusion lines, timing of connection of the infusion line to the catheter and procedure time are all important and relevant variables in order to determine the total heparin dose entering the patient by heparinized flush fluids. In the current study, we aim to clarify these highly relevant variables.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115ErXWS]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) periprocedural anticoagulation management — In patients with AF (excluding those with recent stroke or TIA, or a mechanical valve) on warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) undergoing an invasive procedure or surgery, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging anticoagulation is recommended. In patients with AF on warfarin anticoagulation and an annual predicted risk of thromboembolism of ≥ 5% undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change, continued anticoagulation is recommended in preference to interruption of warfarin and bridging anticoagulation with heparin to reduce the risk of pocket hematoma. In patients with AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 or equivalent risk of stroke on DOAC anticoagulation and undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change, either uninterrupted or interrupted DOAC is reasonable. If an invasive procedure or surgery cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted DOAC, the timing of DOAC interruption should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk of the procedure. After DOAC interruption for a procedure or surgery, resumption of anticoagulation the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery is reasonable, as long as hemostasis has been achieved and further bleeding is not anticipated. For patients with AF on warfarin who are holding warfarin for a surgery or procedure, except in patients with mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA, bridging anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^112QXA13]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence.

In patients receiving warfarin who require its temporary interruption, heparin bridging, typically with subcutaneous, full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), is sometimes used for 3 days before and 3–5 days after the surgery or procedure. The premise for heparin bridging is that by minimizing the time patients are not therapeutically anticoagulated periprocedurally during warfarin interruption and resumption, the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events will be reduced. However, heparin bridging may not affect the pathophysiologic pathway that mediates periprocedural stroke and thromboembolism and may place patients at increased risk of procedure-site bleeding, especially if heparin bridging is administered in too close proximity to the time of the procedure.

Two randomized trials assessed heparin bridging among warfarin-treated patients who required anticoagulant interruption for elective surgery/procedure, including GI procedures. One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (BRIDGE) assessed the need for heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation who required temporary warfarin interruption for an elective surgical procedure, including 758 GI procedures (98.7% were minor or low bleeding risk procedures). Excluded from the BRIDGE trial were patients with a very high thrombotic risk (i.e. a mechanical heart valve; stroke, systemic embolism, or transient ischemic attack within the past 12 weeks) or significant risk factors for major bleeding (i.e. history of a bleeding event within the past 6 weeks; creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min; and thrombocytopenia < 100,000 per microliter). Patients with planned cardiac, intracranial, or intraspinal surgeries were also excluded.

### Management of antithrombotic agents during surgery or other kinds of medical procedures with bleeding: the MARK study [^111u21bW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the frequency of discontinuation of oral antithrombotic agents depends on the type of procedure. With respect to the timing of periprocedural thromboembolic events, the peak incidence varies by the type of thromboembolism. The discontinuation of oral antithrombotic agents and addition of heparin bridging therapy are associated with adverse events in the periprocedural period. Low‐dose heparin bridging therapy is associated with bleeding events and may not actually reduce the risk of thromboembolism.

### Bridging anticoagulation: primum non nocere [^111A3CwZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic oral anticoagulation frequently requires interruption for various reasons and durations. Whether or not to bridge with heparin or other anticoagulants is a common clinical dilemma. The evidence to inform decision making is limited, making current guidelines equivocal and imprecise. Moreover, indications for anticoagulation interruption may be unclear. New observational studies and a recent large randomized trial have noted significant perioperative or periprocedural bleeding rates without reduction in thromboembolism when bridging is employed. Such bleeding may also increase morbidity and mortality. In light of these findings, physician preferences for routine bridging anticoagulation during chronic anticoagulation interruptions may be too aggressive. More randomized trials, such as PERIOP2 (A Double Blind Randomized Control Trial of Post-Operative Low Molecular Weight Heparin Bridging Therapy Versus Placebo Bridging Therapy for Patients Who Are at High Risk for Arterial Thromboembolism), will help guide periprocedural management of anticoagulation for indications such as venous thromboembolism and mechanical heart valves. In the meantime, physicians should carefully consider both the need for oral anticoagulation interruption and the practice of routine bridging when anticoagulation interruption is indicated.

### Perioperative bridging interruption with heparin for the patient receiving long-term anticoagulation [^113cbZHD]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide a timely and concise review of the most recent clinical data in the field of bridging (anticoagulation) therapy with heparin for the at-risk patient receiving long-term oral anticoagulation who requires temporary interruption for an elective invasive procedure or surgery.

Recent Findings

A recent systematic review found that the quality of studies of bridging therapy published before June 2001 was generally poor. More recent larger prospective cohort studies and registries of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation, including patients with mechanical heart valves, who underwent bridging therapy with mostly treatment-dose low-molecular-weight heparin for both major and non-major elective invasive procedures or surgeries have been completed. These studies reveal an overall thromboembolic complication rate of 1.22 (95% CI 0.81–1.77) and an overall major bleed rate of 2.94 (95% CI 2.28–3.74). Standardized low-molecular-weight heparin bridging regimens using postoperative bleeding risk assessments optimized good clinical outcomes, and bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin appears to be at least as safe as unfractionated heparin and produces substantial cost savings through reduction in length of stay in the hospital.

Summary

Perioperative bridging therapy with heparin, either unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, appears to be safe and effective for patients, including those with mechanical heart valves, receiving long-term oral anticoagulation who require temporary interruption, especially for non-high-bleeding risk procedures such as minor surgery and invasive procedures. Further studies, including randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials, are needed to optimize bridging therapy for specific patients and procedures.

### Therapy insight: approaching endoscopy in anticoagulated patients [^117L77s6]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, the application of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents for various cardiovascular and hematologic conditions has become more widespread. Optimal management of these agents during the periendoscopic period requires consideration, but limited prospective data mean that guidelines have largely relied on expert opinion. Elective procedures should be delayed in patients on temporary anticoagulation therapy (e.g. those with deep vein thrombosis). For procedures considered to have a low risk of bleeding (e.g. diagnostic endoscopy and colonoscopy without polypectomy) there is no need to discontinue or adjust anticoagulation. For procedures with a higher risk of bleeding (e.g. polypectomy and biliary sphincterotomy) an individual approach is required. This approach might include stopping oral anticoagulant therapy with or without the administration of unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin for the preprocedure and postprocedure periods, during which the patient's international normalized ratio is in the subtherapeutic range.

Management of anticoagulation in elective cases

Three factors that need to be considered in the case of elective surgeries are (1) when to stop, (2) whether to bridge, and (3) when to restart.

Discontinuation prior to surgery: General recommendations are summarized in the table (table 8) below and are according to the American College of Chest Physician 2012 Guidelines published in Chest, the RE-LY trial published in Circulation 2012, the ROCKET AF trial, and the manufacturer's recommendations.

Table 8
Recommendations for timing of discontinuation of anticoagulation for elective surgery

Patients whose procedures are at low risk of bleeding may continue oral anticoagulation therapy. This is particularly true for high-risk patients such as those with mechanical heart values.

Indications for bridging: The need for perioperative bridging is decided on by taking into account the patient's thromboembolism and hemorrhage risk and stratifying them into low, medium and high risk. In the case of warfarin, recommendations are summarized in the flow chart below (figure 3), adapted from the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Guidelines. Bridging may be achieved either with intravenous unfractionated heparin or with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin. Temporary interruption of vitamin K antagonism agents, without bridging while the INR is subtherapeutic, is recommended for patients with bileaflet mechanical aortic valve replacements and no other risk factors. All other mechanical valve settings should undergo bridging.

Figure 3
Algorithm for perioperative bridging of warfarin. INR, International Normalized Ratio; LMWH, low-molecular-weight heparin; UFH, unfractionated heparin.

Efficacy of bridging: Whether or not outcomes are really better with bridging patients on vitamin K antagonists remains uncertain. A meta-analysis published by Siegal et al in 2012 found that the rate of thromboembolism was equivalent in patients who underwent periprocedural heparin bridging; however, there was a significantly higher number of patients who had major bleeding complications in those undergoing heparin bridging. These results were replicated in a randomized controlled trial by Douketis et al in 2015 demonstrating non-inferiority between patients undergoing no bridging versus those with low-molecular-weight heparin bridging and a significant reduction of major bleeding complications in those patients who did not undergo bridging.

To minimise the risk of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), several strategies are in place: (1) Aside from procedurally administered heparinised saline (a continuous drip of 2000 IU heparin in 1000 mL saline into femoral artery sheaths), which will be used if intravenous thrombolysis was not given before EVT, intravenous heparin is prohibited until after the 24 hours after EVT when neuroimaging has been performed; (2) Blood pressure will be tightly controlled to less than 185/110 mm Hg during the first 24 hours. If TICI > 2 b reperfusion is achieved and the systolic blood pressure is persistently above 140 mm Hg, a blood pressure of 120–160/70–90 mm Hg would be targeted by continuous monitoring after EVT; (3) Blood glucose level will be controlled to less than 160 mg/dL; (4) If contrast extravasation occurs during the procedure which may indicate active bleeding, the TNK infusion will be stopped immediately; (5) If ICAD-LVO is highly suspected and rescue balloon angioplasty and/or stenting will be performed, the dose of intra-arterial TNK will be reduced to half of the recommended dose, or stop, as determined by the local investigator and (6) If there is a concern for change in the patient's neurological condition, a CT scan (flat panel CT in the angio suite permitted) will be performed to rule out haemorrhage and if present, TNK will be immediately stopped. Hypotension and hypovolaemia will be corrected or avoided according to current guidelines. A CT scan will be performed before and after the EVT procedure in all patients.

### The BRIDGE trial: what the hospitalist should know [^115kywJb]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation patients often require warfarin interruption for an invasive procedure or surgery. Heparin bridging therapy has been frequently used during warfarin interruption under the premise of providing a theoretical mitigation against thromboembolism that overweighs expected higher rates of bleeding. Up until recently, little definite clinical evidence was available to guide the hospitalist on optimal perioperative anticoagulant management. The landmark BRIDGE (Perioperative Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) trial provided high-quality evidence that a simple interruption of warfarin in the average atrial fibrillation patient undergoing an elective procedure or surgery is noninferior to bridging therapy for efficacy and superior to bridging therapy in preventing major bleeding. To guide the hospitalist, we propose a treatment algorithm based on these recent data. We review the literature that led to the trial and highlight its practice-changing implications as a proof of concept that calls to question the premise of heparin bridging therapy beyond the atrial fibrillation population.

### Postoperative low molecular weight heparin bridging treatment for patients at high risk of arterial thromboembolism (PERIOP2): double blind randomised controlled trial [^115NMEks]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Uncertainty remains as to whether patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves who require interruption of vitamin K antagonists for invasive procedures benefit from bridging with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after the procedure. Many published and diverse protocols and guidelines have sought to address this common clinical problem, and the concern has always been that these patients are at high risk of thrombotic complications caused by a procoagulable state while off vitamin K antagonists.

In the typical bridging strategy, warfarin is held for four or five days before the procedure and is resumed after the procedure, on the same day or one or two days later.LMWH is given once or twice a day at a therapeutic dose for three to five days before the procedure and for a minimum of four days after the procedure until the international normalised ratio (INR) is therapeutic. The goal of bridging with LMWH is to reduce the risk of perioperative thromboembolism by minimising the time without anticoagulation while reducing bleeding risks with a short acting anticoagulant that allows for minimal or no anticoagulant effect at the time of interruption.

Bridging has been most studied in patients with atrial fibrillation in several observational or single armed studies. A recently completed double blind placebo controlled trial suggested that LMWH bridging is not necessary before or after the procedure for patients on warfarin. However, patients with mechanical heart valves were usually excluded from such studies and patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke were not well represented. In a previous single arm, multicentre pilot study of dalteparin bridging given once daily to 224 patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves, we found that the rate of thrombosis after the procedure was 3.1%; 75% of the events occurred in patients who had anticoagulation held due to a bleeding event after the procedure. These findings suggest that bridging after the procedure caused harm potentially because of a longer period without anticoagulation due to bleeding, which then led to thrombotic events.

Based on this information we performed a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial to assess the necessity of postoperative bridging with the LMWH dalteparin in patients with atrial fibrillation or prosthetic mechanical valves who required warfarin to be held for a procedure. We hypothesised that patients who would receive placebo after the procedure would have fewer bleeding events and a lower rate of thromboembolism because of the association of thromboembolism with bleeding in our pilot study. We chose to only study the LMWH dose after the procedure because the dose before the procedure was unlikely to be causing harm and might be of benefit.

### Management of antithrombotic agents during surgery or other kinds of medical procedures with bleeding: the MARK study [^112Vr9aW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

We found that discontinuation of oral anticoagulant agents for low‐bleeding‐risk procedures was significantly associated with not only risk of TEs but also risk of MB. In addition, for high‐bleeding‐risk procedures, discontinuation of any antithrombotic agents and addition of heparin bridging therapy were also significantly associated with higher risks for MB. Some possible explanations for the finding that discontinuation of antithrombotic agents was associated with the risk of MB are as follows. Patients requiring the discontinuation of oral antithrombotic agents might have extensive atherosclerotic lesions with high bleeding risk and might undergo more invasive procedures than those who continue these agents. In addition, procedures, especially in emergency situations, might have been performed before the antithrombotic effect disappeared because discontinuation and its timing were left to the physician's discretion in our observational study setting. Our result that heparin bridging therapy was associated with higher risk of MB supports the findings of some meta‐analyses and randomized control trials. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 Those studies failed to confirm any protective efficacy of periprocedural TEs with heparin bridging therapy, whereas the risk of bleeding complications increased. The IST (International Stroke Trial) demonstrated that the protection against ischemic events conferred by heparin is offset by bleeding complications. 33 Furthermore, heparin bridging therapy may not be appropriate in the periprocedural period, when bleeding risk is increased.

### Preparation for pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator implants in patients with high risk of thrombo-embolic events: oral anticoagulation or bridging with intravenous heparin? A prospective randomized trial [^116Qm5yL]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Current guidelines recommend stopping oral anticoagulation (OAC) and starting heparin infusion before implanting/replacing a pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in patients with high risk for thrombo-embolic events. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that the maintenance of OAC during device implantation/replacement is as safe as bridging to intravenous heparin and shortens in-hospital stay.

Methods and Results

A cohort of 101 consecutive patients with high risk for embolic events and indication for implant/replacement of a pacemaker/ICD were randomized to two anticoagulant strategies: bridging from OAC to heparin infusion (n = 51) vs. maintenance of OAC to reach an INR = 2 ± 0.3 at the day of the procedure (n = 50). Haemorrhagic and thrombo-embolic complications were evaluated at discharge, 15 and 45 days after the procedure. A total of 4/51 patients (7.8%) from heparin group and 4/50 (8.0%) from the OAC group developed pocket haematoma following the implant (P = 1.00). One haematoma in each group required evacuation (1.9 vs. 2%, P = 1.00). No other haemorrhagic events or embolic complications developed during the follow-up. Duration of the hospital stay was longer in the heparin group [median of 5 (4–7) vs. 2 (1–4) days; P < 0.001].

Conclusion

Implant of devices maintaining OAC is as safe as bridging to heparin infusion and allows a significant reduction of in-hospital stay.

ACC 2020 bleeding pathway — timing of anticoagulation reinitiation: "In general, all such decisions should be made by a multidisciplinary care team". Conditions with high thrombotic risk favor early reinitiation "once hemostasis is achieved and the patient is clinically stable", and "OAC may be reinitiated with close monitoring in patients with high thrombotic risk; for patients with moderate or high rebleeding risk, individualized strategies are appropriate". As an example of early reinitiation, "parenteral anticoagulants can often be started with close monitoring within 1 to 3 days in most patients". For high rebleeding risk when thrombotic risk is unacceptably high and therapeutic anticoagulation is necessary, "it is suggested that unfractionated heparin be administered by intravenous infusion owing to its short half-life and the availability of a reversal agent (protamine sulfate) that can rapidly stop and/or reverse anticoagulation in the event of rebleeding".

### Standardized low-molecular-weight heparin bridging regimen in outpatients on oral anticoagulants undergoing invasive procedure or surgery: an inception cohort management study [^114nZDMn]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin is usually recommended in patients who must stop oral anticoagulants before surgical or invasive procedures. To date, there is no universally accepted bridging regimen tailored to the patient's thromboembolic risk. This prospective inception cohort management study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of an individualized bridging protocol applied to outpatients.

Methods and Results

Oral anticoagulants were stopped 5 days before the procedure. Low-molecular-weight heparin was started 3 to 4 days before surgery and continued for 6 days after surgery at 70 anti-factor Xa U/kg twice daily in high-thromboembolic-risk patients and prophylactic once-daily doses in moderate- to low-risk patients. Oral anticoagulation was resumed the day after the procedure with a boost dose of 50% for 2 days and maintenance doses afterward. The patients were followed up for 30 days. Of the 1262 patients included in the study (only 15% had mechanical valves), 295 (23.4%) were high-thromboembolic-risk patients and 967 (76.6%) were moderate- to low-risk patients. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there were 5 thromboembolic events (0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.9), all in high-thromboembolic-risk patients. There were 15 major (1.2%; 95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 2.0) and 53 minor (4.2%; 95% confidence interval, 3.2 to 5.5) bleeding episodes. Major bleeding was associated with twice-daily low-molecular-weight heparin administration (high-risk patients) but not with the bleeding risk of the procedure.

Conclusions

This management bridging protocol, tailored to patients' thromboembolic risk, appears to be feasible, effective, and safe for many patients, but safety in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves has not been conclusively established.

### Anticoagulation therapy: perioperative anticoagulation-are we at' a bridge too far'? [^116HWte5]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

The perioperative management of patients with atrial fibrillation who require an elective surgical or other invasive procedure is an area of ongoing uncertainty. Accumulating evidence from observational studies suggests that the use of bridging anticoagulation with heparin, although well-intentioned, might not reduce perioperative thromboembolism and can increase bleeding.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^112vn2YQ]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging — management points should be considered when administering heparin bridging, including that bridging is most often done with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) using a therapeutic-dose regimen (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid); bridging with therapeutic-dose IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) is another treatment option, for example, in patients with severe renal insufficiency or who are dialysis-dependent; and other types of heparin bridging may include intermediate-dose regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid). Heparin bridging should be administered in a manner to minimize the risk for bleeding that would require re-operation or another intervention, and avoidance of major bleeding is important because it typically requires a longer period of anticoagulant interruption that, in turn, exposes patients to an increased risk for thromboembolism.

Medication management before catheterization — prior to the procedure, all medications should be thoroughly reviewed; timing of administration needs individual consideration and in some instances medications may need to be held; adjustments of antiarrhythmics should be made in consultation with electrophysiologists and anesthesiologists, pulmonary vasodilators should be discussed with pulmonary hypertension specialists, and if patients are at risk of a pulmonary hypertensive crisis, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) or inhaled iloprost should be readily available; aspirin is usually not discontinued prior to a catheterization procedure (but may need to be stopped for hybrid procedures) and for ASD closure may be started a few days before; depending on the planned procedure, full oral anticoagulation such as coumadin may need to be withheld, some patients may need transition to intravenous heparinization or low molecular weight heparin, heparin can usually be discontinued just before the procedure though on circulatory support it may need continuation throughout, and data within ECMO suggest procedures can be performed safely even with full anticoagulation.

ASIPP 2024 — Warfarin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) perioperative management for interventional procedures states warfarin is continued for minimal bleed risk, whereas for low to moderate and high bleed risk it is stopped for 5 days; other guidance recommends it be stopped for 3–5 days, and individualized care may achieve an appropriate INR below 1.5 after stopping for 2 days. Warfarin can be resumed on the evening of procedure (D0) or the day after procedure (D1) at the patient's usual maintenance dose. "Bridging suggested for high thrombotic risk populations with full-dose, subcutaneous LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily or dalteparin, 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily), with the last dose given the AM of the day prior to the procedure (i.e. D-1) at half the total daily dose". Low-dose LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 40 mg daily or dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) can be used for VTE prophylaxis for first 24–72 hours post-procedure, with full dose LMWH resumed 2–3 days post-procedure. Initiation of low molecular heparin therapy has been questioned and is no longer a recommendation as it increases the risk.

### Chronically anticoagulated patients who need surgery: can low-molecular-weight heparins really be used to "bridge" patients instead of intravenous unfractionated heparin? [^1115K8hg]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Patients at high risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic events often receive chronic treatment with long-term oral anticoagulants such as warfarin. However, if these patients require an invasive procedure, they may require a temporary interruption of their warfarin therapy to minimize their bleeding risk during the procedure. As warfarin has a long half-life and an unpredictable pharmacokinetic profile, short-acting parenteral anticoagulants, such as unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), may be of benefit in protecting the patient from thromboemboli while their warfarin dose is withheld. Such "bridging therapy" has traditionally been provided in-hospital with intravenous UFH; however, recent data have suggested that LMWH may be an effective alternative, with potential cost-savings due to the ability to provide bridging therapy in the outpatient setting.

### Benefit, necessity or harm by administering heparin during neurointerventional procedures? [^116VvkJe]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Intraarterial or intravenous heparinization during neurointerventional procedures has been used regularly for over 30 years. Heparin is administered either as a single bolus, or continuously intravenously, and/or continuously via saline flushing of the catheter. Thromboembolism was and is until today the most common complication resulting in neurological deficits during neurointerventions. The technical advances and the continuously increasing number of neurointerventions have significantly shortened the procedures' duration. Interventions that last many hours belong to the past and have become very rare. Additionally, to the benefit of time reduction, managing of anticoagulation and antiaggregation treatment has improved. As a result, many elective interventions are performed under controlled platelet inhibition. Furthermore, emergency treated patients are not seldom taking anticoagulants or antiplatelets. Therefore, the role of intraprocedural heparin application must be reconsidered — not least under the aspect that there are no standards for heparinization.

Benaly et al. analyzed the Mr Clean data with regards to the effect of heparin on bleeding rates and outcome. Of course, there are no national or international recommendations regarding the use of heparinized flushing fluid during endovascular interventions and especially in thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

Therefore, the manuscript raises a very important question:How much heparin is necessary and how much heparin is dangerous? The data analysis only shows a trend without a level of significance. Nevertheless, it is interesting that the group with 25.000 heparin units stands out in comparison to the other groups in the following points: second lowest recanalization rate, highest mortality rate, highest rate of using stent retriever, fastest management with onset to groin puncture, longest procedure time with probably the highest amount of heparinized infusion, highest rate of previous anticoagulated patients. The influence of all these factors certainly determines the results.

### Preparation for pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator implants in patients with high risk of thrombo-embolic events: oral anticoagulation or bridging with intravenous heparin? A prospective randomized trial [^117LFiy7]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

This is a prospective and randomized single-centre study approved by the Institutional Human Research Committee.

Inclusion criteria

Patients on chronic OAC who required implantation/replacement of a pacemaker or an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) were included in the study if they fulfilled any of the following conditions that imply a high risk for embolic events:(i) mechanical prosthetic valve; (ii) atrial fibrillation (AF) with previous stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), systemic embolic event, mitral stenosis, or prosthetic heart valve; or (iii) AF with at least three criteria of intermediate risk of embolic events: hypertension, diabetes, and left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% or age > 75 years; (iv) intracavitary thrombi protruding into the cardiac chambers; and (v) recent deep venous thrombosis (< 3 months). Patients were randomized in two groups: the first switched from OAC to i.v. heparin (heparin group) and the other maintained OAC with acenocumarol, a vitamin K antagonist (OAC group).

In the heparin group, OAC was discontinued 4 days before implant/replacement; i.v. heparin was started at INR ≤ 2 and stopped 6 h before the implant. After the procedure, OAC was reinstituted at night and i.v. heparin was started 24 h after the implant with i.v. bolus of 60 U/kg (maximum dosage of 4000 U) and an infusion rate that maintained activated partial thromboplastin time between 55 and 70 s. Heparin perfusion was stopped at INR ≥ 2. In the OAC group, INR was tested 15 days before implant to adjust acenocumarol dosage to achieve an INR 2 ± 0.3 at the day of the implant. After the procedure, testing continued until an adequate INR was achieved.

All patients were evaluated at discharge, 15 and 45 days after the procedure to assess pocket haematoma, thrombo-embolic events, or other bleeding.

### Variations in perioperative warfarin management: outcomes and practice patterns at nine hospitals [^1158QWA7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Before surgery, most patients receiving oral anticoagulation require temporary cessation of treatment. Physicians sometimes substitute heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin for oral anticoagulation in the perioperative setting ("bridging therapy"). We sought to characterize rates of bridging therapy use at 9 clinical centers to determine the extent to which the use of bridging is explained by clinical characteristics of patients (vs physician style) and to determine the 30-day incidence of thrombotic and bleeding complications.

Methods

This was a prospective, multicenter, observational study. Periprocedural bridging anticoagulation was classified as none, prophylactic-dose heparin/low-molecular-weight heparin, or full-dose heparin/low-molecular-weight heparin. We collected data on patient and surgery characteristics, anticoagulation management, and thromboembolic and bleeding events.

Results

A total of 492 of 497 consecutive patients completed the study; 54%, 14%, and 33% of patients had no, prophylactic, and full (therapeutic) doses, respectively, of heparin/low-molecular-weight heparin postprocedure. Two hospitals treated more than 80% of their patients with full-dose heparin, whereas the remaining 7 hospitals used full-dose heparin in an average of 22% of cases (P < .001); this variation persisted after adjustment for patient characteristics. There were 4 thromboembolic events (0.8%) and 16 major bleeding events (3.2%). Full-dose heparin/low-molecular-weight heparin postprocedure was associated with a higher likelihood of major bleeding: adjusted odds ratio 4.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.5–14.7).

Conclusion

Management of anticoagulation after an invasive procedure varies widely and is not explained by clinical characteristics of patients alone. The risk of major bleeding is strongly associated with the use of postoperative therapeutic doses of heparin/low-molecular-weight heparin.

### Heparin sodium injection (Heparin sodium) [^112C9MbB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.8 Converting to Warfarin

To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)].

2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin

For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered.

2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis

Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available.
