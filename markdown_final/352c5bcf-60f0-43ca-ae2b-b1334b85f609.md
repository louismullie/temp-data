## Question

What could explain an elevated lipase of 104 and an increased alkaline phosphate to 132 with a normal CEA in an 83-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and colon cancer who has abdominal bloating and nausea?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what could explain mild elevations in lipase (104) and alkaline phosphatase (132) with a normal CEA in an 83-year-old, post-cholecystectomy woman with a history of colon cancer who has abdominal bloating and nausea, and what differential diagnosis, workup, and management should be considered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether these enzyme values meet diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. Then, I should evaluate whether the biochemical pattern suggests cholestasis versus hepatocellular injury. Next, I will integrate the implications of prior cholecystectomy, consider malignancy risk in this age group, review non-pancreatitic causes of lipase elevation, outline a guideline-based diagnostic sequence, synthesize likely diagnoses, and conclude with a management plan [^111wfzKF] [^111MfEZb].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic thresholds so I don't jump to conclusions. A lipase of 104 U/L is a mild elevation and does not meet the ≥ 3× ULN threshold typically required for the biochemical component of acute pancreatitis; diagnosis generally requires at least two of: characteristic abdominal pain, lipase/amylase ≥ 3× ULN, or imaging consistent with pancreatitis, so on labs alone this is insufficient and I should not label this as pancreatitis yet [^111wfzKF] [^113p99NM]. Wait, let me verify my impulse to image immediately; most guidelines suggest reserving CT for atypical presentations or when the diagnosis is unclear, especially when enzymes are not markedly elevated, which fits here [^116vydwn] [^116X1AVn].

> Hold on, I should verify the pattern suggested by the liver tests. A borderline ALP of 132 U/L, even if close to the lab ULN, nudges me to consider a cholestatic process more than a hepatocellular one, and I need to check GGT and direct bilirubin to substantiate cholestasis before proceeding down a biliary pathway; an algorithmic approach to LFTs supports clarifying the pattern and magnitude prior to imaging [^111MfEZb]. Next, I should review first-line imaging for suspected biliary disease; bedside or early transabdominal ultrasound is appropriate to assess common bile duct dilation or stones when cholestasis is suspected [^113UkjmJ].

> Let me consider the impact of prior cholecystectomy carefully. Even after cholecystectomy, retained or recurrent common bile duct stones and benign ductal strictures remain plausible and may present with cholestatic labs and nonspecific symptoms; I should not let the prior surgery falsely reassure me, particularly in an elderly patient [^115apfLq]. A case-based report illustrates post-cholecystectomy choledocholithiasis identified on ERCP, reinforcing that a gallbladder removal history does not eliminate CBD stones, and microlithiasis can underlie "idiopathic" episodes after cholecystectomy as well [^115nbJYv] [^113ziUfj].

> But wait, what if the mild lipase elevation is a harbinger of obstructive pancreaticobiliary malignancy rather than gallstone disease. At age 83 with new GI symptoms, pancreatic head or ampullary lesions must be excluded; a pancreas-protocol contrast-enhanced CT is the recommended initial cross-sectional study when pancreatic cancer is suspected, and CA 19–9 is more informative than CEA for pancreaticobiliary malignancy risk stratification, though either should never be used in isolation for diagnosis [^112NYjCw] [^114G8CYt]. I should confirm that normal CEA does not meaningfully reduce the pretest probability of a pancreaticobiliary tumor in this setting and proceed with imaging based on clinical risk rather than tumor markers alone [^112NYjCw].

> I need to check for alternative, non-pancreatitic sources of a mild lipase bump before anchoring on the pancreas. Mild lipase elevations can occur with biliary obstruction, intestinal inflammation or ischemia, renal insufficiency, and from drugs; I should review renal function, screen for colitis or bowel obstruction if suggested clinically, and very explicitly reconcile medications for GLP-1 receptor agonists and tyrosine kinase inhibitors that can raise enzymes or rarely precipitate pancreatitis [^113hMxVS] [^114eFvfL]. Hold on, I should verify exposure to liraglutide or similar agents and TKIs such as nilotinib or brigatinib, because their labels note enzyme elevations and pancreatitis risk, which can confound interpretation of lipase in the absence of classic pancreatitis symptoms [^113xtr3n] [^113RBwX2] [^116GtMrm] [^111P8qgG].

> Next, I should review the optimal diagnostic sequence so I don't over- or under-test. Phase 1 should include repeating liver enzymes with GGT and direct bilirubin to confirm cholestasis and obtaining a right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess ductal caliber and look for stones or sludge; if ultrasound is nondiagnostic or if there is concern for a mass, escalate to pancreas-protocol CT to evaluate both pancreatic parenchyma and periampullary structures [^111MfEZb] [^113UkjmJ] [^112NYjCw] [^116X1AVn]. If cross-sectional imaging is negative but suspicion persists, I need to consider MRCP for noninvasive ductal delineation and EUS for high-yield detection of small stones, strictures, or subtle pancreatic lesions; repeating ultrasound can also increase biliary detection rates in idiopathic scenarios [^114qDJQD] [^113UkjmJ].

> I will now synthesize the differential, but I should double-check that I am weighting probabilities appropriately. The most likely explanation is partial biliary obstruction from choledocholithiasis or sludge, or a benign bile duct stricture, given the cholestatic lean and post-cholecystectomy status; nonetheless, age and symptom onset compel me to rule out pancreatic head or ampullary malignancy early with appropriate imaging and CA 19–9 assessment, independent of CEA status [^115apfLq] [^112NYjCw]. Less likely, this represents acute pancreatitis because the biochemical criteria are not met and the typical pain pattern has not been established, although I should remain open to evolving clinical features and repeat testing if symptoms escalate or change [^111wfzKF].

> Management should be proportional to severity and pretest risk, and I need to ensure timely imaging and consultation. If symptoms are significant, brief bowel rest and IV fluids are reasonable while the workup proceeds, but empiric antibiotics are not indicated without evidence of infection; urgent ultrasound followed by CT or MRCP/EUS within 24–48 hours is appropriate in this high-risk age group, with early GI or surgical involvement if obstruction is confirmed or strongly suspected [^116X1AVn] [^112NYjCw] [^111Cvbu8]. If imaging demonstrates obstructive choledocholithiasis or a high-risk ductal lesion, ERCP for diagnosis and therapy is appropriate per common bile duct stone guidelines, and surgical consultation should follow for definitive management of structural causes when indicated [^115apfLq].

> Final take: Wait, let me restate to ensure internal consistency. These mild enzyme abnormalities most plausibly reflect a cholestatic process from partial biliary obstruction or a benign stricture after cholecystectomy; however, given advanced age and new symptoms, pancreatic head or ampullary malignancy must be actively excluded with early cross-sectional imaging and targeted tumor markers, because a normal CEA does not obviate the need to evaluate the pancreaticobiliary tract [^115apfLq] [^112NYjCw] [^111wfzKF].

---

In an 83-year-old woman with prior cholecystectomy and colon cancer, mildly elevated lipase (104 U/L) [^111wfzKF] and ALP (132 U/L) with normal CEA most likely reflect biliary obstruction [^113yP4DT] from choledocholithiasis or biliary strictures. Other considerations include pancreaticobiliary malignancy (pancreatic or cholangiocarcinoma) [^112NYjCw], medication-induced enzyme elevation [^113RBwX2], or benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia [^113hMxVS]. The next step is to obtain abdominal ultrasound [^113UkjmJ] or MRCP to assess for biliary obstruction, stones, or masses, and to check CA 19–9 and liver function tests [^111MfEZb]; if imaging is inconclusive, proceed to EUS or ERCP.

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Biliary obstruction or strictures

Obstruction can occur despite prior cholecystectomy [^115nbJYv] due to choledocholithiasis or biliary strictures [^113yP4DT], resulting in elevated ALP and mild lipase elevation due to increased pancreatic duct pressure. Post-cholecystectomy sphincter of Oddi dysfunction may also cause intermittent obstruction with concurrent ALP and lipase elevations.

---

### Pancreaticobiliary malignancy

Mild lipase elevation and cholestatic liver tests may be seen with pancreatic cancer; a normal CEA does not exclude malignancy. Biliary obstruction with elevated ALP and mild lipase elevation can likewise be caused by cholangiocarcinoma.

---

### Medication-induced enzyme elevation

In older adults, common medications can cause mild lipase elevation with cholestatic liver test abnormalities. Agents include GLP-1 agonists [^113xtr3n] [^113RBwX2], thiazides, ACE inhibitors, and statins.

---

### Benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia

Persistent mild lipase elevation without pancreatitis or structural disease can be seen in benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia [^113hMxVS]. It is a recognized phenomenon in older adults and may warrant observation rather than intervention if no other cause is identified.

---

### Other considerations

Without characteristic pain or imaging changes, chronic pancreatitis [^112y4V1D] is less likely, although it can present with mild enzyme elevation [^111BSaZo]. In the absence of systemic signs, infectious or inflammatory conditions are also less likely [^114eFvfL].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

Given the patient's history and current findings, a structured evaluation is warranted:

| **Diagnostic test** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Abdominal ultrasound | First-line to detect biliary obstruction, stones, or ductal dilation [^113yP4DT] |
| MRCP | Noninvasive assessment of biliary and pancreatic ducts for strictures, stones, or masses |
| CA 19–9 | Tumor marker for pancreaticobiliary malignancy |
| Liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin) | Assess extent of cholestasis and hepatocellular injury [^111MfEZb] |
| Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) | If imaging is inconclusive, to detect small lesions or subtle ductal abnormalities |
| ERCP | Diagnostic and therapeutic for confirmed biliary obstruction or strictures |

---

## Clinical significance and management implications

- **Biliary obstruction**: If confirmed, ERCP with stone extraction or stenting is indicated.

- **Pancreaticobiliary malignancy**: If suspected, prompt oncologic evaluation and management are required [^112NYjCw].

- **Medication-induced elevation**: Review and adjust medications as appropriate [^113RBwX2].

- **Benign hyperenzymemia**: If no structural disease is found, reassure and monitor [^113hMxVS].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely causes of mildly elevated lipase and ALP in this patient are biliary obstruction due to choledocholithiasis or strictures [^113yP4DT]; pancreaticobiliary malignancy [^112NYjCw]; medication effects; or benign hyperenzymemia [^113hMxVS]. Targeted imaging and laboratory testing will clarify the diagnosis and guide management.

Serum lipase and amylase are commonly requested in individuals presenting with abdominal pain to investigate acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic hyperenzymemia is not specific to acute pancreatitis and can occur in many other pancreatic and non-pancreatic conditions. When persistent elevation of serum lipase and amylase occurs without a diagnosed cause or evidence of laboratory assay interference, ongoing radiological assessment for pancreatic disease is required for 24 months before benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia can be diagnosed. We report a case of a 71-year-old man with epigastric pain and elevated serum lipase levels. He was extensively investigated; however, no pancreatic disease was detected. He remains asymptomatic, but serum lipase levels remain elevated 18 months after his initial presentation.

### Elevated liver enzymes: Emergency department-focused management [^111MfEZb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This has become more prevalent with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes possess underlying pathology. This emergency medicine-focused review provides a discussion of the various biochemical tests, their underlying biological basis, and an algorithmic approach to the interpretation of abnormalities.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

- **Discussion**: The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. The key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes of these groupings, followed by assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response of elevated LFTs, based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

- **Conclusions**: By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings to a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can be taken to help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis. This may assist providers in ensuring appropriate management.

### Association between time in range 70–180 mg/dl in early stage and severity with in patients acute pancreatitis [^116zVvfE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) was diagnosed if two of the following three criteria were met clinically: (1) acute, sudden, continuous, and severe upper abdominal pain, which can radiate to the back; (2) serum amylase and/or lipase activities at least three times higher than the upper limit of normal; (3) enhanced CT or MRI showing typical imaging changes of AP, such as pancreatic edema or peripancreatic effusion.

- **Group division**: Individuals were divided into two groups according to the severity of pancreatitis at discharge diagnosis:
	- **Mild group**: Patients who met the diagnostic criteria for AP without organ failure and local or systemic complications during hospitalization.
	- **Severe group**: Including MSAP and SAP, accompanied by transient organ failure (which can be recovered within 48 hours), or accompanied by single or multiple organ failure continuously (greater than 48 hours duration).

### Recurrence of idiopathic acute pancreatitis after cholecystectomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ziUfj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Cholecystectomy was performed on 126 out of 524 patients with 'original' idiopathic acute pancreatitis (IAP), accounting for 24.0% during the follow-up period. To establish a subgroup with 'true' IAP, several patients were excluded: those with an established aetiology during either standard (18 patients) or additional (165 patients) work-up, those for whom the presence of biliary disease was not sufficiently reported (195 patients), and patients with unclear disease progression during follow-up (2 patients). In the defined subgroup of 144 patients with 'true' IAP, 36 cholecystectomies were performed, representing 25.0% (refer to Fig. S4 for supporting information).

One study provided pathological examination results of the gallbladder. Microlithiasis was identified in 23 out of 39 gallbladders upon pathological review.

- **Complications of cholecystectomy**: In one study, a bile duct injury was reported in 1 out of 66 cholecystectomies. Two other studies reported no complications in 13 and 39 cholecystectomies, respectively. In total, there was one complication in 118 cholecystectomies, yielding a rate of 0.8% (95% confidence interval of 0 to 2.5%). The remaining studies did not report cholecystectomy complication rates.

### Paraduodenal pancreatitis as diagnostic challenge: Clinical and morphological features of patients with pancreatic pathology involving the pancreatic groove [^1162Rs9C]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

We retrospectively evaluated the clinical records of patients who were managed in the University Hospital of Erlangen (Germany) following a diagnosis of a new-onset pancreatic pathology involving the groove area on imaging, defined at the first imaging evaluation and re-evaluated by two radiologists blinded to the clinical data (MH and MW). We analyzed clinical, surgical, and radiological data, and hospital readmissions using our prospective clinical database, "Soarian" (Siemens GmbH, Erlangen), from January 1, 2005, up to December 31, 2022. The diagnosis of PP was based on imaging (computed tomography [CT] and/or magnetic resonance [MRI]) or histology. The primary aim was to define the diagnostic features of PP compared to similar conditions involving the groove area, namely AP with groove necrosis. Secondary aims were to compare clinical and radiological data and outcomes of conservative, interventional, and surgical therapies for pancreatitis involving the groove area. The diagnosis of PP was done according to imaging and, where available, histopathology. The diagnosis of AP was made according to the revised Atlanta classification, and patients were assigned to the AP group a posteriori, taking into account their clinical course and medical history to exclude chronic pancreatitis.

Data collection

The following clinical parameters were collected: age at clinical onset; sex; alcohol consumption (none, 20 g/day); cigarette smoking (none, 10 pack-years); jaundice; vomiting; and weight loss (defined as a reduction by > 1

### Management of acute pancreatitis [^116vydwn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) in this patient is straightforward, as he is presenting with characteristic abdominal pain and a markedly elevated lipase level. A computed tomography (CT) scan is not necessary in this case, as it will not assist in diagnosis nor be useful in predicting severity, especially since most patients (80%) will improve. CT should be reserved for patients who present with atypical symptoms or mild elevations in amylase/lipase that could be nonspecific.

The etiology of AP in this patient is unclear. Identifying the cause is important for potentially preventing recurrent pancreatitis. Biliary and alcohol are the most common causes of AP. Although ultrasound (US) is indicated as an initial evaluation of AP, a negative examination does not rule out biliary etiology. A stone in the gallbladder may have passed to the common bile duct and be missed by the US, whether it has or has not passed to the duodenum. Repeating the ultrasound on an outpatient basis is advised if no other etiology is found, given the prevalence of biliary pancreatitis.

Alcohol is a common cause of AP, but it requires a relatively large amount of alcohol consumption (50 g) over multiple years to cause pancreatic disease. Could a medication, such as semaglutide, have caused the AP? It is not likely, as there is little evidence that most medications cause AP. Although the triglyceride level is lower than 1,000 mg/dL, an outpatient repeat evaluation will be needed. Given the patient's age, there is a small but real risk of a tumor.

### Acute pancreatitis secondary to pancreatic carcinoma [^114G8CYt]. Pancreas (2000). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) has been recognized as a presentation of patients with pancreatic carcinoma (PC). However, the natural history of patients with PC who present with AP as the first manifestation is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the time between the presentation of AP and diagnosis of PC, and what factors should alert the clinician to suspect underlying PC in patients with AP.

Nineteen physicians completed the survey forms that encompassed 45 patients with a diagnosis of AP preceding a diagnosis of PC. Information included the patient's age, gender, race, conditions that could account for the AP, criteria for diagnosis of AP, severity of AP, criteria for diagnosis of PC, time between the diagnosis of AP and PC, pathology of the carcinoma, extension of the disease, treatment of PC, and survival after the diagnosis of PC.

The study population consisted of 45 patients: 27 (60%) men and 18 (40%) women whose average age was 58 years (range, 32–89). Thirty-eight patients were Caucasian, five were Black, one was Japanese, and one Arabian. The number of AP episodes before PC diagnosis ranged between one and 15 (mean ± 2 SD). AP was mild in 40 (89%) and severe in five (11%). The time between the onset of AP and the diagnosis of PC averaged 34 weeks (range, 1–52). Symptoms on presentation of AP included abdominal pain in 45 (100%), weight loss in 15 (33%), and jaundice in 3 (7%). CA 19–9 was available in 13 patients, eight of whom had levels > 100 at the time AP was diagnosed. Abnormal imaging suggestive of PC was detected by ultrasonography in 17 patients.

### Zilbrysq [^113cCiFF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pancreatitis and other pancreatic conditions**: Pancreatitis and pancreatic cysts have been reported in patients treated with Zilbrysq. During the open-label extension studies, seven (3.3%) patients experienced pancreatic events, including four (1.9%) patients with pancreatitis and three (1.4%) with pancreatic cysts.

- **Adverse reactions in study**: In the 3-month, double-blind Study 1, adverse reactions of increased lipase were reported in six (6.9%) patients treated with Zilbrysq compared to no patients on placebo. Adverse reactions of increased amylase were reported in four (4.7%) patients treated with Zilbrysq compared to one (1.1%) patient on placebo. Lipase levels exceeded three times the upper limit of normal in six (7%) patients after starting Zilbrysq compared to no patients on placebo.

Patients should be informed of this risk before starting Zilbrysq. Obtain lipase and amylase levels at baseline before starting treatment with Zilbrysq. Discontinue Zilbrysq in patients with suspected pancreatitis and initiate appropriate management until pancreatitis is ruled out or has resolved.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^1112MVtk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

- **Diagnosis criteria**: Severe acute pancreatitis is diagnosed by persistent organ failure (cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal) and has a high mortality rate. Both the Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant-based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity are used to establish diagnosis and severity.

- **Imaging work-up**: The appropriate imaging workup for suspected cases involves considering the roles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound (US), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and other ancillary tests.

- **Laboratory parameters**: Critical laboratory parameters for diagnosis should be identified. Different etiologies influence the diagnostic workup, and various scores are indicated for risk assessment. The timing and choice of tests for early follow-up imaging should be considered.

Severe acute pancreatitis is linked to persistent organ failure and high mortality. Patients experiencing persistent organ failure with infected necrosis are at the greatest risk of death and should be admitted to an intensive care unit whenever possible.

- **Discussion**: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas and histological destruction of acinar cells. Diagnosis requires at least two of the following criteria: (i) abdominal pain consistent with the disease, and (ii) biochemical evidence of pancreatitis, such as serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit.

### Acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient [^111p4GSv]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

- **Case presentation**: We discuss a case of acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient. The patient presented with sharp, intermittent abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea and a low-grade fever. The initial assessment included a thorough physical examination and an array of diagnostic tests aimed at identifying the underlying cause.

- **Diagnostic approach**: Laboratory tests were conducted, including a complete blood count and urinalysis, to rule out infections or other abnormalities. Imaging studies such as an abdominal ultrasound were utilized to assess any potential structural issues or inflammation.

- **Discussion and conclusion**: Considering the patient's symptoms and test results, possible differential diagnoses included appendicitis and mesenteric adenitis. The decision-making process was complex, requiring input from multiple healthcare professionals and careful consideration of the patient's history and presenting symptoms. Further studies are recommended to enhance diagnostic and treatment protocols for similar cases.

### Elevated lipase without pancreatitis in infectious colitis [^114eFvfL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated lipase typically confirms the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Elevated lipase may be associated with other disorders, typically with some influence on the pancreas. The differential is more limited than elevated amylase due to the mostly unique production of lipase in pancreatic acinar cells. Elevated lipase has been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but not previously reported in infectious colitis.

- **Case report**: A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain radiating to her left flank, worsening over 2 days. She denied epigastric pain. She had occasional nausea and occasional nonbilious and nonbloody emesis, and also reported diarrhea and weight loss over the preceding months. Laboratory values were largely unremarkable except for a grossly elevated lipase level. A computed tomography scan of her abdomen was performed and revealed findings consistent with infectious colitis, without signs of pancreatic inflammation or other findings associated with pancreatitis. She was admitted to the hospital, treated for infectious colitis with antibiotics, improved over 2 days, and was subsequently discharged for follow-up with her gastroenterologist. This is the first reported case of elevated lipase without pancreatitis associated with infectious colitis.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: Emergency physicians should be aware of other potential causes of elevated lipase and not assume that all cases of elevated lipase are associated with pancreatitis.

### Saxenda [^113xtr3n]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Acute pancreatitis**: Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with liraglutide. After initiation of Saxenda, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, Saxenda should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, Saxenda should not be restarted.

In Saxenda clinical trials in adults, acute pancreatitis was confirmed by adjudication in 9 (0.3%) of 3291 Saxenda-treated patients and 2 (0.1%) of 1843 placebo-treated patients. Additionally, there were 2 cases of acute pancreatitis in Saxenda-treated patients who prematurely withdrew from these clinical trials, occurring 74 and 124 days after the last dose. There were 2 additional cases in Saxenda-treated patients, 1 during an off-treatment follow-up period within 2 weeks of discontinuing Saxenda, and 1 that occurred in a patient who completed treatment and was off-treatment for 106 days.

In a Saxenda pediatric clinical trial, pancreatitis was not independently adjudicated. Pancreatitis was reported in 1 (0.8%) Saxenda-treated patient and resulted in treatment discontinuation.

Liraglutide has been studied in a limited number of adult patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development.

### Acute pancreatitis patient registry to examine novel therapies in clinical experience (APPRENTICE): An international, multicenter consortium for the study of acute pancreatitis [^1162Hrrt]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and methods:

- **Development of APPRENTICE and participating centers**: The idea of starting an international prospective registry in acute pancreatitis (AP) was developed during the AP working group at PancreasFest 2014, held in July 2014, in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, under the sponsorship of the Collaborative Alliance for Pancreatic Education and Research (CAPER). APPRENTICE members have since maintained collaborative communications via e-mail, teleconferences (webinars), and face-to-face meetings at annual conferences of gastrointestinal societies. Expertise was sought from APPRENTICE members and founders of other pancreatitis multicenter research consortia, specifically NAPS2 and INSPPIRE. The University of Pittsburgh has led this initiative from its inception and serves as the coordinating center. An analysis and publication committee with 5 members from four different continents has been established. This committee is responsible for collecting research ideas, setting deadlines, and deciding on the authorship of future publications. Additionally, a strategy has been developed to apply for grant funding in the near future.

- **Initial requirements for center participation**: For a center to participate in APPRENTICE, initial requirements include a letter from their local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee and a signed data-use agreement form, both of which need to be submitted to the University of Pittsburgh, which serves as the "umbrella" IRB. At the time of writing, 20 tertiary referral centers with established expertise in pancreatic disorders from 9 countries have joined the consortium.

- **Subject recruitment**: Standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria have been developed to ensure consistency in participant selection.

### Assessment of appropriate use of amylase and lipase testing in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis at an academic teaching hospital [^114sBgs7]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Despite evidence-based guidelines stating that lipase alone should be used in the diagnosis of suspected acute pancreatitis, healthcare providers continue to order amylase, or both amylase and lipase together. The purpose of this study was to assess the utilization of appropriate laboratory testing related to the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

The study employed a retrospective cross-sectional design, covering the timeframe from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. A retrospective chart review collected data including patient-provider encounter notes, patient demographics, provider demographics, differential and final diagnosis, and laboratory test results. Data analysis included the stratification of categorical variables and the calculation of cost savings.

For the 12-month period, the study found that 2567 (9.3%) of all amylase and lipase tests were unnecessary. Amylase tests accounted for 1881 (73.2%) of these unnecessary tests, followed by lipase tests at 686 (26.7%). Analysis of test-ordering behavior by providers revealed that MDs ordered 81.5% of all unnecessary tests. The study estimated a total cost savings of $128,350 if all unnecessary tests were eliminated.

Our study demonstrated that amylase and lipase tests have been overutilized in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

### Recurrence of idiopathic acute pancreatitis after cholecystectomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117CfACL]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

This review was written in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines and was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42017055275). Data were analyzed based on the definitions of idiopathic acute pancreatitis (IAP) as outlined in the original articles, and according to guidelines, which define IAP as acute pancreatitis in which no etiology can be determined by standard diagnostic evaluation. This evaluation consists of a detailed history, laboratory serum tests (liver enzymes, calcium, and triglycerides), and imaging (transabdominal ultrasonography on admission and repeated after discharge).

Three types of IAP were defined for the purposes of this study: "original" IAP, defined in accordance with definitions used in the original articles; "presumed" IAP, diagnosed after the standard evaluation; and "true" IAP, defined as an acute pancreatitis episode that remained unexplained after both standard diagnostic work-up and additional diagnostic tests such as EUS and MRCP.

- **Outcome measures**: The primary outcome was the recurrence rate of acute pancreatitis, calculated as the proportion of patients experiencing one or multiple episodes of acute pancreatitis after an index episode of "original", "presumed", or "true" IAP. Secondary outcomes included complications of cholecystectomy, severity of recurrences as defined by the revised Atlanta classification, and the occurrence of biliary events before cholecystectomy.

The search strategy was guided by an experienced librarian using databases such as PubMed and Embase.

### A systematic review of the predictive factors for the recurrence of acute pancreatitis [^111MXoBq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is defined as an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas, with variable involvement of other regional tissues or remote organ systems. It is considered the most common pancreatic disease with an incidence of 34 cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide, amounting to 2.8 million new cases per year. Higher occurrences are found in nations such as Japan, the United States, or Taiwan. Recent studies report an incidence of 40 cases per 100,000 in Europe, with an overall increasing trend.

AP can reach a mortality rate of 2% in Western countries and up to 7.5% in Asia.

According to the Revised Atlanta Classification (RAC), a diagnosis of AP can be made by recognizing at least two of the following three characteristics: abdominal pain compatible with AP; serum lipase activity at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal; and characteristic findings of AP on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or transabdominal ultrasonography (US).

The etiology of AP is most commonly alcoholic (AAP) or biliary (BAP), with a distribution that can vary based on geographical region or age group of the affected population.

According to the RAC, AP can be classified into three categories by disease severity:

- **Mild AP**: Defined by the lack of organ failure, it typically has a short, self-resolving course.
- **Moderately severe AP**: Characterized by transient organ failure (present for less than 48 hours) and/or local complications.
- **Severe AP**: Defined by persistent organ failure (present for more than 48 hours), often with w

### Coeliac disease masquerading as macroamylasaemia [^112aCvYB]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A woman in her late 20s was admitted with a history of non-specific abdominal pain and persistent hyperamylasaemia. Her amylase level was 620 U (normal range: 35–120 U). She was referred to the gastroenterology service due to suspected acute pancreatitis. Her medical history was unremarkable, and she was not taking any medications. On admission, she reported intermittent heartburn and dyspepsia. She experienced postprandial, non-specific epigastric pain, which was not typical of pancreatitis and not associated with any specific food. She had no vomiting, dysphagia, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation. Additionally, she did not experience significant weight loss during the period of her ongoing symptoms. Her physical examination was unremarkable. Apart from hyperamylasaemia, all other laboratory results were normal, including serum lipase, triglyceride levels, C-reactive protein, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and thyroid function tests. Serum immunoglobulins were also within normal limits. The patient showed no symptoms or signs of cholelithiasis, hepatitis, biliary cholangitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or rheumatoid arthritis. An ultrasound examination of the abdomen, including the liver and gallbladder, was normal. An abdominal CT with contrast yielded no pathological findings. Serology for coeliac disease was strongly positive, prompting an upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy, which revealed a normal examination up to the second part of the duodenum. Histological evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of coeliac disease, with findings consistent with the condition.

### Recurrence of idiopathic acute pancreatitis after cholecystectomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117SyPYK]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Two reviewers independently screened potentially relevant articles by examining the titles and abstracts. Studies were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: the study cohort comprised patients with idiopathic acute pancreatitis (IAP); the intervention was cholecystectomy, and the comparator was conservative treatment; and the outcome was the rate of recurrent acute pancreatitis. Exclusion criteria were letters, comments, case reports, reviews, conference abstracts, book chapters, studies not written in English, and studies published before 1980, owing to discrepancies in diagnostic evaluation.

The two reviewers read the full texts of potentially eligible studies individually. The reference lists of included articles were screened for relevant publications not identified in the initial search. Disagreements regarding eligibility were resolved after joint re-evaluation by the two reviewers.

After selecting studies that met the inclusion criteria, all relevant data from these studies were extracted by two reviewers using a standard form. Relevant data included study characteristics (authors, years of inclusion, publication year, country, study design, number of patients, duration of follow-up); patient characteristics (sex, age, recurrence or first episode of pancreatitis, number of previous attacks, severity of pancreatitis, previous cholecystectomy); diagnostic evaluation (history, laboratory tests, imaging); interventions (cholecystectomy); and outcome measures.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of acute pancreatitis [^113p99NM]. Canadian Journal of Surgery. Journal Canadien de Chirurgie (2016). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis serve as a clinical tool for the identification and confirmation of this condition in patients presenting with relevant symptoms. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling timely and appropriate treatment.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are based on three primary components: abdominal pain, elevated levels of lipase or amylase, and characteristic findings on imaging studies such as CT or MRI. The abdominal pain associated with acute pancreatitis is typically acute in onset, persistent, severe, and located in the epigastric region, often radiating to the back. The second component involves a significant increase in the levels of pancreatic enzymes, specifically lipase or amylase, to more than three times the upper limit of normal. The third component involves the identification of characteristic findings indicative of acute pancreatitis on CT or MRI scans.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed if two of the three criteria are met. These combinations can be either the presence of abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels, elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings, or abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings. If these combinations are not met, the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are not fulfilled. This approach ensures a high degree of diagnostic accuracy.

Understanding the impressive and relatively young history of risk and probability, which evolved in just the past 300 years and redefined our modern society, will allow surgeons and patients to have a more honest and transparent discussion on the risks and benefits of surgical procedures as part of the preoperative informed consent. Clearly, the "quest for zero risk" remains a common fallacy in our society. Thus, minimizing risk and defining an "acceptable risk" for patients frequently remain the few pragmatic options as part of the shared decision-making process for surgery.

### Double trouble: Ten-year-old girl with chronic diarrhea and acute abdominal pain [^113Xdkk7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

It is important to distinguish that there are two related but distinct pathological conditions in the patient described above. Failure to recognize this could lead to an inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis and poor patient outcomes. Therefore, it was necessary to generate two separate differential diagnoses for this case: one for acute abdominal pain and another for chronic secretory diarrhea.

- **Regarding her abdominal pain**: The diagnoses considered included several possibilities. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was deemed less likely due to a stable weight, normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 3, normal albumin, normal hemoglobin, and no inflammatory cells in the stool. Negative transglutaminase IgA and IgG tests reduced the likelihood of celiac disease. Appendicitis, pyelonephritis, and cholecystitis were ruled out with an MRI on admission. Ovarian torsion was also unlikely, as her ovaries appeared normal on the MRI. Urinalysis on admission was negative for hemoglobin, and microscopy showed only 5 to 10 red blood cells (RBCs), making nephrolithiasis possible but less likely than other conditions. Although a urine culture grew 10,000 colonies of E. coli, the patient denied dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, or flank pain, making a urinary tract infection (UTI)/pyelonephritis unlikely. An abdominal X-ray was negative for small bowel obstruction. Peptic ulcer disease was considered less likely due to the location and episodic nature of the abdominal pain, which was unrelated to meal timing. Malignancy was also considered less likely due to the acute nature of the pain and the absence of weight changes, fevers, or mass/lymphadenopathy on MRI. Additionally, lipase and MRI results were negative for acute pancreatitis.

### Tasigna [^116GtMrm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise patients about the potential health risks associated with Tasigna:

- **Pancreatitis and elevated serum lipase**: Inform patients that Tasigna may increase the risk of pancreatitis. Those with a previous history of pancreatitis might be at greater risk. It is important for patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis, such as sudden stomach pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Advise patients that Tasigna can raise the risk of hepatotoxicity. Patients with a history of liver diseases may be at risk. Immediate medical attention should be sought if they develop symptoms indicative of hepatotoxicity, such as stomach pain, yellowing of the skin and eyes, and dark-colored urine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: Inform patients that Tasigna can cause tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). They should seek immediate medical attention if any symptoms suggestive of TLS occur, such as an abnormal heartbeat or reduced urine production [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

- **Hemorrhage**: Advise patients that serious hemorrhagic events, including fatal ones, have occurred in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with Tasigna. It is crucial for patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms indicative of hemorrhage occur, such as uncontrolled bleeding, changes in eyesight, unconsciousness, or sudden headache or confusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

### A 21-year-old man with chronic pancreatitis [^111BSaZo]. JAMA (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis is a disease for which diagnosis may be difficult to ascertain, and the treatments are limited. Using the case of a 21-year-old man who has experienced episodes of epigastric pain since age 10 and was ultimately diagnosed with idiopathic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic duct stones, we discuss the evaluation and treatment of chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis is based on thorough history taking, physical examination, and carefully selected imaging studies. The etiologies may be structural or nonstructural; genes predisposing individuals to chronic pancreatitis have been identified. An evidence-based approach to treatment is limited by a paucity of randomized controlled trials. We address the patient's concerns regarding chronic pancreatitis, including what he should expect over the next several years, whether endoscopic or surgical therapies should be considered, and whether there are any cures.

### Definitions of pediatric pancreatitis and survey of present clinical practices [^114CFYBK]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). High credibility.

The INSPPIRE (International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a Cure) diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator specifically designed for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in pediatric patients. This scoring system is used to identify children who are likely to have acute pancreatitis based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. The INSPPIRE criteria include abdominal pain characteristic of pancreatitis, serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal, and imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to provide a standardized method for diagnosing acute pancreatitis in children, which can help guide treatment decisions and predict prognosis. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it should be noted that it is not intended to replace clinical judgment or to be used in isolation. Instead, it should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive clinical assessment.

The INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria evaluate the likelihood of pediatric acute pancreatitis by assessing three specific clinical factors:

- **Abdominal pain**: Determining whether abdominal pain suggestive of or compatible with acute pancreatitis is present, characterized by acute onset especially in the epigastric region.
- **Serum enzyme levels**: Evaluating whether there is serum amylase and/or lipase activity at least more than three times the upper limit of normal.
- **Imaging findings**: Assessing imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^1173vdMQ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Episodic abdominal pain, small bowel obstruction without a surgical history and no clear etiology, or nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea with complete resolution between episodes warrant consideration of hereditary angioedema (HAE) as part of the differential diagnosis. The pertinent history may include episodes of cutaneous angioedema without pruritus and urticaria.

Factors to consider in recognizing HAE in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms are summarized as follows:

- **HAE triggers**: Although most HAE attacks have no identifiable trigger, in females, HAE attacks may be brought on by normal hormonal fluctuations or the use of medications such as estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.

- **Abdominal pain characteristics**: In HAE, abdominal pain may vary in severity but typically occurs as severe intermittent episodes lasting 2 to 5 days if untreated, with normal asymptomatic periods between attacks. Abdominal pain is often described as cramping, colicky, tiring, or exhausting. During an attack, patients may experience abdominal distension, tenderness, and possibly ascites. Ascites was detected in 92% of HAE patients who underwent abdominal ultrasound during an abdominal HAE attack.

- **Clinical signs**: According to clinical experience, fever, peritoneal signs, or elevated white blood cell counts are not common during HAE attacks. These signs would be more common with an acute abdominal pathology or familial Mediterranean fever. Elevated neutrophil counts (without increased bands), hypovolemia from fluid losses, and hemoconcentration have been reported in severe attacks.

### Recurrence of idiopathic acute pancreatitis after cholecystectomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114rPi9T]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation varied widely among the included studies. None of the studies reported the use of a standard diagnostic work-up as described in the International Association of Pancreatology/American Pancreatic Association guideline to determine the most likely etiology. Most notably, definitions of alcoholic and biliary etiology varied broadly between studies. Two studies excluded patients based on raised levels of liver enzymes. Although all studies considered cholelithiasis on imaging to be an exclusion criterion for idiopathic acute pancreatitis (IAP), four did not require ultrasonography in all patients or did not mention which imaging modality was used. One study included patients with raised ALT levels, and another included patients with raised levels of liver enzymes, but only if MRCP was negative for CBD stones. Only five studies considered CBD dilatation or the presence of biliary sludge on imaging to be indicative of biliary etiology. One study reported explicitly on the presence of biliary sludge on transabdominal ultrasound imaging, but chose to consider this as indicative of IAP. Repeat transabdominal ultrasonography was commonly employed; five studies used it in all included patients and two in part of the cohort.

Eighteen of the 524 patients (3.4 percent) with 'original' IAP appeared to have a demonstrable etiology after review of the results of standard work-up; the disease was classified as 'presumed' IAP in the remaining 506 patients.

### Ectopic pancreas presenting with pancreatitis and a mesenteric mass [^116Yn85n]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Ectopic pancreas is characterized by the presence of abnormally situated pancreatic tissue that lacks contact with normal pancreatic tissue and possesses its own duct system and vascular supply. Ectopic pancreas in the gastrointestinal tract is relatively common. Although several cases of adult ectopic pancreatitis are documented in the literature, only two cases of pediatric ectopic pancreatitis have been reported at the time of writing.

We describe a 15-year-old female presenting with acute right upper quadrant pain and elevated serum lipase and amylase. Radiological assessment revealed a mesenteric soft tissue mass with adjacent inflammatory changes. However, surgical pathology confirmed a diagnosis of mesenteric ectopic pancreas complicated by pancreatitis. We advocate considering ectopic pancreatitis in pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain, laboratory findings consistent with pancreatitis, and imaging showing a mesenteric mass alongside a normal orthotopic pancreas.

### Causal evaluation of acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis in children: Consensus from the INSPPIRE group [^114SneZC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

The INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria for pediatric chronic pancreatitis (2018) is a clinical calculator specifically designed for the pediatric population. INSPPIRE stands for International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a Cure. This scoring system is used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis in children, a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas that does not heal or improve, worsens over time, and leads to permanent damage.

The clinical utility of the INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria is that it provides a standardized method for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis in children, which can be challenging due to the variability in symptoms and the lack of specific diagnostic tests. The criteria consider various factors including abdominal pain, imaging findings, pancreatic function tests, and histology.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for using the INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria. However, it is important to note that this scoring system is specifically designed for the pediatric population and may not be applicable or accurate in adults. Additionally, it should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment and not as a standalone diagnostic tool.

The INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria for pediatric chronic pancreatitis is a tool that assesses four key indicators to determine the likelihood of chronic pancreatitis in children. Each indicator is evaluated, and a score is generated based on its presence.

### Rare presentation of acute pancreatitis in mild COVID-19 [^112oiavX]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Viral-induced pancreatitis has been well-defined; however, there are limited data regarding COVID-19 and pancreatitis. Most cases occur in conjunction with severe COVID-19, accompanied by lipase elevation. We describe a unique case of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in acute pancreatitis, even in the absence of lipase elevation. A 39-year-old patient with no prior medical history presented with epigastric pain. Vital signs were unremarkable, and the patient tested positive for COVID-19. Liver function panel, calcium, triglyceride, and lipase levels were all unremarkable. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated acute pancreatitis without gallstones. Our case may indicate that pancreatic injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection is due to a direct impact on the pancreas by the virus, given the absence of lipase elevation and mild presentation. This case highlights the importance of suspecting pancreatitis in mild COVID-19 cases that present with atypical symptoms, such as epigastric pain, even in the absence of lipase elevation.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^114LQU8z]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

- **Fat malabsorption**: Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency can lead to malabsorption (or more correctly, maldigestion) and diarrhoea due to impairment of pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate secretion. In adults, this is usually the result of chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma, or pancreatic surgery.

Maldigestion of fat can result in steatorrhoea and weight loss but may not be clinically apparent. Steatorrhoea can be caused by small bowel malabsorption, and clinical assessment of steatorrhoea (e.g. by stool inspection) is unreliable. Symptoms of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency usually develop 10–15 years after the first symptoms of chronic pancreatitis and when the secretion of lipase and other pancreatic enzymes is reduced to less than 10% of normal values. The diagnosis of advanced chronic pancreatitis in patients presenting with diarrhoea is often suggested by the clinical history and confirmed with imaging.

A number of recent guidelines outline the strategies for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. There are international variations in practice depending on the availability of various modalities such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and direct pancreatic function tests. However, there is a broad agreement that invasive direct pancreatic function testing has become largely redundant in routine clinical practice, replaced by indirect pancreatic function testing and imaging. It is also recognised that there is currently no ideal test to diagnose chronic pancreatitis in early or mild disease.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^112rYNYr]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with two days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous five months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over four months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase.

She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### Diagnostic methods I: Sensitivity, specificity, and other measures of accuracy [^111yQ8iv]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

For most physicians, the use of diagnostic tests is part of the daily routine. This paper focuses on their usefulness by explaining the different measures of accuracy, the interpretation of test results, and the implementation of a diagnostic strategy. Measures of accuracy include sensitivity and specificity. Although these measures are often considered fixed properties of a diagnostic test, in reality, they are subject to multiple sources of variation, such as the population case mix and the severity of the disease under study.

Furthermore, when evaluating a new diagnostic test, it must be compared to a reference standard, though the latter is usually not perfect. In daily practice, diagnostic tests are not used in isolation. Several issues will influence the interpretation of their results.

- **Prior assumptions**: Clinicians have a prior assumption about the patient's chances of having the disease under investigation, based on the patient's characteristics, symptoms, and the disease prevalence in similar populations.

- **Diagnostic strategy**: Diagnostic tests are usually part of a diagnostic strategy. Therefore, it is not sufficient to determine the accuracy of a single test; one also needs to determine its additional value to the patient's diagnosis, treatment, or outcome as part of a diagnostic strategy.

### A multidisciplinary approach to an unusual cause of hyperamylasaemia [^114Npcca]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical features, along with the elevation of pancreatic enzymes, are crucial diagnostic indicators of acute pancreatitis. We report a case of a woman in her 50s who presented with abdominal distension and serum amylase levels elevated to more than 30 times the upper limit of normal. Initially, she was treated for acute pancreatitis; however, she did not exhibit symptoms of this condition, and the pancreas appeared normal on a CT scan. Further investigations revealed that the patient had a high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with nodal metastatic spread. An amylase-secreting ovarian tumor was suspected, supported by elevated salivary-amylase isoenzymes, which is consistent with previous reports in the literature. The patient underwent treatment with chemotherapy and surgery, during which her serum amylase and CA-125 levels initially fell significantly but eventually increased, indicating disease progression. This case serves as an important reminder to consider non-pancreatic causes of raised serum amylase to avoid misdiagnosis.

### Alvesco [^117MLgor]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety data described below for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older reflect exposure to Alvesco in doses ranging from 80 mcg to 640 mcg twice daily in five double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Studies with once daily dosing are omitted from the safety database because the doses studied once daily are lower than the highest recommended twice daily doses. The five studies were of 12 to 16 weeks treatment duration, one of which included a safety extension follow-up of one year. In the 12 to 16 week treatment studies, 720 patients (298 males and 422 females) aged 12 years and older were exposed to Alvesco. In the long-term safety trial, 197 patients (82 males and 115 females) with severe persistent asthma from one of the 12-week trials were re-randomized and treated for up to one year with Alvesco 320 mcg twice daily.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

- **Adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older**: Four of the five trials included a total of 624 patients ages 12 years and older (359 females and 265 males) with asthma of varying severity who were treated with Alvesco 80 mcg, 160 mcg, or 320 mcg twice daily for 12 to 16 weeks. These studies included patients previously using either controller therapy (predominantly inhaled corticosteroids) or reliever therapy (bronchodilator therapy).

### Cross-sectional imaging of common and unusual complications after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^111rpH2N]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

In the vast majority of cases, the clinical suspicion of early iatrogenic complications is based on a combination of intraprocedural findings (difficult or repeated cannulation, suspected or confirmed DP), symptoms, and physical signs (sudden or worsening abdominal pain, distension, fever, haemodynamic impairment), and laboratory data (decreasing haemoglobin, elevated leukocyte count, acute phase reactants, serum lipase, or amylase). The key role of CT imaging to investigate patients who become acutely ill hours or days after ERCP results from the limited value of physical examination (due to the retroperitoneal location of most iatrogenic changes) and the similar clinical and laboratory manifestations observed in most complications, particularly AP and DP.

Furthermore, ERCP duration may represent a surrogate marker for challenging cannulation and/or operative maneuvers that can lead to papillary oedema and compromise ductal outflow, resulting in an increased risk and severity of complications, particularly PEAP. According to both the literature and personal experience, planned CT may be warranted in patients after prolonged ERCP procedures, particularly with sphincterotomy or multiple cannulations.

A preliminary unenhanced CT acquisition without intravenous and peroral CM is helpful to visualize extraluminal air, particularly using image review at lung or bone window.

### Serum amylase and lipase and urinary trypsinogen and amylase for diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^117Bi8y8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The treatment of people with acute abdominal pain differs if they have acute pancreatitis. It is important to know the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis so that an informed decision can be made regarding whether the person with abdominal pain has acute pancreatitis. Currently, no Cochrane review exists on the diagnostic test accuracy of these enzymes for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

- **Objectives**: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase, either alone or in combination, in diagnosing acute pancreatitis in individuals with acute onset of persistent, severe epigastric pain or diffuse abdominal pain.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR HTA and DARE), along with other databases until March 2017. We also examined references of the included studies to identify additional studies. We did not restrict studies based on language, publication status, or the prospective or retrospective nature of the data collection. A 'related search' and 'citing reference' search were also conducted in MEDLINE and Embase.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all studies that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for diagnosing acute pancreatitis. We excluded case-control studies.

### Victoza [^113RBwX2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for Victoza-treated patients, while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%.

In the LEADER trial, serum lipase and amylase were routinely measured. Among adult Victoza-treated patients, 7.9% had a lipase value at any time during treatment of greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal compared with 4.5% of placebo-treated patients, and 1% of Victoza-treated patients had an amylase value at any time during treatment of greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal versus 0.7% of placebo-treated patients.

The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with Victoza is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see warnings and precautions (5.2)].

- **Vital signs**: Victoza did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with Victoza compared to placebo.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of Victoza. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### Abdominal cyst of unclear aetiology: Gastrointestinal stromal tumour or reactivation of abdominal tuberculosis [^115c89Jr]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis for an abdominal mass is broad and includes infection, malignancy, and other inflammatory processes. Given the elevated C-reactive protein level, an inflammatory process was high on the differential diagnosis. The mass on the initial CT scan was concerning for a pyogenic abscess, thus an infectious process was considered most likely. Since the patient had a history of abdominal TB, reactivation of TB was of strong concern, prompting AFB smear and cultures to be obtained. The patient's risk factors for abdominal TB combined with 4+ AFB on acid-fast smear were strongly suggestive of a diagnosis of TB infection.

Remarkably, the patient's symptoms did not improve with antituberculous therapy, and AFB cultures did not reveal Mycobacterium tuberculosis, prompting a biopsy of the mass. Histopathology of the core needle biopsy strongly corroborated a diagnosis of GIST. However, a diagnosis of coinfection with M. tuberculosis was still under consideration due to the presence of AFB on smear. Repeat cultures revealed M. chelonae, explaining the presence of AFB on smear, and a diagnosis of M. tuberculosis was eliminated from the differential.

### Pancreatic ascites: Update on diagnosis and management [^114gS8xu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ascites presents a diagnostic challenge due to its rarity and nonspecific clinical features. A comprehensive diagnostic approach, incorporating a history of the presenting illness, physical examination, blood tests, imaging, and diagnostic paracentesis with fluid analysis, is crucial. Physical findings of ascites may include cachexia, abdominal tenderness, peritonitis, abdominal distension, shifting dullness, positive fluid wave, decreased bowel sounds, and extremity edema. Patients with concomitant pleural effusion may exhibit decreased breath sounds, crackles or rales, and, in severe cases, may be in respiratory distress.

- **Laboratory tests**: Routine blood tests, including a complete metabolic panel, brain natriuretic peptide level, lactate, uric acid, and complete blood cell count, can help clinicians narrow down the differential diagnosis of new-onset ascites. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality observed in pancreatic ascites and is likely dilutional due to fluid retention. Hypoalbuminemia is also reported in most cases and is often secondary to severe malnutrition in the setting of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic ascites. On complete blood cell count, patients typically show low hemoglobin with a normal to mildly elevated white blood count, even in the absence of an underlying infection. Platelet count and coagulation factors, such as prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio, are usually normal. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^113pQs91]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Cystic pancreatic lesions (CPLs) are frequently incidental findings in radiological examinations performed for unrelated symptoms. As management strategies vary based on their histological nature, differential diagnosis is essential. Radiologists play a key role in the diagnosis and management of these lesions, as imaging can correctly characterize most of them and thus guide correct management.

The first step for accurate characterization is to look for a communication between the CPLs and the main pancreatic duct. Following this, it is essential to evaluate the morphology of the lesions. Age, sex, and a history of previous pancreatic pathologies are important factors in differential diagnosis. However, because some CPLs with different pathological backgrounds may exhibit similar morphological findings, differential diagnosis can be challenging.

In such cases, a final diagnosis may require other techniques, such as endoscopic ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration, or endoscopic ultrasound-through the needle biopsy. Multidisciplinary management is therefore important for correct management.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pancreatic trauma, more specifically with respect to CT, AAST/WSES 2019 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a repeated CT within 12–24 hours from the initial injury. This is advised for hemodynamically stable patients with high clinical suspicion of duodeno-pancreatic injury or pancreatic ductal injury, particularly if the initial CT results are negative or display non-specific findings. This recommendation is also applicable in cases of elevated amylase and lipase levels or persistent abdominal pain.

### Alunbrig [^111P8qgG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pancreatic enzymes elevation**: In the ALTA 1L study, amylase elevation occurred in 52% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 amylase elevation observed in 6.8% of patients. Lipase elevations were noted in 59% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevation occurring in 17%.

In the ALTA study, amylase elevation was reported in 27% of patients in the 90 mg group and 39% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Lipase elevations occurred in 21% of patients in the 90 mg group and 45% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 amylase elevation was observed in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 2.7% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevation occurred in 4.6% of patients in the 90 mg group and 5.5% of patients in the 90→180 mg group.

Monitor lipase and amylase levels during treatment with Alunbrig. Withhold Alunbrig for Grade 3 or 4 pancreatic enzyme elevation. Upon resolution or recovery to Grade 1 or baseline, resume Alunbrig at the same dose or at a reduced dose as described in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Recurrent acute pancreatitis: International state-of-the-science conference with recommendations [^113vU3Jk]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) is a clinically significant problem globally. The etiology remains unclear in approximately 10% to 15% of patients despite a thorough workup. Data on natural history and efficacy of treatments are limited. We aimed to establish criteria for diagnosis, evaluate the causative factors, and arrive at a consensus on the appropriate workup and management of patients with RAP.

The organizing committee was formed, and a set of questions was developed based on the evidence, controversies, and topics that needed further research. After a vetting process, these topics were assigned to a group of experts from around the world with a special interest in RAP. Data were presented as part of a workshop on RAP organized as a part of the annual meeting of the American Pancreatic Association. Pretest and posttest questions were administered, and the responses were tabulated by the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. The consensus guidelines were established in the format of a diagnostic algorithm. Several deficiencies were identified with respect to etiology, treatment efficacies, and areas that need immediate research.

### What is beyond salmonella gastroenteritis? A case of acute pancreatitis complicating salmonella infection in a child: A case report and literature review [^116Uy6eh]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Hermans et al. studied 14 patients with typhoid fever and found that 7 patients had elevated serum amylase and lipase levels on admission, and 4 out of the 14 patients showed clinical signs of pancreatitis. Baert et al. analyzed 31 patients with salmonella gastroenteritis, finding that 22% experienced an elevation in serum lipase. In each patient, pancreatitis was mild with minimal changes observed in ultrasounds. Based on these studies, we concluded that salmonella infection can be associated with chemical pancreatitis but not necessarily with clinically evident pancreatitis.

The mechanism of pancreatitis in patients with salmonella infection is not well understood, although hematogenous or lymphatic spread are the proposed theories. Direct penetration of the pancreas via the migration of salmonella to the pancreatic duct from the duodenum and biliary tree is another theory. Finally, it is also theorized that toxin-induced or immune-mediated pancreatitis can be associated with salmonella infection.

Our patient had multiple reasons for his abdominal pain. Although he tested positive for GAS, the history and physical examination were not supportive of such infection. Therefore, we believe that the positive rapid antigen detection test indicated a carrier state rather than a true infection. We also believe that the pain and the high-grade fever in this patient may have been attributable to intra-abdominal abscesses, as manifested in the ultrasound by multiple fluid pockets that responded well to antibiotic therapy.

### Acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient [^1137px3N]. Clinical pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The patient presented with two of the three criteria from the revised Atlanta classification, including acute onset epigastric pain and elevated lipase. This led to a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) without a clear etiology. Given that the patient was previously well, the negative workup for common causes of AP, and the progressive history of cannabis use coinciding with the onset of symptoms, the likely cause of the patient's symptoms was ingestion of cannabis. He was diagnosed with cannabis-induced acute pancreatitis (CIAP) with secondary upper gastrointestinal bleed resulting from a Mallory-Weiss tear.

### Prevalence of imaging findings of acute pancreatitis in emergency department patients with elevated serum lipase [^112oLjL4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

To assess the association of imaging features of acute pancreatitis (AP) with the magnitude of lipase elevation in Emergency Department (ED) patients, this Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study included 509 consecutive patients presenting from 9/1/13 to 8/31/15 to a large academic ED with serum lipase levels ≥ 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) (≥ 180 U/L). Patients were excluded if they did not have imaging (n = 131) or had a history of trauma, abdominal metastases, altered mental status, or transfer from an outside hospital (n = 190); the final study population was 188 patients. Imaging exams were retrospectively evaluated, and a consensus opinion of two subspecialty-trained abdominal radiologists was used to diagnose AP. The primary outcome was the presence of imaging features of AP stratified by lipase level (≥ 3×-10× ULN and > 10× ULN). The secondary outcome was the rate of discordant consensus evaluation compared to the original radiologist's report.

- **Results**: 25.0% of patients (47/188) had imaging features of AP. When lipase was > 10× ULN (n = 94), patients were more likely to have imaging features of AP (34%) compared to those with mild elevation (16%) (p = 0.0042). There was a moderately strong correlation between lipase level and presence of imaging features of AP (r = 0.48, p < 0.0001). Consensus review of CT and MRI images was discordant with the original report in 14.9% (28/188) of cases.

- **Conclusion**: Prevalence of imaging signs of AP in an ED population with lipase ≥ 3× ULN undergoing imaging is low. However, the probability of imaging features of AP increases as lipase levels rise.
