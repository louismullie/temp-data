## Question

How long should someone take fosomax

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long someone should take Fosamax (alendronate). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and standard dosing. Then, I should verify what the FDA label says about optimal duration and the strength of evidence. Next, I will review guideline recommendations for drug holidays, risk stratification, and when to extend therapy. After that, I should check the risk–benefit profile with longer use and monitoring parameters. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-based recommendation and a concise takeaway that I can double-check against high-credibility sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and dosing because duration depends on why alendronate is being used and at what dose. Typical regimens include 70 mg weekly for postmenopausal osteoporosis and for men with osteoporosis, 35 mg weekly for prevention in postmenopausal women, 5–10 mg daily for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, and 40 mg daily for 6 months for Paget's disease, so the indication and dose frame the time horizon of therapy [^112x3NwB] [^114dUxK4] [^115xRAK4].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA position on optimal duration because that anchors the ceiling for most patients; the U.S. label explicitly states the optimal duration of use has not been determined and that the pivotal efficacy dataset spans about 4 years, but it also advises that for patients at low risk for fracture, consider discontinuation after 3–5 years of use, with continued therapy for higher-risk patients and periodic reassessment after discontinuation, which signals individualized duration rather than indefinite treatment [^114dp4xK] [^113qGT1G].

> Hold on, I should align this with professional guidelines to avoid overgeneralization. The AACE/ACE 2020 guideline advises offering a bisphosphonate holiday after about 5 years of oral therapy if fracture risk is no longer high, extending up to a total of 10 years for those who remain high risk, with decisions guided by changes in BMD and bone turnover markers, while ACOG 2022 and the Endocrine Society similarly support reassessment at 3–5 years and continuation up to about 10 years in high-risk patients, and ASBMR guidance likewise recommends reassessment at 3–5 years with extended therapy for high-risk individuals [^115fF8SP] [^111zvn9u] [^114jtBQy] [^115AQZNp].

> I need to ensure the risk–benefit balance is clear as duration increases. The benefits of fracture risk reduction accrue early and persist for several years after stopping due to skeletal retention, but rare harms such as atypical femur fractures increase with longer continuous exposure, with risk rising after about 5 years, so guidelines balance these by recommending a holiday in lower-risk patients while allowing extension in those at persistently high risk, which underscores the need for individualized decision-making rather than a fixed stop date [^112TJ2qa] [^111uQabf] [^112syzA1].

> Let me think about monitoring because duration decisions hinge on it. I should confirm that reassessment includes a current DXA to evaluate BMD trajectory, a careful fracture risk review, and consideration of bone turnover markers such as CTX to gauge ongoing suppression and guide whether a holiday is appropriate or when to restart, with the general principle that BMD gains wane slowly during a holiday and that significant BMD loss or a return of elevated turnover would prompt resumption of therapy [^116xDekm] [^11472FPr] [^112eJjGj].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there was a universal 10-year maximum, but I should double-check. Some guidelines allow extension up to about 10 years for very high-risk patients, yet this is not a rigid cap, and many clinicians use 5 years as a standard initial course with reassessment, reserving extension beyond 5 years for those who remain high risk, which better reflects the risk-adapted approach and the label's "no established optimal duration" stance [^115fF8SP] [^111zvn9u] [^114dp4xK].

> Next, I should review the drug holiday concept to avoid overstating continuous therapy. After 3–5 years of oral bisphosphonate, if fracture risk is low-to-moderate, a holiday of 2–3 years is reasonable because antifracture benefit can persist, whereas high-risk patients generally should not take a holiday or should keep it brief with close monitoring, and importantly, non-bisphosphonate antiresorptives like denosumab do not retain benefit after discontinuation and therefore are not candidates for holidays, which affects sequencing decisions if a switch is planned [^11321AQ1] [^114Ziyv4] [^113ers4t].

> I should confirm special situations. For glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, treatment is commonly continued as long as glucocorticoids are required, with ongoing reassessment, and for Paget's disease, the labeled course is 6 months with reassessment rather than indefinite therapy, so indication-specific endpoints matter and can truncate or extend the duration accordingly [^114dUxK4] [^115xRAK4].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize a practical, risk-based recommendation I can stand behind. For most patients with postmenopausal or age-related osteoporosis treated with alendronate, a reasonable approach is to treat for about 5 years and then reassess, continuing up to 10 years total if fracture risk remains high, while considering a drug holiday of 2–3 years in those at low-to-moderate risk who have remained fracture-free and have stable or improved BMD, with earlier reassessment at 3 years in higher-risk patients and decisions individualized by BMD changes, fracture history, and bone turnover markers, and with ongoing calcium and vitamin D optimization throughout therapy [^111zvn9u] [^115fF8SP] [^114dp4xK].

> In short, I should double-check that the final answer aligns with both the FDA label and major guidelines. There is no single fixed duration for everyone, but the consistent, evidence-based framework is to treat for about 3–5 years, reassess fracture risk, extend up to about 10 years for those who remain high risk, and consider a holiday in lower-risk patients, all while monitoring BMD and symptoms and adjusting therapy accordingly, which captures both the uncertainty of optimal duration and the need for risk-adapted, time-limited use with periodic reassessment [^114dp4xK] [^111zvn9u] [^11321AQ1].

The recommended duration of Fosamax (alendronate) is **3–5 years for most patients** [^11321AQ1], after which reassess fracture risk to decide on continuation or a drug holiday [^114Ziyv4]. For low-to-moderate risk patients, **consider a holiday after 3–5 years** [^114Ziyv4]; for high-risk patients, continue up to 10 years [^111zvn9u] with periodic reassessment [^notfound]. For Paget's disease, treat for 6 months [^115xRAK4]; for periprosthetic bone loss after knee replacement, treat for 6 months [^113tAo23]. Ongoing therapy should be **individualized** [^1129L4dq] based on risk, BMD, and clinical factors [^114Ziyv4].

## General recommendations for osteoporosis treatment

- **Initial treatment duration**: 3–5 years for most patients with osteoporosis [^111zvn9u] [^1129L4dq].

- **Reassessment**: After 3–5 years, reassess fracture risk, BMD, and clinical status to decide on continuation or a drug holiday [^111zvn9u] [^114Ziyv4].

- **Low-to-moderate risk patients**: Consider a bisphosphonate holiday after 3–5 years if fracture risk is no longer high [^115fF8SP] [^11321AQ1].

- **High-risk patients**: Continue therapy up to 10 years [^111zvn9u] if fracture risk remains high, with periodic reassessment [^115AQZNp].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Postmenopausal osteoporosis | 3–5 years initially [^111zvn9u] | Reassess after 3–5 years; continue up to 10 years if high risk [^115fF8SP] |
| Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis | 3–5 years [^115AQZNp] | Reassess after 3–5 years; continue if high risk [^115AQZNp] |
| Paget's disease of bone | 6 months [^115xRAK4] | Single course; retreat if relapse occurs |
| Periprosthetic bone loss after knee replacement | 6 months [^113tAo23] | Start postoperative day 2; continue for 6 months |

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

Several factors **influence therapy duration**:

- **Fracture risk**: Higher risk may warrant longer therapy (up to 10 years) [^111zvn9u] [^115AQZNp].

- **Bone mineral density (BMD)**: Significant BMD loss may prompt continuation or holiday termination [^115fF8SP] [^116xDekm].

- **Age and comorbidities**: Older age and comorbidities may influence duration and need for ongoing therapy [^115AQZNp] [^1129L4dq].

- **Patient preference and adherence**: Shared decision-making and adherence affect duration and outcomes [^112cmp68] [^112jrUAb].

---

## Risks and benefits of long-term use

Benefits include sustained fracture risk reduction [^115AQZNp] and increased BMD with continued therapy [^114dp4xK], whereas risks include rare atypical femur fractures [^112TJ2qa] and osteonecrosis of the jaw with prolonged use [^1148XtuZ]; overall, **benefits generally outweigh risks**, especially in high-risk patients [^115AQZNp] [^114jtBQy].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **periodic reassessment** of fracture risk, BMD, and clinical status during therapy and holidays [^111zvn9u] [^114Ziyv4]. Bone turnover markers can help assess treatment response and guide holiday decisions [^11472FPr]. Patients should be educated on adherence, potential side effects, and when to seek care [^114o5z5z].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial treatment**: 3–5 years for most patients [^111zvn9u] [^1129L4dq].

- **Reassessment**: After 3–5 years, reassess risk and BMD [^11321AQ1] [^114Ziyv4].

- **Holiday**: Consider for low-to-moderate risk after 3–5 years [^115fF8SP] [^11321AQ1].

- **Continuation**: Up to 10 years for high-risk patients [^111zvn9u] [^111Ed8xK].

- **Individualization**: Tailor to risk, BMD, age, comorbidities, and preferences [^1129L4dq] [^112eJjGj].

---

The recommended duration of Fosamax therapy is **3–5 years initially** [^111zvn9u], with reassessment to guide continuation or a drug holiday; extend up to 10 years for high-risk patients, and tailor decisions to individual risk, BMD, and clinical factors [^115fF8SP].

Daily Dosing

The efficacy of FOSAMAX 10 mg daily was assessed in four clinical trials. Study 1, a three-year, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, US clinical study enrolled 478 patients with a BMD T-score at or below minus 2.5 with or without a prior vertebral fracture; Study 2, a three-year, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Multinational clinical study enrolled 516 patients with a BMD T-score at or below minus 2.5 with or without a prior vertebral fracture; Study 3, the Three-Year Study of the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) a study which enrolled 2027 postmenopausal patients with at least one baseline vertebral fracture; and Study 4, the Four-Year Study of FIT: a study which enrolled 4432 postmenopausal patients with low bone mass but without a baseline vertebral fracture.

Effect on Fracture Incidence

To assess the effects of FOSAMAX on the incidence of vertebral fractures (detected by digitized radiography; approximately one third of these were clinically symptomatic), the U.S. and Multinational studies were combined in an analysis that compared placebo to the pooled dosage groups of FOSAMAX (5 or 10 mg for three years or 20 mg for two years followed by 5 mg for one year). There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients treated with FOSAMAX experiencing one or more new vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo (3.2% vs. 6.2%; a 48% relative risk reduction). A reduction in the total number of new vertebral fractures (4.2 vs. 11.3 per 100 patients) was also observed. In the pooled analysis, patients who received FOSAMAX had a loss in stature that was statistically significantly less than was observed in those who received placebo (-3.0 mm vs. -4.6 mm).

The Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) consisted of two studies in postmenopausal women: the Three-Year Study of patients who had at least one baseline radiographic vertebral fracture and the Four-Year Study of patients with low bone mass but without a baseline vertebral fracture. In both studies of FIT, 96% of randomized patients completed the studies (i.e., had a closeout visit at the scheduled end of the study); approximately 80% of patients were still taking study medication upon completion.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^113ApMNc]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

ECTS 2020

The ECTS have updated their guidance in a position paper published in October 2020. They reference the "treat to target" approach to osteoporosis treatment, BMD being the sole discussed marker of fracture risk. It is acknowledged that a BMD-only based concept has not been universally accepted and it is prudent to consider other risk factors such as prevalent fractures and continued glucocorticoid or aromatase inhibitor use. The ECTS thus state that in patients with high fracture risk, long-term treatment is supported by safety and efficacy data up to 10 years. The Society advise that pending longer term data the decision to extend denosumab treatment beyond 10 years should be decided in individual cases (for example those with limited life expectancy, significant renal impairment or an explicit patient wish). Mindful of the increased risk of unscheduled treatment cessation with longer treatment duration they recommend to thoroughly assess the indication to start denosumab before commencing, particularly in younger patients where the longer duration may predispose to unscheduled discontinuation. The guidelines also comment on the issue of dentist-initiated treatment interruption, advising that it is preferable to wait for 5 months after last administration before undergoing a procedure and to withhold further treatment until the lesion is healed. Regarding treatment cessation and sequential therapy after denosumab, the ECTS recommend that denosumab may be ceased once the patient is no longer considered at high risk of fragility fracture but that it is then necessary to prescribe a potent antiresorptive, particularly a bisphosphonate. Oral bisphosphonate can be considered in patients reaching this threshold prior to exceeding 2.5 years of denosumab therapy, but if opting for an oral bisphosphonate the advice is to perform a DXA at the time the next denosumab dose is due and to measure bone turnover markers 3 months later to monitor efficacy and adherence, aiming for a level below the mean found in healthy premenopausal women. If there is an adequate response, then they recommend to continue for 1–2 years and reassess with repeat DXA and decide about continuation or discontinuation of bisphosphonate as per the guidance of Kanis et al. Intravenous zoledronate is recommended when there is gastric intolerance of oral bisphosphonate, inadequate response to therapy, or in patients with a long duration of denosumab exposure (longer than 2.5 years). As discussed, the optimal timing of the infusion is yet to be clarified but the ECTS recommend the pragmatic approach of beginning treatment 6 months after the last denosumab injection, and monitoring the bone turnover markers at 3 and 6 months; if bone remodelling is increased, then a second infusion could be considered. The subsequent duration of zoledronate treatment is also yet to be optimally assessed. For patients who have received denosumab for over 2.5 years, the option is also provided to continue denosumab up to 10 years. Despite these guidelines the evidence behind the sequential therapy recommendations is limited and summarized below.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^116gfSLw]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ms BPS has been taking alendronate for 15 years, a duration of treatment that should be generally discouraged due to the cumulative efficacy of bisphosphonates and concern of rare adverse effects, albeit ones that are more strongly associated with very prolonged bisphosphonate use. A detailed history should explore any previous drug holidays or temporary discontinuation (prescribed or self‐administered). This could help to tailor the length of a new, possible drug holiday. Clinical evaluation should include assessment for thigh or groin pain indicative of prodromal symptoms of AFF and oral examination for dental health status that might affect ONJ risk.

Diagnostic evaluation should include a current DXA scan to assess BMD changes over time. If her BMD has remained stable or improved, and her fracture risk is now moderate to low, initiating a drug holiday might be considered. In addition, DXA images sometimes (if the window of interest is slightly lowered) can be used to screen for AFF and may add value. During her drug holiday, she should be under regular monitoring of BMD and BTMs. A significant decline in BMD or a significant increase in BTMs toward baseline levels may indicate the need to resume therapy. The duration of her drug holiday might vary but is typically less than one year.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Instruct patients to read the Medication Guide before starting therapy with FOSAMAX PLUS D and to reread it each time the prescription is renewed.

17.1 Osteoporosis Recommendations, Including Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if intake is inadequate. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home bound, or chronically ill) should take additional vitamin D if needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require additional vitamin D supplementation. Weight-bearing exercise should be considered along with the modification of certain behavioral factors, such as cigarette smoking and/or excessive alcohol consumption, if these factors exist.

17.2 Dosing Instructions

Instruct patients that the expected benefits of FOSAMAX PLUS D may only be obtained when it is taken with plain water the first thing upon arising for the day at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day. Even dosing with orange juice or coffee has been shown to markedly reduce the absorption of alendronate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Instruct patients not to chew or suck on the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration.

Instruct patients to swallow each tablet of FOSAMAX PLUS D with a full glass of water (6–8 ounces) and not to lie down for at least 30 minutes and until after their first food of the day to facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation.

Instruct patients not to take FOSAMAX PLUS D at bedtime or before arising for the day. Patients should be informed that failure to follow these instructions may increase their risk of esophageal problems.

Instruct patients that if they develop symptoms of esophageal disease (such as difficulty or pain upon swallowing, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn) they should stop taking FOSAMAX PLUS D and consult their physician.

If patients miss a dose of FOSAMAX PLUS D, instruct patients to take one tablet on the morning after they remember. They should not take two tablets on the same day but should return to taking one tablet once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — duration of therapy and drug holidays: Limit treatment with abaloparatide and teriparatide to 2 years and follow therapy with a bisphosphonate or denosumab (Grade A; BEL 1). Limit treatment with romosozumab to 1 year and follow with a drug intended for long-term use, such as a bisphosphonate or denosumab (Grade B; BEL 1, downgraded due to limited evidence). For oral bisphosphonates, consider a bisphosphonate holiday after 5 years of treatment if fracture risk is no longer high (such as when the T score is greater than −2.5, or the patient has remained fracture free), but continue treatment up to an additional 5 years if fracture risk remains high (Grade B; BEL 2); for very high fracture risk, consider a holiday after 6 to 10 years of stability (Grade B; BEL 2). For zoledronate, consider a bisphosphonate holiday after 3 years in high-risk patients or until fracture risk is no longer high, and continue for up to 6 years in very-high-risk patients (Grade A; BEL 1). The ending of a bisphosphonate holiday should be based on circumstances such as an increase in fracture risk, a decrease in BMD beyond the least significant change of the DXA machine, or an increase in bone turnover markers (Grade A; BEL 1). A holiday is not recommended for non-bisphosphonate antiresorptive drugs, and treatment with such agents should be continued for as long as clinically appropriate (both Grade A; BEL 1). If denosumab therapy is discontinued, patients should be transitioned to another antiresorptive (Grade A; BEL 1).

### Managing osteoporosis in patients on long-term bisphosphonate treatment: report of a task force of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research [^115AQZNp]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates (BPs) are the most commonly used medications for osteoporosis. This ASBMR report provides guidance on BP therapy duration with a risk-benefit perspective. Two trials provided evidence for long-term BP use. In the Fracture Intervention Trial Long-term Extension (FLEX), postmenopausal women receiving alendronate for 10 years had fewer clinical vertebral fractures than those switched to placebo after 5 years. In the HORIZON extension, women who received 6 annual infusions of zoledronic acid had fewer morphometric vertebral fractures compared with those switched to placebo after 3 years. Low hip T-score, between -2 and -2.5 in FLEX and below -2.5 in HORIZON extension, predicted a beneficial response to continued therapy. Hence, the Task Force suggests that after 5 years of oral BP or 3 years of intravenous BP, reassessment of risk should be considered. In women at high risk, for example, older women, those with a low hip T-score or high fracture risk score, those with previous major osteoporotic fracture, or who fracture on therapy, continuation of treatment for up to 10 years (oral) or 6 years (intravenous), with periodic evaluation, should be considered. The risk of atypical femoral fracture, but not osteonecrosis of the jaw, clearly increases with BP therapy duration, but such rare events are outweighed by vertebral fracture risk reduction in high-risk patients. For women not at high fracture risk after 3 to 5 years of BP treatment, a drug holiday of 2 to 3 years can be considered. The suggested approach for long-term BP use is based on limited evidence, only for vertebral fracture reduction, in mostly white postmenopausal women, and does not replace the need for clinical judgment. It may be applicable to men and patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, with some adaptations. It is unlikely that future trials will provide data for formulating definitive recommendations. © 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Goal-directed osteoporosis treatment: ASBMR / BHOF task force position statement 2024 [^112ToTcj]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

When treatment targets have not been met

Patients with clinical fractures or confirmed vertebral fractures while on medication have not achieved treatment targets and are at imminent risk of more fractures. While a fracture on treatment does not necessarily represent treatment failure, it does suggest that fracture risk is higher than previously recognized. After an evaluation for secondary causes of osteoporosis, interventions to reduce falls risk and improve treatment adherence should be implemented and patients should be started or continued on the most potent medication (or medication sequence) for at least the next 2 yr. This strategy could also consider switching to or adding an osteoanabolic agent to ongoing antiresorptive medication. In women who have already been treated with osteoanabolic medication and remain at very high risk, another course of osteoanabolic medication (either using the same or different medication) could be considered. The optimal timing of a second course of treatment and how to maximize BMD gain after antiresorptive therapy is unknown, although repeated use of branded teriparatide is approved in some countries, if a patient remains at or has returned to a high risk for fracture. This approach might also be appropriate for women whose BMD levels remain below the target or those who lose BMD despite therapy. Continuing an antiresorptive medication, such as denosumab, is also a potential strategy, especially when osteoanabolic options are limited.

### How would you manage this patient with osteoporosis? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113Dhr5S]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength that increases the risk for fracture. Approximately 10 million men and women in the United States have osteoporosis, and more than 2 million osteoporosis-related fractures occur annually. In 2016, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists issued the "Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis", and in 2017, the American College of Physicians issued the guideline "Treatment of Low Bone Density or Osteoporosis to Prevent Fracture in Men and Women". Both guidelines agree that patients diagnosed with osteoporosis should be treated with an antiresorptive agent, such as alendronate, that has been shown to reduce hip and vertebral fractures. However, there is no consensus on how long patients with osteoporosis should be treated and whether bone density should be monitored during and after the treatment period. In this Beyond the Guidelines, 2 experts discuss management of osteoporosis in general and for a specific patient, the role of bone density monitoring during and after a 5-year course of alendronate, and treatment recommendations for a patient whose bone density decreases during or after a 5-year course of alendronate.

### Response to oral bisphosphonates in subgroups of younger and older postmenopausal women [^112wzPUf]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although the effects of bisphosphonates in bone are known for postmenopausal women, it is not known if younger postmenopausal women have a similar response. Furthermore, it is not known if the effects of alendronate and risedronate differ in postmenopausal women in regard to age, specifically in women at or younger than the mean age of natural menopause. Our aim was to examine the effects of two oral bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women by age.

Methods

This was a post-hoc analysis of postmenopausal women < 55 or ≥ 55 years old with low bone mineral density (BMD), randomized to once weekly alendronate 70 mg or risedronate 35 mg for 1 year with 1-year extensions in U.S. and International Fosamax Actonel Comparison Trials.

Results

In both age subgroups of postmenopausal women, alendronate produced significantly greater mean BMD increases from baseline than risedronate at hip trochanter, lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. Changes in BMD were not significantly different between younger and older alendronate-treated women, although treatment differences favoring alendronate were numerically greater for younger than older postmenopausal women at all sites. Significantly greater reductions in bone turnover markers also occurred with alendronate vs. risedronate in both subgroups. Tolerability was similar between treatments.

Conclusions

In this post-hoc subgroup analysis of older and younger postmenopausal women receiving alendronate or risedronate, larger treatment differences in BMD gain in younger compared with older women suggest that patient age may affect the relative efficacy of these antiresorptive drugs.

### New national osteoporosis guidance-implications for geriatricians [^114xLEF5]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment approaches

Oral alendronate remains a highly clinically effective and cost-effective first-line anti-osteoporosis treatment, which is suitable for the majority of older people with high fracture risk, and, after consideration, for many with very high fracture risk unsuitable for parenteral intervention. Notably, because older people have such high absolute fracture risks, the number needed to treat (NNT) is relatively few; in a '' setting in Sweden, within a population aged ≥ 80 years recruited from hospitals and care homes, the NNT with oral alendronate to prevent a hip fracture was 26, and any fracture 20, compared against a number needed to harm, by causing mild upper gastrointestinal symptoms, of 91.

Treatment duration and monitoring guidance for people treated with oral bisphosphonates have been tightened. Anyone, either aged 70 years, or with ≥ 2 vertebral fractures, or is taking glucocorticoids, should be counselled from the outset for 10 years of treatment (only those who are younger and at lower risk should be considered for a treatment pause after 5 years). Tolerance to oral bisphosphonates must be checked after 12–16 weeks, adherence must be checked after 1 year and fracture risk must be reassessed after 5 years (sooner if re-fracture or new CRFs develop). This change in emphasis responds to the increased fragility fracture risk seen when anti-resorptive therapy is routinely stopped after 5 years; a decision in higher-risk patients that often fails to balance the far greater risk of typical fragility fracture versus very rare side-effects.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^117AvP4w]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2016 American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) guidance on drug holidays for patients on long‐term bisphosphonates offers emphasizes the balance between the benefits of fracture prevention with bisphosphonate and the need to reassess fracture risk over time(see Figure 1). High‐risk patients, such as persons age > 70 years, those with a low hip T score (less than −2.5), those who have had a major osteoporotic fracture, or those who continue to fracture while on therapy, may benefit from extended treatment for up to 10 years with oral bisphosphonates or 6 years with intravenous zoledronic acid. For patients deemed to be at low or moderate fracture risk after the initial treatment period, a drug holiday of two to three years may be considered. During this period, patients should undergo periodic reassessment of their fracture risk, including monitoring BMD and possibly bone turnover markers (BTMs). This reassessment helps determine the appropriate time to reinitiate therapy if the patient's fracture risk increases. A decrease in BMD of > 3% (usually more than the least significant change on dual x‐ray absorptiometry [DXA]) is considered significant at an individual patient level.

### Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol (Femynor) [^111a83mh]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

2.2 How to Take Femynor

Starting Femynor after Abortion or Miscarriage

First-trimester

After a first-trimester abortion or miscarriage, Femynor may be started immediately. An additional method of contraception is not needed if Femynor is started immediately.
If Femynor is not started within 5 days after termination of the pregnancy, the patient should use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of her first cycle pack of Femynor.

Second-trimester

Do not start until 4 weeks after a second-trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start Femynor, following the instructions in Table 1 for Day 1 or Sunday start, as desired. If using Sunday start, use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of the patient's first cycle pack of Femynor. [See Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling .]

Starting Femynor after Childbirth

Do not start until 4 weeks after delivery, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start contraceptive therapy with Femynor following the instructions in Table 1 for women not currently using hormonal contraception.
Femynor is not recommended for use in lactating women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
If the woman has not yet had a period postpartum, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to use of Femynor. [See Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling].

SET THE DAY:

 □ Day 1 Start: Take the first pill of the first blister pack during the first 24 hours of your period.

 □ Sunday Start: Take the first pill of the first blister pack on the Sunday after your period starts, even if you are still bleeding. If your period begins on Sunday, start the blister pack that same day.

2.4 Advice in Case of Gastrointestinal Disturbances

In case of severe vomiting or diarrhea, absorption may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken. If vomiting or diarrhea occurs within 3 to 4 hours after taking a red "active" tablet, handle this as a missed tablet [see FDA-approved Patient Labeling].

2.4 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if dietary intake is inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home bound, or chronically ill) may need additional vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.

The recommended intake of vitamin D is 400–800 international units daily. FOSAMAX PLUS D 70 mg/2800 international units and 70 mg/5600 international units are intended to provide seven days' worth of 400 and 800 international units daily vitamin D in a single, once-weekly dose, respectively.

2.5 Administration Instructions for Missed Doses

If a once-weekly dose of FOSAMAX PLUS D is missed, instruct patients to take one tablet on the morning after they remember. They should not take two tablets on the same day but should return to taking one tablet once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.

The risk–benefit balance of bisphosphonates can be evaluated by the number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH). Although the NNT for preventing typical osteoporosis fractures is largely favorable in the early years of treatment, the NNH for serious adverse events such as AFF increases with extended therapy. In White women, bisphosphonate use corresponded to a NNT for preventing a typical fragility hip fractures of approximately 350 and 170 at 5 and 10 years, respectively. In contrast, in Asian women, the NNT was greater at 575 and 278 at 5 and 10 years, respectively. After five years of treatment, the NNH to cause an AFF was 12,500 for all women. However, The NNH decreased after 10 years of continuous treatment to 2,630. Of note, the NNH at 10 year was disproportionately lower among Asian women at only 424, thus indicating a higher rate of AFF compared to the overall population. The study also identified other risk factors for AFF, beside Asian ethnicity, including reduced height, weight, and glucocorticoid use. Importantly, the risk of AFF decreased rapidly after discontinuation of bisphosphonates, highlighting the importance of considering so called drug holidays. These therapy transitions to other types of medications are intended to mitigate long‐term risks while maintaining the therapeutic benefits of fracture prevention. This balance in risk and benefit among different ethnic groups of women, in particular, necessitates careful consideration on the selective timing and duration of bisphosphonate therapy.

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1129L4dq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Clinical considerations — bisphosphonate duration, holiday, sequencing, and special populations: Current evidence suggests that increasing the duration of bisphosphonate therapy to longer than 3 to 5 years reduces risk for new vertebral fractures but not risk for other fractures; however, there is increased risk for long-term harms, therefore, clinicians should consider stopping bisphosphonate treatment after 5 years unless the patient has a strong indication for treatment continuation. The decision for a temporary bisphosphonate treatment discontinuation (holiday) and its duration should be individualized and should be based on baseline risk for fractures, type of medication and its half-life in bone, benefits, and harms. Females initially treated with an anabolic agent should be offered an antiresorptive agent after discontinuation to preserve gains and because of serious risk for rebound and multiple vertebral fractures. Older adults (for example, those aged > 65 years) with osteoporosis may be at increased risk for falls and other adverse events due to polypharmacy or drug interactions, and individualized treatment selection should address contraindications and cautions for drugs indicated to treat osteoporosis based on comorbidities and concomitant medications. There is variable risk for low bone mass in transgender persons based on age at gonadectomy, therapy with sex hormones, distribution of comorbidities, and behavioral risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures.

Osteoporosis is characterized by increased bone turnover and reduced bone mass, leading to skeletal fragility and heightened fracture risk. It is a growing public health concern with expectations for a continued significant rise of fractures by 50% in 2030. Diagnosis is typically based on body mineral density with a T-score of -2.5 or lower indicating osteoporosis. Treatment duration varies, and is determined by careful monitoring of fracture risk and timing for potential drug holidays. Emerging therapies and ongoing research continue to evolve the landscape of osteoporosis management, aiming to reduce fracture risk and improve patient outcomes.

### Teriparatide did not increase adult osteosarcoma incidence in a 15-year US postmarketing surveillance study [^111QiTnY]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Validation

For the validation component of the study, 1009 patients (or their proxies) who completed the interview and signed and returned a medical release form were considered "selection eligible" for the medical record abstraction component of the study. A random sample of 482 cases was selected; in addition, eight of the 13 cases for which possible teriparatide use was reported during the interview (12 cases for patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma and one case for patients diagnosed with one of the five additional ICD‐O‐3 codes) were included in the validation sample (five were excluded for not having returned the release for medical record abstraction). Of these 490 selected cases, medical records were abstracted for 351 patients. For 139 patients, records could not be obtained or contained insufficient information.

Agreement was high between answers provided during the telephone interview and data abstracted from the patient's medical records: 96% or higher agreement for osteoporosis medication use (except for alendronate [Fosamax; Merck and Co. Kenilworth, NJ, USA], which was 92%), 85% agreement for history of osteoporosis, 89% or higher agreement for history of radiation or chemotherapy treatment or history of prior cancer, and 97% agreement for history of Paget's disease.

Generalizability

Among patients with osteosarcoma, there were no notable differences in the distributions for age at diagnosis (age categories, mean age, and range), sex, or ethnicity between all patients identified by participating registries and patients interviewed (see Table 2). White individuals were slightly overrepresented among the patients interviewed (84%) compared with all patients identified (75%). As anticipated, a higher proportion of interviews were completed for patients reported by the registries to be alive at the time of diagnosis (78%) than for the total number of eligible patients identified by the registries and reported as alive (57%). Conversely, the proportion of interviews completed by proxies for patients reported by the registries to be deceased (21%) was lower than the total number of eligible patients identified by the registries and reported to be deceased (42%). The distribution of ICD‐O‐3 morphology codes and primary tumor sites was similar between identified and interviewed patients.

Atypical femoral fracture (AFF) risk with bisphosphonates — incidence and duration trends is characterized by very low absolute rates but increases with longer exposure; studies report "about 3 AFFs per 1000 hip fractures", with population rates "about 5 per 100,000 person-years" versus hip fracture incidences of "300 to 400 per 100,000 person-years". Duration-related risk rose from "~3 per 100,000 person-years" after 2 years to "~20 per 100,000 person-years" at 5 years and "~50 per 100,000 with > 8 years of use". A benefit–risk analysis estimated that treating 1000 osteoporotic women for 3 years would "prevent 100 fractures, including 11 hip fractures, while causing about 0.1 AFF". Given rising risk beyond 5 years, the text states "the consistent increase shown for treatment beyond 5 years suggests consideration of AFF risk in treating patients for > 5 years", and notes the ASBMR proposal of a drug holiday "from oral bisphosphonates after 5 years and from IV bisphosphonates after 3 years" in low-to-moderate risk patients.

However, given her history of two vertebral fractures, Ms BPS would be considered by the ASBMR task force to be at higher risk for future fractures. Moreover, the ASBMR guidance suggests that all patients aged > 70 to 75 years should be considered at high risk, independently from T score improvement. Thus, continuing bisphosphonate or switching to an alternate bone therapy could be justified despite her very prolonged duration of bisphosphonates. If she is agreeable to transitioning to a nonbisphosphonate therapy, options would include osteoanabolic agents such as teriparatide, abaloparatide, or romosozumab. Romosozumab, in particular, demonstrated significantly greater increases in bone mass and bone strength, as assessed by finite element analysis, compared to teriparatide. We would not generally favor a selective estrogen receptor modulator in this circumstance after alendronate. If a PTH analog is chosen, she should know that there may be a period of slight and temporary bone loss at cortical sites such as the hip. Of note, an antiresorptive agent would again be recommended at the end of any anabolic treatment. It is important to note that osteoanabolic agents may be less effective after 15 years of bisphosphonate therapy compared to a treatment‐naïve patient. Long‐term bisphosphonate use significantly suppresses bone turnover and leads to reduced remodeling surfaces, which are necessary for an optimal anabolic response.

Both patients require comprehensive fracture risk assessments incorporating clinical factors, BMD results, and using validated fracture risk calculators or algorithms. This assessment should consider the limitations of these expert panel generated recommendations for drug holidays and should be heavily guided by shared decision‐making. It is critical to discuss with these sisters the known benefits of fracture prevention against the risks of longer‐term risks of therapy with alendronate and the rebound risk when discontinuing denosumab. The sisters' preferences are paramount, especially when concerns about adverse effects influence their willingness to continue treatment and when the evidence available is not of the highest level.

### Long-term use of bisphosphonates in osteoporosis [^112syzA1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Bisphosphonates have been widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Uncommon side effects have emerged in postapproval use. Because bisphosphonates accumulate in bone and are released for months or years after treatment is stopped, it is reasonable to consider the clinical question of how long to treat.

Objective

In this personal perspective, we review the pharmacology and mechanism of action of bisphosphonates and the clinical studies that support their efficacy. We then review the literature for longer-term studies and reports of possible side effects that were not seen in clinical trials.

Results

Bisphosphonates have demonstrated antifracture efficacy in randomized, placebo-controlled trials of 3 and 4 yr duration and have been widely used since the initial release of alendronate in 1995. For zoledronic acid and risedronate, an early effect (fractures reduced within 6–12 months of starting therapy) has been shown. A sustained effect for risedronate has been shown through 5 yr and suggested through 7 yr. Ten-year data with alendronate and 8 yr data with risedronate indicated good tolerability and safety; it is unlikely that longer-term studies will be done. Side effects that emerged in clinical trials include esophageal irritation with oral administration and acute phase response with iv treatment or high-dose oral therapy. Uncommon side effects that have been noted with wide clinical use include osteonecrosis of the jaw, musculoskeletal complaints, and atypical fractures. The numbers of events are small, and a clear cause-and-effect relationship between these events and bisphosphonate treatment has not been established. Because bisphosphonates accumulate in bone, they create a reservoir leading to continued release from bone for months or years after treatment is stopped. Studies with risedronate and alendronate suggest that if treatment is stopped after 3–5 yr, there is persisting antifracture efficacy, at least for 1–2 yr.

Conclusions

Bisphosphonates are popular and effective for treatment of osteoporosis. Because they accumulate in bone and provide some residual antifracture reduction when treatment is stopped, we recommend a drug holiday after 5–10 yr of bisphosphonate treatment. The duration of treatment and length of the holiday are based on fracture risk and pharmacokinetics of the bisphosphonate used. Patients at mild risk might stop treatment after 5 yr and remain off as long as bone mineral density is stable and no fractures occur. Higher risk patients should be treated for 10 yr, have a holiday of no more than a year or two, and perhaps be on a nonbisphosphonate treatment during that time.

### Treat-to-target for osteoporosis: is now the time? [^111VUTnZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Current clinical practice guidelines identify patients at high risk for fracture who are likely to benefit from pharmacological therapy and suggest ways to monitor for effectiveness of therapy. However, there is no clear guidance on when fracture risk has been reduced to an acceptably low level. As a consequence, some patients at low risk for fracture may be treated for longer than necessary, whereas others at high risk for fracture may have treatment stopped when they might benefit from continuation of the same treatment or a change to a more potent therapeutic agent. The objective of this statement is to describe the potential clinical utility of developing a "treat-to-target" strategy for the management of patients with osteoporosis.

Participants

We recommend that a task force of clinicians, clinical investigators, and other stakeholders in the care of osteoporosis explore the options, review the evidence, and identify additional areas for investigation to establish osteoporosis treatment targets.

Evidence

Data from large, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled registration trials for currently available osteoporosis therapies should be analyzed for commonalities of correlations between easily measured endpoints and fracture risk.

Consensus Process

Osteoporosis experts, professional organizations, and patient care advocates should be involved in the process of developing consensus on easily measurable osteoporosis treatment targets that are supported by the best available evidence and likely to be accepted by clinicians and patients in the care of osteoporosis.

Conclusions

A treat-to-target strategy for osteoporosis offers the potential of improving osteoporosis care by reducing the burden of osteoporotic fractures and limiting adverse effects of therapy.

Bisphosphonate duration and holiday — postmenopausal osteoporosis — should follow risk reassessment: in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are taking bisphosphonates, we recommend that fracture risk be reassessed after 3 to 5 years; women who remain at high risk should continue therapy, whereas those at low-to-moderate risk should be considered for a "bisphosphonate holiday". A bisphosphonate holiday is operationally defined as a temporary discontinuation of bisphosphonate for up to 5 years, which may be longer depending on BMD and clinical circumstances; evidence is stronger for retention of benefits during a holiday for alendronate and zoledronic acid where randomized extension trials exist. For annual IV zoledronic acid (5 mg), a shorter reassessment period of 3 years is more appropriate based on RCTs showing residual effects after 3 years of annual use, and once a bisphosphonate holiday is initiated, reassess fracture risk at 2- to 4-year intervals.

Figure 1:

Fracture Intervention Trial: Four-Year Study (patients with low bone mass but without a baseline radiographic vertebral fracture)

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4432-patient study (FOSAMAX, n = 2214; placebo, n = 2218) further investigated the reduction in fracture incidence due to FOSAMAX. The intent of the study was to recruit women with osteoporosis, defined as a baseline femoral neck BMD at least two standard deviations below the mean for young adult women. However, due to subsequent revisions to the normative values for femoral neck BMD, 31% of patients were found not to meet this entry criterion and thus this study included both osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic women. The results are shown in Table 7 below for the patients with osteoporosis.

Fracture Results Across Studies

In the Three-Year Study of FIT, FOSAMAX reduced the percentage of women experiencing at least one new radiographic vertebral fracture from 15.0% to 7.9% (47% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001); in the Four-Year Study of FIT, the percentage was reduced from 3.8% to 2.1% (44% relative risk reduction, p = 0.001); and in the combined U.S./Multinational studies, from 6.2% to 3.2% (48% relative risk reduction, p = 0.034).

### Long-term treatment strategies for postmenopausal osteoporosis [^117T3XHx]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Osteoporosis guidelines do not usually provide specific recommendations regarding what medication is most appropriate for individual patients. Generic oral bisphosphonates are often considered first-line treatment for osteoporosis, but treatment duration is limited, based on potential long-term safety concerns, and there is no consensus about what to do after 5 years. There are no recommendations concerning long-term management of osteoporosis over 30 or more years of postmenopausal life.

Recent Findings

This review attempts to specify medication choices and provide the best clinical management strategies for women at different stages of life and with different underlying disease severity. Because there is no evidence that considers the entire postmenopausal lifespan, much of the discussion here will be based on expert opinion. The review considers a role for estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators, oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, denosumab and the anabolic agents, teriparatide and abaloparatide.

Summary

Optimal sequential monotherapy, over an average of 30 postmenopausal years, should be able to minimize exposure to pharmacology while maximizing benefits on bone strength and minimizing imminent and long-term risk of fracture.

2.6	Important Administration Instructions

Instruct patients to do the following:

Take FOSAMAX at least one-half hour before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day with plain water only [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. Other beverages (including mineral water), food, and some medications are likely to reduce the absorption of FOSAMAX [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Waiting less than 30 minutes, or taking FOSAMAX with food, beverages (other than plain water) or other medications will lessen the effect of FOSAMAX by decreasing its absorption into the body.
Take FOSAMAX upon arising for the day. To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, a FOSAMAX tablet should be swallowed with a full glass of water (6–8 ounces). To facilitate gastric emptying FOSAMAX oral solution should be followed by at least 2 ounces (a quarter of a cup) of water. Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes and until after their first food of the day. FOSAMAX should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day. Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse experiences [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)].

2.7	Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if dietary intake is inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home-bound, or chronically ill) may need vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.

Patients treated with glucocorticoids should receive adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D.

2.8	Administration Instructions for Missed Doses

If a once-weekly dose of FOSAMAX is missed, instruct patients to take one dose on the morning after they remember. They should not take two doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.

What is the rationale for choosing the minimum target of > −2.5?

In some countries, a T-score < −2.5 represents an indication for pharmacologic treatment regardless of other risk factors. However, since fracture risk is dependent on other factors, notably age and prevalent fracture, a T-score > −2.5 should be considered the minimal target. For countries with different or no T-score intervention thresholds, T-score targets should be adjusted accordingly.

Patients with other important risk factors might warrant higher T-score targets. This is demonstrated very clearly in analyses from the denosumab FREEDOM trial (Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Mo) and its extension. The relationship between attained T-score on denosumab treatment and subsequent fracture risk is maintained in individuals with and without prior fracture, but the risk at all BMD levels is much higher in those with a fracture history (Figure 3). These data support setting higher T-score targets in patients with a history of fracture. Higher T-score targets might also be suggested for patients with advanced age, recent falls history, and poor physical function. In these patients, T-score targets of −2.0 or even −1.5 might be appropriate. In the ARCH trial, where all patients had fractures at entry, progressive lowering of subsequent fracture risk was observed as 1 yr TH T-scores approached −1.5.

Figure 3
Relationship between T-score attained on denosumab and subsequent risk of nonvertebral fracture in full population (A), by age < 75 vs. > 75 yr (B), and by prior history of fracture (C).

A higher T-score target might also be considered in patients for whom a pause in medication is being considered. Anyone who stops osteoporosis medication will lose bone eventually, though the rate of loss is dependent on what medication is being discontinued. Bone loss rates after stopping bisphosphonates are much slower than bone loss rates after stopping all other agents. Therefore, medication pauses should only be considered in patients whose last treatment is a bisphosphonate. Aiming for a higher T-score in those patients being considered for a medication pause might permit maintenance of T-score above −2.5 even after the expected bone loss occurs (see section below on BMD maintenance for further discussion).

### The experience of feeling old after a fragility fracture [^113itaXN]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Participants also reported being told by health care providers that, as they got older, their bones would deteriorate and they would develop osteoporosis. For example, one participant said that a health care provider had told her "after a certain age, it [osteopenia] does set in" (AD-5) and another said she was told by her family physician, "because of my age group, I might be a candidate for osteoporosis" (AD-10).

Messages from family and friends also reinforced participants' feelings of becoming old. This was inherent in the way family members and friends were perceived to view them, in the advice that they received, or the way they were treated by family and friends. Participants told us that family members told them, "if you fall, you know that you might not come out of hospital" (COP-21) or that "I don't think you should be doing that" (FR-14). One man talked about his wife fussing over him: "she [wife] is the one who complains because she has to always be aware that I can't do something" (FR-20). Another woman told us, "my husband will say, don't run, because he doesn't want me to break an ankle or something" (AD-23). Another participant joked about her children talking about her behind her back, "and you still think she's young and she isn't. She's 70" (AD-5). Another woman said her daughter kept an eye out for her because she wanted "to keep me around much longer" (I-24).

A few participants talked about their friends reinforcing the message of being old. For example, one told us about her Saturday morning coffee dates with friends, "half of them take calcium. I have heard the Fosamax stories. That's what women our age talk about. Very boring" (I-18).

Two participants appeared to not fit with our general findings that experiences after a fracture made them feel old. One participant said, "I don't think I'm elderly" (COM-14) and another said, "I do feel that your age shouldn't matter. You should have good bone health no matter how old you are" (I-1).

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^11472FPr]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

BTMs, such as C‐terminal telopeptide (CTX), also can be used in monitoring the effectiveness of osteoporosis therapy and guiding decisions about drug holidays or treatment reinitiation. CTX reflects the rate of bone resorption, and its levels typically decrease with effective antiresorptive treatment, such as bisphosphonates. A significant drop in CTX from pretreatment levels, defined as more than the least significant change of 30%, suggests that an antiresorptive therapy is effective in suppressing bone turnover. CTX levels also can be used to monitor drug holidays. A common approach involves comparing baseline (predrug holiday) levels with those during the drug holiday. Two potential thresholds for interpretation include a return to baseline levels (pretreatment) or an increase of more than 30% from the end‐of‐treatment levels. Our approach to these two thresholds can be summarized as follows: (1) a return to pretreatment baseline levels or higher (ie, before any bone active drug has been started), indicating complete loss of antiresorptive effect or (2) an increase of more than 30% (above the least significant change of most BTMs) from end‐of‐treatment levels, suggesting excessive bone loss. Measuring BTMs at 6 to 12 months after stopping bisphosphonates might allow clinicians to determine whether therapy should be restarted earlier than BMD alone would suggest, particularly in high‐risk patients. Other BTMs, including urinary N‐telopeptide, can be used in similar ways, albeit urinary turnover markers are more subject to diurnal variations.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^114jtBQy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Optimal duration of treatment and drug holidays — "treatment of 3 to 5 years" with osteoporosis therapies is "highly beneficial with only minimal risk", but long-term decisions depend on medication type. For bisphosphonates, evidence "includes two randomized trials (one of alendronate and one of zoledronic acid)" and data "beyond 5 years", and "These studies support a residual effect of bisphosphonates after stopping, which support bisphosphonate holidays". In contrast, "for all other therapies… after discontinuation, benefits are quickly lost", so "these therapies must be continued indefinitely or followed with bisphosphonates or another type of therapy to retain the gains achieved".

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

FOSAMAX PLUS D is a combination of a bisphosphonate and vitamin D indicated for:

Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (1.1)
Treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis (1.2)

Limitations of use:

FOSAMAX PLUS D alone should not be used to treat vitamin D deficiency. (1.3)
Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. (1.3)

1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

FOSAMAX®PLUS D is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, FOSAMAX PLUS D increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .]

1.2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis

FOSAMAX PLUS D is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Important Limitations of Use

FOSAMAX PLUS D alone should not be used to treat vitamin D deficiency.

The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of FOSAMAX PLUS D for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

### Bisphosphonates: are they standard of care for the treatment of breast cancer? [^111heuWr]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

It is particularly important that we wait for definitive results from the large trials or from individual patient meta-analysis before adopting the routine use of bisphosphonates in the adjuvant or the metastatic setting without bone involvement. Currently, we are just beginning to understand the magnitude of a relatively newly reported complication of bisphosphonates, that of jaw osteonecrosis. While this has been reported much more commonly in relation to long-term administration of intravenous bisphosphonates occasional reports have occurred with oral drugs such as clodronate, alendronate (Fosamax) and risedronate (Actonel). It will be important to have results from a large randomized trial such as B-34, which will tell us not only the efficacy of clodronate in the adjuvant setting but also the relative risk of side effects in comparison to a placebo control arm.

In the meantime, the use of bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting remains appropriate only when given as suggested in guidelines for osteoporosis, or in the setting of clinical trials. Their use to reduce skeletal or non-skeletal-related metastases or to improve overall survival is not supported by currently available data.

### EMA drug information for vildagliptin [^116zkPJn]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of fosfomycin IV (also known as Contepo):
- Antimicrobial resistance: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of fosfomycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including fosfomycin, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- Decreased blood neutrophil count: maintain a high level of suspicion, as neutropenia, including agranulocytosis, has been reported in patients receiving IV fosfomycin.
- Electrolyte abnormalities: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the intravenous fosfomycin formulation contains 1,980 mg of sodium per vial. This may lead to alterations in serum electrolytes, such as increased sodium and decreased potassium, calcium, and phosphorus levels, and may potentiate cardiac effects, including QT prolongation.
- Increased serum transaminases: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fosfomycin has been shown to increase serum transaminase levels. Monitor liver enzymes throughout treatment.
- Prolonged QT interval: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fosfomycin has been shown to prolong the QT interval in some patients and may lead to torsade de pointes-type VT, with the risk increasing as the degree of QT prolongation increases. Avoid fosfomycin in patients with known QT prolongation or ventricular arrhythmias, including a history of torsade de pointes. Monitor serum electrolytes throughout treatment.

### Bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis [^112Zb89u]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis to reduce fracture risk. Because of their long retention time in bone and uncommon side effects, questions have been raised about the optimal duration of therapy. Potential side effects appear to be rare and may not be causally related. Although there is no strong science to guide "drug holidays", there appears to be some lingering antifracture benefit when treatment is stopped, so some time off treatment should be offered to most patients on long-term bisphosphonate therapy. For most patients with osteoporosis, the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.

Bisphosphonates are the most commonly used agents in the management of metabolic bones diseases. Despite their established therapeutic value, a number of points of uncertainty remain, particularly in connection with their optimal long-term use. It is likely that definitive clinical trial data will not become available to resolve these questions, so careful clinical observation and caution are needed in patients who require treatment over periods of more than 10 years.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Calcium supplements/antacids or oral medications containing multivalent cations interfere with absorption of alendronate. (2.3, 7.1)
Use caution when co-prescribing aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation. (7.2, 7.3)
Some drugs may impair the absorption or increase the catabolism of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Additional vitamin D supplementation should be considered. (7.4, 7.5, 12.3)

7.1 Calcium Supplements/Antacids

Co-administration of FOSAMAX PLUS D and calcium, antacids, or oral medications containing multivalent cations will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, instruct patients to wait at least one-half hour after taking FOSAMAX PLUS D before taking any other oral medications.

7.2 Aspirin

In clinical studies, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events was increased in patients receiving concomitant therapy with daily doses of FOSAMAX greater than 10 mg and aspirin-containing products.

7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

FOSAMAX PLUS D may be administered to patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In a 3-year, controlled, clinical study (n = 2027) during which a majority of patients received concomitant NSAIDs, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events was similar in patients taking FOSAMAX 5 or 10 mg/day compared to those taking placebo. However, since NSAID use is associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be used during concomitant use with FOSAMAX PLUS D.

7.4 Drugs that May Impair the Absorption of Cholecalciferol

Olestra, mineral oils, orlistat, and bile acid sequestrants (e.g., cholestyramine, colestipol) may impair the absorption of vitamin D. Additional vitamin D supplementation should be considered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.5 Drugs that May Increase the Catabolism of Cholecalciferol

Anticonvulsants, cimetidine, and thiazides may increase the catabolism of vitamin D. Additional vitamin D supplementation should be considered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Which drug next? Sequential therapy for osteoporosis [^117KvzpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The proliferation of drugs with unique modes of action for treating osteoporosis has been most welcome. Fear of complications, even though rare, associated with long-term bisphosphonates (BPs) changed prescribing patterns. The BPs are stored in bone for years. Drugs not stored in bone; for example, abaloparatide, teriparatide, denosumab, and romosozumab have expanded our armamentarium for treating osteoporosis but have brought new challenges. Bone accrued during treatment with the last 3 drugs, and perhaps abaloparatide, is lost rapidly after their withdrawal due to rebound increase in bone resorption. Treatment with these drugs must be followed by administration of an antiresorptive agent. The article by Kendler et al. (1) in this issue of JCEM reports alendronate preserves bone accrued during administration of denosumab.

Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Daily Dosing

The safety of FOSAMAX 5 mg/day in postmenopausal women 40–60 years of age has been evaluated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involving over 1,400 patients randomized to receive FOSAMAX for either two or three years. In these studies the overall safety profiles of FOSAMAX 5 mg/day and placebo were similar. Discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse event occurred in 7.5% of 642 patients treated with FOSAMAX 5 mg/day and 5.7% of 648 patients treated with placebo.

Weekly Dosing

The safety of FOSAMAX 35 mg once weekly compared to FOSAMAX 5 mg daily was evaluated in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of 723 patients. The overall safety and tolerability profiles of once weekly FOSAMAX 35 mg and FOSAMAX 5 mg daily were similar.

The adverse reactions from these studies considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with either once weekly FOSAMAX 35 mg, FOSAMAX 5 mg/day or placebo are presented in Table 3.

Concomitant Use with Estrogen/Hormone Replacement Therapy

In two studies (of one and two years' duration) of postmenopausal osteoporotic women (total: n = 853), the safety and tolerability profile of combined treatment with FOSAMAX 10 mg once daily and estrogen ± progestin (n = 354) was consistent with those of the individual treatments.

Osteoporosis in Men

In two placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies in men (a two-year study of FOSAMAX 10 mg/day and a one-year study of once weekly FOSAMAX 70 mg) the rates of discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse event were 2.7% for FOSAMAX 10 mg/day vs. 10.5% for placebo, and 6.4% for once weekly FOSAMAX 70 mg vs. 8.6% for placebo. The adverse reactions considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with either FOSAMAX or placebo are presented in Table 4.

### A population-based registry study of extended bisphosphonate use: minimal shift after landmark publications about shorter treatment duration [^112UhZUL]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Optimal duration of bisphosphonate therapy was unknown until the FLEX study was published in 2006 showing a 5-year course to be adequate for most women. In 2008, a link between long-term bisphosphonate and atypical femoral fractures was reported and confirmed in later studies. We hypothesized these landmark observations should have led to a decrease in use of bisphosphonates for > 5 or 10years, from 2010 onward. The Manitoba Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Registry with linkage to provincial pharmacy data was used to determine the percentage of long- and very long-term bisphosphonate users from therapy start. The cohort comprised women aged > 50years with BMD between 1995 and 2018 with oral bisphosphonate first prescribed for > 90days with adherence > 75% in the first year. For each calendar year of continued therapy, the percentage of patients and medication possession rate was tabulated. The percentage of users beyond 5years was compared among patients who started therapy in 1998–2004 (those taking 5years of therapy still finish before 2010) versus 2005–2012 (all new therapy starts overlap 2010 in those taking ≥ 5years of treatment). The cohort included 2991 women with mean follow-up 8.8 (1.3) years, 64.9% of whom took continuous oral bisphosphonate for > 5years and 41.9% for > 10years. In the earlier versus later era, there were 74.4% versus 70.2% who completed 5years. With respect to longer treatment, there were 68.0% and 60.5% of patients treated for 6 or more years (p < 0.0001) and 46.6% versus 33.5% treated for > 10years (p = 0.08). Medication possession rate was > 79% in every year of therapy. Landmark studies leading to more limited bisphosphonate courses may have slightly reduced longer-term treatment, but up to one-third of adherent patients in the modern era still receive continuous bisphosphonate therapy for > 10years. © 2023 The Authors.

Rash and erythema have occurred.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: One patient treated with FOSAMAX (10 mg/day), who had a history of peptic ulcer disease and gastrectomy and who was taking concomitant aspirin, developed an anastomotic ulcer with mild hemorrhage, which was considered drug related. Aspirin and FOSAMAX were discontinued and the patient recovered. In the Study 1 and Study 2 populations, 49–54% had a history of gastrointestinal disorders at baseline and 54–89% used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin at some time during the studies. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]

Laboratory Test Findings: In double-blind, multicenter, controlled studies, asymptomatic, mild, and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of patients taking FOSAMAX versus approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo. However, the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to less than 8.0 mg/dL (2.0 mM) and serum phosphate to less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL (0.65 mM) were similar in both treatment groups.

Weekly Dosing

The safety of FOSAMAX 70 mg once weekly for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing FOSAMAX 70 mg once weekly and FOSAMAX 10 mg daily. The overall safety and tolerability profiles of once weekly FOSAMAX 70 mg and FOSAMAX 10 mg daily were similar. The adverse reactions considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 1% of patients in either treatment group are presented in Table 2.

### Comparison of weekly treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis with alendronate versus risedronate over two years [^112CQyCr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

A 1-yr extension of the Fosamax Actonel Comparison Trial was completed to compare changes in bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover, and upper gastrointestinal tolerability over 2 yr of treatment.

Design

This was a randomized, double-blind extension conducted at 72 U.S. sites.

Patients and Methods

Of the 1053 women who completed yr 1, 833 postmenopausal women with low BMD entered the extension, continuing their same treatment allocation [once-weekly (OW) alendronate 70 mg or OW risedronate 35 mg]. Changes in BMD at the hip trochanter, total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine and in markers of bone turnover were compared at 24 months. Tolerability was assessed by adverse experience reporting.

Results

Alendronate produced greater increases from baseline in BMD at 24 months than did risedronate at the trochanter (alendronate, 4.6%; risedronate, 2.5%, P < 0.001) as well as at all other BMD sites. Significantly more alendronate than risedronate patients had measured BMD increases of 0% or more and 3% or more at all BMD sites (P < 0.001), and fewer alendronate patients had measured decreases of 3% or more at all BMD sites. Significantly greater reductions in all biochemical markers of bone turnover occurred with alendronate, compared with risedronate. No differences were seen in occurrence or discontinuations due to upper gastrointestinal adverse experiences.

Conclusions

Patients receiving 70 mg OW alendronate had greater gains in BMD, were more likely to maintain or gain BMD, and had greater reductions in bone turnover markers than patients receiving 35 mg OW risedronate after 24 months, with no differences in upper gastrointestinal tolerability.

14.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

FOSAMAX Daily

The efficacy of FOSAMAX 10 mg daily was assessed in four clinical trials. Study 1, a three-year, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, US clinical study enrolled 478 patients with a BMD T-score at or below minus 2.5 with or without a prior vertebral fracture; Study 2, a three-year, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Multinational clinical study enrolled 516 patients with a BMD T-score at or below minus 2.5 with or without a prior vertebral fracture; Study 3, the Three-Year Study of the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT), a study which enrolled 2027 postmenopausal patients with at least one baseline vertebral fracture; and Study 4, the Four-Year Study of FIT, a study which enrolled 4432 postmenopausal patients with low bone mass but without a baseline vertebral fracture.

Effect on Fracture Incidence

To assess the effects of FOSAMAX on the incidence of vertebral fractures (detected by digitized radiography; approximately one third of these were clinically symptomatic), the U.S. and Multinational studies were combined in an analysis that compared placebo to the pooled dosage groups of FOSAMAX (5 or 10 mg for three years or 20 mg for two years followed by 5 mg for one year). There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients treated with FOSAMAX experiencing one or more new vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo (3.2% vs. 6.2%; a 48% relative risk reduction). A reduction in the total number of new vertebral fractures (4.2 vs. 11.3 per 100 patients) was also observed. In the pooled analysis, patients who received FOSAMAX had a loss in stature that was statistically significantly less than was observed in those who received placebo (-3.0 mm vs. -4.6 mm).

### Use of drug holidays in women taking bisphosphonates [^114ExQsy]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are the cornerstone of treatment for osteoporosis. These agents are generally safe and well-tolerated, but concerns have emerged about adverse effects related to long-term use, namely osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures. For most patients at moderate or high risk of fracture, the benefits of treatment far outweigh these serious but rare risks. Bisphosphonates accumulate in bone with some persistent protective effect after therapy is stopped, making it is reasonable to consider a "drug holiday". The duration of therapy and the length of the holiday should be based on clinical judgment.

### Duration of treatment in postmenopausal osteoporosis: how long to treat and what are the consequences of cessation of treatment? [^112592Yt]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Although a variety of medications are effective for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, there is concern that long-term use may incur side effects. Consequently, some have proposed discontinuing or temporarily suspending treatment after a defined period of time. As the benefits of fracture risk reduction may recede during this "drug holiday", the clinician may be faced with deciding when to resume therapy (and with which agent) while avoiding the possible cumulative risk of side effects. This article summarizes data regarding length of treatment and the effects of cessation of treatment on bone density, bone turnover markers, and fracture risk.

Bisphosphonate duration and drug holiday — effects on remodeling and fracture protection wane slowly over 1–5 y when stopped; a temporary "bisphosphonate holiday" can be considered after 3 to 5 years in patients at low or moderate fracture risk who no longer meet criteria for therapy, as fracture risk increases again after 2 years off oral bisphosphonate therapy. Osteoporosis treatment should be restarted with a significant decline in BMD, an intervening fracture, or other factors altering clinical risk; for those remaining at high risk after 3 to 5 years, continuing the bisphosphonate or switching to denosumab or an osteoanabolic agent is recommended. Therapy considerations note bisphosphonates are appropriate to reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal osteoporosis, use with caution in significant renal impairment, and consider a bisphosphonate holiday for women at low or moderate fracture risk.

### Alendronate for fracture prevention in postmenopause [^116Cnbh6]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and bone deterioration leading to increased fracture risk. Alendronate (Fosamax) belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs, which act to inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of alendronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women.

Search Strategy

The authors searched Central, Medline, and EMBASE for relevant randomized controlled trials published from 1966 to 2007.

Data Collection and Analysis

The authors undertook study selection and data abstraction in duplicate. The authors performed meta-analysis of fracture outcomes using relative risks, and a relative change greater than 15 percent was considered clinically important. The authors assessed study quality through reporting of allocation concealment, blinding, and withdrawals.

Main Results

Eleven trials representing 12,068 women were included in the review. Relative and absolute risk reductions for the 10-mg dose were as follows. For vertebral fractures, a 45 percent relative risk reduction was found (relative risk [RR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 0.67). This was significant for primary prevention, with a 45 percent relative risk reduction (RR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.80) and 2 percent absolute risk reduction; and for secondary prevention, with 45 percent relative risk reduction (RR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.69) and 6 percent absolute risk reduction. For nonvertebral fractures, a 16 percent relative risk reduction was found (RR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.94). This was significant for secondary prevention, with a 23 percent relative risk reduction (RR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.92) and a 2 percent absolute risk reduction, but not for primary prevention (RR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.04). There was a 40 percent relative risk reduction in hip fractures (RR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.92), but only secondary prevention was significant, with a 53 percent relative risk reduction (RR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.85) and a 1 percent absolute risk reduction. The only significance found for wrist fractures was in secondary prevention, with a 50 percent relative risk reduction (RR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.73) and a 2 percent absolute risk reduction. For adverse events, the authors found no statistically significant difference in any included study. However, observational data raise concerns about potential risk for upper gastrointestinal injury and, less commonly, osteonecrosis of the jaw.

Authors' Conclusions

At 10 mg of alendronate per day, clinically important and statistically significant reductions in vertebral, nonvertebral, hip, and wrist fractures were observed for secondary prevention. The authors found no statistically significant results for primary prevention, with the exception of vertebral fractures, for which the reduction was clinically important.

1	INDICATIONS AND USAGE

FOSAMAX is a bisphosphonate indicated for:

Treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (1.1, 1.2)
Treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis (1.3)
Treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (1.4)
Treatment of Paget's disease of bone (1.5)

Limitations of use:

Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. (1.6)

1.1	Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

FOSAMAX®is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, FOSAMAX increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .]

1.2	Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

FOSAMAX is indicated for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3	Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis

FOSAMAX is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

1.4	Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

FOSAMAX is indicated for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women receiving glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5 mg or greater of prednisone and who have low bone mineral density [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

1.5	Treatment of Paget's Disease of Bone

FOSAMAX is indicated for the treatment of Paget's disease of bone in men and women. Treatment is indicated in patients with Paget's disease of bone who have alkaline phosphatase at least two times the upper limit of normal, or those who are symptomatic, or those at risk for future complications from their disease. [See Clinical Studies (14.5) .]

1.6	Important Limitations of Use

The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of FOSAMAX for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

Fracture Intervention Trial: Three-Year Study (patients with at least one baseline radiographic vertebral fracture)

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2027-patient study (FOSAMAX, n = 1022; placebo, n = 1005) demonstrated that treatment with FOSAMAX resulted in statistically significant reductions in fracture incidence at three years as shown in Table 6.

Furthermore, in this population of patients with baseline vertebral fracture, treatment with FOSAMAX significantly reduced the incidence of hospitalizations (25.0% vs. 30.7%).

In the Three-Year Study of FIT, fractures of the hip occurred in 22 (2.2%) of 1005 patients on placebo and 11 (1.1%) of 1022 patients on FOSAMAX, p = 0.047. Figure 1 displays the cumulative incidence of hip fractures in this study.

Figure 1:

Fracture Intervention Trial: Four-Year Study (patients with low bone mass but without a baseline radiographic vertebral fracture)

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4432-patient study (FOSAMAX, n = 2214; placebo, n = 2218) further investigated the reduction in fracture incidence due to FOSAMAX. The intent of the study was to recruit women with osteoporosis, defined as a baseline femoral neck BMD at least two standard deviations below the mean for young adult women. However, due to subsequent revisions to the normative values for femoral neck BMD, 31% of patients were found not to meet this entry criterion and thus this study included both osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic women. The results are shown in Table 7 for the patients with osteoporosis.

### Alendronate sodium (Fosamax) [^1115runP]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Bone histology was normal in the 49 patients biopsied at the end of one year who received FOSAMAX at doses of up to 10 mg/day.

Of the original 560 patients in these studies, 208 patients who remained on at least 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent continued into a one-year double-blind extension. After two years of treatment, spine BMD increased by 3.7% and 5.0% relative to placebo with FOSAMAX 5 and 10 mg/day, respectively. Significant increases in BMD (relative to placebo) were also observed at the femoral neck, trochanter, and total body.

After one year, 2.3% of patients treated with FOSAMAX 5 or 10 mg/day (pooled) vs. 3.7% of those treated with placebo experienced a new vertebral fracture (not significant). However, in the population studied for two years, treatment with FOSAMAX (pooled dosage groups: 5 or 10 mg for two years or 2.5 mg for one year followed by 10 mg for one year) significantly reduced the incidence of patients with a new vertebral fracture (FOSAMAX 0.7% vs. placebo 6.8%).

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^116q9bme]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

If denosumab must be discontinued for clinical reasons, the guidance for most indicates a course of bisphosphonate or SERM for consolidation. Bisphosphonates are the preferred option based on available evidence. Evidence for use of SERMs is lacking (the evidence presented by Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al.and Ebina et al.argues against SERM as an alternative), although further randomized controlled studies including SERMs are ongoing. The studies discussed in this review indicate that bisphosphonate treatment after denosumab is at least partially effective for maintaining BMD, in particular spinal BMD. Furthermore bisphosphonates appear to protect against the development of multiple VFs. There remain limitations in the evidence governing the optimum timing, route and duration of sequential bisphosphonate in addition to the potential role of bone turnover markers and how best to monitor individual patient response. For now, the strongest evidence, with which the current authors concur, is from Sølling et al.who recommend an infusion of zoledronate at 6 months after cessation of denosumab, followed by serial monitoring of bone turnover markers and advising a second infusion even within the next 6 months if bone resorption marker increases. The current authors argue that osteoporosis is a chronic condition requiring chronic treatment and that denosumab represents a viable safe and effective treatment indefinitely for most patients.

### Treatment of osteoporosis: all the questions we still cannot answer [^111ELoiJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Many questions remain with regard to the treatment of osteoporosis. The increase in bone mineral density due to bisphosphonates accounts for only a quarter of their antifracture action. The studies of bone mineral density equivalences that have validated certain modes of administration are therefore not relevant. No comparative study on the same patient cohort has been carried out, and the inclusion criteria of the pilot studies on the drugs currently available are all different. This makes any comparison impossible, and thus, the choice of treatment is subjective. Certain combinations (antiresorptive drugs and anabolic agents) are logical, but no major study is available to validate them. Drugs with a long latency period could interfere with later treatments or allow therapeutic windows, but the data in the literature in support of these hypotheses are scarce. The osteoporotic patient will require treatment for 10 to 30 years, depending on the age at diagnosis, but the available data on the efficacy and nontoxicity of the drugs are based on studies of a duration of only 3 or 5 years.

5.2	Mineral Metabolism

Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with FOSAMAX [see Contraindications (4)]. Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with FOSAMAX.

Presumably due to the effects of FOSAMAX on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur, especially in patients with Paget's disease, in whom the pretreatment rate of bone turnover may be greatly elevated, and in patients receiving glucocorticoids, in whom calcium absorption may be decreased.

Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is especially important in patients with Paget's disease of bone and in patients receiving glucocorticoids.

5.3	Musculoskeletal Pain

In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This category of drugs includes FOSAMAX (alendronate). Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.

In placebo-controlled clinical studies of FOSAMAX, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the FOSAMAX and placebo groups.

### Oral bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis: risk factors, prediction of risk using serum CTX testing, prevention, and treatment [^114sg7Xh]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the risk and time course of oral bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaws.

Materials and Methods

Detailed data from 30 consecutive cases were compared with 116 cases due to intravenous aminobisphosphonates.

Results

Results in part noted a higher incidence related to alendronate (Fosamax; Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ), a 94.7% predilection for the posterior mandible, and a 50% occurrence spontaneously, with the remaining 50% resulting from an oral surgical procedure, mostly tooth removals. Just over 53% of patients were taking their oral bisphosphonate for osteopenia, 33.3% for documented osteoporosis, and 13.4% for steroid-induced osteoporosis related to 4 or more years of prednisone therapy for an autoimmune condition. There was a direct exponential relationship between the size of the exposed bone and the duration of oral bisphosphonate use. There was also a direct correlation between reports of pain and clinical evidence of infection. The morning fasting serum C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) test results were observed to correlate to the duration of oral bisphosphonate use and could indicate a recovery of bone remodeling with increased values if the oral bisphosphonate was discontinued. A stratification of relative risk was seen as CTX values less than 100 pg/mL representing high risk, CTX values between 100 pg/mL and 150 pg/mL representing moderate risk, and CTX values above 150 pg/mL representing minimal risk. The CTX values were noted to increase between 25.9 pg/mL to 26.4 pg/mL for each month of a drug holiday indicating a recovery of bone remodeling and a guideline as to when oral surgical procedures can be accomplished with the least risk. In addition, drug holidays associated with CTX values rising above the 150 pg/mL threshold were observed to correlate to either spontaneous bone healing or a complete healing response after an office-based debridement procedure.

Conclusions

Oral bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis is a rare but real entity that is less frequent, less severe, more predictable, and more responsive to treatment than intravenous bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis. The morning fasting serum C-terminal telopeptide bone suppression marker is a useful tool for the clinician to assess risks and guide treatment decisions.

Participants reported that the device was "easy to carry around", "it's portable", "I can keep all my tablets in one place", "it reminds me to take my medication on time", "looks like a modern day gadget", "better than carrying packets of pills" and "it is a good box". Participants felt that the device not only reminded them to take their pills when they forgot but it helped them to be more careful and responsible about taking their pills because they knew that someone was "watching" or monitoring them. On the negative side participants reported that "it would send reminders even when I took my medication", "I didn't like that it had to be charged", "it is too big", "people asked about the box" and "timing of SMS was inconvenient".

Participants suggested that the device should be combined with a reminder (e.g. alarm, buzzer etc.), preferably in one device. Participants also reported that there should not be long delays between forgetting to take their medication and receiving a SMS reminder. Some patients also complained about getting multiple reminders despite actually taking their medication. Participants also mentioned that the device could be smaller and that it should be designed to fit into trouser pockets for convenience, especially in men.

Overall, participants were optimistic about the device and their responses indicated that they found the device "acceptable and useful". One participant reported that "It was great to be reminded to take my medication" while another participant mentioned that "This box is very precious, it is a nice box. I don't have to be reminded by my wife. I wish I can keep it".

Regarding medical management for hip fracture, more specifically with respect to management of osteoporosis, duration, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to consider offering a bisphosphonate holiday after 5 years of treatment with oral bisphosphonates, if fracture risk is no longer high (such as a T score > -2.5, or if the patient has remained fracture free), but continue treatment up to an additional 5 years if fracture risk remains high.

Patient values and preferences indicate that compliance with oral bisphosphonates is low (~30% still continuing at 1 year); in patients with adherence difficulties or who fail to respond, zoledronic acid given annually as an intravenous (IV) infusion or denosumab given by subcutaneous injection every 6 months may be advantageous for effectively lowering fracture risk, and concerns about risks of atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) or osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) should be considered when contemplating bisphosphonate holidays.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^1139XgwN]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a chronic disease, and antiresorptive treatments are often continued for many years. Despite their established efficacy in reducing fracture risk, the most commonly used antiresorptive treatments, bisphosphonates and denosumab, have short‐ and long‐term risks that, coupled with their benefits and other unique characteristics, influence consideration for at least periodic discontinuation. Bisphosphonates retain their effects even after discontinuation due to their prolonged skeletal retention, whereas denosumab discontinuation is associated with a rapid rebound in bone turnover and increased fracture risk. There is controversy about how, when, and why to potentially stop these agents. We discuss both permanent and temporary discontinuation of long‐term treatment with bisphosphonates and denosumab. We focus on the reasons and timing for discontinuation as well as strategies to mitigate future fracture risk.

Phentermine administration and safety — use instructions state phentermine is usually taken as a single daily dose in the morning and to not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period than your doctor tells you to; safety notes add that phentermine is FDA-approved for short-term use in adolescents older than 16 years of age and that you should not take phentermine if you have uncontrolled high blood pressure, heart disease, hyperthyriodism (overactive thyroid gland), glaucoma, or if you are taking stimulant ADHD medications.
