## Question

HPV vaccination recommendation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for current HPV vaccination recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching goals and scope of HPV vaccination programs. Then, I should verify the routine target age and the rationale for starting early. Next, I will examine the catch-up age range and the harmonized adult policy. After that, I need to check the dosing schedules by age at initiation and immunocompromise status. I will then review vaccine formulations and special populations, including pregnancy and HIV. Finally, I should consider implementation strategies, safety, and screening implications, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary that aligns with ACIP, CDC, and ACS guidance.

> Let me first confirm the core public health objective: HPV vaccination aims to prevent HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, notably cervical, anal, oropharyngeal, vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers, as well as anogenital warts, with the 9-valent vaccine covering the types responsible for about 92% of HPV-attributable cancers in the U.S., which anchors the emphasis on early adolescent vaccination before sexual exposure [^117GtUtk] [^116N9XwR].

> I should confirm the routine target age. ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, but vaccination can start at age 9 years; the ACS explicitly encourages initiation between ages 9 and 12 years to maximize on-time completion and population impact, and this early start is supported by higher series completion rates and durable immunogenicity when given before age 13 years [^116cr7qi] [^116Uyo7b] [^112DsrR6] [^1114msT4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about catch-up; I need to verify the harmonized adult recommendation. ACIP updated catch-up vaccination to include all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated, regardless of gender, aligning previously disparate catch-up windows for males and females; the ACS endorses catch-up through 26 years but emphasizes that effectiveness wanes with age and does not endorse routine vaccination beyond 26 years due to low incremental benefit [^116cr7qi] [^117V4vuf] [^115bJgXr].

> Next, I should review dosing by age at initiation and immune status. For immunocompetent adolescents who initiate the series before the 15th birthday, a 2-dose schedule at 0 and 6–12 months is recommended; if the interval between dose 1 and dose 2 is less than 5 months, a third dose is required to ensure adequate immunogenicity; for those who start at age 15 years or older, and for immunocompromised persons of any age, a 3-dose schedule at 0, 1–2, and 6 months is recommended; I should double-check that this applies to all 9–26-year-olds starting at 15, which it does per ACIP and CDC schedules [^113gXKx3] [^117DYJpC] [^111GqQsK] [^112Mmfqf].

> Wait, let me verify the vaccine formulation landscape. In the U.S., only the 9-valent HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9) is currently distributed; it covers HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, expanding protection beyond the quadrivalent formulation; historical bivalent and quadrivalent products are no longer available, though prior series with those products are considered valid and need not be repeated if already complete [^117GtUtk] [^115mkCpx].

> I need to ensure special population nuances are addressed. For pregnancy, HPV vaccination should be delayed until after pregnancy; no pregnancy test is required before vaccination, and inadvertent administration during pregnancy does not require intervention beyond deferring remaining doses; for people with HIV or other immunocompromising conditions, a 3-dose schedule is recommended regardless of age at initiation because immunogenicity may be attenuated; for adults aged 27–45 years, ACIP supports shared clinical decision-making, but the ACS does not endorse routine vaccination in this group due to low effectiveness and limited cancer prevention potential, so clinicians should individualize discussions based on risk and likelihood of new exposure [^1118JDtB] [^114JH6B7] [^115VTLKr] [^115bJgXr].

> Let me consider implementation and operational strategies. Starting at age 9–10 years can improve series completion by age 13, and presumptive, same-day recommendations alongside other adolescent vaccines increase uptake; school-based programs and multi-age catch-up campaigns are particularly impactful in LMIC settings and can be adapted to U.S. community strategies; cost-effectiveness modeling supports 2-dose schedules for 9–14-year-olds as operationally simpler with population-level impact comparable to 3-dose schedules in many contexts [^112DsrR6] [^112m4261] [^1157Bdan] [^117LcwCV].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring. HPV vaccines have an excellent safety profile with > 120 million doses administered in the U.S.; serious adverse events are rare and comparable to controls in trials, though long-term comparative harms data are limited and rely on post-marketing surveillance; common adverse effects are local injection-site reactions, and no safety signals have emerged that alter the risk–benefit calculus for recommended ages [^1145Eq4P] [^1125ySnB] [^113VutRk].

> But wait, what about screening implications after vaccination; I need to check that guidance. Vaccinated individuals should continue routine cervical cancer screening according to age-based guidelines because vaccination does not obviate the need for screening, and the impact of vaccination on screening algorithms is still evolving as vaccinated cohorts mature; USPSTF and ACS screening recommendations remain in force for vaccinated women [^115fo61P] [^117FvKr1].

> Let me reconsider the key messages to ensure internal consistency. Routine vaccination at 11–12 years, allow initiation at 9 years, catch-up through 26 years for all, 2 doses if starting before age 15, 3 doses if starting at 15 or older or if immunocompromised, use 9-valent vaccine exclusively in the U.S., avoid vaccination in pregnancy, and apply shared decision-making cautiously for ages 27–45 years; this synthesis aligns with ACIP, CDC, and ACS positions and reflects the evidence on immunogenicity, effectiveness, and public health impact [^116cr7qi] [^111GqQsK] [^115bJgXr].

HPV vaccination is **recommended for all adolescents at age 11–12 years** [^113gXKx3], but can start at age 9 [^115bJgXr]. A **2-dose schedule is sufficient** if started before age 15, with doses 6–12 months apart [^113gXKx3]; if the interval is shorter than 5 months, a third dose is needed [^111GqQsK]. For those starting at age 15 or older, or for immunocompromised individuals, a **3-dose schedule** (0, 1–2, 6 months) is required [^113gXKx3] [^114JH6B7]. Catch-up vaccination is recommended through age 26 for all who are not adequately vaccinated [^116cr7qi]; for ages 27–45, use shared clinical decision-making given lower effectiveness [^116BC19n] [^115bJgXr]. The 9-valent vaccine is preferred [^117GtUtk] and vaccination should occur before sexual debut for optimal protection [^116Uyo7b].

---

## Routine vaccination schedule

- **Routine age**: 11–12 years [^113gXKx3], but can start at 9 years [^115bJgXr].
- **2-dose schedule**: for those starting before age 15; doses at 0 and 6–12 months [^1145Eq4P]; if the interval is < 5 months, give a third dose [^111GqQsK].
- **3-dose schedule**: for those starting at age 15 or older, or for immunocompromised individuals; doses at 0, 1–2, and 6 months [^113gXKx3] [^114JH6B7].

---

## Catch-up vaccination

Catch-up vaccination is recommended through **age 26** for all who are not adequately vaccinated [^116cr7qi]. For ages 27–45, use **shared clinical decision-making** because of lower effectiveness [^116BC19n] [^115bJgXr].

---

## Special populations

- **Immunocompromised individuals**: 3-dose schedule regardless of age at initiation [^1145Eq4P].
- **Pregnancy**: delay vaccination until after pregnancy; no routine pregnancy testing before vaccination [^1118JDtB].
- **Breastfeeding**: vaccination is safe [^115y46MR].

---

## Vaccine types

The **9-valent vaccine (Gardasil 9)** is preferred and covers HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 [^113sYPjh] [^112mfPVk].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommendations

- **Effectiveness**: HPV vaccination significantly reduces HPV infections, genital warts, and cervical precancers [^1131haP8] [^116N9XwR].
- **Safety**: HPV vaccines have a strong safety record with no serious safety signals identified [^1145Eq4P] [^111GqQsK].

---

## Implementation strategies

Implementation strategies include **provider recommendations** — clinicians should give a strong, routine recommendation — and **school-based programs**, which improve uptake and completion [^112m4261] [^117Q5KtZ] [^1131haP8].

---

HPV vaccination is **recommended for all adolescents at 11–12 years** [^113gXKx3], with a 2-dose schedule if started before age 15 and a 3-dose schedule if started at 15 or older or for immunocompromised individuals [^111GqQsK] [^114JH6B7]. Catch-up vaccination is recommended through age 26 [^116cr7qi], with shared clinical decision-making for ages 27–45 [^116BC19n]. The 9-valent vaccine is preferred [^notfound], and vaccination should occur before sexual debut for optimal protection [^116Uyo7b].

### Use of a 2-dose schedule for human papillomavirus vaccination-updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^113gXKx3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including cancers. Routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2006 for females and since 2011 for males (1,2). This report provides recommendations and guidance regarding use of HPV vaccines and updates ACIP HPV vaccination recommendations previously published in 2014 and 2015 (1,2). This report includes new recommendations for use of a 2-dose schedule for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 9 through 14 years. Three doses remain recommended for persons who initiate the vaccination series at ages 15 through 26 years and for immunocompromised persons.

Background

Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three-dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunisation schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programmes that include males.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV-negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV-positive males or females of any age.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were designed to measure antibody responses (i.e. immunogenicity) as the primary outcome, rather than clinical outcomes, since it is unethical to collect cervical samples from girls under 16 years of age. We analysed immunogenicity outcomes (i.e.g.eometric mean titres) with ratios of means, clinical outcomes (e.g. cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia) with risk ratios or rate ratios and, for serious adverse events and deaths, we calculated odds ratios. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow-up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years. Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9- to 15-year-old females Antibody responses after two-dose and three-dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow-up (4 RCTs, moderate- to high-certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low-certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three-dose group (1/898) and none in the two-dose group (0/899) (low-certainty evidence). Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9- to 14-year-old females and males Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow-up (4 RCTs, moderate- to high-certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low-certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low-certainty evidence). HPV vaccination of 10- to 26-year-old males In one RCT there was moderate-certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person-years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person-years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person-years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person-years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person-years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person-years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection-site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness. Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9- to 26-year-old females and males Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9- to 15-years (n = 600), one in females aged 16- to 26-years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16- to 26-years (n = 500). The RCT in 16- to 26-year-old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high-certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high-certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. HPV vaccination for people living with HIV Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low-certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low- to very low-certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

Authors' Conclusions

The immunogenicity of two-dose and three-dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post-marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long-term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced-dose schedules against HPV-related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^113sYPjh]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is currently recommended?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

Why are the recommendations being updated now?

9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on December 10, 2014. This vaccine targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, the types targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), as well as five additional types, HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. ACIP reviewed results of a randomized trial among approximately 14,000 females aged 16 through 26 years that showed noninferior immunogenicity for the types shared by 4vHPV and 9vHPV and high efficacy for the five additional types. Other trials in the 9vHPV clinical development program included studies that compared antibody responses across age groups and females and males and concomitant vaccination studies. The evidence supporting 9vHPV vaccination was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was designated as a Category A recommendation (recommendation for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).

What are the new recommendations?

9vHPV, 4vHPV or 2vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years and females through age 26 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. 9vHPV or 4vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years and males through age 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. ACIP recommends either 9vHPV or 4vHPV vaccination for men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

Main results

We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow‐up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years.

Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 15‐year‐old females

Antibody responses after two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low‐certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three‐dose group (1/898) and none in the two‐dose group (0/899) (low‐certainty evidence).

Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 14‐year‐old females and males

Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low‐certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low‐certainty evidence).

HPV vaccination of 10‐ to 26‐year‐old males

In one RCT there was moderate‐certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person‐years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person‐years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person‐years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person‐years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person‐years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person‐years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection‐site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9‐ to 26‐year‐old females and males

Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9‐ to 15‐years (n = 600), one in females aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 500). The RCT in 16‐ to 26‐year‐old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high‐grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high‐certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high‐certainty evidence).

HPV vaccination for people living with HIV

Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low‐certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^115bJgXr]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations — The ACS recommends routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates. Health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine series at age 9 or 10 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated, and providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for adults aged older than 26 years. The ACS does not endorse the 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for shared clinical decision making for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on the selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^112NXjjg]. CA (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) presents an adaptation of the current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The ACS recommends routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, which will lead to increased numbers of cancers prevented. Health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine series at age 9 or 10 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. Providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for adults aged older than 26 years. The ACS does not endorse the 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for shared clinical decision making for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on the selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Public health opportunities resulting from sufficient HPV vaccine supply and a single-dose vaccination schedule [^1157Bdan]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). Medium credibility.

Many countries with the highest burdens of cervical cancer have not yet offered human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines to most of their age-eligible girls, who as adults also have limited or no access to effective cervical cancer screening or treatment. There are now 2 complementary developments that could make HPV vaccines more accessible and affordable: 1) the current and projected increases in HPV vaccine supply; and 2) the permissive recommendation for single-dose HPV vaccination schedules. This change in policy paired with the healthier HPV vaccine supply is an incredible opportunity to facilitate rapid access and expansion of HPV vaccination. Female adolescent vaccination including multiage cohorts must be prioritized. In the coming decades, this is the most cost-effective approach to avert millions of projected cervical cancer cases, which account for most HPV-related cancers globally.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older-United States, 2017 [^117DYJpC]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination. Healthy adolescents who start their human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination series before age 15 years are recommended to receive 2 doses of HPV vaccine. Adults and adolescents who did not start their HPV vaccination series before age 15 years should receive 3 doses of HPV vaccine. Changes in recommendations in the adult immunization schedule include updates regarding HPV vaccination for adults who did not complete the HPV vaccination series as adolescents. These changes are described in the 2017 adult immunization schedule as follows:

Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years who have not received any HPV vaccine should receive a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine at 0, 1–2, and 6 months. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated with a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine at 0, 1–2, and 6 months.
Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years (and males aged 22 through 26 years who may receive HPV vaccine) who initiated the HPV vaccination series before age 15 years and received 2 doses at least 5 months apart are considered adequately vaccinated and do not need an additional dose of HPV vaccine.
Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years (and males aged 22 through 26 years who may receive HPV vaccine) who initiated the HPV vaccination series before age 15 years and received only 1 dose, or 2 doses less than 5 months apart, are not considered adequately vaccinated and should receive 1 additional dose of HPV vaccine.

5 VACCINATION SCHEDULES

Current vaccination schedules vary by country and region. The primary target group for HPV vaccination for the prevention of cervical cancer is girls aged 9–14 years, before sexual activity begins. Two‐ and three‐dose schedules were found to result in comparable immune responses in young females in a 2019 Cochrane systematic review. The same review reported that a longer interval (up to 12 months) between doses resulted in a stronger immune response than doses administered at shorter intervals. Although originally recommended as a three‐dose schedule, the demonstration of a comparable immune response and protective benefit from two doses has prompted most guidelines to change to a two‐dose schedule, with a minimum of a 6‐month interval between doses.

Several countries and jurisdictions have updated their HPV vaccination recommendations to include a single‐dose schedule, with a growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness, especially when administered at a young age. These include not only LMICs but also high‐income countries such as Australia, Canada, the UK and several others. A single‐dose HPV vaccine has efficacy similar to that of two‐ or three‐dose schedules in studies evaluating short‐term protection. The longest follow‐up to date was the India IARC trial, in which an average follow‐up of 12 years showed comparable effectiveness. Further studies and long‐term follow‐ups of single‐dose vaccination schedules are ongoing to ensure that similar efficacies persist. Vaccine availability, adherence, and budget limitations are just some of the vaccine implementation challenges, and a single‐dose schedule is a potential solution to this, allowing rapid and broader coverage and expediting achievement of the elimination goal. The WHO recommends a single dose as an option for those up to 20 years of age and a two‐dose recommendation for those aged over 21 years. Three doses are recommended for immunocompromised individuals.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^111MCeUw]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 2019 human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — For children and adults aged 9–26 y, HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 y; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 y, and vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated. For adults aged > 26 y, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 y; instead, shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 y. Administration guidance states that dosing schedules, intervals, and definitions of persons considered adequately vaccinated have not changed and that no prevaccination testing (eg, Pap or HPV testing) is recommended to establish the appropriateness of HPV vaccination. Cervical cancer screening guidelines and recommendations should be followed. These recommendations for children and adults aged 9–26 y and for adults aged > 26 y apply to all persons, regardless of behavioral or medical risk factors; for persons who are pregnant, HPV vaccination should be delayed until after pregnancy, however, pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination, and persons who are breastfeeding or lactating can receive HPV vaccine.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ongoing challenges and future directions [^115nEWwq]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Studies with prophylactic HPV vaccination have demonstrated impressive efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety results; however, the implementation and uptake in both low and high-income countries continues to be challenging. Since 2006, administration guidelines have undergone multiple updates regarding age, dosing schedule, and gender. Despite these changes, the basic tenet remains the same: prioritize immunization before initiation of sexual activity and subsequent exposure to HPV. The importance of immunizing males and females equally and the role for catch-up vaccination in late adolescent and adulthood has also been supported by subsequent research. Very recently, the FDA approved to expand the range of eligible patients for the nonavalent (9vHPV) vaccine to women and men from age 27 to 45 for the prevention of HPV-related cancers and diseases. Furthermore, members of the ACIP voted to recommend that individuals between ages 27 and 45 who have not yet been vaccinated discuss the option with their physician. This review will highlight the history of the vaccine, barriers to vaccination, current recommendations, and future directions for success.

Clinical Question

Who should receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination?

Bottom Line

Catch-up vaccination is now recommended for all persons through age 26 years. For persons aged 27 through 45 years, clinicians and patients should now jointly decide whether HPV vaccination is appropriate. Routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years (or as early as age 9 years) continues to be recommended.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^116Uyo7b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Adolescents remain the most important focus of the HPV vaccination program in the United States. Recommendations harmonized across genders will simplify the immunization schedule and be more feasible to implement. HPV vaccination is most effective when given before exposure to any HPV, as in early adolescence. Clinical trials have indicated that HPV vaccines are safe and effective against infection and disease attributable to HPV vaccine types that recipients are not infected with at the time of vaccination.

Because HPV acquisition generally occurs soon after first sexual activity, vaccine effectiveness will be lower in older age groups because of prior infections. Some previously exposed adults will have developed natural immunity already. Exposure to HPV decreases among older age groups. Evidence suggests that although HPV vaccination is safe for adults aged 27 through 45 years, population benefit would be minimal; nevertheless, some adults who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^116ANd6E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

In practice, HPV vaccination rates in many countries remain low.

Simpler HPV immunisation schedules have been identified as a potential strategy to increase the coverage of vaccination (Walling 2016). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a two‐dose HPV vaccine schedule in 2014, based on a systematic review of studies with immunogenicity as the end‐point (D'Addario 2017; WHO 2017). As of 30 December 2017, 80 countries had fully introduced HPV vaccination and four countries had partially introduced HPV vaccination into their national immunisation programmes, with 65 countries having implemented a two‐dose schedule in girls 9 to 14 years old.

In 2018, a Cochrane Review concluded that the licensed three‐dose schedules of the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in limited adverse events and are effective against precancerous cervical lesions in females (Arbyn 2018). Since the 2014 WHO recommendation and original systematic review of two‐dose HPV vaccination schedules (D'Addario 2017; WHO 2017), the evidence base from RCTs about alternative vaccination schedules has expanded to include more data about the nonavalent HPV vaccine (Iversen 2016), about HPV vaccination in males, including MSM (Giuliano 2011), and amongst people living with HIV infection (Toft 2014). This review was initially commissioned in 2016 by the WHO Initiative for Vaccine Research to update the evidence for the two‐dose recommendation and is an update of D'Addario 2017. We produced a revised protocol for this update (Bergman 2017).

Cochrane Reviews usually include only RCTs with major clinical disease endpoints because RCTs provide the highest level of certainty about critical outcomes of interventions. However, precancer and cancer do not develop until many years after the acquisition of HPV infection, so it is difficult to determine the efficacy of vaccines against these outcomes. Persistent HPV infection is considered by the International Agency for Research on Cancer to be sufficient as a surrogate marker for cervical and anal cancer and non‐inferiority of immunogenicity is sufficient to bridge results to under‐16‐year‐olds. It is therefore important to document all infection and immunological outcomes measured in RCTs of HPV vaccines, even if the intended use of the vaccine is to prevent cancer.

This review aims to extend the evidence base on the efficacy and harms of HPV vaccines by including and evaluating RCTs of different HPV vaccines and different dose schedules in adolescent and adult females and males, as well as women and men living with HIV infection.

American Cancer Society (ACS) adapted human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations — age indications and adult decision-making — state that HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 y; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 y, with an ACS qualifying statement that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9–12 y is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, resulting in increased numbers of cancers prevented, and health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine at age 9 or 10 y. Vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and the ACS qualifying statement specifies that providers should inform individuals aged 22–26 y who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. For adults, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all aged > 26 y and instead shared clinical decision making is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated; however, the ACS does not endorse the recommendation for shared clinical decision making for adults aged 27–45 y because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on selection of individuals who might benefit.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)* routinely recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination has been recommended since 2006 for females through age 26 years, and since 2011 for males through age 21 years and certain special populations through age 26 years.

### Quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^116QJwXV]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Low credibility.

These recommendations represent the first statement by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on the use of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on June 8, 2006. This report summarizes the epidemiology of HPV and associated diseases, describes the licensed HPV vaccine, and provides recommendations for its use for vaccination among females aged 9–26 years in the United States. Genital HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States; an estimated 6.2 million persons are newly infected every year. Although the majority of infections cause no clinical symptoms and are self-limited, persistent infection with oncogenic types can cause cervical cancer in women. HPV infection also is the cause of genital warts and is associated with other anogenital cancers. Cervical cancer rates have decreased in the United States because of widespread use of Papanicolaou testing, which can detect precancerous lesions of the cervix before they develop into cancer; nevertheless, during 2007, an estimated 11,100 new cases will be diagnosed and approximately 3,700 women will die from cervical cancer. In certain countries where cervical cancer screening is not routine, cervical cancer is a common cancer in women. The licensed HPV vaccine is composed of the HPV L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L1 protein in yeast using recombinant DNA technology produces noninfectious virus-like particles (VLP) that resemble HPV virions. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is a mixture of four HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 combined with an aluminum adjuvant. Clinical trials indicate that the vaccine has high efficacy in preventing persistent HPV infection, cervical cancer precursor lesions, vaginal and vulvar cancer precursor lesions, and genital warts caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 among females who have not already been infected with the respective HPV type. No evidence exists of protection against disease caused by HPV types with which females are infected at the time of vaccination. However, females infected with one or more vaccine HPV types before vaccination would be protected against disease caused by the other vaccine HPV types. The vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection, and the recommended schedule is a 3-dose series with the second and third doses administered 2 and 6 months after the first dose. The recommended age for vaccination of females is 11–12 years. Vaccine can be administered as young as age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination is recommended for females aged 13–26 years who have not been previously vaccinated. Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical cancer screening, and vaccinated females should have cervical cancer screening as recommended.

Global HPV Vaccination Activities

Global HPV Vaccination Policies and Guidelines

Since 2005, CDC has provided technical support to WHO and its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts in the development and revision of HPV vaccine policies and guidelines. CDC participated in WHO technical work groups providing expertise for the development of the first WHO position paper and recommendations for HPV vaccination that were released in 2009. CDC also assisted in the development of the 2010 WHO report focused on evaluating HPV vaccine coverage and providing guidance for HPV vaccine impact monitoring. In addition, CDC participated in a series of WHO meetings during 2013–2015 that were focused on revising guidelines for future HPV vaccine trials, including guidance on trial design and clinical endpoints for evaluation of new prophylactic HPV vaccines. As further data became available from vaccine trials, CDC provided ongoing consultation to WHO headquarters and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) when deliberations were under way for reduced-dose vaccination schedules and consideration of vaccination for boys. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of CDC has provided ongoing opportunities for policy makers from other countries to attend and learn from US deliberations on vaccine policy.

### Persistence of immunity when using different human papillomavirus vaccination schedules and booster-dose effects 5 years after primary vaccination [^111wkEeC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence from human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines continues to emerge, demonstrating their high immunogenicity and efficacy against HPV infection, cervical precancer, and invasive cancer. While the first HPV vaccine recommendations suggested a 3-dose scheme, in 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the 2-dose regimen for immunocompetent girls between 9 and 14 years old. This decision was based on immunogenicity studies that showed noninferiority of 2 doses of either HPV vaccine in girls aged 9–14 years as compared to 3 doses in young women.

However, several questions about this decision have been voiced in the recent literature. The main concern is that the WHO recommendation is based on comparison of the immune response between girls and women, which could be clouded by differences in immune maturation. A recent meta-analysis suggests that this could be a possibility; pooling results of 2 studies of same-age girls revealed that the 2-dose schedule was inferior to the 3-dose schedule. Similar concerns have been raised about long-term immunogenicity under the 2-dose regimen. A recent randomized clinical trial showed that the 2-dose regimen in girls aged 9–14 years produced an immunogenic response noninferior to that observed with 3 doses in young women after 5 years of follow-up; thus, age differences could still influence this finding. To solve this limitation, further noninferiority trials conducted in immunologically comparable age groups are needed.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE The American Cancer Society (ACS) reviewed and updated its guideline on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination based on a methodologic and content review of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) HPV vaccination recommendations. A literature review was performed to supplement the evidence considered by the ACIP and to address new vaccine formulations and recommendations as well as new data on population outcomes since publication of the 2007 ACS guideline. The ACS Guideline Development Group determined that the evidence supports ACS endorsement of the ACIP recommendations, with one qualifying statement related to late vaccination. The ACS recommends vaccination of all children at ages 11 and 12 years to protect against HPV infections that lead to several cancers and precancers. Late vaccination for those not vaccinated at the recommended ages should be completed as soon as possible, and individuals should be informed that vaccination may not be effective at older ages.

5.3 Innovation in dosing and schedule

For the priority target population of girls aged 9–14 years, the HPV vaccine is currently delivered under a two‐dose regimen, at intervals of at least 6 months. 28 LICs/LMICs are challenged to finance two doses of a relatively expensive vaccine, and institute tracking and follow‐up to ensure good coverage of the second dose. 28 A single dose schedule, if effective, thus offers many gains in both cost and simplicity of delivery. Some existing studies show that a single dose of the HPV vaccine may potentially be protective against HPV infection for healthy young girls 29 but the quality of existing evidence is not robust enough for a global recommendation. 30 Randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and modeling analyses are underway to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, effectiveness, and cost‐effectiveness of a single‐dose HPV vaccination. 31 These randomized controlled trials and observational studies, along with ecological studies from Australia, Denmark, Scotland, USA, and Mongolia, will be reporting in the near future and the evidence is expected to be evolving rapidly.

The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) will continue to review evidence on the single dose as it becomes available, 30 such that global policy may change in some years. A single dose could be a game changer, by reducing the financial cost of the vaccine, increasing the ease of delivery, and balancing the supply‐versus‐demand scenario.

The ACIP basis included that the vaccine can be administered as young as age 9 years, high antibody titers after vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, and the established young adolescent visit at age 11 or 12 years. Evidence summarized notes that HPV vaccination has been shown to be more effective at younger ages, that vaccinating at age 12 or 13 years is significantly more effective than vaccinating at age 14 or 15 years, that vaccinating at ages 9 to 11 years will be at least as effective and will likely result in a stronger immune response, and that vaccination has shown no sign of protection waning over time.

### FIGO position statement on the effectiveness and safety of the HPV vaccine [^113VDQ69]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer, which is primarily caused by persistent infection with oncogenic high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) types, remains a substantial health problem with the highest incidence and mortality rates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). HPV vaccination induces a robust immune response against the HPV types included in the vaccine and protects against subsequent development of cervical cancer precursors. Furthermore, countries with high vaccination coverage have observed a significant reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer. The vaccine has also been shown to be safe, with adverse effects generally limited to mild local reactions. Vaccination schedules vary from one to three doses, depending on the target population and region, with several countries moving to a single-dose schedule - a growing body of evidence supports the effectiveness of this, especially when given at a younger age. Public health strategies that support equitable and accessible vaccination are vital for achieving the WHO target of 90% of girls being fully vaccinated with the HPV vaccinate by the age of 15. The implementation and promotion of HPV vaccination programs are important components of the global efforts to eliminate cervical cancer.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^115a2Ycp]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations for Use of HPV Vaccines

ACIP recommends that routine HPV vaccination be initiated at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. † Vaccination of females is recommended with 2vHPV, 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available), or 9vHPV. Vaccination of males is recommended with 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available) or 9vHPV.

2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV all protect against HPV 16 and 18, types that cause about 66% of cervical cancers and the majority of other HPV-attributable cancers in the United States. 9vHPV targets five additional cancer causing types, which account for about 15% of cervical cancers. 4vHPV and 9vHPV also protect against HPV 6 and 11, types that cause anogenital warts.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^114mwdj3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Administration

2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV are each administered in a 3-dose schedule. The second dose is administered at least 1 to 2 months after the first dose, and the third dose at least 6 months after the first dose §. If the vaccine schedule is interrupted, the vaccination series does not need to be restarted.

If vaccination providers do not know or do not have available the HPV vaccine product previously administered, or are in settings transitioning to 9vHPV, any available HPV vaccine product may be used to continue or complete the series for females for protection against HPV 16 and 18; 9vHPV or 4vHPV may be used to continue or complete the series for males. There are no data on efficacy of fewer than 3 doses of 9vHPV.

Special Populations

HPV vaccination is recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) who have not been vaccinated previously or have not completed the 3-dose series.

Precautions and Contraindications

HPV vaccines are contraindicated for persons with a history of immediate hypersensitivity to any vaccine component. 4vHPV and 9vHPV are contraindicated for persons with a history of immediate hypersensitivity to yeast. 2vHPV should not be used in persons with anaphylactic latex allergy.

HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. If a woman is found to be pregnant after initiating the vaccination series, the remainder of the 3-dose series should be delayed until completion of pregnancy. Pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination. If a vaccine dose has been administered during pregnancy, no intervention is needed. A new pregnancy registry has been established for 9vHPV. Pregnancy registries for 4vHPV and 2vHPV have been closed with concurrence from FDA. Exposure during pregnancy can be reported to the respective manufacturer. Patients and health care providers can report an exposure to HPV vaccine during pregnancy to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

Adverse events occurring after administration of any vaccine should be reported to VAERS. Additional information about VAERS is available by telephone (1–800–822–7967) or online at.

Cervical Cancer Screening

Cervical cancer screening is recommended beginning at age 21 years and continuing through age 65 years for both vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Recommendations will continue to be evaluated as further postlicensure monitoring data become available.

### HPV vaccines – A review of the first decade [^113qK8Rs]. Gynecologic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Pre-adolescent girls (9–15years) have the option of receiving a two dose HPV vaccine series at either a six month or one year interval to provide protection from HPV 16, the most prevalent type associated with cervical cancers, as well as several other less prevalent types. This series of vaccinations is highly likely to protect her from HPV infection until she enters the routine screening program, whether that be primary HPV testing or a combination of HPV testing and cytology. The two dose program has been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2015. For women 15years and older, the three dose vaccine schedule is still recommended. The past ten years of Gardasil use has provided evidence of reduced HPV 16/18 infections in countries where there has been high coverage. Gardasil9 has replaced Gardasil. Gardasil9 has the same rapid anti-HPV 18 and HPV45 titer loss as Gardasil did. Cervarix remains equivalent to Gardasil9 in the prevention of HPV infections and precancers of any HPV type; Cervarix also has demonstrated sustained high antibody titers for at least 10years. One dose of Cervarix provides protection against HPV 16/18 infection with robust antibody titers well above natural infection titers. This may offer the easiest and most cost effective vaccination program over time, especially in low and lower middle income countries. Cervical cancer screening must continue to control cancer incidence over the upcoming decades. Future studies of prophylactic HPV vaccines, as defined by the WHO, must demonstrate protection against six month type specific persistent infections, not actual cervical cancer precursor disease endpoints, such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3) or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). This simplifies and makes less expensive future comparative studies between existing and new generic vaccines.

### Primary immunization of human papillomavirus vaccine in the pediatric population: what is the verdict now? [^113eMxQX]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy of a 2-dose series for the human papillomavirus vaccines rather than a 3-dose series in older children has not been well defined. This article reviews the literature summarizing the use of all 3 HPV vaccines (2vHPV, 4vHPV, 9vHPV) as a 2-dose series for females and 4vHPV and 9vHPV for males younger than 15 years. Six prospective trials evaluating immunogenicity of a 2-dose series of 2vHPV and/or 4vHPV, as well as an ongoing prospective clinical trial for 9vHPV, are discussed. The 2-dose series with Gardasil 9 ® in both males and females ages 9 to 14 years appears to be the most widely accepted recommendation. The exact time schedule between the 2 vaccines varies among studies, but it seems that they should be separated by 6 to 12 months. Federal and world-wide organizations' (ie, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, and World Health Organization) opinions and recommendations on the appropriate scheduling of the vaccines are also highlighted.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1145Eq4P]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

ACIP recommendations for HPV vaccination include the following:

Routine HPV vaccination for all adolescents at age 11 or 12 years.
Administering vaccine starting at age 9 years.
Catch-up vaccination through age 26 years for those not vaccinated previously.
Not using HPV vaccination for all adults aged > 26 years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making between a patient and a provider regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for certain adults aged 27–45 years not vaccinated previously.
A 2-dose vaccine schedule (at 0- and 6–12-month intervals) is recommended for persons who initiate vaccination before their 15th birthday.
A 3-dose vaccine schedule (at 0-, 1–2-, and 6-month intervals) for immunocompromised persons regardless of age of initiation.

HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. HPV vaccines can be administered regardless of history of anogenital warts, abnormal Pap test or HPV test, or anogenital precancer. Women who have received HPV vaccine should continue routine cervical cancer screening (see Cervical Cancer). HPV vaccine is available for eligible children and adolescents aged < 19 years through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program (additional information is available ator by calling CDC INFO 800–232–4636). For uninsured persons aged < 19 years, patient assistance programs are available from the vaccine manufacturers. Prelicensure and postlicensure safety evaluations have determined that the vaccine is well tolerated. With > 120 million doses of HPV vaccines distributed in the United States, robust data demonstrate that HPV vaccines are safe. Impact-monitoring studies in the United States have demonstrated reductions of genital warts as well as the HPV types contained within the quadrivalent vaccine. Settings that provide STI services should either administer the vaccine to eligible clients within the routine and catch-up age groups through age 26 years who have not started or completed the vaccine series, or link these persons to another facility equipped to provide the vaccine. Clinicians providing services to children, adolescents, and young adults should be knowledgeable about HPV and the vaccine. HPV vaccination has not been associated with initiation of sexual activity or sexual risk behaviors.

Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method for preventing genital HPV infection. Persons can decrease their chances of infection by practicing consistent and correct condom use and limiting their number of sex partners. Although these interventions might not fully protect against HPV, they can decrease the chances of HPV acquisition and transmission.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^1124223n]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — adults older than 26 years: ACIP indicates that catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 years; instead, shared clinical decision making is recommended for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated, and HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 years. The ACS does not endorse the recommendation for shared clinical decision making for adults aged 27 through 45 years because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on selecting individuals who might benefit. Supporting context notes that HPV vaccination is most effective in early adolescence, with effectiveness decreasing dramatically by age 18 years and minimal benefit noted by age 20 or 21 years, and that compared with vaccination through age 26 years, extending to adults through age 45 years was estimated to prevent only an additional 0.5% cases of cancer, 0.4% cases of cervical precancer, and 0.3% cases of genital warts over the next 100 years.

### Vaccine effectiveness following routine immunization with bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: protection against incident genital HPV infections from a reduced-dosing schedule [^117P4WM3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Persistent infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) are associated with development of clinical disease, including anogenital or oropharyngeal cancers (in case of high-risk HPV type infections) and anogenital or laryngeal warts (in case of low-risk HPV type infections). From 2006 onward, 3 vaccines targeting different combinations of HPV types have been registered, which were initially licensed and offered according to a 3-dose (3D) schedule (recommended schedule: 0, 1, and 6 months). The European Medicines Agency licensed a 2-dose (2D) schedule (0 and 6 months) for all available HPV vaccines in 2014 for vaccine recipients aged 9–14 years. Immunobridging studies demonstrated comparable immunogenicity between 9- to 14-year-old 2D-vaccinated and 15- to 26-year-old 3D-vaccinated individuals. As efficacy of vaccination was already shown among 3D vaccine recipients, comparable efficacy was expected after 2 doses in case of noninferior immunogenicity. When comparing girls vaccinated at similarly young age, antibody levels against HPV vaccine types following 2 doses are within acceptable ranges compared to 3 doses, although noninferiority of HPV-18 antibodies is still inconclusive.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^116Fyf98]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

During April 2018–June 2019, the ACIP HPV Vaccines Work Group held at least monthly conference calls to review and discuss relevant scientific evidence regarding adult HPV vaccination using the Evidence to Recommendations framework. The Work Group evaluated the quality of evidence for efficacy, safety, and effectiveness for HPV vaccination for primary prevention of HPV infection and HPV-related disease using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Scientific literature published during January 1, 2006–October 18, 2018, was searched to identify clinical trials of any licensed HPV vaccine in adults aged 27 through 45 years. Detailed search methods and results for the GRADE tables are available at. Benefits were based on per-protocol analyses of vaccine efficacy; immunogenicity data were also considered. Harms were any vaccine-related serious adverse events. Of 1,388 references identified, 100 were selected for detailed review, and 16 publications were included in GRADE tables presented at the October 2018 ACIP meeting; tables were updated in June 2019 to include new results from a 9vHPV trial. At the June 2019 ACIP meeting, two policy issues were considered: 1) harmonization of catch-up vaccination for all persons through age 26 years, and 2) vaccination of adults aged > 26 years. Two Evidence to Recommendations documents were developed and presented along with proposed recommendations; after a public comment period, ACIP members voted unanimously to harmonize catch-up vaccination recommendations across genders for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP members also voted 10–4 in favor of shared clinical decision-making for adults aged 27 through 45 years, recognizing that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^112DsrR6]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — early initiation between ages 9 and 12 years: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended starting the series between ages 9 and 12 years. Evidence is emerging that series completion and acceptance may be higher when vaccination is initiated at age 9 or 10 years compared with age 11 or 12 years; in a primary care network, initiation by age 11 years increased from 4.6% to 60.8% within 18 months. In a large population-based cohort, 97.5% of children who initiated HPV vaccination at age 9 or 10 years completed the series by age 13.5 years compared with 78.0% when initiated at age 11 or 12 years. The American Cancer Society (ACS) adapted ACIP guidance and states that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, and that health care providers are encouraged to start offering the series at age 9 or 10 years.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine update [^117Q5KtZ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Rates of cancers attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) are rising. A safe and extremely effective vaccine is available to prevent many of these cancers. Studies have shown that health care providers' recommendation to immunize is the most important factor in parents' decision. Parents of all adolescent boys and girls should receive a strong and unequivocal recommendation to vaccinate their child against HPV at the 11- or 12-year-old well child visit. Ideally, adolescents complete their HPV vaccine series by their 13th birthday, leading to greater immune response and protection before most adolescents are exposed to sexually transmitted HPV.

### Committee opinion no. 588: human papillomavirus vaccination [^116GQHVH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination routinely be targeted to females and males aged 11 years or 12 years as part of the adolescent immunization platform to help reduce the incidence of anogenital cancers and genital warts associated with HPV infection. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is approved for use in males and females, whereas the bivalent HPV vaccine is approved for use only in females. For those not vaccinated at the target age, catch-up vaccination is recommended up to age 26 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses these recommendations. Although obstetrician-gynecologists are not likely to care for many patients in the initial HPV vaccination target group, they have the opportunity to educate mothers about the importance of vaccinating their children at the recommended age and are critical to vaccinating adolescent girls and young women during the catch-up period. Obstetrician-gynecologists should advise patients and parents that HPV vaccines are most effective in preventing genital cancers when administered before the onset of sexual activity. However, sexually active individuals can receive some benefit from the vaccination because exposure to all HPV types prevented by the vaccines is unlikely in persons aged 13 years through 26 years. Although HPV vaccination in pregnancy is not recommended, neither is routine pregnancy testing before vaccination. Lactating women can receive either HPV vaccine. The need for ongoing cervical cytology screening should be emphasized in all women aged 21 years and older, even those who received HPV vaccination before the onset of sexual activity.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^116BC19n]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Children and adults aged 9 through 26 years. HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. †

Adults aged > 26 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated. (Box). HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 years.

BOX
Considerations for shared clinical decision-making regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of adults aged 27 through 45 years

Ideally, HPV vaccination should be given in early adolescence because vaccination is most effective before exposure to HPV through sexual activity. For adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated, * clinicians can consider discussing HPV vaccination with persons who are most likely to benefit. HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most adults aged > 26 years.

HPV is a very common sexually transmitted infection. Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic and cause no clinical problems.
Although new HPV infections are most commonly acquired in adolescence and young adulthood, some adults are at risk for acquiring new HPV infections. At any age, having a new sex partner is a risk factor for acquiring a new HPV infection.
Persons who are in a long-term, mutually monogamous sexual partnership are not likely to acquire a new HPV infection.
Most sexually active adults have been exposed to some HPV types, although not necessarily all of the HPV types targeted by vaccination.
No clinical antibody test can determine whether a person is already immune or still susceptible to any given HPV type.
HPV vaccine efficacy is high among persons who have not been exposed to vaccine-type HPV before vaccination.
Vaccine effectiveness might be low among persons with risk factors for HPV infection or disease (e.g. adults with multiple lifetime sex partners and likely previous infection with vaccine-type HPV), as well as among persons with certain immunocompromising conditions.
HPV vaccines are prophylactic (i.e. they prevent new HPV infections). They do not prevent progression of HPV infection to disease, decrease time to clearance of HPV infection, or treat HPV-related disease.

### Committee opinion no. 467: human papillomavirus vaccination [^113y4VnP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved both a bivalent and quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended that HPV vaccination routinely be given to girls when they are 11 years or 12 years old. The vaccine can be given to individuals as young as 9 years; catch-up vaccination is recommended in females aged 13 years through 26 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses these recommendations. Although obstetrician-gynecologists are not likely to care for many girls in the initial vaccination target group, they are critical to the catch-up vaccination period. Both HPV vaccines are most effective if given before any exposure to HPV infection (ie, before sexual activity). However, sexually active girls and women can receive some benefit from the vaccination because exposure to all HPV types prevented by the vaccines is unlikely in females aged 13 years through 26 years. Vaccination with either HPV vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. It can be provided to women who are breastfeeding. The need for booster vaccination has not been established but appears unnecessary. Health care providers are encouraged to discuss with their patients the benefits and limitations of the HPV vaccine and the need for routine cervical cytology screening for those aged 21 years and older.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination and cervical cancer risk [^1131haP8]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Persistent human papillomavirus infection is the central cause of cervical cancer, the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Clear evidence from both randomized trials and population based studies shows that vaccination against human papillomavirus reduces the incidence of cervical pre-cancer. These data suggest that the vaccine reduces the incidence of cervical cancer. However, human papillomavirus vaccine coverage is inadequate in all countries, especially in low and middle income countries where disease burden is highest. Supply side strategies to improve coverage include increasing the availability of low cost vaccines, school located delivery, single dose vaccine schedules, and development of vaccines that do not need refrigeration. Demand side strategies include enhancing provider recommendations, correcting misinformation, and public awareness campaigns. The near elimination of cervical cancer is achievable through increased uptake of human papillomavirus vaccination and efforts to increase screening for cervical cancer, especially when enacted to reduce disparities in across the world.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^114ZUkkh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The focus of this review was on clinical outcomes and harms. Immunogenicity is the primary outcome for many trials of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, however, as noted in the Background, randomised efficacy trials of HPV vaccines were first conducted in women aged 15 to 25 or 26 years (Arbyn 2018). Once efficacy, immunogenicity and safety were established in this age group, non‐randomised bridging studies assessed non‐inferiority of immunogenicity outcomes in 9‐ to 15‐year‐old girls (e.g. Block 2006, Dobson 2013). The International Agency for Research on Cancer regards bridging studies that demonstrate non‐inferiority as a sufficient endpoint for individuals under 16 years of age (IARC 2014). Bridging studies have also demonstrated non‐inferiority of immunogenicity outcomes of a two‐dose schedule in boys aged 9‐ to 14‐years compared to three doses in young women aged 15 to 26 years (Iversen 2016). Use of immunogenicity outcomes has limitations because the immunological correlate of protection and the duration of protection remain unknown (Donken 2015). These studies provide lower certainty of evidence, because estimates of clinical outcomes are imprecise and indirect.

The nonavalent HPV vaccine was introduced more recently than the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines. This review included all studies that compared the nonavalent HPV vaccine with other HPV vaccines; two RCTs were identified in females (Joura 2015; Vesikari 2015), and one in males (van Damme 2016). A separate Cochrane Review of completed RCTs of three‐dose schedules with bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines in women aged 16 to 26 years shows protection against lesions of grade CIN3, but not invasive cervical cancer (Arbyn 2018). Further comparisons between the different HPV vaccines in women will be included in an update of the Arbyn 2018 review. Observational studies in countries that have licensed more than one HPV vaccine will also provide important information on the comparative efficacy and harms of the different HPV vaccines.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older-United States, 2014 [^111sxozB]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) annually reviews and updates the Recommended Immunization Schedule for Adults Aged 19 Years or Older. This schedule provides a brief summary of ACIP recommendations for the use of vaccines routinely recommended for adults in the form of two figures, footnotes for each vaccine, and a table that includes primary contraindications and precautions.

In October 2013, ACIP approved the Recommended Immunization Schedule for Adults Aged 19 Years or Older for 2014. This schedule was also reviewed and approved by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American College of Nurse-Midwives. The primary updates for the 2014 schedule include adding Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine to the figures and updating information in the footnote about persons for whom Hib vaccine is recommended; adding information to the influenza vaccine footnote and contraindications table regarding the newly licensed recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) and information about the use of RIV and inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) among persons with egg allergies; moving the footnote for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) recommendations before the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) recommendations because PCV13 should be administered first among persons for whom both vaccines are recommended; and clarifying information about the timing of the second and third doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, use of meningococcal vaccines among adults, and recommendations for tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) and tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccines.

### Comparison of two dose and three dose human papillomavirus vaccine schedules: cost effectiveness analysis based on transmission model [^117LcwCV]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Both the UK model and HPV-ADVISE are transmission dynamic models that take into account indirect (herd) vaccine protection due to reduced transmission of human papillomavirus. Herd protection is likely to be a substantial contributor to the impact of two dose programmes with less than lifetime duration of protection. Models also incorporate the full range of human papillomavirus related outcomes, including cervical cancer (and its precursors), other cancers, and anogenital warts. The consistency of results between the two models despite differences in underlying human papillomavirus epidemiology represented in each of them suggests that the main conclusions are generalisable to other high income countries with similar human papillomavirus epidemiology. However, caution is needed in interpreting the results for resource poor settings owing to differences in sexual behaviour, human papillomavirus epidemiology, cervical screening coverage, and healthcare costs. Similar analyses for these settings are a priority, particularly following the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization's global recommendation of two dose schedules.

One limitation of this analysis is that it does not capture historical changes in the human papillomavirus vaccination programme in the United Kingdom over the past six years. This includes the introduction of bivalent human papillomavirus in 2008 with a catch-up campaign staggered over two years, a switch to the quadrivalent vaccine in 2011, and a switch from three dose to two dose vaccination in September 2014. Instead, we considered a more general scenario in which quadrivalent vaccination is introduced with either two or three doses from the start of the programme, and with a catch-up programme up to age 18 years. This allows results to be more readily generalised to other settings where human papillomavirus vaccination may be (or has already been) introduced with a different configuration from the United Kingdom. Furthermore, it is a conservative assumption: assuming that the same schedule (two or three dose) is followed from the start of the programme maximises the difference in impact between the two schedules. Conversely, allowing a few years of three dose vaccination will temporarily reduce any potential loss of effectiveness when switching to two doses because of residual herd protection from older vaccinees who have received three doses.

### Potential benefit of extended dose schedules of human papillomavirus vaccination in the context of scarce resources and COVID-19 disruptions in low-income and middle-income countries: a mathematical modelling analysis [^111g76X3]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2019, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts recommended that an extended interval of 3–5 years between the two doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (first dose given around ages 9–10 years and the second dose around ages 13–14 years) could be considered when introducing HPV vaccination in a country to alleviate HPV vaccine supply shortage. The recommendation was based on studies indicating that geometrical mean IgG antibody titres were similar when the second dose of the HPV vaccine was given 6 months or 3–8 years after the first dose, and on a modelling study showing that an extended schedule could provide similar population-level impact against cervical cancer as the current two-dose schedule, while minimising short-term vaccine demand and costs. Based on these results, the UK and Québec, Canada, have implemented extended HPV vaccination schedules. Furthermore, the recommendation of an extended schedule is particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, HPV vaccination programmes have been severely disrupted due to physical distancing measures (eg, lockdowns and school closures), health system constraints (eg, reassignment of health-care workers), and worries of risk of transmission during immunisation visits.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112mfPVk]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HPV vaccine — product availability and timing: HPV vaccination prevents HPV infection and is ideally administered before sexual exposure to HPV. Although HPV vaccine is most effective in people with few or no sex partners prior to vaccination, HPV vaccination in people with multiple lifetime sex partners can still prevent HPV infection from subtypes they have not been exposed to yet. Three U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved HPV vaccines are licensed: bivalent, quadrivalent, and 9-valent; currently, only the 9-valent vaccine (9vHPV, protective against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) is available in the United States. Routine HPV vaccination with the 9-valent vaccine should be initiated at age 11 or 12 years but may be started as early as age 9 years.

### Immunogenicity of 2 or 3 doses of 9vHPV vaccine in U.S. female individuals 15 to 26 years of age [^111ietdr]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Within the United States, a 9-valent human papillomavirus (9vHPV) vaccine (HPV-6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) is recommended as a two-dose series among individuals 9 to 14years of age and a three-dose series among those 15 to 26years of age. Data comparing two versus three doses of 9vHPV vaccine among individuals 15 to 26years of age are limited. METHODS: We report on an ongoing, single-blinded, randomized noninferiority trial of the 9vHPV vaccine among individuals 15 to 26years of age in the United States. Participants were randomly assigned to a two-dose (0 and 6 months) or three-dose (0, 2, and 6 months) schedule. Blood draws to assess antibody titers were planned before the first vaccination and at 1 and 6 months after the final vaccination. The primary outcome was the rate of seroconversion at 1 month after final vaccination. The secondary outcome was the two-dose versus three-dose ratio of antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) for each of the 9vHPV genotypes at 1 and 6 months after final vaccination. This interim analysis reports results of female participants at 1 month after final vaccination. RESULTS: Of 860 participants screened, 438 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two-dose (n = 217) or three-dose (n = 221) group. At 1 month after the final vaccine dose, the seroconversion rate for each of the nine HPV genotypes in the vaccine was 100% among participants in the two-dose group and 99% in the three-dose group. The point estimates of the two-dose versus three-dose ratios of antibody GMTs for eight of the nine HPV genotypes were above unity; the ratio for HPV-45 was 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 1.13). This was also the smallest value for the lower bound of the 95% CI for all nine ratios (ratios above 1 favor the two-dose schedule). No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In this unplanned interim analysis of U.S. female participants 15 to 26years of age, two doses of 9vHPV vaccine appear to elicit responses similar to three doses at 1 month postvaccination. We await final results at 6 months following the last vaccine dose. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03943875.)

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^116NJzFz]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

From October 2013 to February 2015, the ACIP HPV Vaccine Work Group reviewed clinical trial data assessing the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of 9vHPV, modeling data on cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV, and data on burden of type-specific HPV-associated disease in the United States. Summaries of reviewed evidence and Work Group discussions were presented to ACIP before recommendations were proposed. Recommendations were approved by ACIP in February 2015. Evidence supporting 9vHPV use was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was categorized as a Category A recommendation (for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).

Clearly, if two doses of human papillomavirus vaccine are equivalent in every way to three doses for disease prevention, then giving the third dose has no health or economic advantage. To explore situations in which this is not the case, we assumed that three dose schedules gave lifelong protection, with full protection against cervical infection and disease due to human papillomavirus 16/18. We estimated efficacy against human papillomavirus 31/33/45/52/58 from a meta-analysis of quadrivalent vaccine trials. We then assumed two dose schedules either to provide reduced duration of protection (10, 20, or 30 years) or to lose efficacy against human papillomavirus 31/33/45/52/58. We assumed girls to be given quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine. We then explored the predicted impact of two dose schedules in terms of reduction in cervical cancer.

As the cost of vaccine procurement is unknown, we assumed a single dose of vaccine to cost £80.50 (€101.65; $126.57) or £86.50 (the current list price for bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines in the United Kingdom), with £9.33 administration cost per dose. UK tender prices are unknown but are likely to be substantially lower, so we also did a threshold analysis to find the maximum price at which two dose vaccination and three dose vaccination become cost effective. We used a threshold of £30 000 for an intervention to be cost effective, which is the upper limit of the threshold used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). All other costs came from our previous work, but inflated to 2012–13 prices.

Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum, as recommended in the NICE reference case. As NICE guidelines also suggest that a discount rate of 1.5% per annum can be considered for public health interventions or interventions that have long term health benefits, we also did sensitivity analyses using this rate.

We also explored the same scenarios about two and three dose vaccination by using HPV-ADVISE, an individual based, transmission dynamic model of human papillomavirus vaccination fitted to Canadian data. We retained the original model structure and parameters governing infection transmission and disease natural history; however, we adjusted parameters governing cancer mortality, incidence and costs of anogenital warts, and some utility losses associated with human papillomavirus related disease to reflect UK data (see table 1and supplementary tables A and B for details).

### Human papillomavirus vaccine: a welcome addition to the national immunisation schedule in Nepal [^1176uY7J]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Nepal has introduced the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine into its national immunisation schedule, becoming the 145th country to do so. This significant public health milestone was achieved by the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division (FWD), Department of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), Nepal, on the recommendation of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee. The committee, during its 23rd meeting in 2081 BS (Nepali calendar), endorsed the HPV Vaccination Service Operational Guidelines, facilitating the vaccine rollout. The HPV vaccination campaign is scheduled from 4 February 2025 to 18 February 2025. Supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), this campaign aims to immunise over 1.6 million adolescent school girls (grades 6–10) and out-of-school girls aged 10–14, followed by its subsequent integration into the routine immunisation programme. To ensure widespread coverage among age-eligible adolescent girls, the HPV vaccine will be administered through school-based health initiatives. As of 2024, 144 countries have already included the HPV vaccine in their national routine immunisation schedules.

### Comparison of two dose and three dose human papillomavirus vaccine schedules: cost effectiveness analysis based on transmission model [^113RGQgC]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Although two doses are likely to protect vaccinees for more than a decade, whether protection (and potential cross protection) will be as long lasting or broad as it is for three doses is uncertain, as immunogenicity is inferior to that for three doses in equivalent aged girls (rather than in 15–25 year olds). Consideration of two dose schedules as an alternative to three dose schedules relies on comparing the potential benefits of the two dose schedule (cost savings, logistical simplicity, and potentially higher uptake) with its risks (potentially lower protection). As the precise duration and extent of two dose protection is not yet known for certain, this requires consideration of the range of possibilities that are consistent with the available data. A cost effectiveness framework allows an assessment of whether the economic benefits of two dose schedules compensate for its associated risks and uncertainties.

Several jurisdictions have recently switched from three dose to two dose vaccination schedules for girls aged 9–14 years on the basis of such risk-benefit considerations, including Switzerland, the Netherlands, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Quebec. In two jurisdictions (United Kingdom and Quebec), the decision was explicitly made after consideration of cost effectiveness modelling. The World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) also recommended a two dose schedule for girls aged 9–14 years after reviewing evidence including cost effectiveness modelling.

Here we present a cost effectiveness analysis of two versus three dose human papillomavirus vaccination; this analysis was used to inform the decisions in the United Kingdom and Quebec, as well as by SAGE to recommend a two dose schedule. The work builds on previous modelling showing that two dose vaccination in England and Canada can provide most of the reduction in cervical cancer associated with three dose vaccination. In this analysis, we extend the previous model to consider the full range of human papillomavirus related diseases, including other sites of cancer, anogenital warts, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. This allows us to examine the cost effectiveness of vaccination, particularly when the duration of protection of two dose vaccination is assumed to be only 10 years, and hence the difference in reduction of cervical cancer between the two schedules is greatest (assuming no booster dose is administered at the point of waning).

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included RCTs with no language restrictions. We included unpublished studies, studies in press, and abstracts without a full‐text publication, if they met the inclusion criteria.

Types of participants

Females or males aged 9 to 26 years, including MSM. For the comparisons among people living with HIV, we included all age groups.

Types of interventions

Prophylactic administration of licensed bivalent (Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline), quadrivalent (Gardasil, Merck), or nonavalent (Gardasil 9, Merck) HPV vaccines. We excluded studies if they assessed monovalent or plasmid vaccines, or assessed non‐prophylactic uses of bivalent, quadrivalent or nonavalent vaccines. In addition, we considered for inclusion any trials reporting on the efficacy, immunogenicity, or adverse events in vaccines currently in phase 2 or 3 development. Studies comparing bivalent versus quadrivalent vaccines were excluded, as these will be included in an update of a separate Cochrane Review (Arbyn 2018).

For males and people living with HIV, we included comparisons of HPV vaccines to placebo containing no adjuvant or only the adjuvant of the HPV vaccine, or another HPV vaccine.

In this review, we use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products that contain another vaccine or only vaccine adjuvants, regardless of the terminology used in individual study reports. We use the term 'placebo' only to refer to comparator products containing no adjuvant or active vaccine. In Characteristics of included studies we have reported full details of the type of comparison group compound.

The focus of the review was on different dose schedules and comparisons between different types of HPV vaccine. Where possible we stratified data by participant characteristics of age, gender, and HIV status. Specifically, we aimed to investigate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of:

fewer than three doses of HPV vaccine in females and males;
different intervals between doses in a two‐dose schedule in females and males;
HPV vaccination compared to control for males (a Cochrane Review for females has been published (Arbyn 2018));
nonavalent HPV vaccine compared to the other HPV vaccines in females and males;
HPV vaccination in people living with HIV.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^117FvKr1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Low credibility.

This report summarizes the epidemiology of human papillomavirus (HPV) and associated diseases, describes the licensed HPV vaccines, provides updated data from clinical trials and postlicensure safety studies, and compiles recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for use of HPV vaccines. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV types can cause cervical cancer in women as well as other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers in women and men. HPV also causes genital warts. Two HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States. Both are composed of type-specific HPV L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L1 protein using recombinant DNA technology produces noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs). Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) contains four HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. Bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) contains two HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 16 and 18. Both vaccines are administered in a 3-dose series. ACIP recommends routine vaccination with HPV4 or HPV2 for females aged 11 or 12 years and with HPV4 for males aged 11 or 12 years. Vaccination also is recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who were not vaccinated previously. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not previously vaccinated. As a compendium of all current recommendations for use of HPV vaccines, information in this report is intended for use by clinicians, vaccination providers, public health officials, and immunization program personnel as a resource. ACIP recommendations are reviewed periodically and are revised as indicated when new information and data become available.

### Factors associated with human papillomavirus vaccination completion on a catch-up schedule [^111aR8Fn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

"Catch-up vaccination" is vaccination outside of the recommended schedule and may occur between 13 and 26 years of age for human papillomavirus vaccines. We aimed to characterize those adolescents and young women who were most likely to complete the three-vaccine series on a catch-up schedule.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of adolescents and young women aged 13–26 years who initiated human papillomavirus vaccination between January 2007 and April 2009 and followed them through April 2010 for vaccine completion (n = 310). Completion was defined as receipt of three doses of the human papillomavirus vaccine. We used log binomial regression to investigate characteristics associated with vaccine completion. The main exposure was pregnancy occurring within 1 year of initiating the series. Other exposure variables included age, race, insurance, and clinical site.

Results

Fifty-six percent of participants completed the vaccine series with a mean follow-up of 2 years. After adjusting for age and site of vaccination, those who became pregnant (n = 31) were significantly less likely than those who did not to complete the series (22.6% compared with 59.9%, respectively, adjusted relative risk 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21–0.81). Race or ethnicity was also independently associated with completion, with black patients having the lowest completion rate (48% compared with 72.1% among white patients, adjusted relative risk 0.71, 95% CI 0.54–0.91).

Conclusion

Human papillomavirus vaccination completion is low among adolescents and females receiving vaccination on a catch-up schedule. Those who become pregnant may not resume the series after pregnancy. Vaccine initiation is an opportunity for contraceptive provision for adolescents and young women.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine administration trends among commercially insured US adults aged 27–45 years before and after advisory committee on immunization practices recommendation change, 2007–2020 [^115dXYXQ]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this population-based cohort study, we found that there was a statistically significant increase in the HPV vaccine administration rate after 2018 among adults aged 27 to 45 years. Women and men showed distinct patterns before 2018, majorly due to the different timings of HPV vaccine recommendations. In this hypothesis-driven analysis, the results showed that the ACIP recommendation change was statistically significantly associated with the increase in HPV vaccine administration rate in this population.

The HPV vaccination rate among those aged 9 to 26 years showed considerable disparities across racial and ethnic groups. However, this study did not find statistically significant differences in administration trends among newly recommended ages. Evidence suggests racial and ethnic disparities in HPV-associated cancer incidence. Further research is needed on how catch-up vaccination in this age group can help reduce these existing disparities.

In 2019 and 2020, those aged 31 to 45 years made up the majority of the vaccinated adults aged 27 to 45 years. This makeup was the opposite until 2018, whereas the majority of the cases were among the age group of 27- to 30-year-olds. These individuals might have missed their vaccination schedule when they were still eligible and now have received catch-up vaccination as they became eligible again. On the other hand, many of these individuals aged up to 45 years who received the vaccine were never eligible for the initial ACIP HPV-vaccine recommendation (ie, women born in 1979 or before and men born in 1984 or before). Shared decision-making may have been effective for those who were never eligible but had perceived benefits of the HPV vaccine.

The dose-specific proportions can be explained by the availability of the vaccine and the ACIP recommendation. In the US, all 2-, 4-, and 9-valent types are approved for use among women, while only 4 valent and 9 valent are approved for use in men. The 4-valent HPV vaccine has been available and recommended since 2006, and as of late 2016, only the 9-valent vaccine has been distributed in the US. Because some adults without adequate vaccination might be at risk for a new HPV infection targeted by the 9-valent vaccine, HPV vaccination may benefit these individuals.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^1125ySnB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

With regard to serious adverse events, there is a large degree of uncertainty in the evidence comparing different HPV vaccines and different dose schedules. The 'Summary of findings' tables show low numbers of serious adverse events and deaths in most included studies. Even when the total number of events is high (e.g. Joura 2015), specific events of clinical relevance are still too rare for meaningful comparative analyses. In this review, we used a composite outcome, that is, the overall frequency of serious adverse events, for each comparison, however, analyses based on a composite outcome can produce results that are difficult to interpret for several reasons. This outcome can include events that are not clinically relevant or are not biologically related to the vaccine (Lineberry 2016), occur outside a plausible time frame relative to vaccine exposure (Huang 2011), or are not based on standardised definitions (Bonhoeffer 2002). In addition, trials measure serious adverse events at different time points and there is a large variation in duration of follow‐up, which could produce misleading summary estimates (Huang 2011). Finally, there is heterogeneity among trials with regard to the age and gender of participants and clinical measurements of serious adverse events (Appendix 4). Meta‐analyses of serious adverse events, such as those presented in this review, should be considered exploratory rather than confirmatory as the analyses are not planned in advance (i.e. when the included studies were designed) (Huang 2011). Despite the uncertainty in the evidence about harms when comparing different HPV vaccines and dose schedules, a previous systematic review reported similar rates of serious adverse events when HPV vaccines were compared to control (Arbyn 2018).

Quality of the evidence

The risk of bias of the included studies in this review is generally low. We rated studies that received funding from the vaccine manufacturer as 'unclear' for the 'other risk of bias' domain. This judgement was based on the results of a systematic review which showed more favourable efficacy results and conclusions in studies sponsored by manufacturing companies (Lundh 2017). It has been suggested that industry sponsorship of studies results in overly positive results through a variety of choices in the design and conduct of the trials that leads to bias. Based on the low risk of bias in other methodological domains and adequate reporting in the trials, we did not downgrade the certainty of the evidence using GRADE for this factor. In accordance with Higgins 2017, information on industry sponsorship and other funding sources is captured in the Characteristics of included studies tables.

### Human papillomavirus vaccinations: provider education to enhance vaccine uptake [^112m4261]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the number one sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approximated that 92% of HPV-related cancers might be prevented by receiving the HPV 9-valent vaccine (Gardasil 9). The 2-dose HPV vaccine for children ages 11 to 12 years provides almost 100% protection against strains affiliated with cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers. Provider education is essential to decrease clinical knowledge deficits and increase vaccination uptake. Evidence-based provider recommendations expressed to eligible individuals improves vaccination rates. Evidence-based approaches for vaccine-hesitant parents involve using the presumptive announcement approach, asking for and addressing main concerns, and trying again if the parent initially declines. Seventy percent of parents who initially decide not to get their child vaccinated later agree to the vaccine or schedule a follow-up appointment. The CDC guidelines for HPV vaccinations, including the catch-up and adult guidelines, are reviewed. A clinical vignette with case scenarios and a Q&A quiz are included.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — ACIP ages and dosing for adolescents and people with HIV — states that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination with 9 valent HPV vaccine for all 11- or 12-year-old girls and boys, with the series able to start at age 9 years; catch-up vaccination is recommended for all 13- to 26-year-old females and all 13- to 21-year-old males who have not been vaccinated, and is also recommended for males aged 22 to 26 years who are men who have sex with men (MSM), or have HIV infection or are otherwise immunocompromised. The 9-valent vaccine should be delivered through a series of three intramuscular injections over a 6-month period, with the second and third doses given at 1 to 2 months and then 6 months after the first dose; although ACIP recommends a 2-dose schedule for adolescents initiating the vaccine series at ages 9 to 14 years, three doses of HPV vaccine (0, 1–2, and 6 months) are recommended for females and males with HIV infection or other immunosuppression because their immune response to vaccination might be attenuated.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — Individuals through age 26 should be vaccinated to prevent HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases; the current vaccine is either quadrivalent or 9-valent (9v), and those who began with bivalent or quadrivalent products may complete the series with 9v. There is no Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for additional 9v vaccination after completion with earlier products. HPV vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy; no intervention is needed if inadvertently given while pregnant, remaining doses should be delayed until after pregnancy, and pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination.

Data synthesis

When pooling was considered feasible, we employed a random‐effects meta‐analysis using the DerSimonian and Laird method (DerSimonian 1986), as it was assumed that effect size might vary across studies and settings. We used data from the last available follow‐up for clinical and adverse event outcomes, with the number of participants (rather than the number of events) used in the analysis. For immunological outcomes, we extracted data from one month after the last HPV dose and at the longest‐term follow‐up.

To assess the harms associated with the HPV vaccine comparisons in this review, we recorded the methods used in each included study to collect adverse event data, and extracted data on common events that we determined a priori as: pain, swelling, redness at the injection site and overall systemic adverse events. For all serious adverse events reported in the included studies, we extracted the number of participants, participants with events and a description of the events. We also extracted information on whether the serious adverse events were considered to be related to the vaccines. We did not conduct statistical hypothesis testing because our protocol did not prespecify hypotheses about differences in the occurrence of any specific serious adverse event.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115VTLKr]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — people with HIV: The Panel recommends that people with HIV receive a three-dose series (0, 1–2, and 6 months) because their immune response to vaccination might be attenuated (AIII), and catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for people with HIV aged 13 to 26 years (AIII). Although routine vaccination beyond age 26 is not recommended, shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for adults aged 27 to 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated and are at risk for a new HPV infection (AIII). For patients previously vaccinated with recombinant bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, some experts would give an additional full series (three doses) of the 9-valent vaccine (CIII), however no data exist to define who might benefit or how cost-effective this approach might be.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^116N9XwR]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

HPV burden of disease and impact of the vaccination program in the United States. Approximately 33,700 cancers are caused by HPV in the United States each year, including 12,900 oropharyngeal cancers among men and women, 10,800 cervical cancers among women, and 6,000 anal cancers among men and women; vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers are less common. HPV vaccination for adolescents has been routinely recommended for females since 2006 and for males since 2011. The existing HPV vaccination program for adolescents has the potential to prevent the majority of these cancers. Mean age at acquisition of causal HPV infection for cancers is unknown, but is estimated to be decades before cancer is diagnosed. In 2017, coverage with ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine was 65.5% among adolescents aged 13 through 17 years. Although coverage with the recommended number of doses remains below the Healthy People 2020 target of 80% for adolescents, the U.S. HPV vaccination program has resulted in significant declines in prevalences of vaccine-type HPV infections, anogenital warts, and cervical precancers. For example, prevalences of 4vHPV vaccine-type infection during 2013–2016, compared with those of the prevaccine era, declined from 11.5% to 1.8% among females aged 14 through 19 years and from 18.5% to 5.3% among females aged 20 through 24 years. In addition, declines have been observed among unvaccinated persons, suggesting protective herd effects.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine administration trends among commercially insured US adults aged 27–45 years before and after advisory committee on immunization practices recommendation change, 2007–2020 [^112CiYe3]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Previous studies that surveyed adults aged 27 to 45 years after the ACIP recommendation update found that the majority of these adults were likely to ask health care professionals about HPV vaccination and willing to get a vaccine if recommended by their clinician. The likelihood of receiving the HPV vaccine was highly associated with the perceived likelihood of benefiting from the vaccine. Similarly, according to a study that surveyed primary care physicians, the majority of physicians reported that they would be more likely to recommend HPV vaccination to adults aged 27 to 45 years due to the new ACIP recommendation. Evidence also supports the substantial effectiveness of patient-clinician shared decision-making in vaccination, cancer prevention, and other health outcomes in general. Especially because the HPV vaccine has been available for more than a decade, shared decision-making may benefit those interested in vaccination based on their perceived benefit but who missed their vaccination schedule or were not eligible. However, also the majority of the physician respondents were unsure of what to emphasize during the shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination. The present findings showed a statistically significant increase in HPV vaccination in this age group after the ACIP update, yet they make up very low rates. These studies together represent the great interest in HPV vaccination among both adults aged 27 to 45 years and health care professionals, as well as the potential effectiveness of their shared decision-making, though there remains a need for further research on enhancing this process (eg, decision aids).

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^113vmKnE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

We reported relative risks (ORs or RRs) in the Effects of interventions section for all relevant outcomes, but where the evidence was of very low‐certainty we reported the number of events in each group only.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We performed subgroup meta‐analyses where possible, using vaccine type, gender, and age group (9 to 15 years; 16 to 26 years) as stratifying variables.

Sensitivity analysis

We carried out one post‐hoc sensitivity analysis for outcomes using a Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratio where events were very rare (i.e. an event rate of < 1% across both trial arms). We compared the results of the primary analysis calculated with Mantel‐Haenzsel methods against those with Peto methods (Bradburn 2007). We also planned to conduct sensitivity analyses for the primary outcomes according to allocation concealment (high risk of bias, low risk of bias, and unclear risk of bias) for outcomes for which data could not be pooled because of considerable heterogeneity (I² > 75%).

Secondary outcomes

Unless otherwise stated, secondary outcomes were assessed at the longest follow‐up time reported by the included studies.

Incident infection with vaccine HPV genotypes (HPV 16 and HPV 18 jointly; HPV 6, HPV 11, HPV 16 and HPV 18 jointly; and HPV 31, HPV 33, HPV 45, HPV 52, and HPV 58 jointly)
Persistent infection (persisting for at least six months or at least 12 months) with vaccine HPV genotypes
Immunological outcomes (geometric mean titre (GMT) and seropositivity), assessed at one month following the last dose and at the longest‐term follow‐up

For the comparisons of dose schedules (i.e. number of doses and longer or shorter interval(s) between doses) we considered immunological outcomes as primary outcomes because these trials were designed to show non‐inferiority of immunogenicity. While these trials were not designed to evaluate efficacy or safety of the vaccines, we have included clinical outcomes when reported and comparative estimates of harms associated with the different dose schedules.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114JH6B7]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Preventing human papillomavirus (HPV) infection — vaccination recommendations for people with HIV state that HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, and to administer three doses of 9-valent HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9) at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months (AIII); ideally, the series should have been initiated at age 11 or 12 years but may be started as early as age 9 years, and the two-dose series is not recommended in people with HIV. For all people with HIV aged 13 to 26 years who were not vaccinated previously, administer three doses of 9-valent HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9) at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months (AIII), and the two-dose series is not recommended in people with HIV. For people with HIV aged 27 to 45 years who were not adequately vaccinated previously, HPV vaccine is not routinely recommended; instead, shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for people who may be at risk for a new HPV infection (AIII). For people who were adequately vaccinated with bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine, some experts would consider additional vaccination with 9-valent HPV vaccine, but data are lacking to define the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach (CIII). HPV vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy (CIII).

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^117GtUtk]. CA (2020). High credibility.

United States human papillomavirus (HPV)–attributable cancer burden and vaccine uptake — For the period from 2012 to 2016, an average of 34,800 cancers annually in the United States were attributable to HPV infection, and ninety-two percent of these cases (32,100) were attributable to the types targeted by the 9-valent HPV vaccine, the only vaccine formulation distributed in the United States since 2016. According to the National Immunization Survey-Teen, in 2018, 68.1% of adolescents (male and female) aged 13 to 17 years had received at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine, and 51.1% were up to date with the HPV vaccine series.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-United States, 2017 [^116owPwY]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In 2017, adolescent vaccination coverage with ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine, ≥ 1 and ≥ 2 doses of MenACWY, ≥ 2 doses of MMR, and ≥ 2 doses of VAR increased, while coverage with ≥ 1 dose of Tdap and ≥ 3 doses of HepB remained high. This report includes the first U.S. estimates of ≥ 1-dose MenB coverage. Unlike MenACWY, MenB is not routinely recommended for all adolescents, and thus, the low vaccination coverage in adolescents aged 17 years (14.5%) is not unexpected.

In December 2016, a 2-dose HPV vaccine schedule was recommended for persons starting the series at age < 15 years, based on data showing noninferior immunogenicity compared with 3 doses. This schedule might encourage on-time initiation of the series and facilitate completion; however, it is too early to assess its impact on vaccination coverage. The 5.1 percentage point annual increase in series initiation among all adolescents since 2013 is encouraging. Moreover, on-time vaccination (series completion by age 13 years) has increased approximately four percentage points in each successive birth cohort. Despite these improvements, HPV vaccination initiation remains lower than coverage with Tdap and MenACWY, suggesting ongoing challenges to providing all three vaccines during the same visit. Efforts are under way to promote and improve on-time vaccination, including implementing a new combined Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measure for adolescent vaccines that assesses receipt of all three routinely recommended adolescent vaccines, including HPV vaccine series completion by age 13 years.

### Recommendations on the use of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in males – advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2011 [^115TpL29]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

On October 25, 2011, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (HPV4; Gardasil, Merck & Co. Inc.) in males aged 11 or 12 years. ACIP also recommended vaccination with HPV4 for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series; males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. These recommendations replace the October 2009 ACIP guidance that HPV4 may be given to males aged 9 through 26 years. For these recommendations, ACIP considered information on vaccine efficacy (including data available since October 2009, on prevention of grade 2 or 3 anal intraepithelial neoplasia [AIN2/3], a precursor of anal cancer), vaccine safety, estimates of disease and cancer resulting from HPV, cost-effectiveness, and programmatic considerations. The evidence for HPV4 vaccination of males was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methods.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology statement: human papillomavirus vaccination for cancer prevention [^1155ipLf]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the leading medical professional oncology society, is committed to lessening the burden of cancer and as such will promote underused interventions that have the potential to save millions of lives through cancer prevention. As the main providers of cancer care worldwide, our patients, their families, and our communities look to us for guidance regarding all things cancer related, including cancer prevention. Through this statement and accompanying recommendations, ASCO hopes to increase awareness of the tremendous global impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) -caused cancers, refocus the discussion of HPV vaccination on its likely ability to prevent millions of cancer deaths, and increase HPV vaccination uptake via greater involvement of oncology professionals in ensuring accurate public discourse about HPV vaccination and calling for the implementation of concrete strategies to address barriers to vaccine access and acceptance.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^1117KpMp]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake and screening context — The initial uptake of the HPV vaccine was slow in the United States after FDA approval in 2006, but current enhanced dissemination efforts have resulted in steadily increasing levels of vaccination and population coverage at the recommended ages of 11 to 12 years. On the basis of the 2018 National Health Interview Survey, 39.9% of adults aged 18 to 26 years reported having received one or more doses of the HPV vaccine (53.6% of women). The most recent report from the National Immunization Survey-Teen of adolescents aged 13 to 17 years showed that coverage with one or more doses of HPV vaccine in 2018 among females and males was 68.1%, and 51.1% were up to date based on HPV vaccine recommendations. Cytology-based screening is much less efficient in vaccinated populations, as abnormal cytology disproportionately identifies minor abnormalities resulting from HPV types that are associated with lower cancer risk. There is emerging evidence on screening outcomes from other countries with higher vaccine uptake, and some preliminary data from the United States that show significant declines in cervical abnormalities in vaccinated populations, and which point to the likelihood that future recommendations for cervical cancer screening will need to incorporate HPV vaccination status.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^116GRsxu]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations approved by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the date published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Additional information about ACIP is available at.

### An update on human papillomavirus vaccination in the United States [^113eX7W8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer remains a significant disease in the United States. Although the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been approved for those aged 9–26 years and for some individuals up to age 45 years, there are many circumstances in which health care professionals may not know whether the vaccine should be recommended, such as for patients with previous infection, health care workers, and those older than age 26 years. This article highlights the evidence that the HPV vaccine is a safe and highly effective way to prevent cervical cancer, with the strongest predictor of vaccine uptake being practitioner recommendation.

### ASCCP committee opinion: adjuvant human papillomavirus vaccine for patients undergoing treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [^115y46MR]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

CURRENT GUIDELINES FOR HPV VACCINATION

The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) recommends following current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for HPV vaccination. These guidelines state that routine HPV vaccination is recommended for all individuals aged 11 to 12 years but may start at age 9. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for individuals through age 26 who were not previously vaccinated. Individuals aged between 27 and 45 years can be offered the vaccine using shared clinical decision making between providers and previously unvaccinated patients who are most likely to benefit. There are no current age-based recommendations for HPV vaccination for individuals aged older than 45 years; the vaccine is not Food and Drug Administration-approved in this age range. The HPV vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy, but is safe for use during lactation. In addition to these CDC guidelines, ASCCP issued a statement in February 2020 recommending HPV vaccination for medical professionals who are routinely exposed to the virus through their occupation.

ASCCP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSIDERATION OF ADJUVANT VACCINATION IN PREVIOUSLY UNVACCINATED INDIVIDUALS UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR CIN2+

Based on these findings, ASCCP recommends consideration of the possible benefit of adjuvant HPV vaccination in shared decision making regarding HPV vaccination for previously unvaccinated, immunocompetent individuals aged 27 to 45 years who are undergoing treatment for CIN2+ (Figure 1). The optimal timing of HPV vaccination in these individuals is not known. These individuals should be well counseled that the prophylactic vaccine will not treat existing HPV disease or prevent all future HPV-related disease. All individuals treated for CIN2+ are at risk for persistent or recurrent disease and require continued surveillance and management as per the 2019 risk-based management guidelines. The ASCCP recommendations may change based on findings from ongoing and future clinical trials.

### Variation in human papillomavirus vaccination effectiveness in the US by age at vaccination [^1166Xf8L]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination at ages 9 to 12 yearsas protection against HPV types 16 and 18 (HPV-16/18), the genotypes in 70% of cervical cancers. Although the importance of vaccination uptake is well known, vaccination often occurs later than recommended. Recent studies have documented the effectiveness of early-age vaccination for reducing cervical precancer and cancer incidence. We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)to estimate the proportion of female individuals who were vaccinated before sexual debut, assess the association of delayed vaccination with HPV-16/18 prevalence, and quantify potential racial and ethnic disparities in timely vaccination.

### HPV vaccination recommendations… [^111GqQsK]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaccination Recommendations
- HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years.
- ACIP also recommends vaccination for everyone through age 26 years if not adequately vaccinated when younger. HPV vaccination is given as a series of either two or three doses, depending on age at initial vaccination.
- Vaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years. Some adults ages 27 through 45 years might decide to get the HPV vaccine based on discussion with their clinician, if they did not get adequately vaccinated when they were younger. HPV vaccination of people in this age range provides less benefit, for several reasons, including that more people in this age range have already been exposed to HPV.
- For adults ages 27 through 45 years, clinicians can consider discussing HPV vaccination with people who are most likely to benefit. HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most adults over age 26 years.

See ACIP's shared clinical decision-making FAQs. Keep in mind that HPV vaccination prevents new HPV infections but does not treat existing HPV infections or diseases. HPV vaccine works best when given before any exposure to HPV. Dosing Schedules Two doses of HPV vaccine are recommended for most persons starting the series before their 15 th birthday.
- The second dose of HPV vaccine should be given 6 to 12 months after the first dose.
- Adolescents who receive two doses less than 5 months apart will require a third dose of HPV vaccine. Three doses of HPV vaccine are recommended for teens and young adults who start the series at ages 15 through 26 years, and for immunocompromised persons.
- The recommended three-dose schedule is 0, 1–2 and 6 months.
- Three doses are recommended for immunocompromised persons aged 9 through 26 years. Vaccine Safety HPV vaccines are very safe.

Scientific research shows the benefits of HPV vaccination far outweigh the potential risks. Like all medical interventions, vaccines can have some side effects. All vaccines used in the United States, including HPV vaccines, go through extensive safety testing before the U. S. Food and Drug Administration licenses them. During clinical trials before the licensure, the 9-valent HPV vaccine Gardasil 9 was studied in more than 15, 000 males and females and was found to be safe and effective.

Key points
- CDC recommends HPV vaccine for children 11 or 12 years old to protect against HPV infections that can cause some cancers later in life.
- HPV vaccination can be started at age 9 and is recommended through age 26 years for those who weren't vaccinated earlier. Introduction More than 15 years of data show that HPV vaccination provides safe, effective, and long-lasting protection against cancers caused by HPV infections. Research shows that healthcare professionals are parents' most trusted source of information about the HPV vaccine. CDC encourages healthcare professionals to recommend HPV vaccination in the same way and on the same day that they recommend other vaccines for adolescents. This page summarizes CDC's current HPV vaccine recommendations. Access the official, full text below: Routine recommendations

### HPV vaccination… [^112Mmfqf]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Protect your child from certain cancers later in life with HPV vaccine.
- CDC recommends 2 doses of HPV vaccine at ages 11–12 years. HPV vaccination can be started at age 9 years. Introduction HPV vaccination provides safe, effective, and lasting protection against the HPV infections that most commonly cause cancer. The HPV vaccine series is most effective when given before a person is exposed to the virus. Every year in the United States, HPV causes about 36, 000 cases of cancer in both men and women. Keep Reading: Reasons to Get Vaccinated. Recommendations Children ages 11–12 years should get 2 doses of HPV vaccine, given 6 to 12 months apart. HPV vaccines can be given starting at age 9. Only 2 doses are needed if the first dose was given before 15th birthday. Children 9–14 years old who have received 2 doses of HPV vaccine less than 5 months apart will need a third dose.

People 15–26 years old who start the series later need 3 doses of HPV vaccine.
- The doses are given over 6 months.
- If your teen isn't vaccinated yet, talk to their doctor about doing so as soon as possible. People with weakened immune systems should get 3 doses if they are 9–26 years old. Who should get vaccinated
- HPV vaccination is recommended at ages 11–12 years. HPV vaccines can be given starting at age 9 years. All preteens need HPV vaccination, so they are protected from HPV infections that can cause cancer later in life.
- Teens and young adults through age 26 years who didn't start or finish the HPV vaccine series also need HPV vaccination. The vaccine is safe and effective HPV vaccination works extremely well. HPV vaccine has the potential to prevent more than 90% of cancers caused by HPV.
- Fewer teens and young adults are getting genital warts.
- HPV vaccination has also reduced the number of cases of pre-cancers of the cervix in young women.
- The protection provided by HPV vaccines lasts a long time. People who received HPV vaccines were followed for at least about 12 years, and their protection against HPV has remained high with no evidence of decreasing over time. To prevent fainting and injuries from fainting, teens should be seated or lying down during vaccination; they should also do the same for 15 minutes after getting the shot.
