## Question

Fruity odor

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of a "fruity odor" on breath, how to identify and prioritize them, and what management steps and differentials to consider. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what volatile chemicals typically cause a "fruity" smell and why. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential of diseases and exposures that produce that odor. Next, I will correlate the odor with bedside signs and lab patterns to differentiate emergencies from less urgent causes. After that, I should outline immediate actions and testing, including pitfalls and confounders. Finally, I will synthesize a concise clinical takeaway with key distinguishing features and when to escalate care.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical basis of a "fruity" breath odor. I initially think of acetaldehyde as the prototypical fruity-smelling aldehyde, but wait, let me verify that against toxicology sources and the classic medical contexts that use the descriptor. The NIOSH entry describes acetaldehyde as a colorless liquid or gas with a pungent, fruity odor, supporting its relevance in chemical exposures, yet in clinical practice the term "fruity breath" most commonly signals acetone due to ketogenesis in DKA and related states, with sevoflurane also described as having a nonpungent odor relevant to anesthesia contexts, so I should correct myself to emphasize acetone and related ketones while still keeping acetaldehyde and sevoflurane on the differential depending on context [^111FWE5i] [^115Qzehv] [^1174Euhp] [^113GTtep].

> Next, I should review the most urgent and common cause, diabetic ketoacidosis, and verify the pathophysiology linking insulin deficiency, lipolysis, and acetone generation. DKA arises from absolute or relative insulin deficiency with counterregulatory hormone excess, increasing fatty acid oxidation and producing acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone; acetone is volatile and responsible for the characteristic fruity or sweet "pear drop" breath, which is repeatedly cited in clinical studies and patient-facing drug labels and guidelines, and may coexist with Kussmaul respirations and altered mental status, so fruity breath in a person with diabetes is a red flag for DKA until proven otherwise [^1174Euhp] [^116vd5L3] [^114RB2bX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Euglycemic DKA and medication-associated DKA can present with fruity breath even when glucose is near-normal, so I need to check for SGLT2 inhibitor use and consider atypical triggers. SGLT2 inhibitors increase DKA risk in certain settings and can produce euglycemic DKA, so I should confirm agent exposure, recent insulin changes, acute illness, dehydration, surgery, or carbohydrate restriction, and maintain a low threshold to check ketones when the patient is unwell despite non-severe hyperglycemia [^112eTxUc] [^112Ktoh3] [^116qqmo4].

> I will now examine other metabolic emergencies that can mimic or overlap with DKA. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state and acute liver failure deserve consideration. HHS may rarely show acetone on breath and is classically marked by extreme hyperglycemia, high osmolality, and dehydration without prominent ketoacidosis, while acute liver failure can produce fruity breath in the setting of lactic acidosis and encephalopathy, so I should confirm plasma glucose, osmolality, anion gap, lactate, and liver function tests to differentiate these entities at the bedside [^116UJ3X3] [^116sBqrG].

> But wait, what if the patient has no diabetes or ketoacidosis? I should review toxicologic causes where a fruity or sweet odor reflects a specific chemical exposure. Isopropanol poisoning produces acetone via alcohol dehydrogenase, yielding fruity breath and an elevated osmolal gap without a primary metabolic acidosis, so history of ingestion or access to rubbing alcohol plus an osmol gap and ketonemia without acidemia should prompt consideration of hemodialysis in severe cases [^111jo1ZN].

> I need to ensure I also consider nitrogen mustard exposure. HN-2 is described as having a fruity odor at high concentrations with delayed and progressive mucosal and airway injury, so an unusual fruity smell in a potential chemical exposure scenario, even without immediate severe symptoms, warrants decontamination and prolonged observation for evolving airway damage [^117QwzMx].

> Let me think about medication effects that patients might describe as fruity breath. Diazoxide, used for refractory hypoglycemia, lists increased urinary frequency, thirst, and fruity breath odor among adverse effects, so confirming drug exposure and monitoring blood glucose and ketones during therapy is prudent, especially under stress conditions [^113wrP8k] [^114oGozb].

> I should also consider physiologic and iatrogenic ketosis states. Nutritional ketosis from low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diets, fasting, and exercise can raise breath acetone into ranges detectable as a sweet or fruity odor without the acidosis or illness of DKA, and DMSO bladder instillations can impart a garlic-like odor to breath and skin for up to 72 hours, which patients may mislabel, so I need to check diet, fasting, recent procedures, and the exact quality of the odor before attributing it to ketoacidosis [^113GTtep] [^112UUtXT] [^113tdDp9] [^115o8hdq].

> Next, I should review bedside diagnostic patterns that help me distinguish among these possibilities. Fruity breath with Kussmaul respirations, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and ketonemia/ketonuria points strongly to DKA. Fruity breath with an elevated osmolal gap, ketonemia, and minimal acidosis favors isopropanol poisoning. Fruity or sweet odor with very high glucose and high effective osmolality but limited ketoacidosis suggests HHS. And fruity or musty odors with jaundice, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy raise concern for acute liver failure, so I should double-check these labs in parallel with the history and exam [^1174Euhp] [^111jo1ZN] [^116UJ3X3] [^116sBqrG].

> I should confirm immediate actions and safety steps. If DKA is suspected, I need to ensure IV access, initiate isotonic fluids, start an insulin infusion, monitor electrolytes including potassium closely, and arrange continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring. If the patient is drowsy or vomiting, I should secure the airway proactively and anticipate frequent neurologic checks and laboratory reassessment. For suspected isopropanol poisoning with severe CNS depression or hemodynamic instability, I should consider early nephrology consultation for hemodialysis. And for suspected HN-2 exposure, immediate decontamination and observation for evolving airway injury are essential even if initial symptoms are mild [^114RB2bX] [^111jo1ZN] [^117QwzMx].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic testing that will sharpen the differential. I need a basic metabolic panel for glucose, electrolytes, bicarbonate, and anion gap, serum ketones or β-hydroxybutyrate, urine ketones, arterial or venous blood gas for pH and lactate, osmolality and calculated osmolal gap, liver function tests and INR if liver failure is on the table, and a thorough medication and diet history including SGLT2 inhibitors, diazoxide, and any recent fasting or low-carb patterns; in children with new-onset diabetes, the presence of fruity breath significantly increases the likelihood of DKA and should heighten urgency [^1174Euhp] [^112jTeyG] [^114Ru4w3].

> Hold on, I should verify common confounders that can mislead. Breath odor assessment is subjective and subject to olfactory fatigue and cognitive bias, and patients may misattribute garlic or chemical smells as fruity, so I need to correlate objective findings with history. Similarly, a positive breath odor for alcohol does not reliably distinguish isopropanol from ethanol, making osmolal gap and ketone/acid-base pattern crucial. And while "fruity urine" is sometimes reported, the pathognomonic bedside sign in DKA is the fruity breath from acetone, not the urine odor, so I should not over-interpret urine smell alone [^114Tap9u] [^111jo1ZN] [^1174Euhp].

> Let me reconsider pediatric nuances briefly. In children, fruity breath and Kussmaul respirations are classic DKA features, and case series of non-diabetic ketoacidosis describe a "rotten apple" smell with Kussmaul breathing, reinforcing that any child with abnormal respirations and fruity or acetone-smelling breath warrants urgent evaluation for ketosis and its underlying cause [^115TPuoS] [^115ZMp87].

> I should double-check the key takeaways so I do not miss an emergency. Fruity or sweet-smelling breath most commonly reflects acetone in DKA but can also indicate isopropanol poisoning, HHS, acute liver failure, medication effects like diazoxide, or physiologic ketosis; Kussmaul respirations, anion gap acidosis, and ketonemia together make DKA most likely, whereas a high osmolal gap with ketonemia and minimal acidosis points to isopropanol, and very high glucose with high osmolality and limited ketoacidosis favors HHS; any fruity breath in a person with diabetes, on SGLT2 therapy, or with altered mental status should trigger immediate evaluation and treatment while confirmatory testing is pursued [^1174Euhp] [^116UJ3X3] [^111jo1ZN] [^112eTxUc].

Fruity odor on breath most often reflects **acetone from ketosis** [^113GTtep], especially in **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** [^1174Euhp] or fasting/low-carb diets [^112qAEKt]. It can also arise from **isopropanol poisoning** [^111jo1ZN] (metabolized to acetone), **nitrogen mustard exposure** [^117QwzMx], or certain medications (e.g. diazoxide) [^113wrP8k]. In children, it is a classic sign of **DKA** [^115TPuoS] and should prompt **urgent evaluation**. Fruity odor is a key clinical clue, but **confirm with ketone testing** and assess for underlying causes.

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can produce fruity breath odor:

- **Ketone production**: In insulin deficiency or low-carb diets, fatty acid oxidation yields acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone [^113GTtep]; acetone is volatile and exhaled, causing the fruity odor [^113GTtep].

- **Alcohol metabolism**: Isopropanol is metabolized to acetone, causing fruity breath without metabolic acidosis [^111jo1ZN].

- **Chemical exposure**: Nitrogen mustard (HN-2) has a fruity odor at high concentrations [^117QwzMx].

- **Medication-induced ketosis**: Diazoxide can cause hyperglycemia and ketosis, producing fruity breath [^113wrP8k].

## Clinical conditions associated with fruity odor

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) | Insulin deficiency → ketone production | - Fruity breath <br/> - Polyuria <br/> - Polydipsia <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Kussmaul respirations <br/> - Altered mental status [^1174Euhp] |
| Isopropanol poisoning | Isopropanol → acetone | - Fruity breath <br/> - CNS depression <br/> - Gastritis <br/> - Ketosis without metabolic acidosis [^111jo1ZN] |
| Nitrogen mustard exposure | Chemical odor | - Fruity odor <br/> - Delayed mucosal injury <br/> - Respiratory symptoms [^117QwzMx] |
| Diazoxide-induced hyperglycemia | Hyperglycemia → ketosis | - Fruity breath <br/> - Hyperglycemia <br/> - Ketosis [^113wrP8k] |
| Fasting or low-carbohydrate diets | Increased fat metabolism → ketosis | - Fruity breath <br/> - Mild ketosis <br/> - No acidosis [^112qAEKt] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When fruity odor is detected, **the following diagnostic steps are recommended**:

- **Clinical history**: Onset, duration, diet, medications, diabetes history, chemical exposures.

- **Physical examination**: Look for dehydration, respiratory patterns, mental status, and abdominal findings [^117XmUjC].

- **Laboratory tests**: Serum glucose, electrolytes, bicarbonate, anion gap, ketones (β-hydroxybutyrate), blood gas analysis, and isopropanol levels if suspected [^113PehAx] [^111jo1ZN].

- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray or CT if chemical exposure or respiratory involvement is suspected.

---

## Clinical significance and implications

Fruity odor is a **valuable clinical sign** that can indicate serious conditions such as DKA, isopropanol poisoning, or chemical exposure. Prompt recognition and evaluation are essential to prevent complications and guide appropriate management.

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **DKA**: Intravenous fluids, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement, and close monitoring [^116BmDT2].

- **Isopropanol poisoning**: Supportive care, gastric lavage, and hemodialysis in severe cases [^111jo1ZN].

- **Chemical exposure**: Immediate decontamination, supportive care, and specific antidotes if available [^117QwzMx].

- **Medication-induced ketosis**: Discontinuation of the offending medication and management of hyperglycemia [^116qqmo4].

---

Fruity odor on breath is a **key clinical clue** most often due to acetone from ketosis, especially in DKA or fasting/low-carb diets. It can also result from isopropanol, nitrogen mustard, or certain drugs. In children, it is a classic sign of DKA and warrants urgent evaluation. Confirm with ketone testing and address the underlying cause.

### Designing novel "Smell-aids" to improve olfactory function in post COVID-19 era [^112ihvoh]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The sense of smell starts with inhaling or sniffing volatile chemical molecules through airflow to the olfactory epithelium, which is confined to a remote and small region in the superior human nasal cavity. A sufficient amount of odorant delivered from the ambient environment to the olfactory epithelium is likely a critical prerequisite for normal olfactory function. Yet, less than 15% of the air inhaled during a normal breath reaches the olfactory epithelium. One would propose that we can potentially enhance the amount of nasal airflow to the olfactory region to improve olfactory functions. This may be an effective approach for patients with nasal obstruction and insufficient airflow to the olfaction region to begin with, but could extend to patients with sensorineural causes of smell losses, such as post-COVID-19. Analogously, hearing aids serve as crucial therapeutic and symptom management devices for individuals with conductive and/or sensorineural hearing losses. However, no noninvasive technique currently exists to achieve that for olfaction. One reason is that the impact of the complex nasal cavity anatomy on nasal airflow is relatively unclear, and the degree of variation in olfactory acuity that the conductive factors can account for has not been entirely determined. Previously, research using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling showed that airflow travels along the path of least resistance and is easily redistributed if one path is altered; and depending on the location, relatively minor changes in key nasal regions may dramatically alter airflow distribution and significantly impact the ability of odorant molecules to reach the olfactory epithelium without affecting total nasal airflow rate.

To fill this gap, in this report, we attempt to design a "Smell-Aid" using two creative inventions: (1) a nasal foam plug with a diagonally embedded air channel that, based on our CFD simulation, would direct more odorant delivery to the olfactory region; (2) a nasal clip modifying the key nasal region identified in previous CFD studies that may intensify the nasal airflow vortex towards the olfactory region. We then tested the efficacy of such designs among healthy controls with varying baseline olfactory sensitivities as well as among patients with confirmed olfactory losses of broad etiologies, including COVID-19-related losses.

COVID-19 and COPD — People with COPD presenting with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, and/or any other symptoms that could be COVID-19 related, even if these are mild, should be tested for possible infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients should keep taking their oral and inhaled respiratory medications for COPD as directed, and physical distancing and shielding, or sheltering-in-place, should not lead to social isolation and inactivity; patients should stay in contact with their friends and families by telecommunication and continue to keep active, and they should also ensure they have enough medication. Patients should be encouraged to use reputable resources for medical information regarding COVID-19 and its management, and guidance for remote (phone/virtual/online) COPD patient follow-up and a printable checklist are provided. Differentiating the symptoms of COVID-19 infection from the usual symptoms of COPD can be challenging; cough and breathlessness are found in over 60% of patients with COVID-19 and are usually also accompanied by fever (> 60% of patients). In COVID-19 symptoms may be mild at first, but rapid deterioration in lung function may occur, and a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 needs to be maintained in people with COPD who present with symptoms of an exacerbation, especially if accompanied by fever, impaired taste or smell or GI complaints. Persistent symptoms in people with COPD may cause diagnostic difficulty: approximately 10–20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop persistent symptoms with 25–45% experiencing dyspnea at 6–9 months after the acute infection and approximately 20% at 9–12 months.

### Significance of hydrogen breath tests in children with suspected carbohydrate malabsorption [^1172L3Yj]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrogen breath tests (HBT) are noninvasive investigations frequently used in pediatric gastroenterology. The range of diseases that can be identified include carbohydrate intolerance, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and orocecal transit time. In the normal individual, gut bacteria are primarily located in the colon and the distal small intestine. When defective sugar absorption is present, unabsorbed carbohydrates make up the substrate for the saccharolitic flora of the colon. Short-chain fatty acids and gases (e.g. hydrogen [H 2], methane [CH 4]) are formed from the metabolism of this flora. Human cells do not produce H 2 and CH 4. The rationale of HBT is based on the concept that part of the gas produced by colonic bacterial fermentation diffuses into the blood and is excreted by breath, where it can be quantified easily by chromatography.

Lactose maldigestion occurs when lactose is not hydrolyzed in the small intestine. It passes into the colon and through increased fluid secretion and gas production can lead to symptoms of lactose intolerance including abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, bloating, nausea or vomiting. In some cases subjects can present with constipation and others are detected only because their weight gain is inadequate. A diagnosis of lactose intolerance in children requires exclusion of other clinical diagnoses such as allergy to cow's milk proteins or other foods, or intolerance to other disaccharidases. The HBT with lactose is still considered to be the most reliable, noninvasive and economical technique to measure lactose maldigestion.

Fructose is a monosaccharide occurring naturally in its free form or as sucrose (glucose plus fructose) and it is absorbed by carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion. Fructose is widely used as a sweetener in foods, beverages, and candy, and it is also present in a variety of fruits. Ingestion of high levels of fructose can lead to carbohydrate intolerance and may results in nonspecific diarrhea, excessive intestinal gas, and recurrent abdominal pain. Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol widespread in plants, particularly in fruits and juices. Sorbitol is normally only partially absorbed and simultaneous ingestion of sorbitol and fructose seems to increase malabsorption of the latter. Methodology and interpretation of results are similar to HBT with lactose. However, the role of HBT with fructose and sorbitol is uncertain and to date often not recommended in clinical practice.

Airway respiratory irritants — Patient safety considerations: Generally, speaking to patients with exposure to highly soluble airway/respiratory irritants you will find that they have self-extricated due to the warning properties such as the smell, rapidity of onset of irritation, and other symptoms. The less soluble agents may generate only an odor (e.g., mowed hay smell for Phosgene) and will have delayed serious symptoms such as acute pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and shortness of breath with minimal exertion.

### Reporter phage and breath tests: emerging phenotypic assays for diagnosing active tuberculosis, antibiotic resistance, and treatment efficacy [^114L7FVv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The rapid and accurate diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) and its drug susceptibility remain a challenge. Phenotypic assays allow determination of antibiotic susceptibilities even if sequence data are not available or informative. We review 2 emerging diagnostic approaches, reporter phage and breath tests, both of which assay mycobacterial metabolism. The reporter phage signal, Green fluorescent protein (GFP) or β-galactosidase, indicates transcription and translation inside the recipient bacilli and its attenuation by antibiotics. Different breath tests assay, (1) exhaled antigen 85, (2) mycobacterial urease activity, and (3) detection by trained rats of disease-specific odor in sputum, have also been developed. When compared with culture, reporter phage assays shorten the time for initial diagnosis of drug susceptibility by several days. Both reporter phage and breath tests have promise as early markers to determine the efficacy of treatment. While sputum often remains smear and Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA positive early in the course of efficacious antituberculous treatment, we predict that both breath and phage tests will rapidly become negative. If this hypothesis proves correct, phage assays and breath tests could become important surrogate markers in early bactericidal activity (EBA) studies of new antibiotics.

### Hypogeusia as the initial presenting symptom of COVID-19 [^117RWPzG]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 59-year-old African–American female presented to our institution by ambulance on 29 March 2020, secondary to several days of shortness of breath, fatigue and loss of appetite. Medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and asthma, requiring infrequent use of albuterol reported less than one time per month. Social history was notable only for a remote history of tobacco abuse, but she denied any current tobacco, drug or alcohol use. Of note, the patient did endorse that her husband, whom she lives with at home, was complaining of shortness of breath and a non-productive cough several days prior to her arrival. Her husband's symptoms lasted only 3–4 days and had resolved completely. She reported no past otolaryngological surgeries or use of any nasal sprays, or homeopathic or herbal medications.

Roughly a week prior to admission, the patient began to experience a subtle decrease in appetite and disinterest in food. These symptoms were isolated and preceded any indication that she was ill. Over the week prior to her presentation, the foods she normally enjoys tasted 'bland and metallic'. The patient described her diet as 'varied and including many spices and strong flavours, particularly using herbs in Jamaican and Caribbean cuisines'. When questioned further, she also admitted to a slowly diminishing ability to smell that progressed to complete anosmia in the absence of congestion or any other nasal symptoms. However, she did not make the connection to this early symptom and the subsequent respiratory distress until specifically questioned. She noted in particular that when preparing her normal meals, she could no longer appreciate any of the typical culinary aromas. Further, she could not smell any of her scented candles but did not think anything of it at that time. The patient denied any history of hyposmia or anosmia prior to this. It was not until a few days later when she developed a non-productive cough, malaise, shortness of breath and chest tightness that ultimately prompted her to call 911. On transit to the hospital via ambulance, the patient had an initial SpO 2 of 68% on room air, and she was later placed on supplemental oxygen.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^117BjDWE]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing asthma in children aged 5 years and under

It can be challenging to make the diagnosis of asthma in some children aged ≤ 5 years. Recurrent wheezing is very common in this age group, including in children without asthma, typically with viral upper respiratory tract infections. Routine assessment of airflow limitation or bronchodilator responsiveness in this age group is difficult and is not practical in primary care.

Asthma diagnosis in children aged ≤ 5 years can be based on symptom patterns, the presence of risk factors, therapeutic response to controller treatment, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses

A diagnosis of asthma in young children with a history of wheezing is more likely if they have wheezing or coughing that occurs with exercise, laughing or crying, or in the absence of an apparent respiratory infection, a history of other allergic disease (eczema, food allergy, or allergic rhinitis), atopy or asthma in first-degree relatives, clinical improvement during 2–3 months of controller treatment, and worsening after cessation.

The following questions can be used to elicit features suggestive of asthma in young children and features that help support the diagnosis:
Does your child have wheezing? Wheezing is a high-pitched noise that comes from the chest and not the throat. Use of a video questionnaire, or asking a parent to record an episode on a smartphone if available can help to confirm the presence of wheeze and differentiate from upper airway abnormalities.
Does your child wake up at night because of coughing, wheezing, or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or breathlessness?
Does your child have to stop running, or play less hard, because of coughing, wheezing or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or shortness of breath?
Does your child cough, wheeze or get difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or shortness of breath when laughing, crying, playing with animals, or when exposed to strong smells or smoke?
Has your child ever had eczema, or been diagnosed with allergy to foods?
Has anyone in your close family had asthma, hay fever, food allergy, eczema, or any other disease with breathing problems?

In preschool children with wheeze, phenotypes have been proposed based on short-term symptom patternsor on symptom pattern trends over time –, but these have not proved to be clinically useful or accurate in predicting asthma in later childhood.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with mild traumatic brain injury: approved by ACEP board of directors, February 1, 2023 clinical policy endorsed by the emergency nurses association (April 5, 2023) [^113dmcJv]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury — intoxication and decision rule performance: The NOC included drug or alcohol intoxication as a higher-risk feature, defined by history or by examination findings such as speech changes or odor on breath, whereas the CCHR and the NEXUS Head CT did not rely specifically on intoxication but instead on a GCS score of < 15 or an abnormal level of alertness. In a Class III prospective cohort of intoxicated adults with minor head injury, 283 patients with GCS ≥ 14 (majority GCS 15 [80%]) had clinically important injuries in 23 patients (8% [95% CI 5% to 12%]). In this cohort, the CCHR sensitivity was 70% (95% CI 47% to 87%) and the NEXUS Head CT sensitivity was 83% (95% CI 61% to 95%); accordingly, the absence of high-risk criteria in these tools cannot alone eliminate the need for CT in intoxicated patients.

### Isopropanol poisoning [^111jo1ZN]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Isopropanol is a clear, colorless liquid with a fruity odor and a mild bitter taste. Most commonly found domestically as rubbing alcohol, isopropanol is also found in numerous household and commercial products including cleaners, disinfectants, antifreezes, cosmetics, solvents, inks, and pharmaceuticals.

Aim

The aim of this review is to critically review the epidemiology, toxicokinetics, mechanisms of toxicity, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of isopropanol poisoning.

Methods

OVID MEDLINE and ISI Web of Science were searched to November 2013 using the words "isopropanol", "isopropyl alcohol", "2-propanol", "propan-2-ol", and "rubbing alcohol" combined with the keywords "poisoning", "poison", "toxicity", "ingestion", "adverse effects", "overdose", or "intoxication". These searches identified 232 citations, which were then screened via their abstract to identify relevant articles referring specifically to the epidemiology, toxicokinetics, mechanisms of toxicity, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of isopropanol poisoning; 102 were relevant. Further information was obtained from book chapters, relevant news reports, and internet resources. These additional searches produced eight non-duplicate relevant citations.

Epidemiology

The majority of isopropanol exposures are unintentional and occur in children less than 6 years of age. Although isopropanol poisoning appears to be a reasonably common occurrence, deaths are rare.

Toxicokinetics

Isopropanol is rapidly absorbed following ingestion with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 30 min. It can also be absorbed following inhalation or dermal exposure. Isopropanol is widely distributed with a volume of distribution of 0.45–0.55 L/kg. Isopropanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetone, acetol and methylglyoxal, propylene glycol, acetate, and formate with conversion of these metabolites to glucose and other products of intermediary metabolism. The elimination of isopropanol is predominantly renal, though some pulmonary excretion of isopropanol and acetone occurs. In one case 20% of the absorbed dose was eliminated unchanged in urine, with the remainder excreted as acetone and metabolites of acetone. The elimination half-life of isopropanol is between 2.5 and 8.0 h, whereas elimination of acetone is slower with a half-life following isopropanol ingestion of between 7.7 and 27 h.

Mechanisms Of Toxicity

While the exact mechanism of action of isopropanol has not been fully elucidated, brain stem depression is thought to be the predominant mechanism. While the clinical effects are thought to be mostly due to isopropanol, acetone may also contribute.

Clinical Features

The major features of severe poisoning are due to CNS and respiratory depression, shock, and circulatory collapse. The most common metabolic effects are an increased osmol (osmolal) gap, ketonemia, and ketonuria. Diagnosis. Poisoning can be diagnosed using the measurement of isopropanol serum concentrations, though these may not be readily available. Diagnosis is therefore more typically made on the basis of the patient's history and clinical presentation. An osmol gap, ketonemia, and/or ketonuria without metabolic acidosis, along with a fruity or sweet odor on the breath and CNS depression support the diagnosis. Management. Supportive care is the mainstay of management with primary emphasis on respiratory and cardiovascular support. Hemodialysis enhances elimination of isopropanol and acetone and should be considered in very severe poisoning.

Conclusions

Severe isopropanol poisoning results in CNS and respiratory depression and circulatory collapse. Treatment primarily consists of symptom-directed supportive care. Although hemodialysis increases the elimination of isopropanol and acetone substantially, it should only be considered in severe life-threatening poisonings. Patients usually make a full recovery provided they receive prompt supportive care.

### Inhaled menthol for dyspnea relief during cycle exercise in COPD: a randomized trial [^112gKRiz]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Menthol inhalation (MI) lowers dyspnea ratings during loaded breathing in COPD and cycle exercise in healthy adults. Proposed mechanisms include stimulation of cold receptors in the upper airways, modulating perception of breathing-related effort, and airflow.

Research Question

Does MI also alleviate exertional dyspnea in COPD?

Study Design and Methods

Twenty patients with COPD (60% male; mean age ± SD, 68 ± 6 years; FEV 1, 47% ± 17% predicted) completed 2 constant-load cycle exercise tests (73% ± 7% peak power output) to exhaustion with menthol or placebo (strawberry flavoring) added to the breathing circuit in counterbalanced order and on separate days. Ventilatory and neuromuscular parameters were measured continuously. Dyspnea intensity was serially assessed using the 0 to 10 category ratio Borg scale, and dyspnea unpleasantness and related sensory qualities were assessed using the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile at end exercise. Participants were asked in which test their inspiratory airflow felt easier.

Results

Serial dyspnea intensity ratings were lower with menthol vs placebo (estimate [Δ/10% peak time]: -0.09; 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.02; p = 0.01), whereas ratings of dyspnea unpleasantness, air hunger, and mental breathing effort were lower at end exercise (all P < .05). Menthol-related improvements in dyspnea intensity at symptom limitation of the shorter test vs equivalent time on the other were correlated with higher endurance time (r = -0.73, P < .001). There were no differences in ventilatory and neuromuscular parameters (P > .05). Exercise endurance time was unaffected by menthol (Δ, 0.3 ± 1.6 minutes with menthol vs placebo; p = 0.50). A total of 85% reported easier inspiratory airflow with menthol.

Interpretation

MI may be useful for management of exertional dyspnea in selected patients with COPD. Future work should investigate if MI can improve outcomes of exercise rehabilitation programs.

### Measuring breath acetone for monitoring fat loss: review [^112qAEKt]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Like carbon dioxide, acetone is a by‐product of metabolism. By itself, the presence of acetone in exhaled breath does not indicate underlying disease. Low concentrations (1 to 2 ppm) of breath acetone represent a basal level of ketosis. High levels of breath acetone (75 to 1,250 ppm), associated with diabetic ketoacidosis, represent the other end of the breath acetone spectrum. Between these extremes lie healthy individuals participating in high‐fat, low‐carbohydrate (HFLC) diets, calorie restriction diets, and fasting. Their BrAce can span two orders of magnitude (Figure 1).

Within that intermediate group are individuals on HFLC diets in which the macronutrient composition (i.e. fat, carbohydrate, and protein) is altered relative to the standard mixed diet. In non‐diabetic subjects, the dietary composition appears to have the greatest impact on BrAce relative to the other factors reviewed. This factor has the greatest impact because acetone is produced when fat is metabolized; increased fat metabolism causes increased acetone production. Eating a standard mixed diet will result in a basal ketosis and BrAce of 1 to 2 ppm. Changing to a HFLC diet (carbohydrate intake < 50 g day −1) causes the body to shift from using carbohydrates to using fats as its primary energy source. Relying on fats as the primary energy source increases ketosis levels to what has been termed "nutritional ketosis". Adults in nutritional ketosis have BOHB ranging from 0.5‐3.0 mM 13, 14, 20, which corresponds to a breath acetone range of 4 to 30 ppm (Figure 2). As important, nutritional ketosis resulting from a HFLC diet increases fat oxidation rates as compared to a standard mixed diet because the primary energy substrate is fat 50.

### Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis: a prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^1174Euhp]. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (2015). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetic ketoacidosis:

- **Definition**: DKA is an acute metabolic complication occurring mostly in patients with T1DM, characterized by a triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased levels of counterregulatory hormones, typically ocurring at the time of new diagnosis of untreated T1DM or due to inadequate insulin therapy, infection (such as pneumonia, UTI, sepsis), concomitant medications (corticosteroids, SGLT-2 inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, sympathomimetics, certain antipsychotics), illicit drug use, surgery, trauma, physiologic stress, or pregnancy.
- **Epidemiology**: The age-adjusted hospitalization rate for DKA in the US was estimated at 6.3% annually in 2014, with an in-hospital case fatality of 0.4%. The rate of hopsitalization for DKA per 10,000 admissions was reported as 53.4 in 2014 and 61.6 in 2017.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include inconsistent caloric intake, poor medication adherence, poor glucose control, alcohol use, and dehydration.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, weight loss, polyphagia, fruity odor of breath, dyspnea, tachypnea, Kussmaul breathing, hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Laboratory findings in DKA include hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia/ketonuria.

### Diazoxide (Proglycem) [^113wrP8k]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Treatment with PROGLYCEM should be initiated under close clinical supervision, with careful monitoring of blood glucose and clinical response until the patient's condition has stabilized. This usually requires several days. If not effective in 2 to 3 weeks, discontinue PROGLYCEM.

Prolonged treatment requires regular monitoring of urine glucose and ketones, especially under stress conditions. Advise patients to promptly report any abnormalities to their healthcare provider. Periodically monitor blood glucose to determine the need for dosage adjustment.

Consider the effects of PROGLYCEM on the hematopoietic system and the level of serum uric acid; the latter should be considered particularly in patients with hyperuricemia or a history of gout.

Since the plasma half-life of diazoxide is prolonged in patients with impaired renal function, a reduced dosage should be considered. Serum electrolyte levels should also be evaluated for such patients.

The antihypertensive effect of other drugs may be enhanced by PROGLYCEM, and this should be kept in mind when administering it concomitantly with antihypertensive agents.

Because of the protein binding, administration of PROGLYCEM with coumarin anticoagulants or its derivatives may require reduction in the dosage of the anticoagulant, although there has been no reported evidence of excessive anticoagulant effect. In addition, PROGLYCEM may displace bilirubin from albumin; consider this when treating newborns with increased bilirubinemia.

Pulmonary hypertension has been reported in neonates and young infants treated with diazoxide (see WARNINGS).

Information for Patients

Advise patients of the need for periodic laboratory testing during treatment with PROGLYCEM. In addition, advise patients to:

take PROGLYCEM on a regular schedule as prescribed, not to skip doses, not to take extra doses
consult their healthcare provider before starting any new medications
not allow anyone else to take this medication
follow dietary instructions
report any adverse reactions (i.e., increased urinary frequency, increased thirst, fruity breath odor) promptly to their healthcare provider
report pregnancy or to discuss plans for pregnancy with their healthcare provider

Laboratory Tests

Consider monitoring the following laboratory tests during treatment with PROGLYCEM (not all-inclusive):

blood glucose (recommended at periodic intervals in patients taking diazoxide orally for treatment of hypoglycemia, until stabilized)
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine clearance
hematocrit, platelet count, total and differential leukocyte counts
serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
serum uric acid level
urine testing for glucose and ketones

### Olfactory dysfunction: a highly prevalent symptom of COVID-19 with public health significance [^114eAMRT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic affecting millions of individuals, killing hundreds of thousands. Although typically described with characteristic symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, greater understanding of COVID-19 has revealed myriad clinical manifestations. Olfactory dysfunction (OD)-hyposmia and anosmia-has recently been recognized as an important symptom of COVID-19 and increasingly gained traction as a public health tool for identifying COVID-19 patients, in particular otherwise asymptomatic carriers who, unawares, may be major drivers of disease spread. The objective of this study is to review the scientific evidence about anosmia in COVID-19.

Data Sources

PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science.

Review Methods

Comprehensive literature search of primary studies pertinent to the objectives of this review using the chosen data sources.

Conclusions

Current evidence shows that OD is highly prevalent in COVID-19, with up to 80% of patients reporting subjective OD and objective olfactory testing potentially showing even higher prevalence. OD is frequently accompanied by taste dysfunction. Up to 25% of COVID-19 patients may experience sudden-onset OD as the first symptom. A large proportion of COVID-19 OD cases may resolve over the period of a few weeks.

Implications For Practice

Sudden anosmia should be considered a symptom of COVID-19. Assessing for sudden-onset anosmia may increase sensitivity of COVID-19 screening strategies, in particular for identifying patients at the earliest stages of disease. Since many cases of OD due to COVID-19 may resolve in the short term, conservative management, including observation, is reasonable, while advanced imaging is unnecessary.

### Nitrogen mustard HN-2: blister agent… [^117QwzMx]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Nitrogen mustards are alkylating agents that affect DNA and other molecules in the body. Exposure to nitrogen mustard damages the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and suppresses the immune system. Although the nitrogen mustards cause cellular changes within minutes of contact, the onset of pain and other symptoms is delayed. Exposure to large amounts can be fatal. HN-2 has a fruity odor at high concentrations, and a soapy or fishy odor at low concentrations. Signs/Symptoms Clinical effects do not appear until hours after nitrogen mustard exposure. Nitrogen mustards penetrate and bind quickly to cells of the body, but their health effects develop slowly. The full extent of cellular injury may not be known for days. The sooner after exposure that health effects occur, the more likely it is that the patient/victim was exposed to a high concentration of mustard.
- Nausea, vomiting, pain, hemorrhagic diarrhea, and chemical burns of the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Mild**: Runny nose, sneezing, nosebleed, hoarseness progressing to "toneless" voice, barking cough, loss of taste and smell, wheezing and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath in smokers and asthmatics, and nasal and sinus pain.
- Exposures to higher concentrations of vapor result in health effects that occur sooner and are more severe.
- Damage to the airways begins with the upper airways and descends to the lower airways. The severity of damage increases as the concentration of nitrogen mustard increases.
- Tender skin, the moist lining of body passages and cavities, and perspiration-covered skin are more sensitive to the effects of nitrogen mustard.
- Skin effects of liquid mustard occur sooner than do the effects of mustard vapor.
- **Mild to moderate**: Erythema begins to appear 1 to 24 hours after exposure; blistering begins 2 to 18 hours after onset of redness; possible intense itching and burning pain. There is no antidote for nitrogen mustard toxicity. Decontamination of all potentially exposed areas within minutes after exposure is the only effective means of decreasing tissue damage.

Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19, and to identify people with COVID‐19 pneumonia. Symptoms are what is experienced by patients, for example, cough or nausea. Signs are what can be evaluated by clinical assessment, for example, lung auscultation findings, blood pressure or heart rate.

Key symptoms that have been associated with mild to moderate COVID‐19 include: troublesome dry cough (for example, coughing more than usual over a one‐hour period, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours), fever greater than 37.8 °C, diarrhoea, headache, breathlessness on light exertion, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste. Red flags indicating possible severe disease or pneumonia include breathlessness at rest, loss of appetite, confusion, pain or pressure in the chest, and temperature above 38 °C.

### Measuring breath acetone for monitoring fat loss: review [^112kRMXX]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Breath Acetone Spectrum

Acetone has a small molecular weight which allows easy movement from blood, into lung air and into exhaled breath 9. As a by‐product of fat metabolism, acetone is present in blood and breath of all humans. BrAce can be increased via a variety of factors including diet and exercise.

A literature review determined ranges of endogenous acetone for multiple conditions in blood or breath. Blood concentrations were converted to breath using the following relationship 10. Calculated values may overestimate measured breath values due to airway gas exchange.

Variable definitions are provided in Table 1. Acetone ranges for multiple conditions are presented in Figure 1. In normal healthy individuals, BrAce can range from 0.5 to 2.0 ppm 9, 12. Adults on ketogenic diets (e.g. high fat with low carbohydrate) can have elevated levels of up to ∼40 ppm 2, 13, 14, 20. Children with epilepsy can be treated with ketogenic diets to reduce the incidence of seizures. In these children, studies have reported BrAce as high as 360 ppm 15, 16. Fasting can cause the body to primarily utilize fats for energy production. This change in energy substrate can elevate BrAce up to ∼170 ppm 1, 17. Poorly controlled diabetes can cause ketoacidosis which can increase BrAce up to 1,250 ppm 18, 19.

Conclusion

In summary, our current analysis suggests that early identification of children with potential ketoacidosis (poor appetite, Kussmaul respiration, and rotten apple smell in the breath), prompt laboratory analysis, and early insulin administration with glucose supplementation can effectively correct ketoacidosis. Bicarbonate administration and CRRT have limited efficacy and should be used cautiously. Further studies are required to assess the optimal therapeutic approach to pediatric non-diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1114yB7i]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease — clinical presentation and AUD recognition: There is no unique presentation of ALD that can be distinguished with confidence from other forms of liver disease, and alcohol use is often not disclosed by the affected patient, whereas liver injury, whether due to alcohol or other causes, often proceeds silently. Although not all patients with ALD meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD), failure to recognize AUD remains a significant clinical problem, and providers need to have a high index of suspicion for AUD in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms and signs given in Table 6. Table 6 lists symptoms such as odor of alcohol on breath, tiredness, abdominal pain, day/night reversal (sleepy by day; wakeful at night), peripheral neuropathy, weight gain (due to ascites), weight loss (due to loss of proximal muscle mass), confusion (as part of hepatic encephalopathy), loss of sexual drive, and amenorrhea, and signs including spider angioma, palmar erythema, leukonychia, ecchymoses, icteric conjunctivae, loss of proximal muscle mass, systemic hypotension; tachycardia suggests alcohol withdrawal syndrome, ascites, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, bruises, gynecomastia, gonadal atrophy in men, neurological findings of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (fine tremor, psychomotor agitation, transient hallucinations or illusions) and hepatic encephalopathy (coarse flapping tremor [asterixis], altered consciousness), as well as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and Dupuytren's contracture.

Other qualities of dyspnea and overall perception — sensations of effort, tightness, and air hunger are more reliably characterized than others, and the mechanisms above do not adequately explain dyspnea from vascular problems such as congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary vascular receptors (J-receptors?) may play a role, but only suggestive evidence is available. Multiple distinguishable sensations seldom occur in isolation, and multiple uncomfortable sensations are often present and together produce the overall perception of dyspnea; even specific laboratory stimuli generally stimulate more than one afferent pathway. Assessment with magnitude scales may be more sensitive than binary choices, though reports of dyspnea are not as consistent as reports of colors or sounds.

### Respiration modulates sleep oscillations and memory reactivation in humans [^115nEhJj]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

On that note, it deserves mention that our results are correlational in nature. Hence, future studies, directly manipulating breathing behavior, will be needed to provide causal evidence for the role of breathing in modulating sleep-related oscillations. For example, it has been shown that presenting odors during NREM sleep is capable of modifying respiration during sleep, by decreasing inhalation and increasing exhalation volume for up to 6 breaths. One hypothesis would be that such interference (i.e. shallower inhalation due to odor presentation) might mitigate the modulation of sleep-related oscillations during the initial presence of odors. Another line of research potentially providing causal evidence could stem from patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is characterized by repetitive upper airway collapse resulting in intermittent hypoxia. Strikingly, in OSA patients' sleep seems to have lost its beneficial effect on memory. While it has been shown that abnormal sleep spindle properties are associated with OSA, it remains unclear whether OSA also impacts the emergence of SOs and SO_spindle complexes. This would corroborate the notion that pathological, arrhythmic breathing affects the coordination of sleep oscillations. Importantly, showing that restoring normal breathing behavior (e.g. via Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment) also restores the relationship between respiration and sleep oscillations would lend some causal evidence for the role of breathing on the coordination of sleep oscillations.

It has to be noted that we did not explicitly screen for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) conditions in our participants, which might have considerable impacted the results of our work. However, SDB is well known to cause sleep fragmentation (e.g. ref.). All our participants exhibited healthy sleep and no signs of sleep fragmentation (i.e. elevated number of awakenings) as assessed with sleep scoring. Moreover, we carefully inspected the respiratory data during recording and offline pre-processing and found no signs of breathing cessation. Finally, sleep oscillations and specifically sleep spindle properties (i.e. frequency and topography) have been shown to be altered by SDB (e.g. ref.). Spindle characteristics were generally within the expected range, both in terms of frequency and topography. That said, the fact that pulse oximetry or plethysmography were not collected during measurements, while no trained clinician evaluated the data, constitutes a limitation of the current study, as we cannot exclude any influence of SDB on our results with certainty.

### Diagnosis of COVID-19 by analysis of breath with gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry-a feasibility study [^117Vy4xX]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is an urgent need to rapidly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory conditions, including influenza, at first-presentation. Point-of-care tests not requiring laboratory- support will speed diagnosis and protect health-care staff. We studied the feasibility of using breath-analysis to distinguish these conditions with near-patient gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS).

Methods

Independent observational prevalence studies at Edinburgh, UK, and Dortmund, Germany, recruited adult patients with possible COVID-19 at hospital presentation. Participants gave a single breath-sample for VOC analysis by GC-IMS. COVID-19 infection was identified by transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR) of oral/nasal swabs together with clinical-review. Following correction for environmental contaminants, potential COVID-19 breath-biomarkers were identified by multi-variate analysis and comparison to GC-IMS databases. A COVID-19 breath-score based on the relative abundance of a panel of volatile organic compounds was proposed and tested against the cohort data.

Findings

Ninety-eight patients were recruited, of whom 21/33 (63.6%) and 10/65 (15.4%) had COVID-19 in Edinburgh and Dortmund, respectively. Other diagnoses included asthma, COPD, bacterial pneumonia, and cardiac conditions. Multivariate analysis identified aldehydes (ethanal, octanal), ketones (acetone, butanone), and methanol that discriminated COVID-19 from other conditions. An unidentified-feature with significant predictive power for severity/death was isolated in Edinburgh, while heptanal was identified in Dortmund. Differentiation of patients with definite diagnosis (25 and 65) of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 was possible with 80% and 81.5% accuracy in Edinburgh and Dortmund respectively (sensitivity/specificity 82.4%/75%; area-under-the-receiver- operator-characteristic [AUROC] 0.87 95% CI 0.67 to 1) and Dortmund (sensitivity / specificity 90%/80%; AUROC 0.91 95% CI 0.87 to 1).

Interpretation

These two studies independently indicate that patients with COVID-19 can be rapidly distinguished from patients with other conditions at first healthcare contact. The identity of the marker compounds is consistent with COVID-19 derangement of breath-biochemistry by ketosis, gastrointestinal effects, and inflammatory processes. Development and validation of this approach may allow rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 in the coming endemic flu seasons.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^115Bu5Vn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is the second update of a review summarising evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms for COVID‐19. This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, exploring the accuracy of antibody tests (Deeks 2020a), routine laboratory testing (Stegeman 2020), rapid point‐of‐care tests (Dinnes 2021) and thoracic imaging tests (Islam 2021).

Target condition being diagnosed

The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is of importance. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, loss of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia), aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction (NIH 2021). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease) require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between them and mild or moderate disease.

Thus, there are three target conditions for current infection:

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic of any severity);
mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease;
COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical).

Here we summarise the evidence on signs and symptoms; as a result asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are out of scope for this review.

### Fast and noninvasive electronic nose for sniffing out COVID-19 based on exhaled breath-print recognition [^111fv5xn]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Therefore, an electronic nose, an artificial olfactory system consisting of an array of integrated gas sensors with different active layers and artificial intelligence (AI) to discriminate complex odors, can be opted as an alternative path to assess VOC mixtures in exhaled breaths. During its exposure to the breath, the sensors respond in a specific way to the various fractions of VOCs. Each odor, representing a unique VOC mixture, can then result in a sensor signal pattern that is distinctive to that odor. For the exhaled air, such VOC pattern is called a breath-print. Complex VOC mixtures using pattern recognition algorithms, including machine learning, can therefore be discriminated and classified at a high throughput without identifying individual molecular components. An electronic nose is relatively inexpensive, mostly portable, fast (creating results within a few minutes), and easy to use. Considering patient perspectives in the case of COVID-19, exhaled breath analysis using an electronic nose is attractive because it is noninvasive, rapid, safe, and simple to operate. Previously, the electronic nose was implemented in clinical settings to diagnose and monitor respiratory and urologic diseases (e.g. ventilator-associated pneumonia, tuberculosis, and kidney failure), and recently, it has been used as a pre-operative screening for COVID-19 –. VOC profiles are expected to change following the continuous progression of COVID-19 within patients' respiratory system. Their alteration is complex, which is associated with the SARS-CoV-2 and its unique interaction with the host.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^113DWPGz]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Asthma irritant avoidance — tobacco smoke; smoke, strong odors, and sprays; vacuum cleaning; and other exposures — provides specific steps: If you smoke, visit smokefree.gov or ask your health care provider for ways to help you quit, ask family members to quit smoking, and do not allow smoking in your home or car. For combustion and odor triggers, if possible, avoid using a wood-burning stove, kerosene heater, or fireplace, vent gas stoves to outside the house, and try to stay away from strong odors and sprays, such as perfume, talcum powder, hair spray, and paints. For vacuuming, try to get someone else to vacuum for you once or twice a week, if you can, stay out of rooms while they are being vacuumed and for a short while afterward, and if you must vacuum yourself, using high efficiency air-filtration (HEPA) filter vacuum cleaners may be helpful. Other things that can make asthma worse include sulfites in foods and beverages — do not drink beer or wine or eat dried fruit, processed potatoes, or shrimp if they cause asthma symptoms — cold air: cover your nose and mouth with a scarf on cold or windy days, and other medicines: tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including nonselective beta-blockers (including those in eye drops).

### SGLT2 inhibitors-the new standard of care for cardiovascular, renal and metabolic protection in type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^112eTxUc]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Fear of increased diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) risk represents a significant barrier to SGLT2i use. Risk factors for this rare but serious condition include pronounced insulin resistance, low beta-cell function including those with T2DM and low C-peptide levels (particularly in people with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [LADA]/slowly evolving immune-related diabetes or a history of pancreatitis), restricted food intake (very low calorie or carbohydrate diets) or severe dehydration, sudden reduction in insulin or increased insulin requirements due to rising counter-regulatory hormones (e.g. during acute illness), major surgery and alcohol abuse. Two recently reported cases of severe ketoacidosis triggered by reduced oral nutrition intake in people taking SGLT2i therapy for HF show that ketoacidosis can occur in people without T2DM and risk factors, such as dietary intake, should be considered for all indications. As highlighted in the ADA/EASD guidelines, incidence of DKA is low in general and SGLT2is are associated with a small incremental increase in absolute risk. Published CVOTs reported DKA rates ranging between 0.1 and 0.6% in the SGLT2i treatment arm and < 0.1 and 0.3% in the placebo arm across studies. Ketoacidosis was not observed in non-diabetes subgroups participating in the DAPA-CKD trial and one case was reported in an individual without T2DM at baseline in the empagliflozin EMPA-KIDNEY study, indicating that such events are generally associated with the presence of T2DM itself. Clear written and verbal education regarding sick day guidance and the signs of DKA can help to manage and place the risk of this rare adverse event into context. The main signs include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath (Kussmaul breathing), drowsiness, confusion and sweet-smelling (pear drop) breath. DKA can occur with euglycaemia (relatively normal glucose levels) during SGLT2i use and HCPs should be aware of this and check ketone levels in individuals who are unwell, even in the setting of relatively normal blood glucose levels. Individuals should be advised to seek medical guidance if they are feeling unwell, even if their blood glucose does not appear elevated. SGLT2i treatment will need to be temporarily paused if symptoms develop, with the decision to restart (where a clear contributing factor has been identified) taken in discussion with the individual and clinical team when it has been established that the benefits of reintroducing an SGLT2i outweigh the risks. Where a person has paused SGLT2i treatment in line with specialist care instructions (e.g. fasting in preparation for surgery), instructions for restarting SGLT2i therapy should be clearly given. Current recommendations vary widely according to country and suggest that SGLT2is must be stopped 3–7 days prior to planned surgery or a procedure requiring nil by mouth. However, the IDSC would advise ceasing SGLT2i therapy the day before surgery and then restarting once normal oral intake has been established and the person's condition has stabilised.

### Measuring breath acetone for monitoring fat loss: review [^112UUtXT]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Endogenous breath acetone is correlated with and can be used to understand the rate of fat loss in healthy subjects. Maintaining a 2 ppm BrAce while on a calorie restriction diet should cause a fat loss rate of ∼227 g week −1. Acetone is correlated with fat loss because it and two other ketone bodies are the by‐products of fat metabolism. Breath acetone is strongly correlated with the blood ketone body BOHB. Breath acetone can range in concentration from 1 ppm in healthy non‐dieting subjects to 1,250 ppm in diabetic ketoacidosis. In healthy individuals, breath acetone is affected by multiple factors. Dietary macronutrient composition has the greatest impact followed, in rank order, by caloric restriction, exercise, pulmonary factors, and other factors. Because of its relationship to fat metabolism, a high‐fat, low‐carbohydrate diet will generate more breath acetone than a standard mixed diet. A reduction in consumed calories relative to that needed for weight maintenance can increase breath acetone and fat loss. Exercise can promote caloric restriction. Additionally, exercise can cause breath acetone elevation during a workout. Human respiratory factors can affect the acetone concentration in the breath sample. Other foods (e.g. garlic), drugs (e.g. disulfiram), and environmental conditions can increase breath acetone due to their ability to increase fat metabolism or block acetone metabolism. While the relationship between breath acetone and fat loss is well established, additional research is needed to better understand these factors and advance this area of integrative physiology.

3. High blood sugar (hyperglycemia): High blood sugar can happen if you have diabetes already or if you have never had diabetes. High blood sugar could lead to:

build up of acid in your blood due to ketones (ketoacidosis)
coma
death

Your doctor should do tests to check your blood sugar before you start taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and during treatment. In people who do not have diabetes, sometimes high blood sugar goes away when olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are stopped. People with diabetes and some people who did not have diabetes before taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules need to take medicine for high blood sugar even after they stop taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules.

If you have diabetes, follow your doctor's instructions about how often to check your blood sugar while taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules.

Call your doctor if you have any of these symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) while taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules:

feel very thirsty
need to urinate more than usual
feel very hungry
feel weak or tired
feel sick to your stomach
feel confused, or your breath smells fruity.

### Sevoflurane — sevoflurane, — volatile for inhalation [^115Qzehv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL STUDIES

Sevoflurane was administered to a total of 3185 patients. The types of patients are summarized as follows:

Clinical experience with these patients is described below.

Adult Anesthesia

The efficacy of sevoflurane in comparison to isoflurane, enflurane, and propofol was investigated in 3 outpatient and 25 inpatient studies involving 3591 adult patients. Sevoflurane was found to be comparable to isoflurane, enflurane, and propofol for the maintenance of anesthesia in adult patients. Patients administered sevoflurane showed shorter times (statistically significant) to some recovery events (extubation, response to command, and orientation) than patients who received isoflurane or propofol.

Mask Induction

Sevoflurane has a nonpungent odor and does not cause respiratory irritability. Sevoflurane is suitable for mask induction in adults. In 196 patients, mask induction was smooth and rapid, with complications occurring with the following frequencies: cough, 6%; breath-holding, 6%; agitation, 6%; laryngospasm, 5%.

Ambulatory Surgery

Sevoflurane was compared to isoflurane and propofol for maintenance of anesthesia supplemented with N2O in two studies involving 786 adult (18–84 years of age) ASA Class I, II, or III patients. Shorter times to emergence and response to commands (statistically significant) were observed with sevoflurane compared to isoflurane and propofol.

Inpatient Surgery

Sevoflurane was compared to isoflurane and propofol for maintenance of anesthesia supplemented with N2O in two multicenter studies involving 741 adult ASA Class I, II or III (18–92 years of age) patients. Shorter times to emergence, command response, and first post-anesthesia analgesia (statistically significant) were observed with sevoflurane compared to isoflurane and propofol.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state: a historic review of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment [^116UJ3X3]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

The hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is the most serious acute hyperglycemic emergency in patients with type 2 diabetes. von Frerichs and Dreschfeld described the first cases of HHS in the 1880s in patients with an "unusual diabetic coma" characterized by severe hyperglycemia and glycosuria in the absence of Kussmaul breathing, with a fruity breath odor or positive acetone test in the urine. Current diagnostic HHS criteria include a plasma glucose level > 600 mg/dL and increased effective plasma osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg in the absence of ketoacidosis. The incidence of HHS is estimated to be < 1% of hospital admissions of patients with diabetes. The reported mortality is between 10 and 20%, which is about 10 times higher than the mortality rate in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Despite the severity of this condition, no prospective, randomized studies have determined best treatment strategies in patients with HHS, and its management has largely been extrapolated from studies of patients with DKA. There are many unresolved questions that need to be addressed in prospective clinical trials regarding the pathogenesis and treatment of pediatric and adult patients with HHS.

Our unique patient case and the aforementioned literature highlight the importance of the physicians' ability to identify these subtle and sometimes unnoticed symptoms of this pandemic-creating virus. Peer-reviewed scientific literature is needed to further elucidate this early finding and to better understand the overall clinical course of SARS-CoV-2.

Patient's perspective

This section highlights the patient's direct quotes regarding the initial presentation of her disease, the progression that led her to the ICU and her eventual improvement and discharge from the hospital.

'My husband was initially sick with what we thought was a cold. We were keeping up with the COVID-19 news and did not think that his symptoms could be it, because other than going to the grocery store, we had no direct contact with anyone. I then started to get really winded and began to cough. It was not until I spoke to the doctor at the hospital when I realized that my sense of taste and smell were off. Everything I was eating tasted off although they were recipes I made frequently. I did not know that my loss of smell was related to COVID'.
'When the doctors told me I may have COVID I was very nervous and feared for my life. Everything that I heard on the news made me even more concerned about this. I had also wondered if my husband did in fact have COVID in the first place but got over it'.
'I am thankful to have noticed early on to come to the hospital when I started having issues breathing as I believe my outcome would be a lot worse hadn't I called 911'.

### Metformin hydrochloride (metformin hydrochloride extended-release 500mg) [^116vd5L3]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

SIDE EFFECTS:

Nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, weakness, or a metallic taste in the mouth may occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly. If stomach symptoms return later (after taking the same dose for several days or weeks), tell your doctor immediately. Stomach symptoms that occur after the first days of your treatment may be signs of lactic acidosis. An empty tablet shell may appear in your stool. This effect is harmless because your body has already absorbed the medication. Remember that your doctor has prescribed this medication because he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects. Metformin does not usually cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Low blood sugar may occur if this drug is prescribed with other anti-diabetic medications. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about whether the dose of your other diabetic medication(s) needs to be lowered. Symptoms of low blood sugar include sudden sweating, shaking, fast heartbeat, hunger, blurred vision, dizziness, or tingling hands/feet. It is a good habit to carry glucose tablets or gel to treat low blood sugar. If you don't have these reliable forms of glucose, rapidly raise your blood sugar by eating a quick source of sugar such as table sugar, honey, or candy, or drink fruit juice or non-diet soda. Tell your doctor about the reaction immediately. Low blood sugar is more likely if you drink large amounts of alcohol, do unusually heavy exercise, or do not consume enough calories from food. To help prevent low blood sugar, eat meals on a regular schedule, and do not skip meals. Check with your doctor or pharmacist to find out what you should do if you miss a meal. Symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) include thirst, increased urination, confusion, drowsiness, flushing, rapid breathing, and fruity breath odor. If these symptoms occur, tell your doctor immediately. Your doctor may need to adjust your diabetes medication(s). Stop taking this medication and tell your doctor right away if this very serious side effect occurs: lactic acidosis (see Warning section). A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any of the following symptoms of a serious allergic reaction: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing. This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist. In the US - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088. In Canada - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to Health Canada at 1–866–234–2345.

### Breath acetone as a marker of energy balance: an exploratory study in healthy humans [^115BQmVB]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The treatment of obesity consists in inducing a negative energy balance over several months or years. The rate of success with lifestyle interventions is disappointingly low, however, possibly because many patients fail to achieve a negative energy balance by overestimating their physical activity and underestimating their energy intake. In this regard weand others, have proposed that monitoring breath acetone as a marker of energy balance may be a useful tool to improve lifestyle intervention efficiency. Ketogenesis is indeed stimulated by fasting, caloric restriction, and exercise. However, it can also be stimulated during consumption of a very low-carbohydrate diet independently of negative energy balance. Whether increased ketogenesis can be detected from breath acetone measurements when energy balance is moderately negative, and whether this is influenced by dietary carbohydrate content, remains however unknown. We therefore monitored breath acetone, using a recently developed laser based breath analyzer, in healthy volunteers after an overnight fast followed by a 4-hour period during which volunteers remained fasted or were fed hourly meals with either 70% or 10% carbohydrate. Thereafter, a 2-h low intensity exercise was performed.

### Functional imaging studies of hyposmia in Parkinson's disease [^113rxCR6]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Hyposmia in Parkinson's disease (PD) was evaluated by using neuroimaging techniques. It is well known that olfactory impairments are one of the cardinal non-motor symptoms in PD. However, all smell tests used in previous studies depend on subjective answers by examinees and on sniffing of odorants, the latter of which may be impaired in PD as a consequence of motor impairments. We developed an fMRI system, which can visualize brain activation by olfactory stimuli during natural breathing. Although 7 age-matched controls demonstrated significant activations in various brain areas including precentral gyrus (BA6/6) and middle temporal gyrus (BA19/39) by the odorant stimuli, 9 patients with PD showed little activations by the same stimuli. These data suggest that the olfactory dysfunction in PD is not a simple reflection of impaired sniffing. Recent epidemiological studies demonstrate that the olfactory impairments may precede the onset of motor symptoms. Moreover, several pathological studies suggest that amygdala is one of the most frequently affected regions and is closely related to hyposmia in PD. Further brain imaging studies of hyposmia will shed light on the early pathological changes in PD.

### Awareness and knowledge of diabetic ketoacidosis in people with type 1 diabetes: a cross-sectional, multicenter survey [^116vqcmF]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Patients' awareness and self-evaluation of prevalence of DKA

A total of 220 (68%) of the respondents stated that they have heard about DKA and 103 (32%) did not hear or were not familiar with the term.

A total of 54 participants (17%) reported at least one and 56 patients (18%) several DKA episodes, whereas 98 individuals (32%) stated that they never had an episode. One hundred and three participants (33%) were unsure about DKA episodes. Approximately 40% of participants felt confident in managing DKA (see table 1). The majority of participants (n = 214, 68%) reported that DKA is a dangerous complication, 28 participants (9%) did not agree and 73 participants (23%) were unsure about it. Asked about whether DKA can be prevented, 237 (76%) participants agreed, 7 (2%) individuals disagreed, and 69 (22%) were unsure about it.

Patients' knowledge about DKA

When participants had to rate their knowledge about DKA on a scale from 0 (no idea at all) to 10 (excellent), median knowledge was 5 (IQR 1–7, mean 4.33, SD 3.1).

In the questionnaire, all individuals were asked to provide free-text answers concerning possible causes and symptoms of DKA. Of the participants, 185 individuals (55%) answered the causes question, while 181 participants (54%) answered the symptoms question. All individuals who answered the causes of DKA also completed the symptoms field.

Of the free-text answers given, 33 (18%) were not rated as correct or rated as inadequate causes of DKA (eg, 'hypoglycaemia', 'no idea', 'too much insulin', 'acetonic' or 'fruity urine/odour') and 15 (8%) answers were not rated as correct for possible symptoms of DKA.

### Standardised exhaled breath collection for the measurement of exhaled volatile organic compounds by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry [^111FRdJW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Other factors which potentially influence the levels of VOCs in the breath are diet and alcohol consumption. As expected, alcohol rapidly and significantly increased the levels of exhaled ethanol which gradually decreased and returned to baseline levels 3.5 hours after wine consumption. This supports the hypothesis that breath ethanol levels reflect a metabolic process and not alcohol vapours coming from the stomach immediately after drinking wine.

Previous reports have shown that the diet may affect the levels of ethanol. In our study there was a tendency for higher levels of breath ethanol 30 minutes after the ingestion of food however this was not statistically significant. Interestingly, there was a trend for increased ethanol levels following breakfast rather than lunch even though none of them was statistically significant. This may be related to the higher content of carbohydrates in the former which may have been metabolised to form ethanol.

### The importance of considering olfactory dysfunction during the COVID-19 pandemic and in clinical practice [^111pb85k]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

The emergence of a worldwide pandemic due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and frequent reports of smell loss in COVID-19-infected patients have brought new attention to this very important sense. Data are emerging that smell impairment is a prominent symptom in COVID-19 and that this coronavirus behaves differently in causing olfactory dysfunction compared with other respiratory viruses. Anosmia and hyposmia, the complete and partial loss of smell, respectively, can result from many causes, most commonly from viral infections, sinonasal disease, and head trauma. Olfactory dysfunction negatively impacts quality of life, because sense of smell is important for flavor perception and the enjoyment of food. Olfaction is also important for the detection of warning smells, such as smoke, natural gas leaks, and spoiled food. Allergists and immunologists frequently encounter anosmia and hyposmia in patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and will likely see more infection-induced olfactory dysfunction in the era of COVID-19. Therefore, now more than ever, it is crucial that we understand this impairment, how to evaluate and how to measure it. In this review, we offer a clinically relevant primer for the allergist and immunologist on olfactory dysfunction subtypes, exploring the pathophysiology, appropriate clinical assessment, objective smell testing, and management of this condition. We will also focus on the emerging literature on COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction, its unique features, and its important implications for this pandemic.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis complicated with previously unknown gitelman syndrome in a Tunisian child [^116BmDT2]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypocalciuria. In the great majority of cases, GS is caused by mutations in the SLC12A3 gene encoding the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCCT), which is specifically expressed in the apical membrane of cells along the distal convoluted tubule.

A 10-year-old Tunisian male patient was admitted with polyuria, polydipsia, and profound fatigue associated with weight loss. His parents were first cousins. Physical examination revealed clouded sensorium, severe dehydration, fruity-like breath odor, and Kussmaul breathing. The laboratory profile revealed hyperglycemia 21.7 mmol/L with ketonuria, acidosis, serum bicarbonate 6.4 mmol/L, sodium 133 mEql/L, potassium 1.1 mEq/L, and HbA 1c 13.2%. On the basis of International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes guidelines, a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was proposed. No abnormalities were showed by electrocardiogram. Clinical management included restoration of intravascular volume, intravenous insulin, and potassium chloride infusion. After a month the clinical picture was improved, but low serum potassium values and low blood pressure were confirmed. Further investigations revealed hypocalciuria, hypochloremic alkalosis, and increased excretion of potassium. GS was then suspected as the etiology of the hypokalemia. A homozygous splice site mutation in the SLC12A3 gene was found with the sequence analysis of the NCCT gene. This mutation was a homozygous G to A base pair substitution in intron 8 (c.1095+1G > A) leading to the inclusion of 95 amino acids before a stop signal at the 96th codon. Parents were heterozygous for c.1095+1G > A. The diagnosis of GS was thus genetically confirmed.

(C) ORs for individuals reporting no DKA compared with those with several experienced DKA episodes. ORs with 95% CI are depicted. *Indicates atypical symptoms. BMI, body mass index.

With regard to free-text symptoms of DKA most frequently 'nausea', 'vomiting' or 'abdominal pain' were mentioned by 59 (18%) participants; 'Thirst', 'need to urinate' or 'dry mouth' by 44 (13%) participants; and symptoms such as 'fruity' or 'acetonic odour/urine' by 33 (10%) participants. A total of 30 (9%) participants mentioned further symptoms of DKA such as 'tiredness', 'sweating', 'visual disturbances' or 'coma'. Participants were then offered multiple-choice answers including atypical symptoms of DKA. Answers can be found in figure 1B. Symptoms not typical for DKA that were offered included aggression, muscular pain, olfactorial disorder, increased appetite and hearing disorder.

There was a significant but low positive correlation between diabetes duration and knowledge of DKA (Spearman r = 0.187; 95% CI 0.0714 to 0.298; p = 0.001).

Ketone body testing

A total of 185 (64%) individuals did not test for ketones at all, 124 (56%) participants tested less than every 6 months and 78 participants (38%) only if glucose was high or testing was needed. The last testing was longer than 1 year ago or never happened in a total of 165 participants (63%). A total of 148 individuals (60%) reported that their ketone test strips were either expired or they did not know (see table 2).

### Diagnostic performance of electronic noses in cancer diagnoses using exhaled breath: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1113Hn6Z]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Consideration and reporting of exogenous and endogenous factors during exhaled breath collection differed largely among studies. A variety of measures were implemented to reduce possible effects of confounding factors on exhaled VOCs. Fasting before breath sampling was performed in 30 studies (58%). Duration of fasting differed largely among these studies. Cessation of smoking was applied in 24 studies (46%). Minimum duration of cessation also differed among studies. In 5 studies (10%), patients were asked to rest for a certain amount of time before breath sampling. Other measures to reduce potential exogenous confounding factors included rinsing of the mouth, cessation of perfume, cessation of pungent food, and use of inspiratory VOC filters. Furthermore, a variety of comorbidities were considered as having a potential confounding effect on VOCs in exhaled breath. In most studies, patients with certain comorbidities were excluded from participation.

### Fast and noninvasive electronic nose for sniffing out COVID-19 based on exhaled breath-print recognition [^114Sj9uZ]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To ensure human safety during the breath exposure test and obtain reliable results, the breath sampling procedure was carefully set and controlled (Fig. 2a). First, the patients were asked to store their end-tidal breath during the third exhalation into 1 L sampling bags (see Fig. 2a(1)). Here, the first two breaths were not taken to minimize contamination from the dead space air (i.e. ventilated air that does not participate in the gas exchange) and mouth-released odor, which are commonly found in the mixed expiratory breath. From another breath analysis report, different sampling procedures (i.e. mixed expiratory and end-tidal breath sampling methods) were discovered to result in varied VOC ratios. In case the blood-borne volatile substances will be assigned as biomarkers of disease, such as in COVID-19 detection, the end-tidal breath sampling technique is, however, appropriate to be used. The ratio values between the difference in the expiratory and inspiratory concentrations and the alveolar concentration were normally calculated to estimate the content alteration of inhaled and exhaled substances, where blood-borne volatile substances with clearly endogenous (e.g. CO 2, isoprene, and acetone) and exogenous origins (e.g. 2-propanol and 2-butanone) obtained high (> 1.5) and low (< 1) ratios, respectively. After the third exhaled breath had been inserted into the sampling bag, its valve had to be quickly closed to avoid any air leakages (see Fig. 2a(2)). Lastly, the upper end of the reservoir tube was connected to the HEPA filter. Hence, the valve could subsequently be reopened, allowing the airflow to occur from the bag to the GeNose C19 machine (Fig. 2a(3)). Such a similar breath sampling concept has already been employed in various off-line breathomics pipelines.

### Breath acetone as a marker of energy balance: an exploratory study in healthy humans [^114qUfoF]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our study indicates that breath acetone is present in detectable amounts in normal subjects, and increases over time when subjects remain fasted, but not when they are fed carbohydrate containing meals. However, it is not suppressed by very low-carbohydrate meals, which may limit its use as a marker of energy balance in subjects on special diets.

1.2 Diabetic ketoacidosis

The risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with SGLT2 inhibitor use has been a cause of concern. The absolute risk is low, but the consequences can be severe. Mitigation strategies are outlined in Box 1. These strategies include stopping the agent when acutely unwell, stopping the agent 3 days before any procedure that requires fasting, bowel preparation, or a hospital admission and restarting the agent when well.,

BOX 1
Reducing the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis with SGLT2 inhibitors.

Reducing the Risk of DKA with SGLT2 inhibitors
Patient counseling,: Patients should seek urgent medical attention if they develop nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, drowsiness, rapid weight loss, ketotic (sweet) breath, Kussmaul (fast and deep) breathing and abnormal odour to the urine or sweat. Patients should be aware of DKA risk factors–fasting, dehydration, acute illness, surgery, sudden reductions in insulin dosage, alcohol abuse, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults and low C‐peptide levels. Patients should remain well hydrated during periods of illness. Patients should stop taking SGLT2 inhibitors if unable to eat or drink.
Withhold SGLT2 inhibitors 3 days prior to the day of any surgery/procedure if the procedure requires fasting, bowel preparation and a hospital admission. Therapy can be restarted when the patient is recovered and eating and drinking.
Consider introducing an automatic alert in the electronic medical record when a patient is on an SGLT2 inhibitor and is being booked for an operation.
Withhold SGLT2 inhibitors during acute severe medical illnesses, and monitor ketones during this period. The SGLT2 inhibitor should then be restarted once the patient's condition stabilizes and the ketones are normal.
Immediately discontinue SGLT2 inhibitor use if DKA is suspected or diagnosed.
In patients who experience DKA during use, do not resume therapy unless another cause for DKA was identified, and resolved.

### Case report and literature review of auto-brewery syndrome: probably an underdiagnosed medical condition [^112z3452]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Figure 1
Protocol for the detection of auto-brewery syndrome.

Concomitant breath analysis testing was done to validate the accuracy of the patient's breathalyser values. The accuracy of the breathalyser is of paramount importance when a patient uses this device to self-monitor their breath alcohol levels during and after treatment. The widespread availability of breathalysers has facilitated the diagnosis and monitoring of these patients. Breathalysers can be obtained without difficulty on the Internet or via appropriate sales outlets. It is also important to note that the breathalyser should be calibrated or replaced every 30 days to remain accurate.

Our patient had an elevated blood alcohol level of 57 mg/dL 8 hours after the carbohydrate meal in Ohio, but a concomitant breathalyser was not done. We propose that gastrointestinal secretions should be obtained by upper and lower endoscopy, at which time the macroscopic gut morphology and any coexisting pathologies can be documented. Secretions collected from the stomach, upper small bowel, colon, and terminal ileum for pH, Gram stain, and bacterial and fungal cultures should be performed. These samples should also be sent to a special laboratory for fungal speciation and antifungal sensitivity testing. To the best of our knowledge, endoscopy has not been used previously to acquire gastrointestinal secretions for this purpose. We believe that endoscopy is an important intervention because it allows us to obtain upper and lower gastrointestinal secretions, while some fungi could be present in the colon, presence of fungi in the stomach and upper intestinal tract is likely pathological.

### S.O.S! I' M short of breath! [^111vpMdX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There are various causes of shortness of breath in a young, pregnant woman. The importance of entertaining a broad differential diagnosis is highlighted in this case.

Case

A young, pregnant African-American woman presented in her third trimester with acute onset of shortness of breath. A team approach by different medical specialties and systematic workup eventually helped us reach the diagnosis and provide optimal management.

Conclusion

This case raises intriguing questions about diagnosis and management of a common symptom in a pregnant woman.

### Continuous glucose monitoring systems for adolescents and adults living with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114RB2bX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Complications of diabetes include microvascular and cardiovascular disease, and metabolic emergencies. Microvascular diseases, as complications of diabetes, include diabetic retinopathy, kidney disease, and neuropathy. Retinopathy causes visual impairment and blindness in 5% to 10% of people with diabetes. Kidney disease occurs in 20% to 40% of people with diabetes and may be associated with proteinuria, peripheral oedema, fatigue, and nausea or lead to kidney failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. Neuropathy may result from reduced sensitivity and impairment of the autonomic system, which can lead to diabetic foot ulcers. Cardiovascular complications include coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities, leading to a decline in activities of daily living. They remain significant causes of death.

Metabolic complications include hypoglycaemia, hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); these are acute complications. Hypoglycaemia causes shakiness, irritability, confusion, tachycardia, sweating, and hunger and should be treated immediately with carbohydrates such as glucose. Severe hypoglycaemic events double the risk of mortality in people living with diabetes. People with HHS present with an altered cognitive state, hyperglycaemia, hyperosmolarity, and dehydration. HHS often occurs in middle‐aged or older people with type 2 diabetes, with a mortality rate of 5% to 20%. People with DKA present with hyperglycaemia, gastrointestinal symptoms, dehydration, Kussmaul respiration, fruity odour smell, and altered mental status. DKA at initial diagnosis is reported in over 50% of Black/African‐American and Hispanic/Latino adults with newly diagnosed ketosis‐prone diabetes. The mortality varies from < 1% to 40%, depending on the clinical setting and available resources. Both HHS and DKA are medical emergencies requiring immediate treatment with intravenous fluids and insulin.

COVID-19 data standards — probable acute COVID-19 case requires either antigen detection or defined clinical/epidemiological criteria or a qualifying death certificate, with clinical criteria specifying symptom counts. Permissible value definitions state: "Detection of SARS- CoV-2 by antigen test in a respiratory specimen OR Meets clinical criteria and epidemiological linkage criteria for COVID-19 with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed OR A death certificate that lists COVID-19 disease or SARS-CoV-2 as an underlying cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death with no confirmatory laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2". Clinical criteria are listed as: "At least 2 of the following: fever (measured or subjective), chills, rigors, myalgia, headache, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, congestion, or runny nose OR Any 1 of the following: cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, new olfactory disorder, new taste disorder OR Severe respiratory illness with clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia or ARDS". Epidemiological linkage criteria are defined as "close contact, as defined by the CDC (while the person was deemed to be infectious (see infectious period below)), or a member of a risk cohort as defined by public health authorities during an outbreak", and it is noted that "In hospital setting, probable cases have been sometimes identified as PUI".

Median (IQR) BMI-for-age z-score was not significantly different between patients with and without DKA in either age group. However, median (IQR) height-for-age z-score was significantly lower in children ≥ 10 years without DKA (−1.7 (1.4) SDS) for patients without DKA vs (−1.5 (1.2) SDS) for patients with DKA, p = 0.007. Median (IQR) values for appraisal interval and total diagnosis interval were significantly longer in children < 10 years with DKA than in those without DKA but not in children ≥ 10 years. Median was 12 (5) days versus 10 (3) days, p = 0.009, for appraisal interval, and 18 (5) days versus 16 (3) days, p = 0.025, for total diagnosis interval.

The presenting symptoms associated with DKA at diagnosis included weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea and/or vomiting, hyperventilation and acetone smell in breath.

### Predicting natural language descriptions of mono-molecular odorants [^111chsxa]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

There has been recent progress in predicting whether common verbal descriptors such as "fishy", "floral" or "fruity" apply to the smell of odorous molecules. However, accurate predictions have been achieved only for a small number of descriptors. Here, we show that applying natural-language semantic representations on a small set of general olfactory perceptual descriptors allows for the accurate inference of perceptual ratings for mono-molecular odorants over a large and potentially arbitrary set of descriptors. This is noteworthy given that the prevailing view is that humans' capacity to identify or characterize odors by name is poor. We successfully apply our semantics-based approach to predict perceptual ratings with an accuracy higher than 0.5 for up to 70 olfactory perceptual descriptors, a ten-fold increase in the number of descriptors from previous attempts. These results imply that the semantic distance between descriptors defines the equivalent of an odorwheel.

### Cherry-flavoured electronic cigarettes expose users to the inhalation irritant, benzaldehyde [^111k9DnL]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Many non-cigarette tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, contain various flavourings, such as fruit flavours. Although many flavourings used in e-cigarettes are generally recognised as safe when used in food products, concerns have been raised about the potential inhalation toxicity of these chemicals. Benzaldehyde, which is a key ingredient in natural fruit flavours, has been shown to cause irritation of respiratory airways in animal and occupational exposure studies. Given the potential inhalation toxicity of this compound, we measured benzaldehyde in aerosol generated in a laboratory setting from flavoured e-cigarettes purchased online and detected benzaldehyde in 108 out of 145 products. The highest levels of benzaldehyde were detected in cherry-flavoured products. The benzaldehyde doses inhaled with 30puffs from flavoured e-cigarettes were often higher than doses inhaled from a conventional cigarette. Levels in cherry-flavoured products were > 1000 times lower than doses inhaled in the workplace. While e-cigarettes seem to be a promising harm reduction tool for smokers, findings indicate that using these products could result in repeated inhalation of benzaldehyde, with long-term users risking regular exposure to the substance. Given the uncertainty surrounding adverse health effects stemming from long-term inhalation of flavouring ingredients such as benzaldehyde, clinicians need to be aware of this emerging risk and ask their patients about use of flavoured e-cigarettes.

Breath testing — use, thresholds, and methane effects: The use of breath testing in the diagnosis of SIBO has lacked universal acceptance, in part due to inconsistency in performance and interpretation, and studies suggest that a positive breath test for SIBO requires 2 H2 peaks, a criterion that has not been validated. Breath testing is more complex than simply measuring H2; CH4 is also important, CH4 is produced by methanogens, 4 moles of H2 are required to produce 1 mole of CH4, the presence of CH4 suppresses H2 on the breath test, and conventional breath testing measures both H2 and CH4.

### Olfactory reference syndrome: demographic and clinical features of imagined body odor [^1163sFmU]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Olfactory reference syndrome (ORS) - preoccupation with a false belief that one emits a foul or offensive body odor - has been described around the world for more than a century. However, only a few small studies have systematically assessed ORS's clinical features.

Method

Twenty patients with ORS were systematically assessed using semistructured measures.

Results

Subjects' mean age was 33.4 ± 14.1; 60% were female. Preoccupation most often focused on the mouth (75%), armpits (60%) and genitals (35%). Bad breath (75%) and sweat (65%) were the most common odor descriptions. Currently, 85% of subjects had delusional ORS beliefs, 77% had referential thinking and 85% reported actually smelling the odor. Ninety-five percent of subjects reported performing one or more ORS-related repetitive behaviors (e.g., excessive showering). Forty percent had been housebound for at least 1 week because of ORS symptoms, 68% had a history of suicidal ideation, 32% had attempted suicide and 53% had been psychiatrically hospitalized. Forty-four percent of subjects had sought nonpsychiatric medical, surgical or dental treatment for the perceived odor, and one third had received such treatment, which was ineffective in all cases.

Conclusion

ORS appears to be characterized by high morbidity and seeking of nonpsychiatric treatment.

### Retronasal olfactory function in patients with smell loss but subjectively normal flavor perception [^1135yHS2]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Finally, as shown in a recent publication, olfactory changes are not as strongly perceived as visual changes. While olfactory changes were only detected with an accuracy of 61%, visual changes were detected with an accuracy of over 97%. Only 24% of the participants were able to detect olfactory changes reliably above chance. Notably, these subjects also rated their personal interest in olfaction and its use in daily life as most important. 41 Regarding our subgroup of patients with smell loss and no subjective change in flavor perception, it might be speculated that these patients rely more on visual, gustatory, and trigeminal cues during eating and drinking leading to an unawareness of a decreased retronasal odor identification ability.

### The perception of odor is not a surrogate marker for chemical exposure: a review of factors influencing human odor perception [^114Tap9u]. Clinical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Clinical toxicologists perform risk assessments and clinical evaluations for patients with potential exposure to airborne toxicants in which the patient's self-reported perception of odor may be the only indicator that an exposure may have taken place.

Objective

To review the factors that may affect the human ability to perceive chemical odors and relate those odors to specific chemical exposures.

Methods

The medical literature, from 1950 through 2012, was searched using the OVID database and the PUBMED database. The searches returned 238 articles, of which 113 involved human studies and were published in the English language. Of these 113 articles, 40 articles discussed odor issues and thus were chosen as specifically relevant to the topic. Bibliographies of all articles were also searched for other relevant references and this found six additional articles, making a total of 46. FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OLFACTION AND THE ABILITY TO PERCEIVE ODOR: Genetic/population: Ethnic background is associated with widely differing odor detection abilities and thresholds. A significant genetic influence for the ability to smell and perceive odor has been reported. Gender: Women are superior to men in their ability to identify odors. Age. Increasing age is correlated with higher odor detection thresholds. Medical conditions: A variety of medical conditions have been associated with deficits in olfaction, including diseases of the nose and sinuses, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia. Alcoholism and smoking: Abuse of alcohol results in impaired olfactory sense, and smoking tobacco products alters odor detection threshold in a dose-related manner. Occupational and environmental factors: Repeated inhalation of any chemical results in olfactory fatigue over relatively short time frames that leads to a decreased ability to accurately detect and identify an odor. Recent exposure to relatively high concentrations of a chemical has been shown to affect sensitivity to that particular odorant, altering subsequent detection thresholds by up to three orders of magnitude. Applicability of proposed odor thresholds: Humans are only able to identify three to four components of complex olfactory mixtures and the odorants present in the mixture affect which individual components are detected. Odorants present in suprathreshold concentrations in a mixture may effectively mask the presence of odorants present in perithreshold concentrations. Self-rating of olfactory function may not correlate with actual olfactory ability. It is even more difficult to accurately determine intensity of an odor in a quantifiable way. For example, under conditions of constant stimulation with hydrogen sulfide, perceptual intensity was reported to decrease exponentially with time of stimulation. Concomitant visual stimulation also affects odor intensity. Some chemicals, such as hydrogen sulfide, may induce reactions in humans related solely to their odor, even when they are present in concentrations substantially lower than those levels usually associated with the development of adverse clinical effects. There is a wealth of literature suggesting that the intensity of perceived odor, the degree of irritation, and the reported health effects of exposure to an odorant chemical are affected by psychological state and bias. Multiple theories have been proposed to explain the cognitive basis for perceived illness in association with the perception of odor. The concept of odor has been reported to be intrinsically and cognitively associated with illness rather than with health. Assigning negative bias to an odor prior to an exposure results in the reporting of significantly more health-related symptoms following exposure. This suggests that those symptoms are not mediated by the odor directly, but rather by an individual's cognitive associations between odor and health.

Conclusions

Attempts to verify exposure intensity based on the report of a perceived odor is unreliable and has no useful application in legitimate exposure assessment paradigms. Detection of an odor does not imply a medically significant exposure to a toxicant and, due to subject bias and the difficulty of detecting individual odorants in mixtures, may not constitute an exposure to the purported substance.

### The fragrance of the heifer's breath [^112weJ1Y]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Malodorous and disfiguring, smallpox held none of the mystique of tuberculosis, whose wasting febrile victims would later inspire romantic literature, music, and art. On the contrary, it struck fear in the hearts of poets, from Andrew Marvel to John Donne. Those who tried their hand at elegies struggled to align this "loathsome and unlovely" condition with internal beauty. A tribute by a young John Dryden to his friend Lord Hastings, who died the day before he was to marry, illustrates the pitfalls: "Blisters with pride swell'd; which th'row's flesh did sprout / Like Rose-buds, stuck i'th' Lily-skin about. / Each little Pimple had a Tear in it, / to wail the fault its rising did commit: / Who, Rebel-like, with their own Lord at strife, / Thus made an Insurrection 'gainst his Life".

Dryden's attempt in his first published poem to liken Hastings' pustules to rosebuds and later to gems and stars failed to transform smallpox to anything palatable. Dryden was not alone in confronting the reality of pathologic symptoms in a poem, but this disease, an everyday event, defied metaphorical interpretation and therefore transformative treatment. Moreover, it was not viewed as divine punishment for "Capital offense, / Some high, high Treason". It remained instead, a "Fierce disease, which knows not how to spare / The young, the great, the knowing, or the Fair".

Records from Glasgow show that in the immediate prevaccination era (1783–1800), 50% of children died before age 10, and of those deaths, 40% were due to smallpox, the leading cause of blindness in Europe. Those who survived were often badly blemished, "Beauty's Enemy" lingering "in many a pityed face / Those hatefull pits and furrowes of its trace".

### Blood and breath profiles of volatile organic compounds in patients with end-stage renal disease [^115w5jtL]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The primary goal of this work was the untargeted identification and quantification of volatile organic compounds characterizing uremic breath and blood with a particular focus on species responding to the dialysis treatment, the latter being potential markers of dialysis efficiency. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection using solid phase microextraction (SPME-GCMS) as a preconcentration step was selected as the adequate analytical method for this purpose. In particular, we aimed at extending the classic definition of uremic breath and blood (encompassing mainly odorous compounds such as ammonia or amines) to include a wider spectrum of volatiles, induced by either CKD or by the hemodialysis procedure itself.

A 54-year-old woman with insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with acute shortness of breath and drowsiness on a background of polydipsia, weakness and significant weight loss. One year ago, she had decided to stop her insulin and other medications and adopt lifestyle modifications instead. Initial emergency department (ED) blood samples were highly lipaemic and appeared strawberry pink. She was eventually diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with severe hypertriglyceridaemia, intubated for airway protection, and managed with fluid resuscitation and intravenous insulin to good effect. We share an uncommon DKA presentation at the ED. History was limited as the patient was drowsy and minimally communicative. Physical examination was unremarkable. Blood investigations were also delayed in view of the need for additional centrifugation. These contributed to a paucity of information in the acute setting and resulted in a diagnostic challenge.

Methods

Consenting procedures

Informed consent was obtained from patients' families.

Study cohort and data collection

A total of 485 children and adolescents aged ≤ 18 years with new-onset T1D were prospectively recruited in the study, during the period 2010–2020, in a diabetes centre in the capital city Sana'a, Yemen. Their data were collected according to a standardised protocol and retrieved retrospectively. The patients' families were questioned and assessed at first encounter on the presenting symptoms and signs of polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, fast breathing, fruity breath, and altered consciousness, and also the duration of symptoms.

Exclusion criteria included children and adolescents with a previous diagnosis of T1D, children with diabetes diagnosed before 9 months of age or with monogenic diabetes diagnosed after that age, and youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) or secondary diabetes.

Demographic data

Demographic variables such as age, gender, Tanner pubertal stage, family history of diabetes, and consanguinity were assessed and recorded. Parents provided family history information regarding physician-diagnosed T1D among immediate first-degree relatives, including parents and siblings. Accordingly, T1D was further subdivided into familial and sporadic cases. In addition, parents were asked about the presence of T2D and parental first cousin consanguinity among the family.

### Acute tellurium toxicity from ingestion of metal-oxidizing solutions [^114v7QaQ]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Tellurium is an element used in the vulcanization of rubber and in metal-oxidizing solutions to blacken or tarnish metals. Descriptions of human toxicity from tellurium ingestion are rare. We report the clinical course of 2 children who ingested metal-oxidizing solutions containing substantial concentrations of tellurium. Clinical features included vomiting, black discoloration of the oral mucosa, and a garlic odor to the breath. One patient developed corrosive injury to the esophagus secondary to the high concentration of hydrochloric acid in the solution. Both patients recovered without serious sequelae, which is typical of tellurium toxicity. An awareness of situations in which children may be exposed to tellurium and its clinical presentation may assist clinicians in the diagnosis of this rare poisoning.

Your doctor should do tests to check your blood sugar before you start taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and during treatment. In people who do not have diabetes, sometimes high blood sugar goes away when olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are stopped. People with diabetes and some people who did not have diabetes before taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules need to take medicine for high blood sugar even after they stop taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules.

If you have diabetes, follow your doctor's instructions about how often to check your blood sugar while taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules.

Call your doctor if you have any of these symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) while taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules:

feel very thirsty
need to urinate more than usual
feel very hungry
feel weak or tired
feel sick to your stomach
feel confused, or your breath smells fruity.

4. High fat levels in your blood (increased cholesterol and triglycerides). High fat levels may happen in people treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, especially in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years old). You may not have any symptoms, so your doctor should do blood tests to check your cholesterol and triglyceride levels before you start taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and during treatment.

Under normal conditions of adequate dietary carbohydrate, the production of free acetoacetic acid is negligible and it is rapidly metabolized by various tissues, especially the skeletal and heart muscles. In conditions of overproduction of acetoacetic acid, it accumulates above normal levels and part of it is converted to the other two KBs leading to ketonemia and ketonuria (presence of KBs in the blood and urine). The characteristic 'sweet' breath odour of ketosis is caused by acetone, which, being a very volatile compound, is eliminated mainly via respiration in the lungs. The pathway that results in the formation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl–CoA from acetyl CoA also occurs in the cytosol of hepatic cells where it is used instead for the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Under normal conditions, the concentration of KBs is very low (< 0.3 mmol/l) compared with glucose (∼4 mmol), and as glucose and KBs have a similar kM for glucose transport to the brain the KBs begin to be utilized as an energy source by the CNS when they reach a concentration of about 4 mmol/l, which is close to the Km for the monocarboxylate transporter.

### Dimethyl sulfoxide (Rimso-50) [^115o8hdq]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

A garlic-like taste may be noted by the patient within a few minutes after instillation of RIMSO-50®(dimethyl sulfoxide). This taste may last several hours and because of the presence of metabolites, an odor on the breath and skin may remain for 72 hours.

Transient chemical cystitis has been noted following instillation of dimethyl sulfoxide.

The patient may experience moderately severe discomfort on administration. Usually this becomes less prominent with repeated administration.

### Predicting natural language descriptions of mono-molecular odorants [^112R71uj]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

There has been recent progress in predicting whether common verbal descriptors such as "fishy", "floral" or "fruity" apply to the smell of odorous molecules. However, accurate predictions have been achieved only for a small number of descriptors. Here, we show that applying natural-language semantic representations on a small set of general olfactory perceptual descriptors allows for the accurate inference of perceptual ratings for mono-molecular odorants over a large and potentially arbitrary set of descriptors. This is noteworthy given that the prevailing view is that humans' capacity to identify or characterize odors by name is poor. We successfully apply our semantics-based approach to predict perceptual ratings with an accuracy higher than 0.5 for up to 70 olfactory perceptual descriptors, a ten-fold increase in the number of descriptors from previous attempts. These results imply that the semantic distance between descriptors defines the equivalent of an odorwheel.

### Randomized, open-label preference study of two cyclosporine capsule formulations (usp modified) in stable solid-organ transplant recipients [^113d21tp]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Prior research has indicated patient dissatisfaction with the odor, size, and taste of cyclosporine capsules, as well as the halitosis and body odor the capsules can cause.

Objectives

The purposes of this investigation were to (1) compare the overall cyclosporine capsule preference (Gengraf vs Neoral) in stable, solid-organ transplant recipients, (2) assess patient preference based on specific capsule attributes, and (3) determine the reliability of the Cyclosporine Capsule SatiSfaCtion Survey (original to this study).

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, preference study, patients were recruited from 144 centers in North America with established transplant programs. Solid-organ transplant recipients who had taken stable doses of cyclosporine (Neoral) for ≥ 2 consecutive months were randomized in a 9:1 ratio to receive another cyclosporine formulation (Gengraf) or to remain on Neoral therapy. Patients completed the Cyclosporine Capsule Satisfaction Survey prior to randomization (baseline survey) and after taking the study drug for 4 weeks (final survey). The survey consisted of multiple attribute items with high face validity in assessing patients' perceptions and preferences with regard to their overall experience, as well as specific attributes of cyclosporine capsules known to affect patient acceptance.

Results

The intent-to-treat population included 1906 patients (1211 men, 693 women [sex unknown in 2 patients]; mean [SD] age, 50.2 [12.4] years). A total of 1708 patients were switched to Gengraf; 198 continued on Neoral. Based on their overall experience with both capsule formulations, the majority of patients switched to Gengraf (61.9%) responded that they preferred the Gengraf capsule, compared with 13.7% who preferred the Neoral capsule and 24.4% who indicated no preference (P < 0.001). A similar preference for Gengraf was observed based on capsule odor (66.3%), ease of swallowing (51.5%), taste (57.1%), and impact on breath odor (52.5%) and body odor (48.4%) (P < 0.001 for each test). The results of internal consistency and reproducibility calculations were high for the Cyclosporine Capsule Satisfaction Survey. Internal consistency ranged from alpha = 0.84 to 0.95 for the subscales and was alpha = 0.95 for the overall score. Ranges for reproducibility in the subscales were r = 0.75 to 0.79, with an overall reproducibility of r = 0.85. Guyatt's responsiveness statistics for the subscale and overall scores were moderately high to very high, indicating that the survey is capable of measuring change in response to treatment.

Conclusions

Of the transplant recipients receiving Gengraf in this study, most preferred Gengraf to Neoral based on overall experience, capsule odor, difficulty swallowing, taste, breath odor, and body odor. Among all study patients, fewer patients receiving Gengraf were bothered by capsule odor, difficulty in swallowing, taste, or the impact on breath or body odor compared with patients who continued to receive Neoral. Internal consistency, reproducibility, and responsiveness results show that the Cyclosporine Capsule Satisfaction Survey is a psychometrically valid instrument that is appropriate for use in clinical trials.

### Dimethyl sulfoxide (Rimso-50) [^113tdDp9]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS (Patient Copy)

RIMSO-50®is a sterile solution of 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 50% water that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in the symptomatic relief of patients with interstitial cystitis.

RIMSO-50®will be instilled in the bladder on an inpatient or out-patient basis, which will be determined by your physician.

Some data indicate that dimethyl sulfoxide could change the effectiveness of medication(s) that you may be presently receiving. Be sure to mention the name and dosage of all medicines you are taking to your physician before a RIMSO-50®instillation.

A garlic-like taste may be noted by the patient within a few minutes after instillation of RIMSO-50®(dimethyl sulfoxide). This taste may last several hours. An odor on the breath and skin may be present and remain for up to 72 hours.

Some patients may experience discomfort on administration of the drug. Usually this becomes less prominent with repeated administration.

If you are pregnant or nursing, ask your physician about the advisability of using RIMSO-50®.

Some eye changes have been observed in animals treated with DMSO in large doses for prolonged periods. Therefore your doctor may want you to have eye evaluations, including slit lamp examinations prior to and periodically during treatment.

### Clinical assessment of patients with smell and taste disorders [^116epLMR]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical assessment of the patient who has smell and taste disorders requires understanding of the etiology of the olfactory and gustatory disorders. Available clinical tests of olfactory and gustatory systems allow detecting and measuring the degree of the sensory loss, but are unable to determine the cause and give neither prognostic information nor therapeutic guidance. With physical examination, however, clinical history can help to establish the diagnosis and guide the treatment if available. A clinician evaluating a patient who has smell and taste loss must understand that "taste" complaints usually are symptoms of an olfactory dysfunction. The distinction between true gustatory loss (bitter, sweet, salty, sour, or umami) and olfactory loss, the inability to perceive complex flavors of food, will help clarify the patient's diagnosis. Easy-to-administer tests are available for olfactory (eg, UPSIT) and gustatory testing (eg, spatial tests, taste sticks, tasting tablets). In rare circumstances, imaging studies (eg, MRI, CT) are indicated.

### Olfactory reference syndrome: a still open nosological and treatment debate [^111Vjn2B]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to report a case of olfactory reference syndrome (ORS) with several co-occurring disorders and to discuss ORS differential diagnoses, diagnostic criteria and classification.

Method

Case report.

Results

A 37-year-old married woman presented overvalued ideas of having bad breath since adolescence. She met current diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and major depressive disorder. ORS similarities and differences with some related disorders are discussed.

Conclusion

Further studies regarding symptoms, biomarkers and outcomes are needed to fully disentangle ORS from existing depressive, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders.

### Mutations in SELENBP1, encoding a novel human methanethiol oxidase, cause extraoral halitosis [^114DgnLB]. Nature Genetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Selenium-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) has been associated with several cancers, although its exact role is unknown. We show that SELENBP1 is a methanethiol oxidase (MTO), related to the MTO in methylotrophic bacteria, that converts methanethiol to H 2 O 2, formaldehyde, and H 2 S, an activity not previously known to exist in humans. We identified mutations in SELENBP1 in five patients with cabbage-like breath odor. The malodor was attributable to high levels of methanethiol and dimethylsulfide, the main odorous compounds in their breath. Elevated urinary excretion of dimethylsulfoxide was associated with MTO deficiency. Patient fibroblasts had low SELENBP1 protein levels and were deficient in MTO enzymatic activity; these effects were reversed by lentivirus-mediated expression of wild-type SELENBP1. Selenbp1-knockout mice showed biochemical characteristics similar to those in humans. Our data reveal a potentially frequent inborn error of metabolism that results from MTO deficiency and leads to a malodor syndrome.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^1178jBRW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration — mechanism and induction — reflects a perception of not getting enough air that can be induced experimentally by increasing inspiratory drive (for example with exercise, hypercapnia, or hypoxia), particularly when the capacity to satisfy ventilatory demand is limited; as ventilatory demand exceeds capacity, an imbalance develops between motor drive to breathe (corollary discharge) and afferent feedback from mechanoreceptors, which becomes increasingly unpleasant and distressing, and multiple labels have been used for this imbalance without fully capturing the neurophysiological interplay.
