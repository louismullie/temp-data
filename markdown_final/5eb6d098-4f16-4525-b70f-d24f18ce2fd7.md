## Question

Can fosfomycin be used to treat a Klebsiella urinary tract infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fosfomycin can be used to treat a Klebsiella urinary tract infection, and what the evidence and guidance say about this scenario specifically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indication and whether Klebsiella is included at all. Then, I should verify contemporary guideline positions, especially the IDSA 2024 guidance for antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacterales. Next, I will review in vitro susceptibility and laboratory testing pitfalls for Klebsiella. After that, I need to examine clinical evidence for oral and intravenous fosfomycin in Klebsiella UTIs. Then, I will distinguish management by clinical scenario, including uncomplicated cystitis versus pyelonephritis or complicated UTI, and consider pharmacokinetics. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and stewardship considerations, making sure nothing contradicts the label or guidelines before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline, because if the label excludes Klebsiella, that anchors how conservative I should be. The FDA label for oral fosfomycin tromethamine indicates use only for acute uncomplicated cystitis in women caused by susceptible Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis, explicitly noting it is not indicated for pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess and does not list Klebsiella among labeled pathogens, and it cautions against repeated daily dosing for a single episode because it does not improve outcomes and increases adverse events [^11335mYn] [^112HsPQX] [^1165FGVC].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to avoid overinterpreting in vitro data. The 2024 IDSA guidance for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections recommends nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole as preferred therapy for ESBL Enterobacterales uncomplicated cystitis and lists oral fosfomycin as an alternative for E. coli only, not for Klebsiella, and for pyelonephritis or complicated UTI it recommends TMP-SMX, fluoroquinolones, or carbapenems as preferred options and does not include oral fosfomycin as a treatment option [^115gXGo1] [^116GR3iW] [^112qCGNZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from lab results alone; I need to check Klebsiella susceptibility patterns and testing caveats. In vitro, several series report substantial fosfomycin activity against Klebsiella, including roughly 80 percent susceptibility among ESBL-producing isolates, but methods matter and the fosA enzyme common in Klebsiella can cause diffusion-based tests like Etest or disk diffusion to misclassify susceptibility, leading to major errors unless agar dilution is used, which complicates routine clinical interpretation [^113WhEj8] [^114rZhkp] [^113d6cVo] [^116SLuVi].

> Let me consider clinical outcomes with oral fosfomycin and double-check whether any randomized trials directly support use in Klebsiella cystitis. The pivotal RCTs and meta-analyses of oral fosfomycin in uncomplicated cystitis largely enrolled E. coli predominant populations and did not specifically demonstrate efficacy in Klebsiella, with one large RCT showing nitrofurantoin outperforming single-dose fosfomycin for clinical and microbiologic resolution, reinforcing that extrapolation to Klebsiella lacks high-certainty evidence [^1139v98s] [^111ZFoxh] [^116TVgfB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what about intravenous fosfomycin, especially for resistant Klebsiella in complicated infections. The ZEUS phase 2 and 3 randomized trial of IV fosfomycin for complicated UTI including acute pyelonephritis showed noninferiority to piperacillin tazobactam overall and included a Klebsiella subset, but broader confirmatory data remain limited, while small prospective cohorts in carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae reported favorable outcomes with IV fosfomycin in combination regimens and expert statements suggest considering IV fosfomycin as part of combination therapy in selected MDR cases [^112eWJ7f] [^111B2ovt] [^115LC9Cn] [^112WNmi3].

> I should now distinguish clinical scenarios carefully to avoid overgeneralization. For uncomplicated cystitis due to Klebsiella, oral fosfomycin is not recommended by IDSA and is not FDA labeled, so preferred options are agents like nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX if susceptible and alternatives like fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams as guided by susceptibility and stewardship, whereas for pyelonephritis or complicated UTI caused by Klebsiella or ESBL Klebsiella, oral fosfomycin is inappropriate and guideline-preferred therapy is TMP-SMX, fluoroquinolones, or carbapenems based on susceptibility, with consideration of IV fosfomycin only as part of combination salvage therapy in multidrug-resistant contexts [^115gXGo1] [^116GR3iW] [^11335mYn].

> Wait, I need to check pharmacokinetic suitability and exposure variability because it can explain clinical failures outside uncomplicated cystitis. Oral fosfomycin achieves very high urinary concentrations with substantial interindividual variability but limited systemic and renal parenchymal exposure, aligning with the label's exclusion of pyelonephritis and supporting why single-dose oral therapy is not appropriate for tissue-invasive disease, and repeated daily dosing for one episode is discouraged by the label due to lack of added benefit [^115JfJLz] [^11335mYn] [^1165FGVC].

> I should confirm resistance and stewardship implications before recommending off-label use. Rising fosfomycin resistance can occur with increased utilization and stewardship frameworks generally reserve fosfomycin for well-supported indications or specific pathogens like E. coli in recurrent uncomplicated cystitis, reinforcing caution against empiric or routine use for Klebsiella even when in vitro data look favorable [^115yDk7c] [^115fXgm6].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize a practical approach and I will now examine how to apply this at the bedside with verification steps. If the organism is Klebsiella causing uncomplicated cystitis, prioritize agents endorsed by guidelines when active such as nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX and avoid oral fosfomycin unless exceptional circumstances exist and alternatives are unavailable, in which case discuss off-label risks and ensure susceptibility testing was performed with a method that reliably detects fosA-mediated effects and avoid diffusion-only results; for pyelonephritis or complicated UTI due to Klebsiella, do not use oral fosfomycin and treat with TMP-SMX, fluoroquinolones, or carbapenems guided by susceptibility, reserving IV fosfomycin for combination therapy in salvage scenarios with infectious diseases consultation [^115gXGo1] [^116GR3iW] [^113d6cVo].

> But wait, what if the isolate appears susceptible and the patient cannot take preferred agents; I should double-check before making an exception. Even then, the IDSA restriction to E. coli for oral fosfomycin and the FDA labeling gap for Klebsiella mean that routine use for Klebsiella cystitis is not supported, and any off-label attempt should be rare, carefully monitored, and preceded by reliable susceptibility testing and informed consent about uncertain efficacy and potential for emergent resistance [^115gXGo1] [^11335mYn].

> Bottom line, after confirming the label, guidelines, and evidence, oral fosfomycin should not be used for Klebsiella UTIs except in rare off-label circumstances with no suitable alternatives and robust susceptibility confirmation, and intravenous fosfomycin may be considered only as part of a combination regimen for multidrug-resistant Klebsiella complicated infections in consultation with infectious diseases, given the limited and indirect evidence base [^11335mYn] [^115gXGo1] [^111B2ovt] [^112eWJ7f].

Fosfomycin is **not recommended for Klebsiella UTIs** because Klebsiella pneumoniae has only moderate susceptibility (about 80%) [^114rZhkp] and resistance emerges rapidly, especially in ESBL- or carbapenemase-producing strains [^115LC9Cn] [^113WhEj8]. The 2024 IDSA guidance **does not include fosfomycin for Klebsiella UTIs** and reserves it for E. coli [^115gXGo1] when no alternatives exist. For Klebsiella UTIs, use nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX if susceptible [^115gXGo1], with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems as alternatives [^112qCGNZ]; avoid fosfomycin unless no other options are available and susceptibility is confirmed [^116GR3iW].

---

## Susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae to fosfomycin

- **Moderate susceptibility**: Klebsiella pneumoniae shows about 80% susceptibility to fosfomycin, lower than E. coli (97%) [^114rZhkp] [^113WhEj8].

- **Resistance in ESBL/AmpC**: ESBL- or AmpC-producing Klebsiella have significantly lower susceptibility to fosfomycin.

- **Rapid resistance emergence**: Resistance can develop quickly during therapy, limiting effectiveness in Klebsiella UTIs [^115LC9Cn].

---

## Clinical efficacy of fosfomycin in klebsiella UTIs

Evidence for fosfomycin in Klebsiella UTIs is **limited and less robust than for E. coli**, with consistently lower clinical and microbiological cure rates, particularly in resistant strains. Accordingly, it is **not recommended as first-line therapy** for Klebsiella UTIs, as moderate susceptibility and rapid resistance emergence undermine effectiveness [^115gXGo1].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **IDSA 2024 guidance**: Recommends nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales [^115gXGo1]; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems are alternatives.

- **Fosfomycin for E. coli only**: IDSA lists oral fosfomycin as an alternative for E. coli only [^115gXGo1], not Klebsiella.

- **No recommendation for Klebsiella**: Fosfomycin is not recommended for Klebsiella UTIs in current guidelines.

---

## Resistance mechanisms in klebsiella pneumoniae

Klebsiella pneumoniae develops fosfomycin resistance via **plasmid-encoded FosA enzymes** that inactivate the drug [^113d6cVo], as well as efflux pump upregulation and porin mutations that reduce intracellular concentrations. These mechanisms enable **rapid selection of resistance** during therapy, limiting clinical utility [^115LC9Cn].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

In Klebsiella UTIs treated with fosfomycin, **lower cure** and **higher recurrence** are observed compared with E. coli. Resistance-driven failure occurs as rapid **resistance emergence** contributes to clinical failure and recurrence.

---

## Safety and tolerability

Fosfomycin is **generally well tolerated**; gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea and diarrhea are most commonly reported [^116TVgfB]. Serious adverse events are uncommon; however, in Klebsiella UTIs the principal limitation is the **rapid emergence of resistance**.

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

- **Nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX**: Preferred for uncomplicated cystitis if susceptible [^115gXGo1] [^1139v98s].

- **Fluoroquinolones or carbapenems**: Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems are alternatives for complicated or resistant infections [^115gXGo1] [^112qCGNZ].

- **Aminoglycosides**: Consider as alternative options [^116GR3iW] [^116FBNfn].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended antibiotics** | **Fosfomycin role** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | - Nitrofurantoin <br/> - TMP/SMX | Not recommended |
| Complicated UTIs | - Ciprofloxacin <br/> - Levofloxacin <br/> - Carbapenems | Not recommended |
| ESBL-producing Klebsiella | - Carbapenems <br/> - Aminoglycosides | Not recommended |
| Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella | - Ceftazidime-avibactam <br/> - Meropenem-vaborbactam <br/> - Cefiderocol | Not recommended |

---

Fosfomycin is **not recommended for Klebsiella UTIs** [^115gXGo1] due to moderate susceptibility and rapid resistance emergence. Use nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, fluoroquinolones, or carbapenems based on susceptibility and clinical context.

Regarding the medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, and more specifically the management of Enterobacterales infections, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend the administration of nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX as preferred options for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems should be administered as alternative options, but the latter should not be used if nitrofurantoin and TMP/SMX are active. A single-dose aminoglycoside or oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) can be administered as another alternative option.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, particularly concerning the management of Enterobacterales infections, ESBL-producing, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend several treatment protocols. Administer TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as preferred options for the treatment of pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. If resistance or toxicities preclude using TMP/SMX or fluoroquinolones, administer ertapenem, meropenem, or imipenem/cilastatin as preferred alternatives. Aminoglycosides may be administered as an alternative option when other treatments are not suitable.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of Gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^114rZhkp]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

**Susceptibility testing results**: Escherichia isolates showed very good susceptibility against fosfomycin (97.0%), nitrofurantoin (96.6%), and cefuroxime (90.5%), but poorer susceptibility against other common first-line antibiotics: co-trimoxazole (67.8%) and ciprofloxacin (75.8%). Klebsiella strains showed good susceptibility only against fosfomycin (80.4%), with other tested first-line antibiotics being poorly active (from 52.4% to 43.5%). Fosfomycin was also the most active antibiotic for Enterobacter isolates, showing 82.8% susceptibility compared to a range of 77.2% to 0.0% for the other tested first-line antibiotics. Other Gram-negative bacterial isolates were also highly susceptible to fosfomycin, with the exception of Providencia (susceptible 44.1%) and Morganella (susceptible only 16.2%). Other susceptibility results for the main groups of Gram-negative bacteria are presented in Table 1.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^116TVgfB]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

There were no significant differences between groups in adverse events not related to urinary tract infection. In the fosfomycin group, 57 out of 243 women reported 64 adverse events, whereas in the ibuprofen group, 42 out of 241 reported 51 adverse events. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and diarrhea, were reported more often in the fosfomycin group (15 versus 6). Rashes or vaginal thrush were rare.

Four patients in the ibuprofen group reported serious adverse events that required hospital admission. One incident, a gastrointestinal hemorrhage, was likely drug-related; the other three incidents were considered unrelated to the drugs. The woman with gastrointestinal hemorrhage was later found to have an undetected stomach ulcer and alcohol-induced hepatitis. Due to a misunderstanding, one woman unblinded herself without having symptoms by using the pharmacy emergency number.

Non-participants reported higher symptom scores than participants at baseline.

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections [^112qCGNZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The IDSA 2024 guidelines for managing antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, particularly Enterobacterales infections, provide specific recommendations.

- **Empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis**: If clinical improvement occurs with piperacillin/tazobactam initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales, do not change or extend antibiotic therapy.

- **Treatment options for pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs**: Consider administering TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems instead of piperacillin/tazobactam for treating ESBL-producing Enterobacterales pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs. The risk of clinical failure with piperacillin/tazobactam may be low, but these alternatives are recommended.

- **Infections outside of the urinary tract**: Avoid using piperacillin/tazobactam for treating infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, even if susceptibility to piperacillin/tazobactam is demonstrated.

### The role of challenges with fosfomycin susceptibility testing of multispecies Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates [^113d6cVo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Lastly, our data suggest that the addition of PPF may have a synergistic effect with fosfomycin against fosA-positive organisms. This is corroborated by a recently published study that found significant MIC reductions and restored fosfomycin susceptibility in fosA-positive Gram-negative organisms. PPF is available as the antiviral foscarnet but would likely be unattractive as an adjuvant therapy due to toxicity.

Our study is limited by a small sample size of bla KPC-positive multidrug-resistant isolates collected from a single center. We are unable to make inferences on non-KPC-positive isolates, as they were not included in this study. However, the clinical utility of fosfomycin is primarily against MDR isolates, and our study highlights the difficulty in accurately providing fosfomycin antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for these organisms. A further limitation is the lack of exploration of other molecular mechanisms of resistance, which were not evaluated in all isolates. Our study also lacks outcome data; therefore, we can make no conclusions on the clinical implications of fosfomycin susceptibility testing results.

In conclusion, fosfomycin appears to have reliable in vitro activity against KPC-producing Gram-negative organisms by agar dilution. However, methods readily available in a clinical microbiology laboratory, such as Etest and DD, generate frequent major errors, with the presence of fosA impacting the interpretation of these diffusion-based methods. Caution is advised when interpreting and releasing AST results derived from diffusion-based methods for these organisms.

Fosfomycin tromethamine is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) in women, due to susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. It is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess.

If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with fosfomycin tromethamine, other therapeutic agents should be selected. See the precautions and clinical studies sections for more information.

### Effect of 5-day nitrofurantoin vs single-dose fosfomycin on clinical resolution of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women: A randomized clinical trial [^1139v98s]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

The study, "Nitrofurantoin vs. fosfomycin in uncomplicated UTI", was published in 2018 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the diseases acute cystitis and acute pyelonephritis. The trial aimed to evaluate the effect of a 5-day nitrofurantoin regimen in female patients with uncomplicated UTI. It was designed as a multi-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial (RCT).

The study population comprised 513 female patients. Inclusion criteria were female patients with uncomplicated UTI. Key exclusion criteria included pregnancy and lactation, suspected upper UTI, antibiotic use or any UTI symptoms in the preceding four weeks, indwelling catheter, immunosuppression, and ongoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Oral nitrofurantoin**: 255 patients received 100 mg three times daily for five days.
	- **Oral fosfomycin**: 258 patients received a single 3 g oral dose.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in clinical resolution at 28 days after therapy completion (70% for nitrofurantoin vs. 58% for fosfomycin; absolute risk difference [ARD] of 12, 95% confidence interval [CI] of 4 to 21).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- There was a significant increase in microbiologic resolution (74% vs. 63%; ARD of 11, 95% CI of 1 to 20).
	- There was a significant increase in clinical response at 14 days (75% vs. 66%; absolute risk reduction [ARR] of 9, 95% CI of 1 to 17).

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: A position statement by the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery [^115LC9Cn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with a wide therapeutic range and excellent tissue penetration. It is frequently administered in Europe, often in combination with other antibiotics, to combat severe bacterial infections, though it is seldom used in North America. Monotherapy with fosfomycin is not recommended due to the rapid emergence of resistance.

- **Treatment options**: Both ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are effective against complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. These agents can circumvent carbapenemases that degrade penicillins, cephalosporins, first-generation beta-lactamase inhibitors, and carbapenems. New agents for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), particularly K. pneumoniae, include meropenem/vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin/relebactam. CRE typically exhibits multiple antibiotic resistance mechanisms.

- **CRE treatments**: Meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin/relebactam are active against most Enterobacterales producing K. pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC) but are not effective against those producing OXA-48-like carbapenemases.

- **MBL-producing Enterobacterales treatment**: Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are zinc-dependent enzymes that hydrolyze most beta-lactam agents, including carbapenems, except aztreonam. Ceftazidime/avibactam combined with aztreonam, or cefiderocol, are options for treating MBL-producing Enterobacterales. However, cefiderocol's efficacy in treating cIAI has not been studied. It is a novel cephalosporin that overcomes three distinct mechanisms of carbapenem resistance by avoiding porin channels and efflux pumps and entering bacterial cells via iron transport mechanisms, providing stability against all four classes of beta-lactamase.

### Fosfomycin: an old — new antibiotic [^112WqdmY]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic discovered in Spain in 1969. It exhibits bactericidal activity against a wide range of bacteria, including gram-negative microorganisms and some gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococci. Initially, fosfomycin was administered parenterally and was reserved for patients with severe infections. Today, it is frequently dispensed as fosfomycin-trometamol, an oral formulation recommended for the treatment of urinary tract infections. A single dose of fosfomycin-trometamol is indicated for the treatment of women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

### Fosfomycin for the treatment of multidrug-resistant, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing, Enterobacteriaceae infections: a systematic review [^113WhEj8]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Rising rates of resistance to antimicrobial drugs among Enterobacteriaceae limit the choice of reliably active forms of these drugs. We evaluated the evidence on fosfomycin as a treatment option for infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with advanced resistance to antimicrobial drugs, including producers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). We systematically reviewed studies evaluating the antimicrobial activity or the clinical effectiveness of fosfomycin.

Seventeen antimicrobial-susceptibility studies were found and included in our review, accounting for 5057 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae with advanced resistance to antimicrobial drugs (4448 were producers of ESBL); 11 of the 17 studies reported that at least 90% of the isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. Using a provisional minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility breakpoint of 64 mg/L or less, 1604 (96.8%) of 1657 Escherichia coli isolates producing ESBL were susceptible to fosfomycin. Similarly, 608 (81.3%) of 748 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing ESBL were susceptible to fosfomycin.

In two clinical studies, oral treatment with fosfomycin-trometamol was clinically effective against complicated or uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli in, cumulatively, 75 (93.8%) of the 80 patients evaluated. Initial clinical data support the use of fosfomycin for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by these pathogens, although further research is needed.

### Once-daily plazomicin for complicated urinary tract infections [^116FBNfn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The increasing multidrug resistance among gram-negative uropathogens necessitates new treatments for serious infections. Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside with bactericidal activity against multidrug-resistant (including carbapenem-resistant) Enterobacteriaceae.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 609 patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), including acute pyelonephritis, in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous plazomicin (15 mg per kilogram of body weight once daily) or meropenem (1 g every 8 hours). Optional oral step-down therapy was allowed after at least 4 days of intravenous therapy, for a total of 7 to 10 days of therapy. The primary objective was to show the noninferiority of plazomicin to meropenem in the treatment of complicated UTIs, including acute pyelonephritis, with a noninferiority margin of 15 percentage points. The primary endpoints were composite cure (clinical cure and microbiologic eradication) at day 5 and at the test-of-cure visit (15 to 19 days after initiation of therapy) in the microbiologic modified intention-to-treat population.

- **Results**: Plazomicin was noninferior to meropenem with respect to the primary efficacy endpoints. At day 5, composite cure was observed in 88.0% of the patients (168 of 191 patients) in the plazomicin group and in 91.4% (180 of 197 patients) in the meropenem group (difference, -3.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -10.0 to 3.1). At the test-of-cure visit, composite cure was observed in 81.7% (156 of 191 patients) and 70.1% (138 of 197 patients), respectively (difference, 11.6 percentage points).

### Fosfomycin trometamol versus comparator antibiotics for the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ZFoxh]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness and safety profile of fosfomycin versus comparator antibiotics in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis.

Relevant databases were searched using methods recommended by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. We assessed the risk of bias and confounders. The study's primary endpoint was clinical or microbiological success, defined as complete (cure) and/or incomplete resolution of symptoms at the end of treatment (improvement) and/or microbiological eradication.

After screening 539 articles, 15 were included, which recruited a total of 2,295 adult female patients. Of the studies, 14 were used for microbiological eradication analysis. We used 11 of the 15 articles for clinical resolution, involving a total of 1,976 patients, and 11 articles for safety outcome analysis, involving a total of 1,816 patients. No difference was found for clinical resolution in all comparators combined in 11 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1,976 patients (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.91–1.49, p = 0.13). No difference was found for microbiological eradication in 14 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2,052 patients (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.83–1.30, p = 0.09) or for safety outcomes in 11 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1,816 patients (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.86–1.58, p = 0.33). Most adverse effects reported for fosfomycin were transient, and single-dose therapy seems to have resulted in better patient compliance.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: Data from a unicentric study [^115t5QCS]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Against a background of rapid increase of β-lactamase-producing or multi-resistant pathogenic bacteria and the resulting lack of effective antibiotic treatment, some older antibiotics have been tested for new therapeutic uses. One of these is fosfomycin, to which these resistant bacteria are very sensitive, according to studies. Our study was designed because there is no data on the fosfomycin susceptibility rate in the Czech Republic.

- **Method**: In this study, from January 2013 to June 2014, 3295 unique isolates of Gram-negative bacteria that had caused urinary tract infections were examined. The antibiotic susceptibility was measured by a disk diffusion test. Both EUCAST and CLSI guidelines criteria (for fosfomycin only) were used for the antibiotic susceptibility evaluation.

- **Results**: The most frequently tested bacterial isolates were Escherichia coli (51.3%, n = 1703), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.4%, n = 643), and Proteus spp. (11.8%, n = 392). Among all isolates, 29.0% (n = 963) were resistant to fluoroquinolones, 11.3% (n = 374) produced extended spectrum β-lactamase, and 4.2% (n = 141) produced AmpC β-lactamase. The overall in vitro susceptibility was significantly higher for fosfomycin compared to the other tested oral antibiotics (nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and cefuroxime) against all tested Gram-negative rod isolates (excluding Morganella morgani and Acinetobacter spp. isolates). Fosfomycin also remained highly active against those isolates with extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production, with a susceptibility rate of 95.8% in Escherichia coli isolates.

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections [^111oeEbg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, particularly Enterobacterales infections that are ESBL-producing, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend not changing or extending antibiotic therapy if clinical improvement occurs with cefepime initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Avoid using cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis, complicated UTIs, and infections outside of the urinary tract when caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, even if susceptibility to cefepime is demonstrated.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^115YfPgB]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

- **Randomisation and baseline characteristics**: A total of 1,184 women with suspected urinary tract infection were screened, with 779 considered eligible, and 494 randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups. On average, 12 women per practice were included in 42 practices. Ten women with exclusion criteria were included incorrectly by general practitioners and were excluded immediately after recruitment by a masked researcher. The intention to treat population comprised 241 women in the ibuprofen group and 243 in the fosfomycin group. Three women, in whom exclusion criteria were detected later after inclusion, remained in this population. Two women in the ibuprofen group and seven in the fosfomycin group refused further participation and withdrew from the trial.

- **Participant flow**: There were no major differences in baseline characteristics between both groups. Minor differences included the duration of symptoms, with 110 (46%) women in the fosfomycin group versus 87 (36%) in the ibuprofen group having symptoms for more than two days. Urinary tract infections were reported more often by women assigned to the fosfomycin group (54 (23%) versus 42 (17%)).

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^1165FGVC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Do not use more than one single dose of fosfomycin tromethamine to treat a single episode of acute cystitis. Repeated daily doses of fosfomycin tromethamine did not improve the clinical success or microbiological eradication rates compared to single-dose therapy but did increase the incidence of adverse events. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be informed that fosfomycin tromethamine can be taken with or without food. Their symptoms should improve in two to three days after taking fosfomycin tromethamine; if not improved, the patient should contact her health care provider. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever), even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Metoclopramide**: When coadministered with fosfomycin tromethamine, metoclopramide, a drug which increases gastrointestinal motility, lowers the serum concentration and urinary excretion of fosfomycin. Other drugs that increase gastrointestinal motility may produce similar effects.
	- **Cimetidine**: Cimetidine does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fosfomycin when coadministered with fosfomycin tromethamine.

### Treatment options for multidrug-resistant Gram-negatives in urinary tract infections [^112WNmi3]. Current Opinion in Urology (2023). High credibility.

Infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria are challenging to treat because of limited treatment options and potential side effects of less frequently used anti-infectives. In the past few years, several new antimicrobial agents effective against MDR Gram-negatives have become available. This review focuses on the treatment options for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) caused by MDR Gram-negatives.

- **Recent findings**: The novel combinations of beta-lactam or carbapenem and beta-lactamase inhibitors, such as ceftazidime/avibactam and meropenem/vaborbactam, are effective for infections caused by KPC-carbapenemase-producing pathogens. Imipenem/relebactam, another carbapenem/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination, has been approved for the treatment of cUTI. However, data on the efficacy of imipenem/relebactam against carbapenem-resistant pathogens is still limited. Ceftolozane/tazobactam is mainly used for the treatment of MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. For the treatment of cUTI caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacterales, aminoglycosides or intravenous fosfomycin should be considered.

- **Summary**: To ensure prudent use and to avoid the development of resistance to novel anti-infective substances, an interdisciplinary approach, including urologists, microbiologists, and infectious disease physicians, is strongly advised.

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^116AD9zT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Fosfomycin, the active component of fosfomycin tromethamine, demonstrates in vitro activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms associated with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. It is bactericidal in urine at therapeutic doses, primarily due to its ability to inactivate the enzyme enolpyruvyl transferase. This inactivation irreversibly blocks the condensation of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine with p-enolpyruvate, a critical early step in bacterial cell wall synthesis. Additionally, fosfomycin reduces the adherence of bacteria to uroepithelial cells.

There is generally no cross-resistance between fosfomycin and other classes of antibacterial agents, such as beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.

Fosfomycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:

- **Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms**: Enterococcus faecalis
- **Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms**: Escherichia coli

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Fosfomycin exhibits in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 64 mcg/mL or less against most (≥ 90%) strains of these microorganisms; however, the safety and effectiveness of fosfomycin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^114jxgu6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Baseline variables at admission and randomization were collected using participant questionnaires and from the electronic patient file (see Supplemental Material, Protocol S1). Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to an IV–oral switch to fosfomycin–trometamol every 24 hours as a powder for solution, equivalent to 3g fosfomycin, or ciprofloxacin 0.5g every 12 hours as capsules. To ensure blinding (double-dummy), patients received an identical placebo for both active substances. The duration of antimicrobial treatment was set at 10 days, which consisted of 2–5 days empirical IV treatment and the remaining 5–8 days oral study treatment.

Patients were instructed to register the intake of study medication and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) in a paper diary. A physical appointment was planned 6–10 days after study treatment completion to assess early end points and collect urine; a telephone appointment at 30–35 days was set to assess late end points. At inclusion and during both follow-up meetings, structured questionnaires were administered regarding urinary tract and systemic symptoms, antimicrobial use, health status, and healthcare consumption.

The primary end point was clinical cure at days 6–10 post-end of treatment (PET). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with a reduction of all initial local and systemic fUTI-related symptoms, without the requirement of additional antibiotic therapy for UTI, except for antibiotic prophylaxis. In the case of an indwelling catheter, local symptoms were not counted. According to this definition, patients who did not meet the criteria for clinical cure were identified.

### Oral fosfomycin for the treatment of lower urinary tract infections among kidney transplant recipients-results of a Spanish multicenter cohort [^115DaxRA]. American Journal of Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Oral fosfomycin may constitute an alternative for the treatment of lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), particularly in view of recent safety concerns with fluoroquinolones. Specific data on the efficacy and safety of fosfomycin in KTRs are scarce. We performed a retrospective study in 14 Spanish hospitals including KTRs treated with oral fosfomycin (calcium and trometamol salts) for posttransplant cystitis between January 2005 and December 2017.

A total of 133 KTRs developed 143 episodes of cystitis. Most episodes (131 [91.6%]) were produced by gram-negative bacilli (GNB), and 78 (54.5%) were categorized as multidrug resistant (including extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae [14%] or carbapenem-resistant GNB [3.5%]). A median daily dose of 1.5 g of fosfomycin (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.5–2) was administered for a median of 7 days (IQR: 3–10). Clinical cure (remission of UTI-attributable symptoms at the end of therapy) was achieved in 83.9% (120/143) episodes. Among those episodes with follow-up urine culture, microbiological cure at month 1 was achieved in 70.2% (59/84) episodes.

Percutaneous nephrostomy was associated with a lower probability of clinical cure (adjusted odds ratio: 10.50; 95% confidence interval: 0.98–112.29; P = 0.052). In conclusion, fosfomycin is an effective orally available alternative for treating cystitis among KTRs.

### Perioperative fosfomycin disodium prophylaxis against urinary tract infection in renal transplant recipients: a randomized clinical trial [^115DNAUE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Each member of the FOS group received one 4 g dose of FOS disodium intravenously (IV) 3 hours before the following procedures: placement of the UC immediately before the RT surgery, removal of the UC, and removal of the DJS. The placebo group received saline solution 0.9% IV following the same schedule.

All RTRs received cephalothin (1 g, IV single dose) for prophylaxis before RT surgery. The UC was placed using a sterile technique, and the patients received a DJS. The type of ureteral reimplantation (extra or intravesical) was decided by the surgical team.

All participants received TMP/SMX prophylaxis at 160/800 mg (PO) daily when the estimated glomerular filtration rate, calculated according to the formula proposed by the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Epidemiology Collaboration, was ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m². It was defined as the date of DJS removal since Day 14 and UC removal since Day 2.

RTRs with high immunological risk (presence of preformed donor-specific antibodies, deceased donor, or retransplant) received induction with antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin®, Sanofi-Genzyme, Lyon, France) at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg divided into three daily doses given on consecutive days. Low-risk RTRs received induction with 20 mg basiliximab (Simulect®, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) on Days 0 and 4 after RT. Immunosuppression maintenance consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, and prednisone. All RTRs were assessed at Weeks 1, 4, 6, and 7 after RT through questioning, physical examination, evaluation of FOS- or TMP/SMX-related adverse events, and a TMP/SMX tablet count.

### Comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose antibiotics for lower urinary tract infection in pregnancy [^112YwALJ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2011). Low credibility.

To compare the efficacy of fosfomycin trometamol, cefuroxime axetil, and amoxicillin clavulanate antibiotics, researchers aimed to assess the difference in patient compliance in the treatment of urinary tract infections during pregnancy.

Between September 2007 and May 2008, 90 out of 324 pregnant women with complaints of lower urinary tract infection were enrolled in a prospective study at the outpatient clinic or were referred to the emergency department of Vakif Gureba Education and Research Hospital. Patients were randomized into three equal groups for treatment with single-dose fosfomycin trometamol or 5-day courses of amoxicillin clavulanate or cefuroxime axetil. Study data were obtained for 28, 27, and 29 patients, respectively, after follow-up.

The treatment groups did not differ significantly regarding demographics, clinical success rate, microbiological cure rate, or adverse effects. A significantly higher drug compliance was observed in the fosfomycin trometamol group compared to the other two groups (P < 0.05).

In conclusion, treatment with a single dose of fosfomycin trometamol was as effective for UTIs as the standard course of treatment with amoxicillin clavulanate or cefuroxime axetil. Fosfomycin trometamol may be a preferable treatment for UTIs because of its simpler use and better rates of compliance.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^113vMb2M]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Febrile urinary tract infections (fUTIs), defined as UTIs with systemic symptoms, frequently occur in women and are predominantly caused by Escherichia coli. Guidelines recommend treating fUTIs that require hospitalization with a 7- to 14-day course of antibiotics, which usually consists of empiric intravenous (IV) treatment preferably followed by an oral step-down treatment targeted to the susceptibility pattern of the causal uropathogen. The optimal treatment of fUTIs is hampered by the increase in multiresistant gram-negative bacteria.

While new antibiotics are being developed for the IV treatment of fUTIs, the arsenal of oral antibiotics has remained stable for decades. Based on antimicrobial resistance, 2%–5% of patients hospitalized for community-acquired fUTIs in the Netherlands cannot be treated with oral antibiotics, with even higher rates of antimicrobial resistance in other parts of the world, implying the need for prolonged IV antibiotic therapy and extended hospitalization.

Fosfomycin is a phosphoenolpyruvate analogue that is orally available as fosfomycin–trometamol. It is licensed for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women, has a good safety profile, and has in vitro activity against E. coli. Despite its increased use, persisting low resistance rates are observed against fosfomycin, up to 2%. In retrospective studies, fosfomycin appeared effective as a step-down treatment for fUTIs. Our objective in this randomized, controlled trial was to determine if fosfomycin is noninferior to ciprofloxacin for the oral step-down treatment of fUTIs caused by E. coli.

### Fosfomycin for injection (ZTI-01) versus piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection including acute pyelonephritis: ZEUS, a Phase 2/3 randomized trial [^112eWJ7f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

In this study, ZTI-01 met the primary objective of non-inferiority compared with PIP-TAZ in the treatment of hospitalized patients with cUTI/AP. ZTI-01 provides a differentiated mechanism of action with a broad spectrum of activity inclusive of Gram-negative pathogens, including ESBL-producing and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. In the era of unmet medical needs due to growing concerns pertaining to multidrug-resistant bacteria, ZTI-01 potentially offers an important novel intravenous therapeutic to the antibiotic armamentarium in the United States.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^112ADMKH]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

In our trial, ibuprofen was used to ease symptoms of urinary tract infection. An additional antimicrobial effect against E. coli has been postulated by Obad and colleagues but could not be confirmed. Currently, the same hypothesis is being investigated by Vik and colleagues.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (day 14–28) were more common in the fosfomycin group. This may be attributed to the higher number of women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections who were randomized into the fosfomycin group. Additionally, antimicrobial treatment might result in recurrent urinary tract infections; in a recent trial, women with asymptomatic bacteriuria treated with antibiotics had significantly higher rates of subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection during 12 months' follow-up than untreated women.

For external validity and to comply with routine general practice, we chose a symptomatic approach as recommended in primary care guidelines. Therefore, we did not wait for culture results before inclusion and randomization, and women with negative results on culture remained in the trial. Symptoms and results of urine tests, including the number of negative urine cultures at inclusion, were comparable with other trials in primary care. A subgroup analysis stratified for urine culture results in the ibuprofen group showed significant differences in both co-primary outcomes: women with negative results showed significantly lower symptom burden, and antibiotic use was significantly more reduced in women with positive culture results.

### Effectiveness and tolerability of intravenous fosfomycin in treating complicated urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli: a prospective cohort study from the FOSFOMIC project [^116NbyAh]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). High credibility.

The FOSFOMIC study assessed the clinical and microbiological effectiveness and safety of intravenous fosfomycin in treating complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) caused by *Escherichia coli*, in comparison with other intravenous antimicrobials.

- **Methods**: A prospective, multinational matched cohort study involving adults with community-acquired cUTIs and receiving targeted therapy with intravenous fosfomycin or other first-line drugs (beta-lactams or fluoroquinolones) was conducted from November 2019 to May 2023 in ten centers across Spain, Italy, and Türkiye. Matching criteria included the type of infection acquisition, as well as Charlson and Pitt scores. The endpoints were clinical and microbiological cure, mortality, recurrence, and adverse effects. Analyses used conditional logistic regression and the desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR).

- **Results**: Overall, 155 matched pairs were included. Clinical and microbiological cure rates were 65.2% (101/155; 95% CI, 57.4–72.2) and 63.2% (98/155; 95% CI, 55.4–70.4) with fosfomycin and comparators, respectively (adjusted OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.68–1.73; p 0.73). Mortality rates were 1.9% (3/155; 95% CI, 0.7–5.5) and 5.8% (9/155; 95% CI, 3.1–10.7), respectively (p 0.11). Recurrence rates were 14.2% (22/155; 95% CI, 9.6–20.6) in the fosfomycin group vs. 10.3% (16/155; 95% CI, 6.1–16.1) (p 0.39). Severe adverse effects occurred in 1.9% (3/155; 95% CI, 0.7–5.5) of patients treated with fosfomycin vs. 0.6% (1/155; 95% CI, 0.0–3.3) in the control group (p 0.62). Non-severe adverse effects were more frequent with fosfomycin, affecting 23.3% (36/…).

### Other antimicrobials of interest in the era of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin and tigecycline [^112KHYgF]. Clinical microbiology and infection (2008). Low credibility.

The progressive increase of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enteric bacteria in recent years has called for a re-evaluation of antibiotic therapy for these infections. The activity and potential use of two old antimicrobials, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin, and the new compound tigecycline for treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, with special emphasis on E. coli, are reviewed. Fosfomycin continues to be active against the most common uropathogens; in a recent survey from Spain, among the 428 ESBL-producing isolates, the resistance rate of E. coli to fosfomycin was 0.3%, whereas the resistance rate of K. pneumoniae was 7.2%. Other recent surveys, from other parts of the world, confirm the activity of fosfomycin against ESBL-producing E. coli.

The rate of resistance to nitrofurantoin in recent surveys in the United States and Canada was 1.1% among 1,142 isolates of E. coli from outpatient urinary isolates. However, among 115 clinical isolates of E. coli ESBL producers, only 71.3% were sensitive to nitrofurantoin. Also, E. coli resistance to nitrofurantoin has been reported to be high in a recent survey in Latin American hospitals and in Italy.

- **Tigecycline activity**: Tigecycline is a glycylcycline that circumvents efflux and ribosomal protection, the two most frequent genetic mechanisms of tetracycline resistance. The recent activity of tigecycline against 285 non-clonally related isolates expressing well-characterized ESBLs from hospital settings and the community reveals susceptibility rates for tigecycline of 97.5%.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of Gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^112hUvER]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotic susceptibility in common susceptible isolates and isolates producing β-lactamase (ESBL or AmpC) was evaluated. For E. coli isolates, only two antibiotics remained highly active against both common susceptible and β-lactamase producing isolates — fosfomycin (97.4% and 92.0%) and nitrofurantoin (97.1% and 89.6%) respectively. The susceptibility of β-lactamase producing isolates was significantly lower for all other tested first-line antibiotics (p < 0.0001).

A very similar situation was found for Enterobacter isolates. There was susceptibility of both groups only for fosfomycin, with no statistically significant decrease in β-lactamase producing isolates (p = 0.1081). Fosfomycin remained the only highly effective antibiotic against β-lactamase producing K. pneumoniae isolates; for all other tested antibiotics, β-lactamase producing isolates showed statistically significantly lower susceptibility (p < 0.0001).

- **Comparison of the susceptibility to commonly used first-line antibiotics**:
	- Comparison of common susceptible isolates with those producing β-lactamase (ESBL or AmpC).

Fosfomycin showed relatively good activity against Proteus isolates which are primarily resistant. Further comparisons of the commonly susceptible and β-lactamase producing isolates are presented in the removed table.

### High interindividual variability in urinary fosfomycin concentrations in healthy female volunteers [^115JfJLz]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin is increasingly being prescribed for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in an era of emerging drug resistance. Surprisingly, little is known about the urinary concentrations of fosfomycin and its interindividual variation after the standard single 3-g oral dose. We aimed to gain more insight into urinary fosfomycin pharmacokinetics to evaluate its effectiveness.

- **Methods**: Three grams of fosfomycin trometamol was administered to 40 healthy female volunteers with an estimated mean glomerular filtration rate of > 90 mL/min/1.73 m². Urine samples were collected from every urination during 48 hours, and then twice daily for up to 7 days. Time, volume, and pH were recorded. Concentrations were quantified with UPLC-MS/MS. Effectiveness was evaluated based on urinary concentrations and the target MIC of E. coli, the most common uropathogen.

- **Results**: A high interindividual variability was found. Peak concentration was 1982.0 ± 1257.4 mg/L, urinary half-life 12.4 ± 5.7 hours, and excretion rate over 48 hours 29.9 ± 7.1 mg/h. Recovery was 44.5 ± 12.6% after 48 hours and 47.0 ± 10.4% after 7 days. Concentrations remained above the EUCAST breakpoint of 32 mg/L in 100% of the volunteers over the first 24 hours, 67.5% for 48 hours, and 30% for 72 hours. A high urinary output was associated with low urinary concentrations and consequently reduced time > MIC, AUC 0–7days /MIC, and C max /MIC values.

- **Conclusions**: Considerable interindividual variability observed in the pharmacokinetics of fosfomycin signifies a risk for inadequate drug exposure.

### Cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections caused by Gram-negative uropathogens: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^117PCWDx]. The Lancet. Infectious Diseases (2018). High credibility.

Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria represent the highest priority for addressing global antibiotic resistance. Cefiderocol (S-649266), a new siderophore cephalosporin, has broad activity against Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, including carbapenem-resistant strains. We assessed the efficacy and safety of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections in patients at risk of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections.

- **Methods**: We conducted a phase 2, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group non-inferiority trial at 67 hospitals in 15 countries. Adults (≥ 18 years) admitted to the hospital with a clinical diagnosis of complicated urinary tract infection with or without pyelonephritis, or those with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis, were randomly assigned (2:1) by an interactive web or voice response system to receive 1-hour intravenous infusions of cefiderocol (2 g) or imipenem-cilastatin (1 g each) three times daily, every 8 hours over 7–14 days. Patients were excluded if they had a baseline urine culture with more than two uropathogens, a fungal urinary tract infection, or pathogens known to be carbapenem resistant. The primary endpoint was the composite of clinical and microbiological outcomes at the test of cure (i.e. 7 days after treatment cessation), which was used to establish non-inferiority with 15% and 20% margins of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin. The primary efficacy analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat population.

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^116HbXnC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Do not use more than a single dose of fosfomycin tromethamine to treat a single episode of acute cystitis. Repeated daily doses of fosfomycin tromethamine do not improve clinical success or microbiological eradication rates compared to single-dose therapy but do increase the incidence of adverse events. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be informed that fosfomycin tromethamine can be taken with or without food and that their symptoms should improve in two to three days after taking it. If symptoms do not improve, patients should contact their healthcare provider. Diarrhea is a common issue caused by antibiotics, usually resolving when the antibiotic is discontinued. However, patients may develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after taking the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, they should contact their physician as soon as possible.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Metoclopramide**: When coadministered with fosfomycin tromethamine, metoclopramide — a drug that increases gastrointestinal motility — lowers the serum concentration and urinary excretion of fosfomycin. Other drugs that increase gastrointestinal motility may produce similar effects.
	- **Cimetidine**: Cimetidine does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fosfomycin when coadministered with fosfomycin tromethamine.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^112z2qrN]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

In a cohort of 126 patients who underwent urodynamic study (UDS), urinary tract infections (UTIs) were diagnosed in 26 cases (20.9%) — 14 (22.2%) from the levofloxacin group and 12 (19%) from the fosfomycin group — indicating no significant difference in incidence rates between the two groups (p = 0.660). The absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the levofloxacin and fosfomycin groups was 3.2% (22.2% - 19%). The relative effect size, expressed as an odds ratio (OR), was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.4–1.95). Of those with UTI, 17 were male — 10 from the levofloxacin group and 7 from the fosfomycin group.

Symptomatic UTIs were observed in six (4.8%) patients in the levofloxacin group and in seven (5.6%) patients in the fosfomycin group. The relative risk for symptomatic UTI was 1.17 (95% CI: 0.4–3.5), with an ARR of 0.8% (5.6% - 4.8%). No subgroup or adjusted analyses were performed as this was not pre-specified in the protocol. Harms and unintended effects were minimal in both groups. Three participants (4.76%) in the levofloxacin group reported mild nausea, which resolved without intervention. In the fosfomycin group, two participants (3.17%) reported mild nausea. No serious adverse events were observed during the study period.

E. coli was the most frequently identified bacterium in urine cultures, followed by K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Additionally, 10 patients with UTI showed no bacterial growth in their urine culture/isolation.

### Evaluation of the commercial AD fosfomycin test for susceptibility testing of multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^116SLuVi]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Low credibility.

To compare fosfomycin susceptibility testing with the commercial agar dilution (AD) test, AD Fosfomycin (Liofilchem, Roseto degli Abruzzi, Italy), and the reference AD method, a collection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates was used.

- **Methods**: The collection included 119 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, 53 Enterobacterales producing acquired AmpC-type and/or extended-spectrum β-lactamases, and 38 carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa, including representatives of different high-risk clones. Both AD Fosfomycin and the AD reference method (ISO 20776–1:2019) were performed starting from the same microbial suspension. Results were interpreted according to EUCAST clinical breakpoints (10.0). Essential agreement (EA), category agreement (CA), and error rates were calculated as described by the International Organization for Standardization.

- **Results**: Of 172 Enterobacterales, 143 (83.1%, including 92.9% [52 of 56] of the NDM-producers and 84.2% [48 of 57] of the KPC-producers) were susceptible to fosfomycin using the reference AD. A CA of 91.9% (158 of 172; 95% CI 87.1%-95.3%) and an EA of 92.5% (136 of 147; 95% CI 87.4%-96.0%) were calculated for the commercial AD Fosfomycin test, with 9.8% (14 of 128) of major errors and no very major errors (0 of 29). Overall, 86.8% (33 of 38) of P. aeruginosa showed a fosfomycin MIC ≤ 128 mg/L using the reference AD. An EA of 84.8% (95% CI 66.3%-92.0%) was calculated for the commercial AD Fosfomycin test, with a CA of 100% (95% CI 93.6%-100%) when considering a tentative break.

### Perioperative fosfomycin disodium prophylaxis against urinary tract infection in renal transplant recipients: a randomized clinical trial [^116d6ERM]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

The antimicrobial susceptibility of all isolates to FOS was 72%; FOS group had 62% and placebo group had 77% (P = 0.45), and susceptibility to TMP/SMX was 5% with 8% in the FOS group and 4% in the placebo group (P = 1), see Supplementary Data.

We recovered 19 (48.7%) extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates in the entire cohort; 6 out of 13 in the FOS group and 13 out of 26 in the placebo group (P = 0.82).

Ten of the 15 E. coli isolates (66.7%) were ESBL-producing, distributed equally between the groups: 2 out of 3 in the FOS group and 8 out of 12 in the placebo group (P = 1). All ESBL-producing and non-producing E. coli isolates were susceptible to FOS, with only one isolate from the placebo group being susceptible to TMP/SMX.

Nine of the 15 Klebsiella spp. isolates were ESBL-producing (60%); 4 out of 5 in the FOS group and 5 out of 10 in the placebo group (P = 0.26). Among these, three isolates from the FOS group and three from the placebo group were sensitive to FOS. No ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. isolate was susceptible to TMP/SMX.

### Fosfomycin for injection (ZTI-01) versus piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection including acute pyelonephritis: ZEUS, a phase 2/3 randomized trial [^111EAchn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoints were largely consistent across various baseline patient characteristics. Clinical cure rates were over 90% in both treatment groups at TOC in MITT, m-MITT, CE, and ME groups.

Baseline cUTI/AP caused by a baseline pathogen that was resistant to PIP-TAZ was uncommon (14 ZTI-01 patients, 9 PIP-TAZ patients). Of the 9 PIP-TAZ patients infected with a PIP-TAZ-resistant pathogen, 33.3% were clinical cures compared with 78.6% of ZTI-01 treated patients. Among patients infected with a PIP-TAZ-susceptible uropathogen at baseline, overall success rates were similar to those observed in the primary endpoint analysis (TOC, 64.7% ZTI-01, 56.7% PIP-TAZ).

- **Microbiology**: Most patients (92.4% ZTI-01, 94.4% PIP-TAZ, m-MITT) had a monomicrobial Gram-negative infection at baseline. The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli (72.3% ZTI-01, 74.7% PIP-TAZ) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.7% ZTI-01, 14.0% PIP-TAZ). All tested E. coli isolates in the ZTI-01 group were susceptible (provisional breakpoint MIC of ≤ 64 μg/mL), and 97.0% were susceptible to PIP-TAZ (MIC ≤ 16 μg/mL).

Overall success, with pathogens typed using PFGE analysis at TOC in m-MITT, occurred in 96/133 (72.2%) ZTI-01 and 77/133 (57.9%) PIP-TAZ patients who were infected with E. coli at baseline. Additionally, in patients who were infected at baseline with K. pneumoniae, success was seen in 17/27 (63.0%) ZTI-01 and 13/25 (52.0%) PIP-TAZ patients.

### The role of fosfomycin for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections [^116rLZrN]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

In the last decade, there has been increasing interest in using fosfomycin for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative (MDR-GNB) infections, especially when few or no other active alternatives remain available.

- **Recent findings**: Fosfomycin may remain active against a considerable proportion of MDR-GNB. Observational studies describe a possible curative effect of oral fosfomycin monotherapy for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) and bacterial prostatitis caused by MDR-GNB. In contrast, intravenous fosfomycin has been mostly used in combination with other agents for various severe MDR-GNB infections. The ZEUS randomized controlled trial (RCT) has started to provide high-level evidence about the possible use of fosfomycin for complicated UTI caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing GNB, but no results of large RCTs are currently available to firmly guide the use of fosfomycin for carbapenem-resistant GNB.

- **Summary**: Fosfomycin is an important therapeutic option for MDR-GNB infections. Further pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and clinical research is needed to optimize its use.

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^115WNHFu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Fosfomycin, the active component of fosfomycin tromethamine, exhibits in vitro activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms associated with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. At therapeutic doses, fosfomycin is bactericidal in urine. This bactericidal action is due to the inactivation of the enzyme enolpyruvyl transferase, which irreversibly blocks the condensation of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine with p-enolpyruvate, a key step in bacterial cell wall synthesis. Fosfomycin also reduces the adherence of bacteria to uroepithelial cells.

There is generally no cross-resistance between fosfomycin and other classes of antibacterial agents such as beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.

Fosfomycin has demonstrated activity against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the indications and usage section:

- **Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms**: Enterococcus faecalis
- **Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms**: Escherichia coli

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Fosfomycin exhibits in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 64 mcg/mL or less against most (≥ 90%) strains of the following microorganisms. However, the safety and effectiveness of fosfomycin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials:

- **Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms**: Enterococcus faecium

### Clinical management of an increasing threat: Outpatient urinary tract infections due to multidrug-resistant uropathogens [^115H9zXq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most commonly treated bacterial infections. Over the past decade, antimicrobial resistance has become an increasingly common factor in the management of outpatient UTIs. As treatment options for multidrug-resistant (MDR) uropathogens are limited, clinicians need to be aware of specific clinical and epidemiological risk factors for these infections. Based on available literature, the activity of fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin remains high for most cases of MDR Escherichia coli UTIs. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole retains clinical efficacy, but resistance rates are increasing internationally. Beta-lactam agents have the highest rates of resistance and lowest rates of clinical success. Fluoroquinolones have high resistance rates among MDR uropathogens and are being strongly discouraged as first-line agents for UTIs. In addition to accounting for local resistance rates, consideration of patient risk factors for resistance and pharmacological principles will help guide optimal empiric treatment of outpatient UTIs.

### Incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella infections in the United States: A systematic literature review [^115Z7Ysg]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite a reported worldwide increase, the incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella infections in the United States is unknown. Understanding the incidence and trends of ESBL infections will aid in directing research and prevention efforts.

- **Objective**: To perform a literature review to identify the incidence of ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella infections in the United States.

- **Design**: Systematic literature review.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE via Ovid, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for multicenter (≥ 2 sites), US studies published between 2000 and 2015 that evaluated the incidence of ESBL-E. coli or ESBL-Klebsiella infections. We excluded studies that examined resistance rates alone or did not have a denominator that included uninfected patients such as patient days, device days, number of admissions, or number of discharges. Additionally, articles that were not written in English, contained duplicated data, or pertained to ESBL organisms from food, animals, or the environment were excluded.

- **Results**: Among 51,419 studies examined, 9 were included for review. Incidence rates differed by patient population, time, and ESBL definition and ranged from 0 infections per 100,000 patient days to 16.64 infections per 10,000 discharges, and incidence rates increased over time from 1997 to 2011. Rates were slightly higher for ESBL-Klebsiella infections than for ESBL-E. coli infections.

- **Conclusion**: The incidence of ESBL-E. coli and ESBL-Klebsiella infections in the United States has been increasing over the years.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^115c7V6k]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding clinical indications for urodynamic studies (UDS), 69 patients (54.8%) had lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), 41 patients (32.8%) had overactive bladder (OAB), 11 patients (8.9%) had underactive bladder, and 5 patients (3.5%) had stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The distribution of these diagnoses between the treatment groups is detailed in Table 1. Based on chi-square analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of clinical diagnoses between the fosfomycin and levofloxacin groups (p = 0.068). This indicates that randomization was generally adequate in balancing baseline clinical characteristics across both groups.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^111HMGzT]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin (Phosphomycin), introduced in 1969, is characterized as an anti-cell wall bactericidal antibiotic with a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It was used for many years as a highly effective antimicrobial drug, especially for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, with the advent of new antibiotics such as β-lactams or fluoroquinolones, it became somewhat obsolete.

In the past decade, there have been reports of a rapid increase in resistant pathogens, including extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers and multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, defined as non-susceptible to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories. Due to the lack of an effective antimicrobial drug for these cases, some older antibiotics were tested to evaluate their effectiveness against multi-resistant bacteria. Fosfomycin, in particular, has shown very good in vitro activity against resistant bacteria such as ESBL-producers, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). All this evidence has generated higher interest in the use of fosfomycin in the last 5 years.

Fosfomycin had long been unavailable in the Czech Republic but has been available as the per-oral formulation fosfomycin trometamol since October 2014.

### Antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired urine bacterial isolates in French Amazonia [^114m7WKZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). High credibility.

Enterobacterales were resistant to amoxicillin in 70.9%, to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 25.2%, and to cefotaxime in 5.9% of cases. Interestingly, they were sensitive to fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin in 98% and 86% of cases, respectively. Therefore, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin seem to be reasonable options for empirical treatment of uncomplicated UTIs, as they are active against common causes of UTIs, mainly E. coli, whereas nonfermentative GNRs are naturally resistant. Overall, resistance to these two antibiotics is uncommon in Enterobacterales, and many multidrug-resistant organisms retain susceptibility.

On the other hand, fluoroquinolones were active against 90% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates. They were reported as effective for clinical and microbiological cures in patients with uncomplicated UTIs. However, they should be spared in first- and second-line UTI treatment due to their selection pressure and should be reserved for more severe infections.

- **Susceptibility trends**: our study shows that Enterobacterales exhibited a decreasing susceptibility profile over time for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, and nitrofurantoin. In contrast, the susceptibility trends for gentamycin and ofloxacin were stable. This can be explained by the antibiotic pressure in the community.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of Gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^115yDk7c]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The evaluation of overall antibiotic susceptibility in relation to patient status revealed significantly lower resistance in bacterial isolates from ambulatory patients compared to those of hospitalized patients. With the exception of ICU isolates, using resistance of 10% as the limit for use as a first-line option for empirical therapy in non-life-threatening infections, only fosfomycin seems to have adequate coverage among agents suitable for oral therapy. Our study did not include samples from the community (from GPs), which is why our samples exhibited higher resistance.

Our results demonstrated fosfomycin trometamol as a promising antibiotic for urinary tract infections in our country. However, according to some published studies, the increasing use of fosfomycin worldwide has led to elevated levels of resistance in isolates. For instance, a Spanish study detected an increase in fosfomycin resistance in Escherichia coli isolates from 0.0% in 2005 to 14.4% in 2011. A change in the guidelines for UTI therapy is deemed necessary to prevent this side effect of widespread fosfomycin trometamol use for UTIs. We foresee the primary future benefit of an oral fosfomycin formulation in our fosfomycin-naive population in treating specific groups of patients with non-life-threatening urinary tract infections, such as those with long-term stents often colonized by multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. These patients frequently face chronic urinary tract infections and, after successful intravenous antibiotic therapy during hospitalization, should continue to be monitored.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^114C7B8i]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

The ICUTI (Immediate versus Conditional Treatment of Urinary Tract Infection) was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter comparative effectiveness trial with two parallel active treatment arms: ibuprofen and fosfomycin. The study adhered to the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Safety data were monitored throughout and assessed every six months by the data and safety monitoring board. Serious adverse events were defined as those leading to hospital admission, disability, permanent damage, or risk of death.

The detailed study protocol has been published elsewhere. From February 2012 to February 2014, practice staff and general practitioners in 42 general practices in northern Germany systematically approached women aged 18–65 with typical symptoms of urinary tract infection for consent. The upper age limit was chosen because, until 2013, fosfomycin was approved only for patients up to age 65.

This study was designed as a pragmatic trial in a general practice setting. Inclusion criteria were dysuria and/or frequency/urgency of micturition, with or without lower abdominal pain. The main exclusion criteria included any signs of upper urinary tract infection (such as fever or loin tenderness), conditions that could increase the risk of potentially complicated courses (such as pregnancy or renal diseases), urinary tract infection within the past two weeks, and urinary catheterisation. We also excluded patients currently treated with non-steroidal drugs for pain or antibiotics.

### Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria in urinary tract infections in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vQM8j]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

In the systematic review and meta-analysis, the predominant ESBL-producing pathogens were Klebsiella spp. and E. coli, with pooled prevalence estimates of 43.91% and 31.14%, respectively. Similarly, the predominant carbapenemase producer was Klebsiella spp. (17.78%), followed by E. coli (11.42%). These findings are consistent with those of other reported systematic reviews of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria in Ethiopia. Additionally, they align with meta-analyses conducted on pediatric UTIs globally, as well as in countries like Thailand, Nepal, India, Turkey, and Italy, which reported that K. pneumoniae and E. coli were the predominant ESBL-producing pathogens among gram-negative bacteria in urine.

Klebsiella spp., particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae, poses a significant public health threat as a common, severe MDR pathogen in the ESKAPE group, alongside Enterococcus, S. aureus, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species. These pathogens are common in both developed and developing countries. Cephalosporins and carbapenems, vital for treating gram-negative bacterial infections, including those from Klebsiella spp. and E. coli, have lost efficacy due to widespread resistance genes like ESBLs and carbapenemases. The predominance of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella spp. and E. coli in this systematic review and meta-analysis, as well as many other systematic reviews, may be due to these pathogens being mostly multidrug-resistant because of the production of those enzymes. These pathogens are ubiquitous and considered "One Health" concerns.

### Intravenous fosfomycin for the treatment of nosocomial infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in critically ill patients: A prospective evaluation [^111B2ovt]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections as a result of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens remain a serious problem in critically ill patients. Adult ICU patients who received intravenous fosfomycin were prospectively examined to assess its safety and effectiveness as an adjunct to the antimicrobial therapy of life-threatening infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Fosfomycin was administered intravenously in 11 patients for treatment of hospital-acquired infections caused by carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. Fosfomycin (2–4 g every 6 h) was administered in combination with other antibiotics. The mean ± SD duration of treatment was 14 ± 5.6 days. All patients had good bacteriological and clinical outcomes of infection. All-cause hospital mortality was two out of 11 (18.2%) patients. No patient experienced adverse events related to the administration of fosfomycin. Intravenous fosfomycin may be a beneficial and safe adjunctive treatment in the management of life-threatening ICU-acquired infections caused by carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^111Sijk9]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

The safety profile of ibuprofen versus fosfomycin showed differences in complication rates between the groups. There were five cases of pyelonephritis in the ibuprofen group compared to one case in the fosfomycin group (P = 0.12). Women who developed pyelonephritis had a higher initial symptom score than average (7.5 versus 6). Five women with pyelonephritis consulted their general practitioners because of symptoms indicative of upper urinary tract infections, such as fever and loin tenderness, within the first seven days, with one case on day 16. All women were treated as outpatients and achieved full recovery.

The rate of recurrent urinary tract infection was similar across both groups. However, there were significantly more recurrences after day 14 in the fosfomycin group (11% versus 6% in the ibuprofen group, P = 0.049). Of these recurrences, 5 out of 14 women (36%) in the ibuprofen group had a prior history of recurring urinary tract infections, compared to 16 out of 27 women (60%) in the fosfomycin group. Conversely, more women in the ibuprofen group experienced early symptom relapses (up to day 14), though this difference was not statistically significant (5% versus 3%; P = 0.18).
