## Question

A 55-year-old man presents after an episode of severe left ankle pain. The pain has resolved, but he decided to come in for evaluation as he has had pain like this before. He says he has experienced similar episodes of intense pain in the same ankle and his left knee in the past, which he associates with eating copious amounts of fatty food during parties. On one occasion the pain was so excruciating, he went to the emergency room, where an arthrocentesis was performed, revealing needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals and a high neutrophil count in the synovial fluid. His past medical history is relevant for essential hypertension which is managed with hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg/day. His vital signs are stable, and his body temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F). Physical examination shows a minimally tender left ankle with full range of motion. Which of the following is the most appropriate long-term treatment in this patient?\\n
A. Colchicine
B. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
C. Intra-articular steroid injection
D. Xanthine oxidase inhibitor

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate long-term treatment for a 55-year-old man with recurrent gout flares who is currently taking hydrochlorothiazide. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and disease severity. Then, I should verify indications for urate-lowering therapy and the role of treat-to-target serum urate. Next, I will examine medication contributors, especially thiazide diuretics, and whether to switch. After that, I need to choose among urate-lowering options and consider cardiovascular safety. Finally, I should plan anti-inflammatory prophylaxis during ULT initiation and outline monitoring and patient education, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. The synovial fluid analysis showing needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals with a neutrophil-rich inflammatory response is pathognomonic for monosodium urate crystal deposition disease, i.e., gout, and the history of recurrent flares in multiple joints supports chronic intermittent gout rather than a single isolated attack, which is clinically relevant for long-term management decisions [^11588AtF].

> Now, I need to check whether he meets criteria for urate-lowering therapy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the thresholds. The ACR 2020 guideline strongly recommends initiating ULT for frequent flares, defined as two or more per year, and also for tophi, radiographic damage, or chronic gouty arthritis; this patient has recurrent flares and thus meets a strong indication for ULT, and a treat-to-target strategy with maintenance of serum urate below 6 mg/dL is recommended to promote crystal dissolution and prevent recurrence [^115C6rnR] [^114VoGtr] [^116z9DFQ] [^1155wEsg].

> Wait, let me verify the role of his antihypertensive therapy. Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, raise serum uric acid and are associated with an approximately twofold increased risk of incident gout; both ACR 2020 and EULAR 2017 recommend substituting thiazides when feasible in patients with gout, and hypertension guidelines emphasize monitoring uric acid in patients with a history of gout unless they are on urate-lowering therapy, so I should consider switching HCTZ to an alternative agent such as an ARB or CCB if clinically appropriate [^1134yxdF] [^117UowUD] [^114Z3kxS] [^1172SeSg].

> Next, I should review which urate-lowering agent to choose. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is first-line and preferred over febuxostat in most patients because of comparable efficacy and a more favorable cardiovascular safety profile; febuxostat carries a boxed warning for increased cardiovascular death in comparative trials, so I should avoid it unless there is a compelling reason and allopurinol is not tolerated or contraindicated, and I should start low and titrate to target urate per treat-to-target principles [^116EC67m] [^11588AtF] [^1155wEsg].

> I will now examine the timing of ULT initiation. The ACR conditionally recommends starting ULT during a flare if the decision to start has been made, but I need to ensure adequate anti-inflammatory coverage to prevent flare exacerbation. Given this patient is currently not in a severe acute flare, starting now with prophylaxis is reasonable, though if he were actively flaring I would intensify acute therapy first and then proceed with ULT [^113LGkbn] [^11329roc].

> Hold on, I should verify prophylaxis details. When initiating ULT, concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis is strongly recommended for at least 3–6 months to reduce flare risk, with low-dose colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily as a common first choice, NSAIDs as an alternative if no contraindications, and prednisone/prednisolone as another option. I should tailor to comorbidities, renal function, and drug interactions, and continue prophylaxis until serum urate is at target and flares are controlled [^116Tdtmx] [^111RqG5r] [^117QyWfG] [^112D3qBA].

> Let me consider the long-term strategy and targets. I should confirm that therapy aims to maintain serum urate below 6 mg/dL lifelong, with consideration of a lower target, such as below 5 mg/dL, in patients with severe disease features like tophi or chronic arthropathy to accelerate crystal dissolution. I also need to ensure indefinite continuation of ULT once initiated, as stopping increases relapse risk and crystal burden may reaccumulate [^116z9DFQ] [^114N8dyy] [^11452vHk].

> But wait, what about the distractors in the answer choices. NSAIDs and colchicine are excellent for acute flares and for prophylaxis during ULT initiation, but they do not lower serum urate and therefore are not the correct long-term disease-modifying answer; intra-articular steroids treat acute inflammation but likewise do not reduce uric acid burden, so they are not appropriate as sole long-term therapy in this scenario [^115ALujz] [^1139UKZq] [^116EC67m].

> I should double-check patient education and monitoring. I need to counsel on lifelong ULT adherence, diet and alcohol moderation, and the need for periodic serum urate checks to titrate therapy toward target; I should also review comorbidities and medications that worsen hyperuricemia, and coordinate with cardiology or primary care if adjusting antihypertensives to sustain both blood pressure control and gout control [^114WLg4T] [^1122onV5] [^114Z3kxS].

> Final answer: The most appropriate long-term treatment is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, with allopurinol as first-line, started at a low dose and titrated to achieve and maintain serum urate below 6 mg/dL, alongside concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for 3–6 months and consideration of switching hydrochlorothiazide to an alternative antihypertensive when feasible [^116EC67m] [^1155wEsg] [^116Tdtmx] [^1134yxdF].

---

The most appropriate long-term treatment is a **xanthine oxidase inhibitor** (allopurinol or febuxostat) to lower serum urate and prevent future flares, with a treat-to-target strategy of maintaining serum urate **< 6 mg/dL** [^1155wEsg] [^116z9DFQ]. Initiate **colchicine prophylaxis** (0.5–1 mg/day) for at least 3–6 months to prevent flares during urate lowering, and switch hydrochlorothiazide to an alternative antihypertensive if feasible, as thiazides raise uric acid [^116Tdtmx] [^1134yxdF]. NSAIDs and intra-articular steroids are for acute flares, not long-term control [^115ALujz].

---

## Indications for long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT)

According to the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines, ULT is indicated for patients with **recurrent flares (≥ 2/year)** [^114VoGtr], tophi, chronic gouty arthritis, or radiographic joint damage attributable to gout [^115C6rnR]. The patient has recurrent flares and thus meets criteria for long-term ULT [^115C6rnR].

---

## First-line pharmacologic therapy: xanthine oxidase inhibitors

Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs), such as allopurinol and febuxostat, are the **first-line pharmacologic therapy** for long-term gout management [^11588AtF]. These agents reduce uric acid production, thereby lowering serum urate levels and preventing crystal deposition and future flares [^116EC67m].

- **Allopurinol**: Preferred first-line agent due to its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Start at a low dose (100 mg/day) and titrate every 2–4 weeks until serum urate is < 6 mg/dL [^116Rkf8r].

- **Febuxostat**: Alternative XOI, particularly useful in patients intolerant to allopurinol. However, recent guidelines caution against its routine use due to potential cardiovascular risks compared to allopurinol [^116EC67m].

---

## Treat-to-target strategy

A treat-to-target approach is strongly recommended, aiming to **maintain serum urate < 6 mg/dL** [^1155wEsg] [^116z9DFQ]. This target level promotes dissolution of existing monosodium urate crystals and prevents future flares [^111hYypL]. Regular monitoring of serum urate levels and dose titration of XOIs are essential to achieve and maintain this target [^1155wEsg].

---

## Adjunctive anti-inflammatory prophylaxis

Initiating ULT can transiently increase the risk of gout flares. Therefore, **anti-inflammatory prophylaxis** is recommended during the initial months of ULT [^111RqG5r]. Colchicine (0.5–1 mg/day) is the preferred prophylactic agent, with NSAIDs or low-dose prednisone as alternatives if colchicine is contraindicated or not tolerated [^112D3qBA] [^114o8nJD] [^116Tdtmx]. Prophylaxis should continue for at least 3–6 months after achieving target serum urate, or longer if flares persist [^11588AtF] [^116Tdtmx].

---

## Lifestyle modifications and management of comorbidities

Lifestyle modifications are integral to long-term gout management. Weight loss, dietary changes (limiting purine-rich foods, alcohol, and sugary beverages), and increased hydration are recommended [^11588AtF]. Additionally, **managing comorbidities**, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, is essential [^111yGxST]. In this patient, hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, is a known risk factor for hyperuricemia and gout flares [^11588AtF] [^116EC67m]. If feasible, switching to an alternative antihypertensive agent (e.g. losartan, which has uricosuric properties) is recommended [^11588AtF] [^117UowUD].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor serum urate levels, assess treatment response, and adjust therapy accordingly [^1155wEsg]. The ACR guidelines recommend maintaining serum urate **< 6 mg/dL** and continuing ULT indefinitely once initiated [^11452vHk].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) | Allopurinol (first-line) or febuxostat (alternative) |
| Serum urate target | < 6 mg/dL |
| Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis | Colchicine (0.5–1 mg/day) for 3–6 months |
| Lifestyle modifications | - Weight loss <br/> - Dietary changes <br/> - Hydration |
| Management of comorbidities | Switch hydrochlorothiazide if feasible |
| Monitoring | Regular serum urate and clinical follow-up |

---

The most appropriate long-term treatment for this patient is initiation of a **xanthine oxidase inhibitor** (allopurinol preferred) with a treat-to-target strategy to maintain serum urate **< 6 mg/dL** [^1155wEsg]. Adjunctive colchicine prophylaxis and lifestyle modifications, including switching hydrochlorothiazide if feasible, are essential components of management [^116Tdtmx] [^1134yxdF].

### Gout… [^115kppdJ]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of pain in a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint, caused by the deposition of needle-shaped crystals of the monosodium salt of uric acid. Pain typically comes on rapidly, reaching maximal intensity in less than 12 hours. In about half of cases, the joint at the base of the big toe is affected. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or kidney damage. Gout is due to persistently elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs from a combination of diet, other health problems, and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who regularly drink beer or sugar-sweetened beverages; eat foods that are high in purines such as liver, shellfish, or anchovies; or are overweight.

Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by the presence of crystals in the joint fluid or in a deposit outside the joint. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack. Signs and symptoms Gout can present in several ways, although the most common is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis. The metatarsophalangeal joint at the base of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. It can also involve midfoot structures, including the cuneiform bones. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists, and fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins during the night and peaks within 24 hours of onset. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including fatigue and high fever. Long-standing elevated uric acid levels may result in other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals called tophi.

Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. Elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in kidney stone formation and subsequent acute uric acid nephropathy. Lifestyle Dietary causes account for about 12% of gout, and include a strong association with the consumption of alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages, meat, and seafood. The dietary mechanisms and nutritional basis involved in gout provide evidence for strategies of prevention and improvement of gout, and dietary modifications based on effective regulatory mechanisms may be a promising strategy to reduce the high prevalence of gout. Among foods richest in purines yielding high amounts of uric acid are dried anchovies, shrimp, organ meat, dried mushrooms, seaweed, and beer yeast. Chicken and potatoes also appear related. Other triggers include physical trauma and surgery. Studies in the early 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant.

Specifically, a diet with moderate purine-rich vegetables is not associated with gout. Neither is total dietary protein. Alcohol consumption is strongly associated with increased risk, with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer or spirits. Eating skim milk powder enriched with glycomacropeptide and G600 milk fat extract may reduce pain but may result in diarrhea and nausea. Medical conditions Gout frequently occurs in combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants, and myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index greater than or equal to 35 increases male risk of gout threefold.

### Metabolic diseases: gout [^115p6xbF]. Clinics in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Gout is a disease of antiquity but is increasing once again in prevalence despite availability of reasonably effective treatments. This may be related to a combination of factors, including diet, obesity, and diuretic use. Allergic reactions, noncompliance, drug interactions, and sometimes inefficacy all limit the effective use of current hypouricemic agents. There are new treatments for gout on the horizon, including febuxostat, a nonpurine inhibitor of xanthine oxidase with a potentially better combination of efficacy and side effects than allopurinol. Diagnostic progress is being made in that ultrasound may offer a noninvasive means of diagnosing tophaceous deposits in and around joints. The increasing prevalence of gout means that dermatologists will see more cutaneous manifestations of gout, including tophi, draining sinus tracts, panniculitis, and dystrophic calcifications.

Gout is a common disorder with clinical signs and symptoms resulting from inflammatory responses to monosodium urate crystals deposited in tissues from extracellular fluids saturated for urate. Long-term management of gout focuses on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic means to achieve and maintain serum urate levels in a subsaturating range. Despite a firm understanding of gout pathophysiology, means to achieve certain diagnosis, and a variety of effective therapies, treatment outcomes remain suboptimal. In this review, available nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies for chronic gout are discussed and a framework is provided for successful achievement and maintenance of goal-range serum urate levels.

### An update on the management of gout [^114tvpxq]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and its incidence in the UK has steadily increased from 1.5% in 1997 to 2.5% in 2012. 1,2 It is characterised by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues and usually presents with intermittent painful attacks followed by long periods of remission. 3 It has been suggested that the management of gout in the UK remains suboptimal. 1 In 2004, we concluded that there was a woeful lack of evidence to guide treatment or prophylaxis for gout, particularly with regard to choice of drug or doses. 4 The introduction of new drugs and new evidence on the efficacy and safety of treatment options has led the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) to update their guidelines on the management of gout. 2,5 Nevertheless, there are differing views on target serum uric acid (SUA) levels and the role of urate lowering treatment (ULT). 2,5–7 Here, we review the latest guidance on the management of gout and consider the role of long-term ULT.

American College of Physicians guideline — pharmacologic therapy evidence and dosing reports that moderate-quality evidence showed that thiazide diuretics, citrates, and allopurinol reduce the risk for recurrence of composite calcium stones, and combination therapy with these agents was not more beneficial than monotherapy; most patients have calcium stones, and evidence showed that thiazide diuretics, citrates, and allopurinol all effectively reduced recurrence of this stone type. The available evidence evaluated higher doses of thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg; chlorothalidone, 25 or 50 mg; indapamide, 2.5 mg), and the use of lower doses of thiazides is associated with fewer adverse effects, but their effectiveness in preventing stone recurrence compared with higher doses is not known.

Longer term data exploring the efficacy and safety of colchicine use as a prophylactic treatment would be interesting. Clinical trials in this population could be of interest, to evaluate the use of colchicine in prophylaxis for long-term gout flares and thus avoid the recurrence of flare when urate-lowering therapies are initiated.

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should It Be? [^114T3Cvz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

These key pharmacologic differences have contributed to the long‐standing debate among clinicians and hypertension experts about whether chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide is superior. Multiple systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have previously demonstrated that the thiazide‐like diuretics better prevent cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality compared with the thiazide‐type diuretics. These systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, however, included many RCTs conducted before 1990 and few RCTs of indapamide. Consequently, the generalizability of the findings to the current era may be limited as the prevalence and nature of cardiovascular disease risk factors have evolved and as we have refined our knowledge about which classes should be used first line for hypertension treatment. Observational studies have provided contrasting conclusions on this debate, with one finding no difference between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazidewhereas another one showed better outcomes with hydrochlorothiazide, not chlorthalidone. However, the follow‐up period in these observational studies was probably too brief to detect differences in clinical end points and the conflicting findings are likely due to residual confounding. For these reasons, the available meta‐analyses and observational studies offer little practical guidance in thiazide selection. Instead, what may be more helpful for current clinicians is to recall the findings from more recent, large RCTs that have critically appraised these agents. The Table, lists several pivotal RCTs of the thiazides published since 2000 relevant to common and everyday clinical scenarios. Chlorthalidone and indapamide treat hypertension effectively and safely in several clinical settings, including in patients with multiple coronary artery disease risk factors, prior stroke, elderly age, and advanced chronic kidney disease. Additionally, small RCTs have demonstrated that combination therapy containing chlorthalidone provides superior hypertension treatment compared with combination therapy containing hydrochlorothiazide and to combination therapy without any thiazide diuretic, including among patients with stage 2 hypertension. Finally, the thiazide‐like diuretics offer pleiotropic protection against cardiovascular diseases independently of blood pressure reduction. In contrast, no cardiovascular benefit with hydrochlorothiazide treatment has been consistently found. Despite these randomized data, the hydrochlorothiazide‐versus‐chlorthalidone debate has continued in part because until recently no trial had directly compared the 2.

Question 2: Which of the following is not known to be a risk factor for this condition?
A. Obesity
B. Diuretic use
C. Chronic kidney disease
D. Vitamin C supplementation
E. Excessive alcohol consumption

Answers:
A. Obesity – Incorrect. Obesity, along with other components of metabolic syndrome such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, is a well-established risk factor for gout. Body mass index > 30 kg/m 2 was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of developing gout.
B. Diuretic use – Incorrect. Diuretics, particularly loop and thiazide diuretics, are associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of developing gout. This is mainly due to volume depletion, which enhances uric acid reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Some diuretics may also directly impair uric acid excretion, while a few can have a mild uricosuric effect. The risk is higher with loop diuretics than with thiazides and tends to be more pronounced in men. Additionally, underlying conditions treated with diuretics, such as hypertension, are themselves linked to increased gout risk.
C. Chronic kidney disease – Incorrect. Chronic kidney disease is an established independent risk factor for goutas well as for the incidence of miliarial tophi.
D. Vitamin C supplementation – Correct. Although high doses of vitamin C (> 1000 mg/day) may increase the risk of uric acid kidney stones in some individuals, it is not a known risk factor for gout. In fact, vitamin C supplementation can lower serum uric acid levelsby enhancing renal excretion. However, current observational and interventional studies do not support its use for preventing the onset or recurrence of gout.
E. Excessive alcohol consumption – Incorrect. Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with a 2-fold higher risk of developing gouty tophi.

### Classification… [^1174ft51]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Etiology Chronic pain has many pathophysiological and environmental causes and can occur in cases such as neuropathy of the central nervous system, after cerebral hemorrhage, tissue damage such as extensive burns, inflammation, autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, psychological stress such as headache, migraine or abdominal pain and mechanical pain caused by tissue wear and tear such as arthritis. In some cases, chronic pain can be caused by genetic factors which interfere with neuronal differentiation, leading to a permanently lowered threshold for pain. These changes in neural structure can be explained by neuroplasticity. When there is chronic pain, the somatotopic arrangement of the body is abnormally changed due to continuous stimulation and can cause allodynia or hyperalgesia. In chronic pain, this process is difficult to reverse or stop once established.

EEG of people with chronic pain showed that brain activity and synaptic plasticity change as a result of pain, and specifically, the relative activity of beta wave increases and alpha and theta waves decrease. Disease associations Some diseases such as diabetes, shingles, phantom limb pain, hypertension, and stroke play a role in the formation of chronic pain. Chronic pain is associated with fibromyalgia. Prognosis and outcomes Complete, longterm remission of many types of chronic pain is rare. Chronic pain is often difficult to treat. Chronic pain can significantly reduce individuals' quality of life, productivity, and wages, worsen existing health issues, and provoke the onset of new conditions like major depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. Many of the often-used medications for chronic pain carry risks for side effects and complications.

For example, chronic use of opioids is associated with decreased life expectancy and increased mortality of patients relative to non-users. Acetaminophen, a frequently used drug in chronic pain management, can cause hepatotoxicity when taken in excess of four grams per day, and even therapeutic doses administered to pain patients with chronic liver disease may cause hepatotoxicity. Long-term risks and side effects of opioids, another class of analgesic, include constipation, drug tolerance and dependence, nausea, indigestion, arrhythmia, endocrine gland disruptions promoting amenorrhea, erectile dysfunction, and gynecomastia, and fatigue. A major public health and clinical concern in and since the 2010s has been opioid overdose, especially in the context of an opioid epidemic in the United States.

Also, this disease causes many complications and increases the possibility of death of patients and suffering from other chronic diseases and obesity. Similarly, patients with chronic pain who require opioids often develop drug tolerance over time, and this increase in the amount of the dose taken to be effective increases the risk of side effects and death. Severe chronic pain is associated with increased risk of death over a ten-year period, particularly from heart disease and respiratory disease. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this increase, such as an abnormal stress response in the body's endocrine system. Additionally, chronic stress seems to affect risks to heart and lung health by increasing how quickly plaque can build up on artery walls. However, further research is needed to clarify the relationship between severe chronic pain, stress and cardiovascular health.

### Crystal-induced arthritides in the elderly: an update [^113GDZSA]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence of gout increases with age. After the serum concentration of urate exceeds the saturation or solubility point, it deposits in and around the joints. Presentation in the elderly is often atypical and challenging to diagnose. Treatment depends on disease stage, health status, and comorbidities. Elderly patients often have several confounding issues; treatment decisions can be complicated and therapeutic options limited. To prevent recurrence, serum concentration of urate should be maintained well below the saturation threshold of 6.8 mg/dL, leading to dissolution of urate deposits and preventing recurrence.

### Colchicine for pericarditis [^111LbuzD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Colchicine is one of the oldest available drugs. It has been used for centuries to treat and prevent gouty attacks and more recently to prevent attacks of autoinflammatory diseases such as Familial Mediterranean Fever. Its main mechanism of action is the capability to block the polymerization of tubulin, thus affecting the function of microtubules. The capability to concentrate in white blood cells, especially granulocytes, and interfere with their function explains its potentiality as an anti-inflammatory drug. Colchicine (0.5mg twice daily for patients > 70kg or once daily for those weighing less) in addition to standard anti-inflammatory therapy, in either acute or recurrent pericarditis, may hasten the response to anti-inflammatory therapy and reduce the subsequent risk of recurrences. After exclusion of contraindication and appropriate dose adjustment, the drug is safe and well tolerated. The more common side effect is gastrointestinal intolerance occurring in 5–10% of cases and may be controlled by dose reduction or temporary discontinuation.

### Critical appraisal of serum urate targets in the management of gout [^111hYypL]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Gout management involves two broad aspects: treatment of gout flares to provide rapid symptomatic relief and long-term urate-lowering therapy to lower serum urate sufficiently to prevent gout flares from occurring. All of the major rheumatology societies recommend a target serum urate of < 5mg/dl (< 0.30mmol/l) or < 6mg/dl (< 0.36mmol/l), both of which are below the point of saturation for urate and therefore lead to monosodium urate crystal dissolution. In this Review, we describe the rationale for treat-to-target urate approach in the long-term management of gout and the current evidence and controversy around the appropriate serum urate targets.

Gout is a group of diseases characterized by arthritis and results from a disturbance of urate metabolism with the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints and soft tissues. Often, but not invariably, the serum urate levels are elevated as a result of overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. Clinical manifestations include acute and chronic arthritis, tophaceous deposits, interstitial renal disease, and uric acid nephrolithiasis. The diagnosis is based on the identification of uric acid crystals in joints, tissues, or body fluids. Acute episodes are treated with colchicine, NSAIDs, or steroids. Long-term management includes treatment with uricosuric agents or xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

Best practice: the treatment of hypertension

This section summarises the recommendations for primary care following the diagnosis of hypertension. There is good evidence (GRADE 1A) for the treatment of hypertension with one or more of the following: diuretics (thiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide); beta‐blockers; calcium channel‐blockers (CCB); angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or an angiotensin‐2 receptor blocker (ARB) 1. In the future, the threshold for treating high blood pressure might change to cardiovascular risk (see below, the treatment of cardiovascular risk, not hypertension).

Step 1 treatment

Patients aged less than 55 years should be offered an ACE inhibitor, or a low‐cost ARB. If an ACE inhibitor is prescribed but is not tolerated (for example, because of cough), offer a low‐cost ARB. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. An ACE inhibitor should not be combined with an ARB.

Patients aged over 55 years and Black patients of African or Caribbean family origin of any age should be offered a CCB. If a CCB is not suitable, for example because of oedema or intolerance, or if there is evidence of heart failure or a high risk of heart failure, a thiazide‐like diuretic should be offered.

If diuretic treatment is to be initiated or changed, offer a thiazide‐like diuretic, such as chlorthalidone (12.5–25.0 mg once daily), or indapamide (1.5 mg modified‐release once daily or 2.5 mg once daily), in preference to a conventional thiazide diuretic such as bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide.

For patients who are already having treatment with bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide and whose blood pressure is stable and well controlled, treatment with the bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide should be continued.

Beta‐blockers are not a preferred initial therapy for hypertension. However, beta‐blockers may be considered in younger patients, particularly those with an intolerance or contraindication to ACE inhibitors and ARBs, or women of childbearing potential or patients with evidence of increased sympathetic drive. If beta‐blockers are started and a second drug is required, add a CCB rather than a thiazide‐like diuretic to reduce the person's risk of developing diabetes.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^116qMxjN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis that is characterised by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues. The natural history of articular gout is generally characterised by three periods: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, episodes of acute gout and chronic gouty arthritis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. Published guidelines recommend their use to treat acute attacks, using maximum recommended doses for a short time.

Objectives

To assess the benefit and safety of NSAIDs (including COXIBs) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies to 7 October 2013, the 2010 and 2011 ACR and EULAR abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of articles. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trial register and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy (including non-pharmacological therapies) for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain (proportion with 50% or more reduction in pain or mean pain when the dichotomous outcome was unavailable), inflammation (e.g. measured by joint swelling/erythema/tenderness), function of target joint, participant's global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 23 trials (2200 participants). One trial (30 participants) of low-quality evidence compared an NSAID (tenoxicam) with placebo. It found that significantly more participants had more than 50% reduction in pain after 24 hours (11/15 participants) compared with those taking placebo (4/15 participants) (risk ratio (RR) 2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 6.72). A similar outcome was seen for more than 50% improvement in joint swelling after 24 hours (5/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 2/15 participants taking placebo; RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.93). The trial did not measure function, participant global assessment of treatment success and health-related quality of life. There were no adverse events reported with the use of tenoxicam; two adverse events (nausea and polypuria) were reported in the placebo group. No between-group differences in outcome were observed after four days. Moderate-quality evidence based upon four trials (974 participants) indicated that NSAIDs and COXIBs produced similar benefits in terms of pain, swelling and global improvement, but COXIBs were associated with fewer adverse events. Pain reduction was 1.9 points on a 0- to 10-point scale with COXIBs (0 was no pain) while pain reduction with NSAIDs was 0.03 points lower or better (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.13). Joint swelling in the COXIB group was 1.64 points on a 0- to 3-point scale (0 is no swelling) and 0.13 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.34). Function was not reported. Participant-reported global assessment was 1.56 points on a 0- to 4-point scale with COXIBs (0 was the best score) and was 0.04 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.20). Health-related quality of life assessed using the 36-item Short Form showed no evidence of a statistically significant between-group difference (MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.61 to 2.60 for the physical component). There were significantly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (3%) compared with NSAIDs (8%) (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.28). There was a significantly lower number of total adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (38%) compared with NSAIDs (60%) (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86). There was moderate-quality evidence based on two trials (210 participants) that oral glucocorticoids did not differ in pain reduction, function or adverse events when compared with NSAIDs. Pain reduction was 9.5 on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, pain reduction with NSAIDs was 1.74 higher or worse (MD 1.74, 95% CI -1.44 to 4.92). The trials did not assess inflammation. Function measured as walking disability was 17.4 points on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, function with NSAIDs was 0.1 lower or better (MD -0.10, 95% CI -4.72 to 4.52). The trials did not measure participant-reported global assessment and health-related quality of life. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events. There was no evidence of a difference in total number of adverse events with glucocorticoids (31%) versus NSAIDs (49%) (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.28).

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supported the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute gout. One placebo-controlled trial provided evidence of benefit at 24 hours and little or no harm. We downgraded the evidence due to potential selection and reporting biases, and imprecision. While these data were insufficient to draw firm conclusions, they did not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, other inflammatory arthritis and expert consensus, which support the use of NSAIDs in acute gout. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial although COX-2 inhibitors are likely to be associated with significantly fewer total and gastrointestinal adverse events. We downgraded the evidence due to an unclear risk of selection and reporting biases. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs were also equally beneficial in terms of pain relief. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events were similar between groups. We downgraded the evidence due to unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. There was low-quality evidence that there was no difference in function. We downgraded the quality due to unclear risk of selection bias and imprecision.

### Gout-induced arthropathy after total knee arthroplasty: a report of two cases [^1148tMm5]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Gout, although relatively rare in joint replacements, can present as an acute or chronic painful knee or hip arthroplasty. Gout and acute infection of a joint replacement can be difficult to differentiate, with the physical examination and laboratory study results frequently being similar. Both conditions can present with a rapid onset of joint pain, swelling, erythema, and constitutional symptoms, including fevers and malaise. Laboratory findings in both conditions often include an elevated leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level. Negatively birefringent, needle-shaped crystals in the synovial fluid confirm the diagnosis of gout. The mistaken diagnosis of septic arthritis in a joint replacement with crystal-induced synovitis can lead to inappropriate open debridement or component removal. The current study includes a review of the literature and presents two cases of gout after total knee arthroplasty. These cases suggest that in situations of suspected sepsis without synovial fluid crystals, operative intervention is indicated with a presumed diagnosis of septic arthritis. The identification of chalky white or yellow deposits in the synovium or bone is highly suggestive of gout. The definitive diagnosis is made by polarized light histologic evaluation of these tissues. If these deposits are present in the absence of a positive preoperative culture, positive Gram stain for bacteria, or component loosening, component retention is indicated.

### Approach to septic arthritis [^1177DDKz]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment of infectious arthritis can help prevent significant morbidity and mortality. The acute onset of monoarticular joint pain, erythema, heat, and immobility should raise suspicion of sepsis. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, and rigors are poorly sensitive for septic arthritis. In the absence of peripheral leukopenia or prosthetic joint replacement, synovial fluid white blood cell count in patients with septic arthritis is usually greater than 50,000 per mm3. Isolation of the causative agent through synovial fluid culture is not only definitive but also essential before selecting antibiotic therapy. Synovial fluid analysis is also useful to help distinguish crystal arthropathy from infectious arthritis, although the two occasionally coexist. Almost any microorganism can be pathogenic in septic arthritis; however, septic arthritis is caused by nongonococcal pathogens (most commonly Staphylococcus species) in more than 80 percent of patients. Gram stain results should guide initial antibiotic choice. Vancomycin can be used for gram-positive cocci, ceftriaxone for gram-negative cocci, and ceftazidime for gram-negative rods. If the Gram stain is negative, but there is strong clinical suspicion for bacterial arthritis, treatment with vancomycin plus ceftazidime or an aminoglycoside is appropriate. Evacuation of purulent material with arthrocentesis or surgical methods is necessary. Special consideration should be given to patients with prosthetic joint infection. In this population, the intraarticular cutoff values for infection may be as low as 1,100 white blood cells per mm3 with a neutrophil differential of greater than 64 percent.

### Evaluating the safety and short-term equivalence of colchicine versus prednisone in older patients with acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis (COLCHICORT): an open-label, multicentre, randomised trial [^1162C7QG]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis causes intense joint pain mainly affecting older people. Because guidance and evidence remain scarce, management of this disease relies on expert opinion. We therefore aimed to compare the safety and short-term equivalence of low-dose colchicine with oral prednisone in older patients with acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis.

Methods

We did an open-label, multicentre, randomised, trial (COLCHICORT) at six hospitals in Paris and northern France. We enrolled patients who were admitted to hospital who were 65 years or older and who presented with acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis with a symptom duration of less than 36 h. Diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis was made by the identification of calcium pyrophosphate crystals on synovial fluid analysis or typical clinical presentation (onset of joint pain and swelling). Key exclusion criteria included absence of calcium pyrophosphate crystals on synovial fluid analysis or a history of gout. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1), using a centralised electronic treatment group allocation module, to receive either colchicine 1·5 mg on day 1 and 1 mg on day 2 (ie, the colchicine group) or oral prednisone 30 mg on days 1 and 2 (ie, the prednisone group). The primary outcome was change in joint pain (measured by visual analogue scale [VAS] from 0 mm to 100 mm) at 24 h. Equivalence was determined whether the 95% CI of the between-group difference at 24 h was within the -13 mm to +13 mm margin in the per-protocol analysis. Adverse events were recorded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0). This trial is completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03128905.

Findings

Between Feb 5, 2018, and May 7, 2022, 111 patients who were admitted to hospital were randomly assigned (57 [51%] to the colchicine group and 54 [49%] to the prednisone group). 95 (86%) of 111 patients were included in the per-protocol analysis (49 [52%] in the colchicine group and 46 [48%] in the prednisone group). The median age was 88·0 years (IQR 82·0–91·0) and 69 (73%) of 95 participants were women and 26 (27%) were men. Acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis affected mainly the knee in 46 (48%) of 95 participants, the wrist in 19 (20%), and the ankle in 12 (13%). Pain VAS at baseline was 68 mm (SD 17). At 24 h, change in pain VAS was -36 mm (SD 32) in the colchicine group and -38 mm (SD 23) in the prednisone group. The between-group difference in change in pain VAS at 24 h was -1 mm (95% CI -12 to 10), showing equivalence between the two drugs. In the colchicine group, 12 (22%) of 55 patients had diarrhoea, one (2%) had hypertension, and none had hyperglycaemia. In the prednisone group, three (6%) of 54 had diarrhoea, six (11%) had hypertension, and three (6%) had hyperglycaemia. No deaths occurred in the colchicine group; two deaths occurred in the prednisone group, which were deemed unrelated to prednisone (one due to infectious valvular endocarditis leading to heart failure, and one due to a stroke).

Interpretation

Colchicine and prednisone exhibit equivalent short-term efficacy for the treatment of acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis, with different safety profiles in the older population.

### Sprained ankle… [^117TSgkw]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

Signs and symptoms Knowing the symptoms that can be experienced with a sprain is important in determining that the injury is not really a break in the bone. When a sprain occurs, hematoma occurs within the tissue that surrounds the joint, causing a bruise. White blood cells responsible for inflammation migrate to the area, and blood flow increases as well. Along with this inflammation, swelling and pain is experienced. The nerves in the area become more sensitive when the injury is suffered, so pain is felt as throbbing and will worsen if there is pressure placed on the area. Warmth and redness are also seen as blood flow is increased. There is also decreased ability to move the joint.
- Right foot, housed in an air brace, has become swollen as a result of a more severe 2nd degree sprain to the ankle.
- Right foot, 3rd degree sprain. One day after injury. Cause Movements – especially turning, and rolling of the foot – are the primary cause of an ankle sprain.

The risk of a sprain is greatest during activities that involve explosive side-to-side motion, such as tennis, skateboarding or basketball. Sprained ankles can also occur during normal daily activities such as stepping off a curb or slipping on ice. Returning to activity before the ligaments have fully healed may cause them to heal in a stretched position, resulting in less stability at the ankle joint. This can lead to a condition known as Chronic Ankle Instability, and an increased risk of ankle sprains. The following factors can contribute to an increased risk of ankle sprains:

- Weak muscles/tendons that cross the ankle joint, especially the muscles of the lower leg that cross the outside, or lateral aspect of the ankle joint
- Weak or lax ligaments that join the bones of the ankle joint – this can be hereditary or due to overstretching of ligaments as a result of repetitive ankle sprains.
- Inadequate joint proprioception;
- Slow neuron muscular response to an off-balance position;
- Running or stepping on uneven surfaces;
- Shoes with inadequate heel support; and
- Wearing high-heeled shoes – due to the weak position of the ankle joint with an elevated heel, and a small base of support. Ankle sprains occur usually through excessive stress on the ligaments of the ankle. This can be caused by excessive external rotation, inversion or eversion of the foot caused by an external force. When the foot is moved past its range of motion, the excess stress puts a strain on the ligaments. If the strain is great enough to the ligaments past the yield point, then the ligament becomes damaged, or sprained. Diagnosis The diagnosis of a sprain relies on the medical history, including symptoms, as well as making a differential diagnosis, mainly in distinguishing it from strains or bone fractures.

The Ottawa ankle rule is a simple, widely used rule to help differentiate fractures of the ankle or mid-foot from other ankle injuries that do not require x-ray radiography. It has a sensitivity of nearly 100%, meaning that a patient who tests negative, according to the rule almost certainly does not have an ankle fracture. If ankle pain is persistent 6–8 weeks after initial sprain, MRI imaging of the joint can be considered to rule out peroneal tendon, osteochondral, or syndesmotic injury. Types Inversion ankle sprain The most common type of ankle sprain occurs when the foot rolls inwards, or has a force, typically one's body weight, causing it to internally rotate beyond its normal range, affecting the lateral side of the ankle. When this type of ankle sprain happens, the outer, or lateral, ligaments are stretched too much.

### Gout: rapid evidence review [^116EC67m]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints and tissues. Risk factors include male sex; obesity; hypertension; alcohol intake; diuretic use; a diet rich in meat and seafood; chronic kidney disease; a diet heavy in fructose-rich food and beverages; being a member of certain ethnic groups, including Taiwanese, Pacific Islander, and New Zealand Maori; and living in high-income countries. Gout is characterized by swelling, pain, or tenderness in a peripheral joint or bursa, including the development of a tophus. Diagnosis of gout can be made using several validated clinical prediction rules. Arthrocentesis should be performed when suspicion for an underlying septic joint is present; synovial fluid or tophus analysis should be performed if the diagnosis is uncertain. Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout episodes. Indications for long-term urate-lowering therapy include chronic kidney disease, two or more flare-ups per year, urolithiasis, the presence of tophus, chronic gouty arthritis, and joint damage. Allopurinol and febuxostat are used to prevent flare-ups, although febuxostat is associated with an increase in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and is therefore not routinely recommended.

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. part II: management. report of a task force of the EULAR standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^111yGxST]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### Gout… [^1172VYdu]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of pain in a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint, caused by the deposition of needle-shaped crystals of the monosodium salt of uric acid. Pain typically comes on rapidly, reaching maximal intensity in less than 12 hours. The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or kidney damage. Gout is due to persistently elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs from a combination of diet, other health problems, and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who regularly drink beer or sugar-sweetened beverages; eat foods that are high in purines such as liver, shellfish, or anchovies; or are overweight.

Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by the presence of crystals in the joint fluid or in a deposit outside the joint. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack. Signs and symptoms Gout can present in several ways, although the most common is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis. The metatarsophalangeal joint at the base of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. It can also involve midfoot structures, including the cuneiform bones. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists, and fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins during the night and peaks within 24 hours of onset. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including fatigue and high fever. Long-standing elevated uric acid levels may result in other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals called tophi.

Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. Elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in kidney stone formation and subsequent acute uric acid nephropathy. Lifestyle Dietary causes account for about 12% of gout, and include a strong association with the consumption of alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages, meat, and seafood. The dietary mechanisms and nutritional basis involved in gout provide evidence for strategies of prevention and improvement of gout, and dietary modifications based on effective regulatory mechanisms may be a promising strategy to reduce the high prevalence of gout. Among foods richest in purines yielding high amounts of uric acid are dried anchovies, shrimp, organ meat, dried mushrooms, seaweed, and beer yeast. Chicken and potatoes also appear related. Other triggers include physical trauma and surgery. Studies in the early 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant.

Specifically, a diet with moderate purine-rich vegetables is not associated with gout. Neither is total dietary protein. Alcohol consumption is strongly associated with increased risk, with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer or spirits. Eating skim milk powder enriched with glycomacropeptide and G600 milk fat extract may reduce pain but may result in diarrhea and nausea. Medical conditions Gout frequently occurs in combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants, and myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index greater than or equal to 35 increases male risk of gout threefold.

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^114HRgjZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### Diagnosis of acute gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111NWXYW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis of gout.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on gout diagnosis, identified using several databases, from database inception to February 2016. Evaluated outcomes included the accuracy of the test results; intermediate outcomes (results of laboratory and radiographic tests, such as serum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis and radiographic or ultrasonography changes); clinical decision making (additional testing and pharmacologic or dietary management); short-term clinical (patient-centered) outcomes, such as pain and joint swelling and tenderness; and adverse effects of the tests. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with joint inflammation suspected to be gout.

Recommendation

ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Fibromyalgia… [^114ZsDyV]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a long-term adverse health condition characterised by widespread chronic pain. Current diagnosis also requires an above-threshold severity score from among six other symptoms: fatigue, trouble thinking or remembering, waking up tired, pain or cramps in the lower abdomen, depression, or headache. Other symptoms may also be experienced. The causes of fibromyalgia are unknown, with several pathophysiologies proposed. The treatment of fibromyalgia is symptomatic and multidisciplinary. Aerobic and strengthening exercise is recommended. Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin can give short-term pain relief to some people with FM. Symptoms of fibromyalgia persist long-term in most patients. Fibromyalgia is associated with a significant economic and social burden, and it can cause substantial functional impairment among people with the condition.

People with fibromyalgia can be subjected to significant stigma and doubt about the legitimacy of their symptoms, including in the healthcare system. FM is associated with relatively high suicide rates. Chronic pain Chronic pain continues to be regarded as the core characteristic of fibromyalgia. According to the NHS, widespread pain is a major symptom, which could feel like an ache, a burning sensation, or a sharp, stabbing pain. Patients are also susceptible to pain, and the slightest touch can cause pain. Pain also tends to linger for a longer period when a patient experiences it. The pain associated with fibromyalgia is often a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months, occurring on both sides of the body and above and below the waist. Pain in fibromyalgia may include contributions from central pain, peripheral musculoskeletal pain generators, neuropathic pain, and other pathways. Men may be affected by FM pain differently to women.

Fatigue Fatigue is a common symptom of fibromyalgia. Patients may experience physical or mental fatigue. Physical fatigue can present as a feeling of exhaustion after exercise or limitation in daily activities. Fibromyalgia fatigue can range from feeling mildly tired to flu-like exhaustion. Severe fatigue may come on suddenly and make it difficult to be active at all. The impact of fatigue can be severe and pose more of a problem than the pain. Fatigue is a complicated, multifactorial, and vexing symptom that is highly prevalent and stubbornly persistent, as evidenced by longitudinal studies over 5 years. Fatigue does not improve with sleep or rest. Medication seems to have little impact on FM fatigue. Comorbidity Fibromyalgia as a stand-alone diagnosis is uncommon, as most fibromyalgia patients often have other chronic overlapping pain problems, mental disorders or physical conditions. Comorbidities can give higher levels of pain and other symptoms.

Fibromyalgia is associated with mental health issues including Anxiety, Post-traumatic stress disorder – Approximately one third of patients presenting with an FM diagnosis also meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder, Bipolar disorder, Alexithymia, and Depression – Patients with fibromyalgia are five times more likely to have major depression than the general population. Neurological disorders that have been linked to pain or fibromyalgia include, Multiple sclerosis, Post-polio syndrome, Neuropathic pain, Parkinson's disease. Fibromyalgia largely overlaps with several syndromes that may share the same pathogenetic mechanisms. These include myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome. Comorbid fibromyalgia has been reported to occur in 20–30% of individuals with rheumatic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. It has been reported in people with noninflammatory musculoskeletal diseases.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^113jcmxe]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

There is a paucity of data on the natural history of gout, which has several stages of development (Fig. 1). The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) has previously endorsed a definition of the disease state 'gout' that requires current or prior clinically evident symptoms or signs resulting from MSU crystal deposition. Gout is generally considered a chronic disease, with episodic highly symptomatic flares. Poorly controlled gout can have a substantial impact on an affected individual and the individual's family. Inadequately treated gout leads to recurrent gout flares, the formation of tophi (which contain aggregated masses of MSU crystals in joints and certain soft tissues), chronic gouty arthritis and joint erosion. Ulceration and infection associated with tophi occurs frequently, and surgical interventions for these sequelae have a high rate of complications. Substantial time off work, poor health-related quality of life and disability are common in those with poorly controlled gout –. Gout is associated with frequent hospital admissions, particularly in patients with hyperuricaemia and inadequate allopurinol use and/or dose. However, not all individuals with gout develop severe disease, and whether everyone diagnosed with gout requires long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) has been questioned.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of gout [^11588AtF]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is characterized by painful joint inflammation, most commonly in the first metatarsophalangeal joint, resulting from precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in a joint space. Gout is typically diagnosed using clinical criteria from the American College of Rheumatology. Diagnosis may be confirmed by identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid of the affected joint. Acute gout may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, or colchicine. To reduce the likelihood of recurrent flares, patients should limit their consumption of certain purine-rich foods (e.g., organ meats, shellfish) and avoid alcoholic drinks (especially beer) and beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup. Consumption of vegetables and low-fat or nonfat dairy products should be encouraged. The use of loop and thiazide diuretics can increase uric acid levels, whereas the use of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan increases urinary excretion of uric acid. Reduction of uric acid levels is key to avoiding gout flares. Allopurinol and febuxostat are first-line medications for the prevention of recurrent gout, and colchicine and/or probenecid are reserved for patients who cannot tolerate first-line agents or in whom first-line agents are ineffective. Patients receiving urate-lowering medications should be treated concurrently with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, or low-dose corticosteroids to prevent flares. Treatment should continue for at least three months after uric acid levels fall below the target goal in those without tophi, and for six months in those with a history of tophi.

### CaseBook challenges: managing gout, hyperuricemia and comorbidities – dialogue with the experts [^115ZpRbx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of gout and hyperuricemia are on the rise in the United States corresponding with an increase in risk factors for these conditions, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and the use of diuretics. A progressive disorder, untreated gout can be debilitating and result in tophi, chronic arthropathy, and recurrent kidney stones. Although joint aspiration is needed for a definitive diagnosis, the majority of patients are diagnosed presumptively based on medical history and presentation with characteristic signs and symptoms. Patients with gout also often have multiple comorbidities, and there is an increasing body of evidence that shows hyperuricemia is associated with incidence hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Clinical strategies for the management of gout and hyperuricemia must include considerations for these and other common cardiometabolic and renal conditions. In addition to acute flare therapy and prophylaxis, the treatment of gout involves lowering serum uric acid (SUA) levels with the urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) allopurinol or febuxostat. Once begun, treatment with ULT is lifelong. However, inadequate dosing and patient nonadherence or intolerance to therapy often lead to treatment failure. Recent guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology stress tailoring therapy and target SUA level (traditionally < 6 mg/dL, but lower levels may be needed for certain patients) based on gout severity and the presence of comorbid conditions. Because painful acute gout flares may result in trips to the emergency department and because the majority of gout cases are managed in primary care, it is important for clinicians practicing in these settings to be able to diagnose and treat this condition and communicate with patients to improve their understanding of the disease process and adherence to treatment.

### Updates in the management of gout [^115dzN3p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both the physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels. Confusion frequently arises because certain medications such as colchicine may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### Thiazides in the management of hypertension in older adults-a systematic review [^1148BMD2]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Low dose treatment with thiazide or thiazide like diuretics in adults aged 65 and older is in general appropriate. Patients with a history of gout should avoid thiazide use. At present, evidence as to whether other antihypertensives are more effective or safer is too scarce to draw definite conclusions. Patients with multimorbidity, polypharmacy and very elderly patients are underrepresented in clinical trials. The benefits for these patient groups are less clear.

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^112D3qBA]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to anti-inflammatory therapy, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate colchicine (0.5–1 mg/day, reduced in renal impairment) as first-line prophylactic treatment. Recognize the potential neurotoxicity and/or muscular toxicity with prophylactic colchicine in patients with renal impairment or on statin therapy. Avoid co-prescribing colchicine with strong P-glycoprotein and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors.

### Newer therapeutic approaches: gout [^111k1D6c]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Newer approaches to the treatment of gout have included modifications and further attention to aspects of current therapies, and development of interesting new therapies. Colchicine prophylaxis appears to be needed longer than previously recognized after introduction of a urate-lowering agent. Diet has received attention, though most dietary effects are small. New agents under investigation include pegylated formulations of uricase and a new potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor, febuxostat. Some cardiovascular drugs have been shown to be uricosuric.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116ucgkw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 13 — FDA-approved drugs for treatment of hypertension — Thiazide-type diuretics recommended for initial therapy list dosing and monitoring. Chlorthalidone 12.5–25 mg/d with daily frequency 1, hydrochlorothiazide 25–50 mg/d with daily frequency 1, and indapamide 1.25–2.5 mg/d with daily frequency 1 are provided. Chlorthalidone has a longer half-life and is more potent than hydrochlorothiazide on a mg-to-mg basis. Monitor for hyponatremia and hypokalemia, increased glucose, uric acid, and calcium levels, and monitor patients with history of acute gout unless patient is on uric acid-lowering therapy.

### Update on importance of diet in gout [^113dQdoz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals within synovial joints. Although it is most well-known for its arthritis, gout has an intimate relationship with many other cardiovascular and metabolic conditions. Current recommendations support aggressive medical therapy to treat gout, whereas dietary counseling has become less emphasized. This article argues for the absolute importance of dietary counseling in gout and proves why this counseling may impact the long term well-being of a patient with gout.
