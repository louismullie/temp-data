Write a brief plan of care for slipping rib syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a brief plan of care for Slipping Rib Syndrome (SRS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and ruling out mimics. Then, I should verify first-line conservative management options and escalation criteria. Next, I will review surgical indications and compare surgical techniques including outcomes and recurrence. After that, I should consider perioperative details, analgesia strategies, and follow-up metrics. Finally, I need to address special populations and explicitly appraise the quality of evidence to keep the guidance appropriately cautious and transparent.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis strategy. SRS remains underrecognized; a focused history of lower chest or upper abdominal pain provoked by torsion, coughing, or athletic activity and sometimes accompanied by a "clicking" or "popping" sensation is typical, and the diagnosis is primarily clinical with reproduction of pain or clicking using the hooking maneuver over ribs 8–10, which has long been emphasized in pediatric and sports reports of SRS and is often sufficient to avoid unnecessary testing when classic features are present [^114ycQPj] [^113M8H6M]. Wait, let me verify the role of imaging: dynamic ultrasound (DUS) has increasingly been used to visualize rib hypermobility and confirm the symptomatic level, especially when clinical findings are equivocal, and in one retrospective series DUS identified the hypermobile excursion in all surgical cases, supporting its adjunctive value in a standardized pathway [^111Ca6LU]. Hold on, I should also verify an anatomic rationale: recent cadaveric work confirms frequent mobility and anatomic variability of the 9th–10th costal margin that can predispose to subluxation, providing biologic plausibility for dynamic entrapment and nerve irritation in SRS [^1175YvMU].

> I need to ensure a prudent differential to avoid missing dangerous mimics. While broad cardiopulmonary and gastrointestinal evaluations are not routinely required, targeted testing is warranted if red flags exist; otherwise, a clinical diagnosis plus DUS when needed is appropriate and can reduce delays and misdiagnosis in this elusive condition [^114ycQPj] [^111Ca6LU]. But wait, what if pain localizes posteriorly near the paraspinal region rather than the anterior costal margin? I should consider costovertebral joint pathology in such cases; case reports show that selected patients with posterior costovertebral pain can benefit from targeted imaging and, rarely, disarticulation or partial rib resection when conservative care fails, underscoring the need for accurate localization and careful preoperative marking with patient input [^117ESv3g] [^114PBasj] [^116Akged].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative management over about 6–12 weeks. Activity modification to limit provoking maneuvers is reasonable, with pharmacologic analgesia centered on NSAIDs and acetaminophen; although data are extrapolated from broader acute musculoskeletal injury guidelines, acetaminophen has a role in reducing pain in non–low back acute musculoskeletal conditions and can be combined with NSAIDs in a multimodal approach when tolerated [^116LbXRy]. Let me consider regional analgesia: ultrasound-guided intercostal nerve blocks can be both diagnostic and therapeutic in mechanical chest wall pain syndromes, and while high-quality SRS-specific trials are lacking, intercostal blocks are commonly used in case series and can be considered at levels corresponding to the symptomatic ribs, often around T9–T10 for ribs 8–10, acknowledging the anatomic variability of the costal margin and extrapolation from regional anesthesia literature in rib fracture pain [^111NBMhp] [^115V9CjB] [^1175YvMU]. I should double-check the role of rehabilitation: targeted physical therapy focused on rib stabilization and core control is plausible but evidence is limited; when used, therapy should be delivered and documented as a coherent multimodal intervention rather than isolated techniques, in line with rehabilitation reporting guidance to enhance fidelity and reproducibility [^113P6kxU] [^111zV978].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing to escalate care. Surgical consultation is reasonable when pain remains severe and function-limiting beyond approximately 3 months despite conservative treatment, when a diagnostic intercostal nerve block produces a meaningful albeit temporary response that supports a peripheral pain generator, or when dynamic imaging and clinical exam demonstrate substantial hypermobility with neurovascular impingement that correlates with symptoms [^114ycQPj] [^111Ca6LU] [^111NBMhp]. I should confirm this with outcomes literature: case series in pediatric and mixed populations consistently report good results after surgery in patients who failed nonsurgical care, supporting referral under these conditions while acknowledging the low level of evidence [^113CAmGD] [^111kdDp6].

> I will now examine surgical options, starting with costal cartilage excision (CRE) with or without stabilization, which remains the most described approach. Wait, let me verify long-term results: a pediatric series with extended follow-up reported 72% complete cure and high satisfaction after CRE, with recurrences often associated with residual or fused cartilage or hypermobile bony ribs seen at re-excision, highlighting the importance of complete resection at the culprit level(s) and attention to adjacent structural contributors [^111kdDp6]. Let me consider stabilization: adding vertical bioabsorbable rib plating has been associated with lower re-symptom rates compared with excision alone in a single-institution retrospective comparison, decreasing re-symptoms from about 17% to about 3%, although this is nonrandomized and susceptible to confounding, so shared decision-making is essential when discussing the incremental operative burden for potential recurrence reduction [^112gi5DH].

> Next, I should review minimally invasive sutured fixation as a cartilage-preserving alternative. In adults, nonexcisional sutured fixation of the 10th rib produced substantial pain improvement at 1–6 months with large reductions in analgesic use, supporting its feasibility and potential for quicker recovery in selected patients, though durability and recurrence risk require counseling given limited follow-up and retrospective design [^113TDVUV]. Hmm, wait a minute, what about pediatric patients with sutured fixation? A recent pediatric series showed early pain improvement and medication reduction after minimally invasive fixation, but notable reoperations and recurrent pain occurred in a subset with limited one-year follow-up, suggesting that while appealing for faster recovery, recurrence risk may be higher than with excision plus plating and must be discussed transparently [^114bKrQo].

> Let me consider analgesic adjuncts during surgery. I initially thought cryoablation reduces postoperative opioid use by about 40%, but I should confirm the exact data before asserting a precise magnitude. A high-credibility pediatric series comparing CRE with and without intercostal nerve cryoablation found significantly lower in-hospital opioid consumption with cryo and a trend toward shorter length of stay by approximately one day, with most cryo treated at T9/T10 and no documented abdominal wall laxity at short-term follow-up; thus, cryo appears to be a reasonable adjunct to reduce perioperative opioid exposure, though longer-term safety and functional outcomes require ongoing evaluation [^113SVwHP].

> I need to check perioperative localization and technique nuances to minimize recurrence and complications. Precise preoperative marking of the symptomatic rib level with the awake patient's guidance is crucial, particularly when pain localizes posteriorly where palpation may be less reliable intraoperatively; if costovertebral involvement is suspected, targeted imaging and complete disarticulation of the affected joint may be necessary for definitive relief in rare, posteriorly driven cases, while minimizing soft tissue trauma and avoiding unnecessary pericostal sutures can reduce postoperative pain burden based on thoracic surgical case experience [^117ESv3g] [^114PBasj] [^116Akged]. I should verify that dynamic or ultrasound confirmation intraoperatively can help confirm the correct level; although formal protocols are not established for SRS, similar chest wall surgery reporting emphasizes the value of systematic preoperative imaging review and standardized reporting to improve reproducibility and outcomes interpretation across centers [^116eJUoQ].

> For postoperative pain control, I should ensure a multimodal regimen anchored by scheduled acetaminophen with NSAIDs if tolerated, reserving short-course opioids for breakthrough pain while leveraging regional strategies where appropriate, as this aligns with broader musculoskeletal pain guidance and complements the observed opioid-sparing effect of intercostal cryoablation after CRE [^116LbXRy] [^113SVwHP]. Hold on, I should verify whether routine chest tubes are needed; in limited rib-focused case reports, minimizing invasive adjuncts such as routine chest tube placement was feasible and may reduce pain, but such decisions should remain individualized and guided by intraoperative findings and surgeon judgment due to limited evidence in SRS-specific surgery [^114PBasj] [^117ESv3g].

> Let me think about a structured follow-up protocol to capture recovery and detect recurrence early. At approximately one month, reassess pain intensity on a numeric scale, activity resumption, wound healing, and medication use, with expectations of substantial pain reduction in many patients based on adult and pediatric series; at six months, assess functional outcomes and satisfaction, aiming for tapering off opioids where used; annually thereafter, screen for recurrence or new-level symptoms, recognizing that recurrent cases often involve residual cartilage or hypermobile bony ribs that can be addressed if confirmed by clinical exam and supportive imaging [^113TDVUV] [^111kdDp6]. I should double-check the medication trajectory data: in adult sutured fixation cohorts, most patients discontinued opioids by one month and maintained low analgesic use at six months, which supports using these timepoints for outcome checks in clinical practice while acknowledging cohort and technique differences [^113TDVUV].

> Now, I will address special populations and preferences. In pediatric patients, CRE with vertical plating is commonly favored given lower observed recurrence with plating in retrospective comparisons and solid long-term satisfaction after excision in pediatric series, though patient-specific anatomy and activity levels should guide the plan and plating decisions remain individualized in the absence of randomized evidence [^112gi5DH] [^111kdDp6]. For athletes or adults prioritizing quicker recovery and cartilage preservation, minimally invasive sutured fixation can be considered with counseling about higher reoperation or recurrence risk seen in pediatric series and the limited long-term adult data, emphasizing shared decision-making around goals and trade-offs [^113TDVUV] [^114bKrQo]. For posterior or paraspinal pain patterns, I need to ensure we consider costovertebral joint pathology and employ CT to confirm the target level when planning intervention, as mislocalization can compromise outcomes [^117ESv3g] [^116Akged].

> I should confirm the role and interpretation of diagnostic blocks in the pathway. Intercostal nerve blocks can provide short-lived relief that supports a peripheral pain source and may help localize symptomatic levels; while SRS-specific predictive data are sparse, analogous use of local anesthetic response to support surgical decision-making is common in thoracic outlet and chest wall pain practices, warranting cautious extrapolation and clear documentation of block response in shared decisions about surgery [^111NBMhp] [^117NAvdP]. Let me reconsider technical specifics: because SRS most often involves ribs 8–10, targeting T9–T10 intercostal nerves for block or cryo is common, but the exact levels should be individualized based on the patient's maximal tenderness and dynamic findings, given the frequent anatomic variability of the costal margin [^113SVwHP] [^1175YvMU].

> Finally, I need to appraise and communicate the evidence quality so that recommendations are appropriately cautious. Most SRS therapeutic evidence comprises retrospective case series and single-center experiences, including the pediatric long-term excision outcomes, the DUS-guided pathway report, the adult sutured fixation series, and the plating cohort comparison; these consistently suggest benefit but remain low-level and susceptible to bias, emphasizing individualized care and the importance of transparent outcome reporting and shared decision-making until higher-quality prospective studies emerge [^111kdDp6] [^111Ca6LU] [^113TDVUV] [^112gi5DH]. Hold on, I should verify that this stance aligns with broader guidance methodology: when evidence is limited, structured consensus and rigorous reporting frameworks from relevant societies can help bridge gaps while avoiding overstatement, which is consistent with living guideline and reporting principles in related thoracic and rehabilitation fields [^1162FH4c] [^113P6kxU] [^116eJUoQ].

A brief plan of care for slipping rib syndrome includes: confirm the diagnosis with a **clinical examination** [^114ycQPj] and **dynamic ultrasound** [^111Ca6LU]; start conservative management with NSAIDs, activity modification, and physical therapy [^116LbXRy]; use intercostal nerve blocks [^111NBMhp] if pain persists; and consider surgical excision or minimally invasive fixation [^111kdDp6] [^113TDVUV] if conservative measures fail.

---

## Diagnosis and assessment

Clinical evaluation includes a detailed history of intermittent, sharp, localized lower chest or upper abdominal pain worsened by movement or palpation [^114ycQPj], and the **hooking maneuver** [^113M8H6M] to reproduce symptoms. Imaging relies on **dynamic ultrasound** [^111Ca6LU] to visualize rib hypermobility and confirm the diagnosis; CT or MRI is reserved to exclude other pathology if needed [^114ycQPj].

---

## Conservative management (first-line)

- **Patient education**: Explain the benign nature of SRS, typical course, and self-management strategies.

- **Activity modification**: Avoid activities that trigger symptoms (e.g. heavy lifting, repetitive torso movements) [^114ycQPj].

- **Analgesia**: Use NSAIDs or acetaminophen for pain control [^116LbXRy].

- **Physical therapy**: Emphasize core strengthening, postural training, and breathing exercises to stabilize the chest wall and reduce symptoms [^116Cq9Ae].

- **Intercostal nerve blocks**: Consider ultrasound-guided intercostal nerve blocks [^111NBMhp] for persistent pain despite initial conservative measures [^115V9CjB].

---

## Surgical management (for refractory cases)

- **Indications**: Persistent, debilitating pain despite ≥ 3–6 months of conservative therapy [^111kdDp6].

- **Procedures**: Options include costal cartilage excision [^111kdDp6], minimally invasive sutured fixation [^113TDVUV], or vertical rib plating with bioabsorbable plates [^112gi5DH].

- **Outcomes**: High patient satisfaction [^111kdDp6] and durable symptom relief [^113TDVUV] are reported after surgical intervention.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should track symptom progression, treatment response, and adherence to activity modifications, and **patient-reported outcomes** [^113P6kxU] should be measured with standardized pain and functional scales to guide ongoing care [^111fMvHb].

---

This plan emphasizes a **stepwise approach**: begin with conservative measures, escalate to surgery only if symptoms persist [^111kdDp6], and use **dynamic ultrasound** [^111Ca6LU] as the key diagnostic tool.

### Minimally invasive repair of adult slipped rib syndrome without costal cartilage excision [^113TDVUV]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Slipped rib syndrome (SRS) is a painful disorder caused when one or more of the 8th-10th false ribs become abnormally mobile. Established treatment modalities include analgesia, intercostal nerve injection, and costal cartilage excision. No definitive surgical correction of SRS without cartilage excision has been previously described. We aimed to determine whether a nonexcisional repair technique in affected adults could demonstrate significant relief from SRS using standardized outcome measures.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of cases of SRS treated at our institution in 2019. We obtained data by survey before and after sutured 10th rib fixation, using a self-reported rating scale from 0–10 at defined intervals. Surveyed outcome measures were compared pre- and postoperatively using the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. The use of neural modulating, narcotic, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug medications was also compared pre- and postoperatively using McNemar's test where applicable.

- **Results**: SRS was diagnosed using clinical examination alone in 42 adults and repaired in 29 patients. Median postoperative improvement in pain at 1 and 6 months was 75% (P < .001) and 80% (P < .001), respectively. Improvements in other outcome measures were similar. In patients who took pain medications preoperatively, narcotics were discontinued at 1 month by 100%, neural modulators by 86%, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs by 92% (all P values < .001). Pain medication use remained minimal at 6 months in 23 (79%) of patients completing follow-up.

### Scts annual meeting 2022 abstracts [^111Ca6LU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Slipping rib syndrome (SRS) is not well recognized by physicians, and many patients undergo multiple consultations and investigations before receiving a diagnosis. SRS is caused by hypermobility of the costal cartilages of the 8th to 10th ribs. Recent studies have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of surgical management via rib(s) excision and stabilization. Dynamic ultrasound of the chest wall (DUS) has emerged as a useful tool in aiding the diagnosis of SRS, which is traditionally a clinical diagnosis. The objective was to determine if a standardized management protocol based on a targeted excision/repair technique could lead to significant symptom improvement, evaluated through health outcome measures.

A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted on all patients (n = 18) undergoing surgical intervention for SRS between September 2019 and July 2021. Data were collected using standardized health and pain questionnaires pre-operatively and post-operatively. Outcomes were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test.

- **Results**: Median length of history was 6 years. DUS identified the excursion movement of the specific rib in all cases. All 18 patients underwent a targeted rib excision with or without stabilization. Post-operatively, the mean improvement in pain at 6 weeks was 46% (p < 0.01).

### Long-term outcomes and satisfaction rates after costal cartilage resection for slipping rib syndrome [^111kdDp6]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Slipping rib syndrome (SRS) is a challenging and underdiagnosed condition. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of costal cartilage resection for SRS and now report the long-term follow-up of our updated cohort.

- **Methods**: Retrospective chart review with prospective telephone follow-up was performed for 30 previously analyzed patients and 22 new patients to elucidate risk factors for recurrence and discuss preoperative experience, symptoms, postoperative course, and satisfaction.

- **Results**: From 2006 to 2020, 49 patients met inclusion criteria and underwent 67 operations. Eleven patients underwent re-operation for recurrence, with a median time of 1.6 years [1.2, 2.6]. The median age of symptom onset was 13 years [11, 14], while the median age at diagnosis was 15.4 years [14, 16.7]. Out of the 49 patients, 29 (59%) were contacted, with a median follow-up of 4.5 years [2.1, 5.7]. Twenty-one patients (72%) reported a complete cure, and 20 (69%) reported satisfaction at 10/10, with 83% rating their satisfaction greater than 7/10. Eleven patients (38%) were offered opioids for pain control prior to surgical evaluation. Patients with recurrence had residual or fused cartilage, hypermobile bony ribs, or both, at re-excision.

- **Conclusions**: Costal cartilage resection is an effective treatment for SRS, with high satisfaction rates and is an appropriate consideration for patients who fail conservative management.

- **Level of evidence**: Level IV; case series with no comparison groups.

### Slipping rib syndrome: An elusive diagnosis [^114ycQPj]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Slipping rib syndrome remains rarely recognized and frequently undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Awareness of this condition may prevent extensive and unnecessary diagnostic evaluation and avoid chronic debilitating pain. Persistent lower chest and/or upper abdomen pain after analgesic treatment may suggest the possibility of this disorder. The diagnosis of this syndrome is clinical, based on the patient's history and the hooking maneuver. A few cases have been published in the literature, providing no clear consensus about the treatment of this condition. In this overview article, the clinical manifestations, diagnostic approach, and treatment modalities of this syndrome will be discussed.

### Machine learning-based cluster analysis identifies three unique phenotypes of patients with adult spinal deformity with distinct clinical profiles and long-term recovery trajectory: A development study [^113JTr85]. Spine (2025). Low credibility.

The present study proposes three phenotypes with distinct procedure regimes and recovery trajectories. Within the identified phenotypes, pain location and its severity emerge as pivotal classifiers, with minimal VAS for back and leg in phenotype 1, higher VAS for back but lower VAS for leg in phenotype 2, and higher VAS for back and leg in phenotype 3. Phenotype 1, labeled as the "minimal impairment" group, exhibited better SRS-22r domains at baseline and the highest SRS-22r domains at both 1-year and 2-year follow-ups. This outcome correlates with the prediction rule proposed by Smith et al; they reported that ASD patients who exhibited the best and worst postoperative outcomes were preoperatively different in terms of the severity of baseline disability as measured by ODI and SRS-22r domains.

It is worth noting that patients in this cluster exhibited younger age, lower pain, and significantly higher SRS-self-image. Therefore, this cohort supposedly underwent surgical intervention not for pain reduction, but for other symptoms associated with ASD, such as cosmetic concerns. In patients with ASD, back pain can derive from the degeneration of intervertebral discs and facet joints, and increased load on the spinal axis by inducing fatigue on the erector spinae muscles. Verma et al. reported that ASD patients with radiculopathy showed increased preoperative disability compared to those without leg pain and that greater pain and disability continued even after surgery. Additionally, previous studies indicated that back pain was more related to patient satisfaction.

### Chest wall abnormalities and their clinical significance in childhood [^115pfmKV]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The thorax consists of the rib cage and the respiratory muscles. It houses and protects various intrathoracic organs such as the lungs, heart, vessels, esophagus, and nerves. It also serves as the "respiratory pump", generating the movement of air into the lungs while preventing their total collapse during exhalation. The performance of these functions depends on the structural and functional integrity of the rib cage and respiratory muscles. Any condition, whether congenital or acquired, affecting either of these components can have serious implications on the function of the other.

Furthermore, when these abnormalities occur early in life, they may affect lung growth. This article reviews the physiology of the respiratory pump, provides a comprehensive list of conditions affecting the thorax, and describes their effects on lung growth and function.

### Remaining or residual first ribs are the cause of recurrent thoracic outlet syndrome [^112Mp1ep]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Surgical intervention for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) is not always successful, as treatment plans can be difficult in patients presenting with recurrent symptoms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes for this patient subset, who underwent operative intervention to remove a remaining or residual first rib due to thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS)-related symptoms.

- **Methods**: Data on 15 patients who presented with previous scalenectomy, brachial plexus lysis, or first rib resection and scalenectomy (FRRS) with a residual rib present on chest radiograph from 2004 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively maintained database, with approval from the Institutional Review Board of Johns Hopkins Hospital. Patients were classified as having a remaining first rib if they presented with recurrent NTOS symptoms, had previously undergone scalenectomy and/or brachial plexus lysis alone to decompress the thoracic outlet, and exhibited an intact first rib on chest X-ray. Patients were classified as having a remnant rib if they presented with recurrent symptoms of NTOS, had previously undergone a first rib resection at another institution, and exhibited an anterior or posterior first rib on chest X-ray. Demographic and clinical characteristics along with postoperative outcomes were evaluated.

- **Results**: Different precipitating events reaggravated symptoms in 12 patients, including car accidents (n = 4), work-related repetitive movements (n = 5), lifting heavy objects (n = 2), and repetitive injury (n = 1).

### Recommendations for reporting on rehabilitation interventions [^113P6kxU]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). High credibility.

Clear reporting on rehabilitation treatments is critical for interpreting and replicating study results, as well as for translating treatment research into clinical practice. This article reports the recommendations of a working group on improved reporting on rehabilitation treatments. These recommendations are intended to be combined with the efforts of other working groups, through a consensus process, to arrive at a reporting guideline for randomized controlled trials in physical medicine and rehabilitation (Randomized Controlled Trials Rehabilitation Checklist).

The work group conducted a scoping review of 156 diverse guidelines for randomized controlled trial reporting, aiming to identify themes that might be applied to the rehabilitation field. Themes were developed by identifying content that might improve or enhance existing items from the Template for Intervention Description and Replication.

- **Broad research domains**: Guidelines tended to define reporting items generally, from the investigator's perspective of relevance.
- **Circumscribed domains**: Provided more specific and operationalized items.

Rehabilitation is a diverse field, but a clear description of the treatment's separable components, along with distinct treatment theories for each, can improve reporting of relevant information. Over time, expert consensus groups should develop more specific guideline extensions for circumscribed research domains, focusing on coalescing bodies of treatment theory.

### One-year results of minimally invasive sutured fixation of the slipped ribs in the pediatric population [^114bKrQo]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Costal cartilage resection with or without rib resection is considered the gold standard surgery for slipping rib syndrome. Minimally invasive restoration of normal anatomy using nonabsorbable sutures has shown encouraging results in the adult population. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of minimally invasive sutured fixation of the hypermobile rib in the pediatric population.

A retrospective review was conducted at Mayo Clinic involving 31 pediatric patients diagnosed with slipped rib syndrome. Minimally invasive sutured open reduction internal fixation was performed between 2020 and 2022. The standardized Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire was administered at designated time points pre- and post-operatively to assess efficacy. Significance was determined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

SRS was clinically diagnosed in 31 patients (24 females, 7 males, ages 12–20). Symptoms were present for an average of 18.9 months, and patients had seen an average of 4.7 specialists. Traumatic causes were identified in three patients, and eight patients had hypermobility. At one month follow-up, there were no surgical complications, and patients reported significantly less pain (p < 0.001). Preoperative analgesics were reduced by 80%. Ultimately, seven patients underwent a second operation, three patients underwent a third operation, and one patient underwent five total operations. Recurrent pain was reported in six patients. Only nine patients followed up at 1-year post-operation.

Pediatric patients with SRS demonstrated an early positive response to the minimally invasive procedure.

### Comparison of the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided superficial serratus anterior plane block and intercostal nerve block for rib fractures: a randomized controlled trial [^115V9CjB]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

Various regional analgesic methods are frequently incorporated into multimodal analgesia strategies for managing rib fractures. This study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided superficial serratus anterior plane block (S-SAPB) and intercostal nerve block (ICNB) in patients with isolated rib fractures.

- **Methods**: This randomized controlled trial included patients aged 18–65 years with unilateral isolated rib fractures (≤ 6 ribs) resulting from trauma. Patients underwent ultrasound-guided S-SAPB (20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine) or ICNB (3 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine for each fractured rib). Pain levels were assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) both prior to the procedure (Pre-Block, T0) and at specific time points following the intervention: 1st hour (T1), 2nd hour (T2), 4th hour (T4), 8th hour (T8), 16th hour (T16), and 24th hour (T24). The changes in observed values over time were expressed as delta (Δ).

- **Results**: Both S-SAPB and ICNB provided effective analgesia. In the first 4 hours, ICNB demonstrated a greater reduction in VAS scores, particularly in patients with 10th and 11th rib fractures. However, S-SAPB resulted in significantly longer-lasting analgesia, with greater pain relief after 8 hours (T8-T24) compared to ICNB (p < 0.05). Patients in the S-SAPB group required no additional analgesia, whereas 43.3% of ICNB patients required supplemental tramadol (p < 0.001). Both techniques were well tolerated, with no reported complications.

- **Conclusions**: S-SAPB provides prolonged analgesia and may be preferable for managing rib fracture pain beyond the initial hours post-injury.

### The radiographic approach to child abuse [^113FVaFz]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

An AP chest radiograph of a 3-month-old infant (Fig. 2A) shows a classic posteromedial rib fracture near the midline (arrow), with other healing rib fractures noted elsewhere (arrowheads). An axial CT image of the same patient (Fig. 2B) displays the same posteromedial fracture with irregular linear lucency (arrow). The CT image reveals this more clearly than the radiograph in Fig. 2A. Other rib fractures with periosteal reaction indicating healing are also present (arrowheads and curved arrow).

By conventional radiography, an acute rib fracture can be identified by a linear lucency in the bone. The lucency's conspicuity varies depending on the fracture's angle relative to the beam, its age, and the degree of displacement. Rib fractures are typically either nondisplaced or only minimally displaced, making acute diagnosis challenging. As healing occurs, callus forms, identifying the fracture as a small segment of fusiform widening that then tapers in the contour of the rib. Initially, the linear lucency of the fracture becomes more apparent, then fades as healing progresses. Occasionally, only subtle linear sclerosis may be present.

CT scanning aids significantly by making these phases more evident. It also highlights important confirmatory soft tissue changes, such as pulmonary contusions, pleural effusions, and extrapleural soft tissue swelling and hemorrhage. The "hole in the rib" pattern can be attributed to medullary trabecular resorption around the fracture, resulting in radiographically evident radiolucency surrounding a healing fracture (Fig. 3).

### Acute care of cyclic vomiting syndrome and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in the home and emergency department [^1118n7N6]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

An individualized care plan should be developed for patients who frequently utilize the emergency department to abort cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) or cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) attacks. For some patients, care could be provided with standing orders at an outpatient infusion center or even in a home care setting. However, for most patients, it is more feasible to organize a predictable care plan at a community or academic hospital emergency department.

The ideal time to discuss and implement such a plan is during the interepisodic phase, informed by past responses to specific medical therapies. Process discussions to implement a care plan most often occur with the responsible medical administrator, likely the emergency department nurse manager. Hospitals adopting computerized medical records can increasingly trigger individualized treatment protocols for conditions such as CVS. These care plans relieve the patient of the effort to educate medical and nursing staff at every visit, as well as reassure emergency department staff against the idea of drug-seeking behavior when requesting medications such as benzodiazepines.

Ideally, these care plans should be developed by a patient's primary care physician or specialist and emergency department representatives, with the final care plan approved by the patient. Physicians often find that the care plan simplifies decision-making, and patients particularly find relief in experiencing predictable, effective care. Although data is lacking, anecdotal experience has shown that admission rates are lower in CVS or CHS patients whose care adheres to an individualized care plan.

### Bilateral 11th rib disarticulation and resection for chronic rib pain: A case report [^117ESv3g]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Low credibility.

Traditionally, chronic rib pain results from painful rib syndrome or slipping rib syndrome. Painful rib syndrome is considered to result from irritation to an adjacent intercostal nerve from ribcage hypermobility. Similarly, slipping rib syndrome is thought to result from a failure of development or fusion of the costal cartilage, allowing for grinding movement of the ribs/cartilage and impingement of the intercostal neurovascular bundle and peripheral soft tissue. The discomfort caused by slipping rib syndrome and painful rib syndrome tends to be located in the anterior thorax. In this case, however, the patient's discomfort was located posteriorly, in the paraspinal region at the 11th costovertebral joint. Removing approximately one half of the proximal 11th rib led to complete resolution of chronic pain.

We found only one published full-length manuscript describing this condition and treatment. Sales and colleagues reported a series of 5 patients treated with a similar operation between 1990 and 2002, which they termed resection arthroplasty. The diagnosis that the patients were given was osteoarthritis of the costovertebral joint. The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine to exclude intervertebral disc pathology, as well as CT scan, which confirmed osteoarthritis of a single costovertebral joint. Image-guided injection of the relevant joint with lidocaine and steroid was performed; a positive response to the injection was ensured before proceeding with resection in 4 of the 5 cases. Their mean operating time was 89 minutes (range, 68–110 minutes).

### Bilateral 11th rib disarticulation and resection for chronic rib pain: A case report [^116Akged]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Low credibility.

An axial CT scan reveals an unremarkable insertion of the 11th rib on the vertebral body.

- **Central message**: We report the unusual case of unrelenting chronic pain at the bilateral 11th costovertebral joints, which responded to disarticulation and partial rib resection of the affected ribs on each side.

- **Causes and management**: Numerous causes, both traumatic and atraumatic, as well as the management of chronic rib pain, have been discussed. Painful rib syndrome and slipping rib syndrome are well-recognized entities resulting in chronic rib pain. However, chronic pain related to the costovertebral joint is less well understood and described. This report introduces the first documented case of bilateral costovertebral joint pain, successfully treated using partial rib resection for this obscure condition.

### Rehabilitation definition for research purposes: A global stakeholders' initiative by Cochrane Rehabilitation [^113Zy2bP]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

Suppose some articles report treatments like manipulation, exercises, and orthosis as single interventions. At the same time, in the clinical reality of these studies, they were multimodal rehabilitation because they combined with others (e.g. counseling, education, cognitive-behavioral component). Their results would lead manipulation therapists or trainers to apply these treatments without adding the other elements, that is, providing single interventions and not rehabilitation. Consequently, the results could be completely different from the expectations.

Failure to recognize what was performed in the primary studies (single intervention or rehabilitation?) because of poor study conduct, reporting, or (even worse, but probably also common) understanding can significantly impact the clinical end users. This negative effect multiplies in the case of secondary evidence synthesis. The risks are that the results of primary studies with highly different interventions are pooled together because they are erroneously judged to be similar interventions. Consequently, evidence syntheses may fail to identify effective treatments, generating low certainty results, generally limited by high heterogeneity.

The broad audience and influence of evidence syntheses, for example, informing recommendations within clinical guidelines, make this a potentially serious problem that may impact the delivery of effective rehabilitation. The rehabilitation definition can help primary researchers to correctly define what they are doing when they study "rehabilitation interventions" or "re…

### Surgical treatment of snapping scapula syndrome due to malunion of rib fractures [^116qRoYc]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

This report describes a case of snapping scapula syndrome (SSS) caused by malunited rib fractures. Abrasion of the deformed ribs was performed with good results. SSS as a cause of shoulder pain after thoracic trauma has to be considered and can be treated by a surgical abrasion technique.

### Costal cartilage excision for the treatment of pediatric slipping rib syndrome [^113CAmGD]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Costal cartilage excision is an effective treatment for slipping rib syndrome (SRS), although diagnosing SRS may be elusive. We review our experience with SRS in pediatric patients.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective review from 2000 to 2011 of patients presenting with symptoms of SRS before 18 years of age.

- **Results**: Seven patients were identified who were diagnosed with SRS and underwent costal cartilage excision. All patients presented with unilateral chest pain exacerbated by activity. Five patients reported a popping or clicking sensation with activity that was associated with pain. On physical examination, all patients had reproducible pain with palpation over the affected cartilage. Four patients exhibited a mobile or popping rib with palpation, and four also had chest wall asymmetry. Five patients underwent imaging, and four patients were referred to specialists. It was a median of 2 years (0–5 years) from the onset of symptoms to resection. At resection, all cartilages were grossly abnormal. There were no postoperative complications. Follow-up was complete for all patients over a median of 0.9 years (0.2–2.0 years). One patient experienced a recurrence of pain in a different location; another had persistent pain, though it was less severe.

- **Conclusions**: Slipping rib syndrome presents with costal cartilage pain that is reproducible on physical examination and commonly associated with a mobile rib. Excision of the affected cartilage(s) is an effective treatment and should be considered early to avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests and evaluations, which delay definitive therapy.

### Thoracic insufficiency syndrome: Approaches to assessment and management [^116R3q2E]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS) was described in 2003 as the inability of the thorax to support normal respiration or lung growth. TIS includes a broad and disparate group of typically degenerative thoracospinal conditions. Although TIS arises due to a heterogeneous group of disorders and thus its incidence is not well quantified, general approaches to management and treatment exist.

Evolving imaging techniques and measurements of health-related quality of life augment tests of pulmonary function to quantify disease burden, both longitudinally and pre- and post-intervention. Intervention is primarily via growth-sparing surgery, for which several device options exist, to preserve vertical growth prior to a definitive spinal fusion at skeletal maturity.

### Computed tomography-guided reoperation for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome [^113zahrT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Persistent symptoms after surgical treatment for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (nTOS) are commonly encountered by high-volume referral centers. The mechanical etiology patterns at reoperation include: (1) inadequate previous rib resection, (2) rib regrowth, (3) scar tissue formation, or (4) intact scalene muscle. Reoperative TOS surgery has significant potential morbidity. Therefore, careful patient selection and meticulous planning are required. This study evaluated the utility of multidetector computed tomography (CT) in the differential diagnosis of patients with recurrent or persistent nTOS.

A retrospective record review was performed of an nTOS referral practice, focusing on patients reoperated on for recurrent or persistent symptoms. In 2003, a dedicated high-resolution multidetector TOS CT protocol was established to assist in clinical decision-making and reoperative planning. A single designated radiologist interpreted all CT images. Imaging, patient clinical characteristics, interventions, and outcomes were reviewed.

The study group included 20 reoperations for recurrent (n = 15) or persistent (n = 5) symptoms. The mean age was 35 years, and 60% of redo cases were in women. Preoperative CT imaging demonstrated the following anatomic patterns: inadequate previous rib resection in 5 (25%), rib regrowth in 5 (25%), scar tissue formation in 10 (50%), and intact scalene muscle in 3 (15%). Operative findings concurred with preoperative imaging in 85% of patients.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^1162FH4c]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians' (CHEST) new Living Guidelines Model will not only provide clinicians with guidance based on the most clinically relevant science, but will also allow expert-informed guidance to fill in any gaps in the existing evidence. These guidance documents will be updated as necessary using one or more of three processes: (1) evidence-based guidelines, (2) trustworthy consensus statements, and (3) a hybrid of the other two. The new Living Guidelines Model will be more sustainable and will encourage maintenance of targeted recommendations and suggestions.

- **Methods**: Over recent years, the Guidelines Oversight Committee (GOC), which consists of CHEST members with methodological experience and other stakeholders, developed a rigorous process for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. This guideline methodology will be used to the greatest extent permitted by the peer-reviewed literature. However, for some important problems, clinicians seek guidance but insufficient research prevents establishing guidelines. For such cases, the GOC has created a carefully structured approach permitting a convened expert panel to develop such guidance. The foundation of this approach includes a systematic review of literature and rigorously vetted, entrusted experts.

- **Results**: Existing evidence, even if insufficient for a guideline, can be combined with a Delphi process for consensus achievement, resulting in trustworthy consensus statements. This article provides a review of the CHEST methodologies for these guidance documents.

### Neck pain: Revision 2017 [^116Cq9Ae]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for neck pain, particularly concerning physical therapy for neck pain with mobility deficits, APTA 2017 guidelines recommend offering a multimodal approach for patients with chronic neck pain with mobility deficits:

- **Thoracic manipulation and cervical manipulation or mobilization**: These techniques help improve mobility and reduce pain.

- **Mixed exercise for cervical/scapulothoracic regions with neuromuscular exercise**: This includes coordination, proprioception, and postural training, which are complemented by stretching, strengthening, endurance training, aerobic conditioning, and cognitive affective elements.

- **Dry needling, laser, or intermittent mechanical/manual traction**: These adjunctive therapies may further assist in managing pain and enhancing mobility.

### An assessment of outcomes with intramedullary fixation of fractured ribs [^117NJ4mr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Of the 33 intramedullary splints placed, six were positioned laterally, while the remaining 27 were used for posterior rib fractures. The direction of splint insertion, either posteriorly toward the spine or laterally away from the spine, was determined by the surgeon's preference. Operating room time was slightly longer than when using only outer cortical plates due to intraoperative image intensifier usage to ensure correct placement of all intramedullary splints. On two occasions, an intramedullary splint perforated the rib cortex and needed to be backed out and redirected correctly. We did not present data on operative times since these operations often involved other specialists addressing additional fractures not related to ribs.

The 3-month CT scans were assessed for the degree of healing and the presence of residual deformity at the fracture fixation site. Complete healing (bony union) was observed in only 3 (9%) of the fractures fixed with splints by 3 months. Partial healing (cartilaginous union) was noted in 28 of the 33 fractures (85%), and non-healing was seen in only 2 (6%). In these two patients, there was a failure at the rib/splint interface with hardware removal before 3 months, residual deformity, and failure of union (shown in Figures 3 and 4). No other patients experienced residual deformity or non-union at a fracture site fixed with an intramedullary splint. There were no hardware failures in this cohort.

Pain was markedly reduced at 3 months in all patients, with only two patients still requiring opiate analgesics.

### Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF): The WSES and CWIS position paper [^115hL4wr]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

A CT scan is required prior to SSRF. Other modalities, including 3D reconstruction, may add value in certain cases, but their absence should neither delay nor preclude surgery.

- **Rib fracture sites for SSRF**: SSRF should be considered for fractures in ribs 2–10. Repair of ribs 1, 11, and 12 does not confer additional benefits in terms of either chest wall stability or pain control and may be considered only in highly selected circumstances. Such circumstances include marked displacement, thoracic or abdominal organs impalement/damage/herniation, marked chest wall deformity, vascular impingement, or localized refractory pain (LoE V, Grade D).

- **Preoperative image analysis**: During this process, the surgeon should determine the rib fracture types and locations (anterior/lateral/posterior), indicating the anatomical landmarks used (LoE V, Grade D).

- **Repair options for specific fracture locations**:
	- Fractures within 2.5 cm of the costal cartilage may be repaired by spanning plates to the sternum outer cortex, if possible, or alternatively by fixation to the cartilage (LoE IV, Grade C).
	- Fractures abutting the transverse process of the vertebral body may be repaired if the surgeon is able to obtain reliable fixation on the proximal fracture fragment. There is no absolute distance cutoff for this decision (LoE V, Grade D).

- **Stabilization of multiple fractures**: In patients with multiple fracture series (e.g. flail segment or FC), both fracture lines should be stabilized whenever possible (LoE IV, Grade C). In patients with non-FC rib fracture patterns, all displaced ribs should be stabilized whenever possible (LoE IV, Grade C).

### Rehabilitation definition for research purposes: A global stakeholders' initiative by Cochrane Rehabilitation [^111zV978]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

The definition has the potential to improve and clarify the development and publication of primary studies and substantially enhance the clarity of evidence synthesis within systematic reviews. We give here two examples where the definition could improve reporting of intervention components. Let's hypothesize a study focusing on spinal manipulation performed in a rehabilitation setting. We could have two main possibilities: (1) the treatment providers could manipulate only (strict per-protocol approach); (2) in a rehabilitation setting, we can also expect that they add educational advice, counseling, and perhaps even some suggestions for exercises. This second possibility is particularly true when independent clinicians (and not the researchers) provide the treatments because they are concerned with their patients' results and not with research integrity. Similarly, in a second example of therapeutic exercises for one specific health condition, it would be usual for a provider in a rehabilitation setting to incorporate patient education into their exercise provision. They may even introduce the exercises within an overall cognitive-behavioral approach, sometimes without even being conscious of this and calling the treatment "therapeutic exercise" only. We would expect these adjunctive interventions to contribute to differential rehabilitation outcomes and procedures should be clearly reported.

### Norditropin [^114R7dsH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Slipped capital femoral epiphysis in pediatric patients**: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders, including GHD and Turner syndrome, or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during somatropin therapy should be carefully evaluated.

- **Progression of preexisting scoliosis in pediatric patients**: Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Skeletal abnormalities, including scoliosis, are commonly seen in untreated patients with Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome. Scoliosis is also commonly seen in untreated patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Physicians should be alert to these abnormalities, which may manifest during somatropin therapy.

- **Otitis media and cardiovascular disorders in Turner syndrome**: Patients with Turner syndrome should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders, since these patients have an increased risk of ear and hearing disorders. Somatropin treatment may increase the occurrence of otitis media in patients with Turner syndrome. In addition, patients with Turner syndrome should be monitored closely for cardiovascular disorders, such as stroke, aortic aneurysm/dissection, and hypertension, as these patients are also at risk.

### Focal therapy: Patients, interventions, and outcomes — a report from a consensus meeting [^112Pqjbd]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

**Limitations**: Expert group meetings are susceptible to significant bias because they often include individuals with vested interests in the field as a whole or in specific aspects of it. The presence of an independent chair, who had no personal interest in the results of the consensus exercise, helped to reduce this bias. The chair ensured that all panel members had the opportunity to contribute to the discussions and that no member dominated the discussions. It is important to note that the scoring method, even during the face-to-face meeting, was anonymous. We also acknowledge a lack of expertise in imaging and pathology. Although this situation was decided a priori because the questions were about the delivery of focal therapy, it may have affected our findings.

### A call to action [plans] for cyclic vomiting syndrome [^113eZAWw]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a disorder of gut-brain interaction with a wide clinical spectrum. Clinical action plans have been developed to address and facilitate treatment for complex, chronic medical conditions. The CVS Action Plan was developed to meet the chronic and acute care needs of children and adults with CVS. While this tool has not been tested for clinical efficacy as was shown with action plans for functional constipation, anecdotal and indirect evidence supports its use. The CVS Action Plan has the potential to enhance outcomes by simplifying home management and streamlining disease recognition and acute care in the emergency department.

### Computer-assisted surgical planning and intraoperative guidance in fetal surgery: A systematic review [^112gtDeV]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Fetal surgery has become a clinical reality, with interventions for twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and spina bifida demonstrated to improve outcomes. Fetal imaging is evolving, with the use of 3D ultrasound and fetal MRI becoming more common in clinical practice. Medical imaging analysis is also changing, with technology being developed to assist surgeons by creating 3D virtual models. These models improve understanding of complex anatomy and prove to be powerful tools in surgical planning and intraoperative guidance.

We introduce the concept of computer-assisted surgical planning and present the results of a systematic review of image reconstruction for fetal surgical planning. This review identified six articles utilizing such technology.

- **Surgical planning benefits**: Indications from other specialties suggest a benefit of surgical planning and guidance to improve outcomes. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop fetal-specific technology to improve fetal surgical outcomes.

### Guidelines for composing and assessing a paper on treatment of pain [^111fMvHb]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Authors, readers, and editors share a common focus. Authors want to publish their work, while readers seek high-quality, new information. Referees and editors ensure that authors provide valid conclusions based on the quality of information that readers desire. Common to each of these roles are instructions to authors. Typically, these are written in an uninspiring, legalistic style, like a set of rules that authors must follow to get published. This makes the instructions seem boring and oppressive, if not forbidding. Yet, they need not be so if set in context.

Instructions to authors can be framed in a way that reflects a common purpose. They can remind authors of what perceptive readers want to see in a paper and prompt authors to include all necessary information. When framed this way, instructions to authors are not merely rules to satisfy publishers; they become guidelines for effective communication etiquette between authors and their readers.

Against this background, the present article is composed to serve several purposes. Foremost, it amplifies instructions to authors beyond conventional technicalities such as headings, layout, font size, and line spacing. It prescribes the type of information that should be communicated and explains the reasons for these recommendations. Doing so informs authors about what to write and also informs readers and referees about what to look for in a good paper. Secondarily, the article publicizes examples of errors and deficiencies of manuscripts submitted to the journal.

### Multi-modal treatment approach to painful rib syndrome: Case series and review of the literature [^111NBMhp]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Mechanical chest wall pain is a common presenting complaint in primary care offices, emergency rooms, and specialty clinics. Diagnostic testing is often expensive due to similar presenting symptoms that may involve the heart or lungs. Since chest wall biomechanics are poorly understood by many clinicians, few effective treatments are offered to patients with rib-related acute pain, which may lead to chronic pain.

- **Objective**: This case series and literature review illustrate the biomechanics involved in the pathogenesis of rib-related chest wall pain and suggest an effective multi-modal treatment plan using interventional techniques, with an emphasis on manual manipulative techniques.

- **Study design**: Case series and literature review.

- **Setting**: Pain clinic in an academic medical center.

- **Results**: This is a case series of three patients diagnosed with painful rib syndrome using osteopathic palpatory physical examination techniques. Ultrasound-guided intercostal nerve blocks were followed by manual manipulation of mechanically displaced ribs as part of our multi-modal treatment plan. A review of the literature was undertaken to clarify nomenclature used in the description of rib-related pain, to describe the biomechanics involved in the pathogenesis of mechanical rib pain, and to illustrate the use of effective manual manipulation techniques.

- **Limitation**: This review is introductory and not a complete review of all manual or interventional pain management techniques applicable to the treatment of mechanical rib-related pain.

### Bilateral 11th rib disarticulation and resection for chronic rib pain: A case report [^114PBasj]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Low credibility.

Unlike slipping rib syndrome, which is a fairly well-known phenomenon, chronic pain caused by mobility of the costovertebral joint has not been widely understood or reported. Resection of the rib leading to the resolution of this problem has been only rarely reported. This case demonstrates this unusual scenario and successful surgical intervention.

We do not believe that the patient's resolution of pain was related to dermatomal anesthesia caused by disruption of the intercostal nerve; previous local anesthetic injections in the area were not helpful, and the patient did not describe any significant numbness at either of the postoperative visits. Instead, we believe that her pain was alleviated by removing the contact point between the rib and the costal facet of the spine.

Exact preoperative marking of the rib to be resected based on patient guidance is crucial, as intraoperative palpation or localization of the abnormal joint may not be possible. It is critical to completely disarticulate the head of the rib from the transverse process of the spine. Only partial resection of the rib is necessary, as the source of pain originates from the costovertebral joint and not the rib itself. Minimizing additional tissue trauma (e.g. omitting pericostal sutures and chest tube placement) may yield benefits in terms of postoperative pain.

### Rib head protrusion into the central canal in type 1 neurofibromatosis [^113XTukG]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Dystrophic scoliosis in children with NF is typically characterized by a short-segment, sharply angulated curve with associated wedging and scalloping of the vertebral bodies. It can be accompanied by vertebral body rotation, widening of the intervertebral foramina, and penciling of rib heads. These abnormalities predispose children with dystrophic scoliosis to intraspinal rib head dislocation. To our knowledge, a total of 21 cases (including our four) of intraspinal rib head dislocation in NF1 patients have been reported in the English literature. The majority of documented cases of intraspinal rib head dislocation in NF1 occur during the teenage years (ages range from 5 to 16 years) with no gender predisposition. Although generally asymptomatic, the clinical presentation of intraspinal rib displacement varies. Two of our patients had moderate symptoms; the other two were essentially asymptomatic. This parallels the cases we found in the literature, with nine of the 15 for whom this information was available being essentially asymptomatic. The other six had neurological symptoms ranging from mild sensory and motor deficits to paraplegia and paraparesis.

- **Postoperative complications**: Both Khoshhal and Ellis and Cappella et al. describe the postoperative complication of rib head dislocation in NF patients who developed paraparesis several weeks after posterior spinal fusion without recognition of or attempt at correcting rib head protrusion. In retrospect, rib head protrusion had been present on a preoperative MRI in Cappella's patient but had not been recognized. Both cases illustrate the potential oversight in diagnosing rib head protrusion preoperatively.

### Radiomic modeling of bone density and rib fracture risk after stereotactic body radiation therapy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^117MPLjd]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Patient characteristics**: A total of 192 treatment plans met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and had available dosimetric data (4 patients had separate left and right lung SBRT plans included in the analysis). A subset of 180 of these plans was used to extract radiomic data from the ribs. The median follow-up for all patients was 22.4 months, and only 15.6% of patients had less than 12 months of follow-up (patients with less than 6 months of follow-up were excluded from the study).

There were 31 rib fractures (16.1%), with 21 of those causing chest wall pain (10.9%). The 2-year rate of rib fracture was 12.7%. The median time to a rib fracture was 20.5 months (range: 5.6–77.5 months). Clinical variables that were significant predictors of a rib fracture include distance to the chest wall (P < 0.001), PTV–rib overlap (P < 0.001), PTV–chest wall overlap (P < 0.001), and time from treatment to death/last follow-up (P = 0.023) (Table E1). Of patients with PTV overlapping any volume of the chest wall, 26.4% developed a rib fracture compared with 2.4% among those with no PTV–chest wall overlap.

### Surgical treatment of the intraspinal rib head dislocation in children with dystrophic scoliosis secondary to type 1 neurofibromatosis [^113Lu3Ca]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Low credibility.

We monitored somatosensory evoked potentials and motor evoked potentials intraoperatively in this study to reduce the risk of spinal cord injury. No new neurological injury or aggravation of neurological symptoms occurred postoperatively in any patient.

This study has several limitations. First, without postoperative MRI, it is not possible to accurately measure the changes in DSCIRH before and after surgery, making it difficult to evaluate safety regarding the spinal cord. Furthermore, 18 patients received GRs, and only 3 underwent subsequent PSF. However, it is unclear whether the other 15 individuals eventually required PSF because these patients were lost to follow-up. Finally, we calculated the IRP through CT images of patients, aiming to be used as a quantitative indicator of the severity of the rib head into the spinal canal, and also to conduct statistical comparison and analysis of important imaging parameters for patients before and after surgery, which has certain clinical value. However, the clinical value of IRP in guiding the choice of surgical treatment really needs further study and analysis.

Overall, the surgical treatment of IRH in children with NF1-DS should be determined on the basis of the presence of preoperative neurological symptoms. This study supports the practice of correcting spinal deformities only in patients with mild or no spinal cord injury. If there are obvious neurological symptoms, IRH resection is necessary to relieve spinal cord compression to recover nerve function.

### A newborn with extremely rare cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome; a case report study [^113UP333]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome (CCMS) is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by micrognathia and posterior rib gaps. Patients often experience breathing difficulties due to upper airway obstruction, decreased thoracic capacity, spina bifida, and scoliosis.

- **Case presentation**: We describe a case involving a late preterm neonate boy who presented with a low Apgar score, respiratory distress, and complicated orofacial anomalies, resulting in a poor outcome. Radiographic findings indicated mandibular hypoplasia (micrognathia), chest deformity, multiple posterior rib gap defects, and abnormal costotransverse articulation. Based on physical examination and radiologic findings, the diagnosis of CCMS was confirmed.

- **Conclusion**: Physicians should consider the diagnosis of CCMS in all infants with micrognathia and rib-gap defects, as these infants require careful monitoring of respiratory function. Early airway management is crucial for improving growth and development. Additionally, their physical and psychological development should be assessed regularly.

### Analysis of completion intraoperative venography during first rib resection for venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^1141jV38]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

- **Type of research**: Single-center retrospective cohort study.

- **Key findings**: First rib resection and completion intraoperative venography in 51 patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome identified 16 (31.3%) with no stenosis, 17 (33.3%) with no stenosis after angioplasty, 10 (19.7%) with residual stenosis, and 8 (15.7%) with complete occlusion. Symptomatic relief was achieved in 44 of the 51 patients (86.3%), and primary patency was seen in 42 of 43 patients (97.7%) at 3 months and 32 of 33 patients (97.0%) at 1 year without significant differences between groups (P = 0.49).

- **Take home message**: First rib resection and completion intraoperative venography resulted in excellent symptomatic relief and short- and mid-term patency for venous thoracic outlet syndrome despite residual stenosis and complete occlusion after decompression.

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) represents 5% of all cases of thoracic outlet syndrome, accounting for approximately 3,000 to 6,000 cases in the United States per year. Patients are typically young, with a mean age in their early 30s, and present with effort thrombosis of the axillosubclavian vein (AxSCV).

The traditional treatment algorithm comprises catheter-directed thrombolysis followed by first rib resection (FRR) and subsequent venography. Optimal timing of confirmatory venogram remains undefined. Chang et al. established routine postoperative venography 2 weeks after FRR in a study of 84 patients. Their protocol included balloon dilation and anticoagulation when a > 50% stenosis was identified, and stopping anticoagulation when the AxSCV was widely patent.

### Evidence for exercise-based interventions across 45 different long-term conditions: an overview of systematic reviews [^111HQZgq]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

This overview builds upon previous studies and summarizes the evidence from 42 systematic reviews (36 meta-analyses) and three supplementary randomized controlled trials (RCTs), providing a total of 990 RCTs in 936,825 people across 39 different long-term conditions (LTCs). We found that participation in exercise was beneficial in 25 out of the 45 pre-specified single LTCs, with consistent improvements in exercise capacity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to no exercise control. However, the quality of evidence was mixed.

Three main limitations identified across the included systematic reviews were: the lack of an explicit statement that review methods were established prior to the conduct of the review, limited provision of a rationale for the selection of included study designs, and lack of reporting of sources of funding. It is important to note that these limitations may reflect poor reporting rather than poor methodological quality per se.

Our overview identified limited reporting of key outcomes across LTCs, including mortality, hospital admissions, disability, frailty, and physical activity. This paucity of data limits our ability to fully understand the comprehensive impact of exercise-based interventions on important aspects of health. Moreover, these outcomes have recently been identified as core outcome measures for exercise and rehabilitation. Despite exercise being considered a universally effective intervention, evidence for the impact of exercise was lacking in seven out of 45 LTCs and evidence was uncertain for 13 LTCs.

### Customized 3-dimensional printed rib plating in chest wall reconstruction [^114WazGR]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Low credibility.

3D printing is a rapidly evolving field and is likely to shape the future of thoracic surgery. At this juncture, it is essential to identify suitable indications for the use of 3D-printed patient-specific implants and develop practical workflows to facilitate smooth implementation into clinical practice. Additionally, it is important to ensure easier accessibility of this technology and surgical technique to patients. Patients who have already undergone reconstructive surgery with 3D-printed implants should be followed up to study at least the short- and medium-term outcomes in the near future.

### Optimal diagnostic and treatment practices for facial dysostosis syndromes: A clinical consensus statement among European experts [^111G58AN]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Literature search, statement formation, and voting process**: Figure 1 illustrates the article selection and Delphi process. Following deduplication and screening of the remaining 3344 articles, 94 met the eligibility criteria. An additional fourteen articles were included by the expert panel to address evidence gaps. From these articles, 96 statements were initially derived, with 84 added by the panel based on expert opinion, and 16 based on a patient survey (17 responses). For the second voting round, 24 additional statements were included to enhance coverage, acknowledging the broad scope of facial dysostosis syndromes. Overall, 196, 98, and 27 statements were reviewed in the first, second, and third voting rounds, respectively, with 92 (46.9%), 58 (59.2%), and 19 (70.4%) achieving consensus. The voting process involved 92 experts from various specialties and 3 patient representatives [Supplemental Digital Content 1]. In Table 3, voting results and quality appraisal of source literature for consensus statements are presented [Supplemental Digital Content 1]. An overview of all statements, including those not reaching consensus, is available in Supplemental Digital File 3 [Supplemental Digital Content 4].

### Four-dimensional computed tomography scans facilitate preoperative planning in snapping scapula syndrome [^114ny83Q]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Because a 4-dimensional CT scan (4D CT) is able to provide a moving 3-dimensional (3D) image in real time for patients with snapping scapula syndrome, a 4D CT scan should be able to demonstrate bony impingement of the scapula on the posterior thorax. This study was performed to determine if 4D CT scans aid the clinician in defining the size and location of the scapular bone causing impingement in patients with snapping scapula syndrome.

Between October 2009 and August 2013, 12 patients (median age: 26.5 years; range: 15–55 years) with snapping scapula syndrome were investigated using 4D CT. The images formed produced a dynamic volume-rendered reconstruction of the scapulothoracic joint that displayed its movements and any dynamic area of impingement of the scapula on surrounding bony structures. Asymmetry between symptomatic and asymptomatic scapulae was used to determine the radiologic cause of the patient's symptoms. After the failure of conservative management, 8 patients underwent surgery for their condition.

Five patients demonstrated bony contact of the scapula on the posterior thoracic ribs. Four patients demonstrated no bony contact but close apposition of the scapula to the posterior thoracic ribs. Three patients demonstrated no bony impingement but abnormal movement of the second and third rib caused by a soft-tissue tethering structure.

The 4D CT scan images defined pathology well in patients with snapping scapula syndrome and improved assessment of the amount and location of the scapular bone and soft tissue.

### Development and validation of a prediction model for outcomes after transaxillary first rib resection for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome following strict Society for Vascular Surgery diagnostic criteria [^117NAvdP]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) is the most common form of thoracic outlet syndrome, although it has remained difficult to diagnose and treat successfully. The purpose of the present study was to generate a predictive clinical calculator for postoperative outcomes after first rib resection (FRR) for NTOS.

Methods included a retrospective review of patients who underwent FRR for NTOS at a single tertiary care institution between 2016 and 2020. A multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association of the percentage of improvement after FRR with patient baseline characteristics, pertinent clinical characteristics, and diagnostic criteria set by the Society for Vascular Surgery. The primary outcome was subjective patient improvement after FRR. A prediction risk calculator was developed using backward stepwise multivariate logistic regression coefficients, with bootstrapping for internal validation.

The results showed that a total of 208 patients (22.2% male; mean age, 35.8 ± 12.8 years; median follow-up, 44.9 months) underwent 243 FRRs. Among these patients, 94.7% had symptoms localized to the supraclavicular area, and 97.6% experienced symptoms in the hand. All patients had positive symptoms reproduced by the elevated arm stress and upper limb tension tests, with no other reasonably likely diagnosis present. Of the 196 patients who received a lidocaine injection, 180 (93.3%) reported improvement of NTOS symptoms.

### Initial outcomes using cryoablation in surgical management of slipping rib syndrome [^113SVwHP]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) and cartilaginous rib excision (CRE) for slipping rib syndrome (SRS) are painful procedures. Intercostal nerve cryoablation (Cryo) controls pain and decreases opioid use in MIRPE. Herein, we describe our experience with cryoablation in CRE.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients undergoing CRE between 2018 and 2022. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, operative details, and hospital course were collected.

- **Results**: A total of 98 patients underwent CRE: 68 with CRE without cryo, 22 with CRE + Cryo, and 8 with combined MIRPE + CRE + Cryo. Ninety percent of patients underwent bioabsorbable rib plating. Patients were predominantly female (79%, 73%, 50% respectively) with median ages of 17.6, 16.9, and 14.2 years respectively. CRE + Cryo patients used significantly less opioids in the hospital (0.6 OME/kg [0.1, 1.2]) compared to CRE without cryo (1.0 OME/kg [0.6, 2.1]), p < 0.05. The median length of stay (LOS) in CRE + Cryo was 1 day [1, 2] compared to 2 days in CRE without cryo [1, 2], p = 0.09. MIRPE + CRE + Cryo patients used 0.6 OME/kg [0.2, 8.0] with a 2 day [1, 5.5] LOS. Ninety-one percent of Cryo patients had cryoablation of T9 and/or T10 intercostal nerves, with no documented abdominal wall laxity at a median follow-up of 16 days. Cryo was applied extra-thoracically in CRE + Cryo without thoracoscopy or lung isolation, while MIRPE + CRE + Cryo used a combination of extra-/intra-thoracic cryoablation with thoracoscopy.

- **Conclusion**: Intercostal nerve cryoablation reduces opioid use and LOS in patients undergoing CRE.

### Outcomes following interval delayed first rib resection for acute axillosubclavian deep venous thrombosis [^115MsNUP]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

- **Type of research**: Single-center retrospective observational study.
- **Key findings**: Treatment for Paget-Schroetter syndrome with preoperative anticoagulation for ≥ 6 weeks, followed by interval first rib resection and postoperative anticoagulation, was used to treat 20 patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome. Post-treatment duplex examination confirmed complete deep venous thrombosis resolution in 60% of patients. All patients remained asymptomatic after 5 years.
- **Take home message**: Substituting anticoagulation alone for thrombolytic therapy before first rib resection for venous thoracic outlet syndrome results in good venous patency and excellent clinical outcomes.

Although most patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) present with shoulder or arm pain, approximately 5% present with upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT), often termed venous TOS, or effort-related upper extremity DVT. Effort-related axillosubclavian DVT was first described independently by England's Sir Paget (1875) and Germany's Von Schroetter (1884). Hughes first applied the eponym Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS) in 1949, when reviewing 320 patients with effort thrombosis. Patients presenting with PSS are often young, physically active, and involved athletically or vocationally in repetitive overhead arm motions. Patients with PSS often present with upper extremity swelling, cyanosis, pain, heaviness, and fatigue. The diagnosis of PSS is suggested by history and physical examination, and confirmed with noninvasive duplex scanning or conventional venography.

### Cell-based assay for ciliopathy patients to improve accurate diagnosis using ALPACA [^115kw2ca]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Skeletal ciliopathies are a group of rare congenital disorders caused by dysfunction of cilia. As the name implies, all skeletal ciliopathies are characterized by skeletal abnormalities and can additionally present with other organ abnormalities. The majority of skeletal ciliopathies are categorized as short-rib thoracic dysplasia syndromes (SRTD, MIM %208500). The SRTDs include short-rib polydactyly syndrome (SRPS, MIM #263520, #614091, #615503, #269860), Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MZSDS, MIM #266920), and (Jeune) asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD, MIM %208500, #611263, #613091, #613819, #614376). In addition, there are three non-SRTD skeletal ciliopathies: Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EVC, MIM #225500), endocrine-cerebroosteodysplasia (MIM #612651), and cranioectodermal dysplasia syndrome (CED, Sensenbrenner syndrome, MIM #218330, #613610, #614099, #614378). A complicating matter in the accurate diagnosis of patients with a suspected skeletal ciliopathy is the broad phenotypic spectrum, in combination with the overlap in symptoms amongst the skeletal ciliopathy subgroups.

### Vertical rib plating for the treatment of slipping rib syndrome [^112gi5DH]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Slipping rib syndrome (SRS) is a painful condition characterized by hypermobile, detached lower costal cartilages that impinge on the intercostal nerves. While surgical resection of the cartilaginous rib is reported as a definitive treatment, symptoms are common. We describe the addition of vertical bioabsorbable rib plating to decrease recurrence.

- **Methods**: An IRB-approved (#17–098), single institution, retrospective chart review was conducted for patients who presented with SRS from 2009 to 2019 at a single institution. Descriptive statistics were used to compare patients with and without bioabsorbable vertical plating.

- **Results**: A total of 85 patients (71.8% female, mean age 17.7 years) underwent evaluation for SRS. Of the 70 who underwent surgery solely for SRS, 29 (41%) underwent vertical rib plating at the initial surgery while 41 (58.6%) did not. Re-symptoms developed in 7 (17.1%) unplated patients, while only 1 (3.4%) plated patient experienced re-SRS, which occurred following a motor vehicle crash (p = 0.0116). Of the 8 with re-symptoms, 3 underwent vertical plating at a subsequent operation.

- **Conclusion**: The rate of re-symptoms after cartilage resection alone for SRS was 17.1%. The addition of vertical rib plating with bioabsorbable plates decreased re-symptoms and improved outcomes.

- **Level of evidence**: II.

### The chest wall injury society recommendations for reporting studies of surgical stabilization of rib fractures [^116eJUoQ]. Injury (2021). Low credibility.

Publications investigating the efficacy of surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) have increased exponentially. However, there is currently no standardized reporting structure for these studies, rendering both comparisons and extrapolation problematic.

- **Methods**: A subject matter expert group was formed by the Chest Wall Injury Society. This group conducted a review of the SSRF investigational literature and identified variable reporting within several general categories of relevant parameters. A complement of guidelines was then generated.

- **Results**: The reporting guidelines consist of 26 recommendations in the categories of: (1) study type, (2) patient and injury characteristics, (3) patient treatments, (4) outcomes, and (5) statistical considerations.

- **Conclusion**: Our review identified inconsistencies in reporting within the investigational SSRF literature. In response to these inconsistencies, we propose a set of recommendations to standardize reporting of original investigations into the efficacy of SSRF.

### An alternative plane block for multiple rib fractures: Rhomboid intercostal and sub-serratus block (RISS) [^113TFYDp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Rib fractures are a common injury resulting from severe blunt chest trauma. Sufficient and early pain control is essential to avoid respiratory complications. In recent years, the serratus plane and the erector spinae plane blocks have been used in the emergency department (ED) for pain related to rib fractures. The Rhomboid Intercostal and Sub-Serratus (RISS) block can be utilized for pain control in patients with multiple rib fractures. We report two cases of patients with multiple rib fractures in which pain reduction was achieved with the application of the RISS block.

### Chest wall hypoplasia — principles and treatment [^111BThUM]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The chest is a dynamic structure that relies on a coordinated movement of multiple bones, joints, and muscles for normal respiratory function. Muscle weakness can impact respiration by decreasing respiratory motion. However, conditions that cause chest wall hypoplasia, resulting in an immobile chest wall, can have a similar effect. Conditions such as Jarcho-Levin and Jeune syndrome present significantly different challenges compared to early onset scoliosis, where chest wall mechanics and thoracic volume may be closer to normal. Due to these differences, more aggressive approaches to clinical and surgical management are necessary.

### Rib head protrusion into the central canal in type 1 neurofibromatosis [^1168ZPYz]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Between 2003 and 2009, rib head dislocation into the spinal canal was found at our institutions in four children, ranging in age from 9 to 14 years old. Radiographs, CTs, MRIs, and operative reports were available in all four, along with clinical follow-up from several months to 6 years. The case studies provide insights into this rare occurrence.

- **Clinical findings**:
	- Case 1 involved a 14-year-old boy with severe progressive scoliosis who complained of neck and upper back pain. He was mildly tender to palpation at the apex of his curve. He had slight hyperreflexia of the left lower extremity (3+) and a few beats of ankle clonus bilaterally.

- **Imaging findings**:
	- The preoperative spine radiograph demonstrates penciling and displacement of the fourth and fifth ribs at the apex of the curve, although only the fourth was in an abnormal position on CT and MRI. Rib head resection can be seen on the postoperative spine radiograph.

In summary, these cases underscore the importance of thorough clinical and imaging evaluation in pediatric patients with atypical scoliosis to identify underlying conditions such as rib head dislocation into the spinal canal.

### Two years of debilitating pain in a football spearing victim: Slipping rib syndrome [^113M8H6M]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2003). Low credibility.

Blunt chest trauma can occur in a variety of sports, leading to rib fractures and less commonly known and diagnosed injuries. We report the case of a 14-year-old student athlete who was speared (helmet tackled) in a practice scrimmage, sustaining a painful injury that eluded diagnosis and treatment for more than two years.

- **Methods**: The case history of pain treatments and radiological evaluations is presented.

- **Results**: Ultimately, a definitive diagnosis of "slipping rib syndrome" was achieved through a simple clinical manipulation (the hooking maneuver), combined with a history of symptomatic relief provided with costochondral blockade. Surgical resection of the slipping rib provided total resolution of the problem.

- **Conclusion**: Very few clinicians are aware either of the syndrome or the maneuver used to diagnose this condition. Although spearing has been outlawed in American football for years, it remains a commonplace occurrence, and sports physicians should be aware of the potential consequences to the victim, as well as those to the perpetrator.

### Skytrofa [^114dssCN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Slipped capital femoral epiphysis**: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients undergoing rapid growth. Evaluate pediatric patients with the onset of a limp or complaints of persistent hip or knee pain.

- **Progression of preexisting scoliosis**: Somatropin increases growth rate, and progression of existing scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Monitor patients with a history of scoliosis for disease progression.

- **Pancreatitis**: Pancreatitis has been reported in pediatric patients receiving somatropin. The risk may be greater in pediatric patients than adults. Consider pancreatitis in patients who develop persistent severe abdominal pain.

- **Lipoatrophy**: When Skytrofa is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, lipoatrophy may result. Rotate injection sites when administering Skytrofa to reduce this risk [see Preparation and Administration (2.5)].

- **Sudden death in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome**: There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Skytrofa is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome.

### The impact of transitioning to prospective contouring and planning rounds as peer review [^111LSXyU]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Not all treatment planning can be categorized using the urgency of planning, and some require different workflow considerations. To address these situations, we implemented multiple special procedure care paths for treatments such as stereotactic radiation therapy and brachytherapy. We depict the special procedure care path for high-dose rate brachytherapy as an example in Figure 3A. CPR is held around noon each day, so if the contours are ready by that time, we present them to the group; otherwise, they are presented the next day.

- **Special procedures care path**: Special procedures, such as stereotactic radiosurgery or brachytherapy, are reviewed. Patients are reviewed before treatment when possible; however, most present retrospectively after the first treatment.

- **Time from CT simulation to initiation of treatment**: Between May 2015 and March 2017, contouring and planning rounds were implemented in October 2015.

- **Case presentations**: Since the initiation of CPR, a total of 4,759 patients have been presented through May 31, 2018. The majority were in the standard care path (66.3%), with 7.5%, 9.0%, and 3.8% in the urgent, nonemergent palliative, and emergent care paths, respectively. A total of 124 SRS (2.6%) and 514 brachytherapy (10.8%) cases were reviewed. The number of cases assigned to each treatment planning group, categorized by disease site, is described in Table 2. A total of 125 patients (2.6%) required major changes and were re-presented after the suggested modification.

### Abstracts of ESPR 2013, the European Society of Paediatric Radiology 50th Annual Meeting and 36th Postgraduate Course. June 3–7 2013. Budapest, Hungary [^115nGcnD]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

A variety of mimics enter the differential diagnosis of inflicted rib fractures, including developmental variants, birth injuries, iatrogenic and accidental injuries, metabolic disorders, and spurious imaging appearances. Most are readily distinguished on clinical, laboratory, and imaging grounds.

Skeletal surveys performed for suspected abuse should conform to the standards of the American College of Radiology and the British Society of Paediatric Radiology, including oblique as well as frontal and lateral views of the thorax. When further early documentation of rib fractures is required, radiography may be supplemented with scintigraphy and/or CT. Follow-up skeletal surveys should be performed whenever rib fractures are demonstrated on the initial survey or other imaging. They should also be conducted when initial imaging is normal, but abuse is strongly suspected on other grounds.

Although the evidence is clear that rib fractures in infants occur with rib compression, quantitative data are lacking. Preliminary studies with finite element modeling show promise in defining the precise types and magnitude of applied forces entailed in the production of these familiar and strong predictors of abusive injury.

### Redefining the costal margin: A pilot study [^1175YvMU]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Classical teaching of rib anatomy contends that the false ribs (7th to 10th) fuse anteriorly to form the costal margin of the chest. Slipped rib syndrome consists of false rib subluxation into the thorax with symptomatic impingement of the intercostal nerve. We sought to determine the incidence of this anatomic finding through an anatomic study of the costal margin.

- **Methods**: Cadavers were evaluated for mobility and attachment of the ninth and tenth ribs. Experienced anatomists and chest wall surgeons conducted a standardized dissection and assessed rib tip mobility using predefined criteria. Videos of dissections were submitted to a single investigator who reviewed the findings.

- **Results**: Costal margins of 40 cadavers (45% male) were evaluated bilaterally. The average age was 83 years ± 11 years. The ninth rib was found to be attached to the eighth rib 100% of the time by an interchondral cartilaginous attachment along the body of the eighth and ninth ribs. Internal subluxation was noted in 19% (15 of 80), and the tip of the rib was mobile in 86% (69 of 80) evaluations. The tenth rib was attached to the ninth rib in 18% (14 of 80). A "floating" 10th rib was noted in 59% (47 of 80) of specimens. Subluxation was noted in 33% (26 of 80). Half of the ribs that subluxed moved medially to the ninth rib, and half moved externally. An upwardly hooked tip was noted in 10% (8 of 80). Ribs with a hooked tip subluxed in 63% (5 of 8), and all of these ribs (5 of 5) moved to the interior of the chest (p = 0.020).

- **Conclusion**: The ninth rib is commonly attached to the eighth rib.
