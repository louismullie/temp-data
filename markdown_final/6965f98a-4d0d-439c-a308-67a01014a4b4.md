## Question

What is the appropriate dosage adjustment for vancomycin in patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dosage adjustment for vancomycin in patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining stage 4 CKD and its pharmacokinetic implications. Then, I should verify the pharmacodynamic targets and monitoring framework. Next, I will determine the loading dose, followed by the maintenance strategy and interval selection. After that, I need to check therapeutic drug monitoring timing and interpretation, including AUC-guided approaches. I will then consider special populations and dialysis scenarios, review nephrotoxicity risk mitigation, and finally synthesize a practical, individualized dosing plan with caveats and follow-up actions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pharmacokinetic implications of stage 4 CKD, which corresponds to eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m². Vancomycin is eliminated unchanged by the kidneys, so clearance falls as GFR declines, prolonging half-life and increasing accumulation risk, which mandates dose and interval adjustments to avoid toxicity while maintaining efficacy [^11549Bdx].

> I need to verify the pharmacodynamic target and monitoring framework. Contemporary guidance favors AUC-guided dosing with a target AUC/MIC of 400–600 mg·h/L assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L, recognizing that trough-only monitoring is an imperfect surrogate and that Bayesian or two-concentration PK methods improve accuracy and safety compared with trough-only strategies [^1162PCFm] [^111idGNH] [^112hbm4W].

> Now, the loading dose. I initially thought to use 15–20 mg/kg, but wait, let me verify the most defensible approach in severe renal impairment — consensus and FDA labeling support a loading dose of at least 15 mg/kg actual body weight to promptly achieve therapeutic concentrations, and many experts extend this to 20–25 mg/kg in serious infections or when rapid attainment is needed, with the caveat that higher loading doses should be balanced against nephrotoxicity risk and followed by early TDM [^116BWdxD] [^116joeur] [^114iDJvQ].

> For maintenance dosing, I should confirm the principle that in stage 4 CKD we generally reduce dose and extend interval. A practical starting point is 15 mg/kg every 48–72 hours, with the exact interval individualized to residual renal function and clinical status, and I should double-check that this aligns with FDA guidance describing marked renal impairment regimens of 250–1,000 mg every several days rather than daily dosing, which operationalizes the same principle of extended intervals in low GFR [^116joeur].

> Hold on, I should verify the monitoring cadence and timing. Given prolonged time to steady state in CKD, the first trough should be obtained after 72 hours of therapy or before the fourth dose if using extended intervals, and if using AUC-guided dosing, collect a post-distribution peak 1–2 hours after infusion and a trough at the end of the dosing interval to estimate AUC, with earlier sampling if clinical status changes or if accumulation is suspected [^111yjhjk] [^111idGNH] [^1115Eoc2].

> Next, I should review interpretation and adjustment. Troughs below 10 mg/L risk subtherapeutic exposure and resistance, whereas troughs above 20 mg/L increase nephrotoxicity risk, so I will adjust dose or interval to keep troughs generally 10–20 mg/L if using trough monitoring, and if using AUC, target 400–600 mg·h/L while avoiding AUC above roughly 600 mg·h/L which correlates with higher AKI risk, noting that cystatin C–based eGFR models can improve trough prediction and may refine dosing adjustments in CKD [^113VESyu] [^112hbm4W] [^113ykM62].

> But wait, what if the patient is on dialysis or has fluctuating renal function? I need to ensure dialysis-specific protocols are applied when relevant, including loading 20–25 mg/kg and dosing relative to dialysis sessions with predialysis targets of 15–20 mg/L, and I should remember not to sample within 2 hours post-dialysis due to rebound, while also adapting dosing if CRRT is used with typical maintenance of 7.5–10 mg/kg every 12 hours and early TDM to hit AUC targets [^115DwQm4] [^116nWH4S] [^115ncFqT] [^116vfKkA].

> I should double-check nephrotoxicity risk mitigation. Vancomycin-associated AKI is more likely with higher exposure, concomitant nephrotoxins, and critical illness, so I will avoid or minimize coadministration with agents like piperacillin-tazobactam when possible, monitor renal function and vancomycin concentrations frequently in unstable patients, and consider holding or reducing vancomycin if AKI develops without another clear cause, balancing infection control needs [^1133Eibk] [^116r1MRT] [^112NUWLF].

> Let me synthesize a practical, individualized plan for a typical 70 kg adult with stage 4 CKD and stable renal function: start with a 20 mg/kg loading dose (about 1.4 g), then give 15 mg/kg every 48–72 hours (about 1 g), obtain the first level after 72 hours or before the fourth dose, and adjust to maintain trough 10–20 mg/L or AUC 400–600 mg·h/L using two levels if pursuing AUC, with earlier reassessment if renal function fluctuates or clinical status changes [^113az2Y3] [^116joeur] [^111idGNH] [^111yjhjk].

> Hold on, I should verify key caveats. If residual function is near 30 mL/min, a 48-hour interval may suffice, whereas near 15 mL/min may warrant 72 hours or even less frequent dosing, and if infection severity demands faster attainment, a higher loading dose up to 25 mg/kg can be justified with vigilant early TDM. In obesity, use actual body weight for loading but consider adjusted weight for maintenance to avoid overexposure, and if cystatin C is available, incorporate CKD-EPI creatinine–cystatin C eGFR to improve PK prediction and dosing accuracy [^114iDJvQ] [^113ykM62] [^114ipEpJ].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing reassessment. Repeat vancomycin levels with any change in renal function, after 3–5 days of therapy, and periodically thereafter in stable patients, and coordinate with nephrology for trajectory of kidney function, volume status, and potential dialysis needs, since dynamic changes in GFR and dialysis timing materially alter vancomycin clearance and exposure [^1115Eoc2] [^111jMeFn].

For stage 4 CKD (eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m²), vancomycin requires **dose reduction and extended intervals** to avoid accumulation and nephrotoxicity. Use a **loading dose of 15–20 mg/kg** [^116BWdxD] (max 2 g) [^114iDJvQ], then adjust maintenance to 15 mg/kg every 48–72 hours based on trough levels [^notfound]. Troughs should be checked before the third dose or at 72 hours [^111yjhjk], targeting 10–20 mg/L; adjust to 15–20 mg/L for severe infections [^113VESyu]. If AUC-guided monitoring is available, target AUC/MIC 400–600 [^1162PCFm] [^115VvJhz]. Extend intervals further if eGFR < 15 mL/min or if accumulation is suspected, and monitor renal function closely [^111jMeFn].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations in stage 4 CKD

Vancomycin is eliminated unchanged by the kidneys; therefore, in stage 4 CKD, **reduced clearance increases exposure and nephrotoxicity risk** [^11549Bdx]. Its half-life is prolonged, so accumulation occurs with standard dosing; thus, dose and interval adjustments are essential [^115VGMAZ].

---

## Recommended dosing strategy

### Loading dose

A **standard loading dose** of 15–20 mg/kg (max 2 g) [^114iDJvQ] is recommended to rapidly achieve therapeutic levels [^117SkzPr].

---

### Maintenance dose and dosing interval

- **Initial maintenance dose**: 15 mg/kg [^116BWdxD] every 48–72 hours, adjusted to renal function and trough levels [^116joeur].
- **Dosing interval**: Extend to 72 hours if eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or if accumulation is suspected.
- **Maximum dose**: Do not exceed 2 g per dose [^114iDJvQ].

---

## Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)

TDM is critical in stage 4 CKD to balance efficacy and nephrotoxicity; **obtain trough levels before the third dose or at 72 hours** [^111yjhjk], and target troughs of 10–20 mg/L (15–20 mg/L for severe infections) [^113VESyu]. If available, use AUC-guided monitoring with a target AUC/MIC of 400–600 [^1162PCFm] [^112hbm4W].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks associated with vancomycin use in stage 4 CKD

Vancomycin use in stage 4 CKD carries an **increased risk of nephrotoxicity** [^notfound], particularly with elevated troughs or prolonged therapy [^116Edsz1]. Close monitoring and timely dose adjustments reduce this risk [^112hbm4W].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Parameter** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Loading dose | 15–20 mg/kg (max 2 g) |
| Maintenance dose | 15 mg/kg every 48–72 hours |
| Dosing interval | Extend to 72 hours if eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² |
| Trough monitoring | - Before third dose or at 72 hours <br/> - Target 10–20 mg/L (15–20 mg/L for severe infections) |
| AUC-guided monitoring | Target AUC/MIC 400–600 if available |
| Maximum dose | 2 g per dose |

Vancomycin dosing in stage 4 CKD requires **careful adjustment** to avoid accumulation and nephrotoxicity: use a 15–20 mg/kg loading dose, then 15 mg/kg every 48–72 hours with TDM to guide adjustments [^1162PCFm].

On univariate and multivariate analysis, COR and AOR revealed that age, sex, weight, SCr, CrCl, BUN, reason of admission, comorbidity, stage of renal impairment, number of medication prescribed per patient and number of medications that required dose adjustment per patient did not show significant difference on the proportion ofappropriately adjusted prescriptions per patient (Table 2).

However, dose adjustment of prescription entries was associated with type of medications prescribed, stage of renal impairment, SCr level and BUN (Table 3). There was a negative association between the type of medication prescribed and the likelihood of appropriately adjusting medications. When cimetidine (AOR = 0.013 (0.001, 0.150)), vancomycin (AOR = 0.045 (0.004, 0.525)), ceftazidime (AOR = 0.067 (0.005, 0.894)) and digoxin (AOR = 0.009 (0.000, 0.297)) were prescribed, dose was appropriately adjusted less frequently than any other medications. Prescription entries were appropriately adjusted more frequently in stage 4 than any other stages of renal impairment (AOR = 587.70 (4.040, 8.549)). Specifically each 1-unit increase in SCr level was associated to an increase in the likelihood of appropriately adjusting dose of medications by a factor of 129.95.

### An evaluation of the incidence of nephrotoxicity after a loading dose of vancomycin in patients with severe renal impairment [^117SkzPr]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Loading doses of vancomycin assist in the rapid achievement of target trough concentrations. Patients with renal dysfunction have been excluded from studies evaluating loading doses.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate nephrotoxicity related to initial vancomycin dose in patients with severe renal dysfunction.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of a large, academic health system. Adults were included if they received intravenous vancomycin in the emergency department and presented with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min. Chronic dialysis patients were excluded. The primary outcome was incidence of nephrotoxicity after an initial high (> 20 mg/kg) vs. low (≤ 20 mg/kg) dose of vancomycin. Secondary outcomes included dialysis, vancomycin concentrations, length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and a composite outcome of nephrotoxicity or dialysis.

Results

Of the 927 patients included in the analysis, nephrotoxicity occurred in 7.2% and 13.8% of patients in the high- and low-dose groups, respectively (p < 0.01). Patients in the high-dose group had a reduced risk of nephrotoxicity (relative risk 0.53; 95% confidence interval 0.35–0.78). The reduction in risk remained after fitting a generalized linear model adjusting for weight, age, sex, initial serum creatinine, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (relative risk 0.61; 95% confidence interval 0.39–0.93). Limitations of this study include its retrospective design and single-center population.

Conclusion

These data suggest that vancomycin loading doses do not increase nephrotoxicity compared with lower doses in patients with severe renal dysfunction. These patients should be included in future studies relating to vancomycin loading doses.

Hybrid hemodialysis dosing and monitoring — In patients receiving hybrid hemodialysis, loading doses of 20 to 25 mg/kg by actual body weight should be used, initial doses should not be delayed to wait for a dialysis treatment to end, and maintenance doses of 15 mg/kg should be given after hybrid hemodialysis ends or during the final 60 to 90 minutes of dialysis, as is done with standard hemodialysis (B-III); concentration monitoring should guide further maintenance doses.

### Cystatin C-guided vancomycin dosing in critically ill patients: a Quality improvement project [^113WsdxT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of the study was to determine whether a vancomycin dosing algorithm based on estimated glomerular filtration rate from creatinine and cystatin C levels (eGFR cr-cys) improves target trough concentration achievement compared to an algorithm based on estimated creatinine clearance (eCL cr) in critically ill patients.

Study Design

This prospective quality improvement project evaluated intensive care unit (ICU) patients started on intravenous vancomycin using one of 2 different strategies. Dosing regimens were selected and implemented after an individualized goal trough range was established (10–15 or 15–20mg/L). Steady-state goal trough achievement was compared between treatment arms with and without adjustment for potential confounders.

Setting & Participants

3 medical and surgical ICUs at a single tertiary medical center.

Quality Improvement Plan

During January 2012 to October 2013, vancomycin was dosed according to eCL cr using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (control arm). During December 2013 to May 2015, a multidisciplinary quality improvement team implemented a novel vancomycin dosing algorithm according to eGFR cr-cys using the CKD-EPI equation (intervention arm).

Outcome

Steady-state initial goal vancomycin trough concentration achievement.

Measurements & Results

More patients in the intervention arm (67 of 135 [50%]) achieved therapeutic trough vancomycin levels than in the control arm (74 of 264 [28%]; OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.65–3.90; P < 0.001). Improved trough achievement was maintained even after adjustment for age, sex, APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) III score, fluid balance, baseline CL cr, surgical admission diagnosis, presence of sepsis, and goal trough concentration range (adjusted OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.76–4.44; P < 0.001). Clinical outcomes were similar between groups.

Limitations

Nonrandomized, incomplete algorithm compliance.

Conclusions

A vancomycin dosing nomogram based on eGFR cr-cys significantly improved goal trough achievement compared to eCL cr among ICU patients with stable kidney function. Further studies are warranted to characterize the relationship between use of cystatin C-guided dosing and clinical outcomes.

### Drug dosing in older patients with chronic kidney disease… [^115Y2kgp]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Although the Cockcroft-Gault equation and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation are valuable and relatively accurate for approximating a patient's creatinine clearance, I find their utility limited in daily practice. The Cockcroft-Gault equation requires knowledge of ideal body weight, and the developers of the MDRD equation caution against using it in older patients and in those with stable kidney function. 2 I use the long-overlooked and less well-known Jelliffe equation, which is well validated. 3 Although it is no more or less accurate than the Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD equations, its advantage is that it can be calculated in one's head. There are several versions of this equation; the simplest is: Once a patient's creatinine clearance is calculated, it is important to recognize certain medications that should be reduced or avoided. Drs. Munar and Singh laudably review antibiotic adjustments;.

1 I routinely refer to the "Dosage in Renal Failure" table of my pocket Sanford Guide. 4 Two antibiotics in particular deserve emphasis. The double-strength tablet of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which is commonly prescribed, should be avoided unless the patient's creatinine clearance is known to exceed 50 mL per minute; the single-strength tablet of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is preferable. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated if a patient's creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL per min, a condition that occurs often in patients older than 65 years. Thiazides, often prescribed to patients who are older, are ineffective in patients with a creatinine clearance less than 30 mL per min.

Finally, it is important to recognize that alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate, bisphosphonates used to prevent hip fractures in patients with osteoporosis, are contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearances less than 35 mL per minute, 30 mL per minute, and 30 mL per minute, respectively. I echo Drs. Munar's and Singh's recommendations to adjust for renal clearance when prescribing medications. I prefer the Jelliffe formula for its bedside ease; but whichever method we use, as long as we calculate clearance we will prescribe more safely.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin in serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — AUC-based targets and MIC considerations state that daily AUC values (assuming a MICBMD of 1 mg/L) should be maintained between 400 and 600 mg·h/L to maximize efficacy and minimize the likelihood of acute kidney injury (AKI). MIC utility is limited because the BMD MIC90 in most institutions is 1 mg/L or less, measurement is imprecise with dilution of ± 1 log and a variation of 10% to 20% considered acceptable, and results are typically not available within the first 72 hours even though the vancomycin AUC/MIC ratio needs to be optimized early in infection; additionally, trough-only monitoring may be insufficient to guide dosing in all patients.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116Bs7A1]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Medication management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Patients with CKD have altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics due to reduced renal elimination of drugs, including reduced filtration, secretion, and kidney metabolism. Bioavailability and non-kidney drug clearance may also be altered, especially in more advanced stages of CKD. Drugs that can be used in CKD should be dose-adjusted based on the degree of residual kidney function; the extent of dose reduction typically depends on the level of kidney function, and some medications may be contraindicated in those with severe kidney dysfunction. Most often, as the data to evaluate the need for dose adjustment in patients with CKD is part of the FDA approval process, recommendations frequently rely primarily on the manufacturer's product labeling.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^116r1MRT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Vancomycin used at currently recommended doses is minimally nephrotoxic when used in noncritically ill patients with less serious infections. In sicker patients with multiple risk factors for AKI, VANT occurs much more commonly, but it remains uncertain to what degree vancomycin is directly responsible. In our opinion, it is safe to initiate therapy with vancomycin in critically ill patients with multiple risk factors for AKI, pending culture results with use of TDM and antibiotic stewardship (Table 5). Trough levels should be obtained within 48–72 h, by which time initial culture results should be available. Decisions regarding continuation of vancomycin therapy can be individualized, based on culture result, MIC (if staphylococci are isolated), AKI risk, and side‐effect profile of alternative agents. Loading doses are safe. Trough levels with intermittent dosing should always be > 10 mg/L to prevent resistance. It remains uncertain whether Guideline‐based trough levels of 15–20 mg/L are more efficacious than 10–15 mg/L in serious infections. Trough levels of 15–20 mg/L, however, are clearly associated with greater VANT than levels < 15 mg/L, but it remains uncertain whether these levels are the cause or the result of the nephrotoxicity. Combination with PTZ should be avoided or duration minimized. In patients receiving vancomycin who develop AKI that is not easily correctible with fluid resuscitation or discontinuation of other agents, cessation of vancomycin should be considered. This very important issue clearly warrants a large, multicenter RCT to answer definitively. Further issues need research as well, preferably with RCTs (Table 6).

Pediatric patients — For children with normal renal function and suspected serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, based on an AUC target of 400 mg · h/L (assuming MIC of 1 mg/L) from adult data, initial recommended vancomycin dosing is 60 to 80 mg/kg/day divided every 6 to 8 hours.

### Serum cystatin C predicts vancomycin trough levels better than serum creatinine in hospitalized patients: a cohort study [^113TVzB9]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Graphical representation of the expected improvement in vancomycin trough target levels with application of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaborative models. Predicted trough for each model (x-axis) versus actual trough or versus the expected trough when targeting 15 mg/L with the model (y-axis) for model 5 (a, b), model 6 (c, d), and model 7 (e, f). The improvement in the proportion that would have an expected trough of 10 to 20 mg/L for each model is also shown. The more refined analysis targeting a trough of 10 to 15 or 15 to 20 mg/L (depending on the clinical indication for treatment) is presented in the text and tables.

The vancomycin trough achieved target in only 35 patients (20%) during routine clinical care with maintenance doses of 15 to 20 mg/kg and intervals informed by the Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance. Trough achievement in clinical practice was 22% when institutional dosing interval recommendations were followed compared with 20% when not followed (P = 0.8). Application of the model with the greatest power (model 7: eGFR with CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C; R 2 = 0.580) is expected to yield about a 2.5-fold greater trough achievement than that which resulted from routine clinical practice (54% versus 20%; P < 0.0001 versus observed trough). Among patients with CKD (defined as CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C of less than 60 mL/min), the improvement between observed and expected trough achievement was modest (34% versus 43%, P = 0.4). In contrast, among patients without CKD (defined as CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C of more than 60 mL/min), the improvement between observed and expected trough achievement was much greater (17% versus 57%, P < 0.001). Notably, low trough levels were associated with a high GFR (Figure 4; P < 0.0001). Cross-validation of model 7 to address potential overfitting of the data projected a slightly lower target trough achievement of 51% across the 10 replications instead of 54%.

### Evaluation of a protocol for vancomycin administration in critically patients with and without kidney dysfunction [^1155b1ra]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our protocol seems to allow a rapid achievement of a target VSC particularly in patients with kidney dysfunction. In order to avoid subtherapeutic VSC, our algorithm should be implemented by the estimation of ARC, the presence of which implies an adjustment of the dose of vancomicyn, both in terms of loading and continuous infusion dose.

### Evaluation of a protocol for vancomycin administration in critically patients with and without kidney dysfunction [^115WgXL3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main results of the present study are: 1) our protocol seems to consent to a fast achievement of a target VSC in patients with normal kidney function and in those with kidney dysfunction; 2) the presence of an augmented renal clearance was the main determinant of the difficulties in reaching a target VSC.

Early antibiotic administration should aim to reach adequate target VSC within a few hours from infusion. However, critically ill patients usually have a large volume of distribution which likely reflects significant capillary leakage. The latter, coupled with aggressive fluid loading, can expand the interstitial space. Hence hydrophilic antimicrobials — distributed exclusively in the extracellular compartment — are expected to be diluted. This shift of fluid may favour movement of drug into the interstitium and a decreased VSC is expected. Moreover, while critical illness might alter the volume of distribution, renal dysfunction additionally makes antibiotic pharmacokinetics even more unpredictable. As a consequence, patients with decreased renal function require vancomycin to be administered following dose adjustments. Hence our protocol was designed in order to avoid both a VSC under and over the target range, although we choose to favour the avoidance of a VSC under the range since its association with an increased in-hospital mortality. At the same time we felt that patients with kidney dysfunction should have had a specific protocol because of reduced renal clearance. Finally, target VSC may be difficult to achieve because of the presence of augmented renal clearance. ARC is characterised by an enhanced renal elimination of circulating solutes observed in critically ill patients. The presence of ARC might imply subtherapeutic levels of a given drug for substantial periods of the dosing interval resulting in treatment failure or selection of resistant organisms.

### Glomerular filtration rate equations do not accurately predict vancomycin trough concentrations in pediatric patients [^111ywz21]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The Bedside Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) equation was developed using data from children with chronic kidney disease. Some institutions are using this equation in all pediatric patients, regardless of renal function, to adjust medications. No data have shown that the Bedside CKiD equation is equivalent or better than the Schwartz equation in estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in pediatric patients with normal renal function.

Objective

To compare GFR estimates using the Bedside CKiD and Schwartz equations and determine if either offers sufficient vancomycin dosing guidance in hospitalized pediatric patients.

Methods

This retrospective review at a single-center, academic, pediatric hospital included patients 2 to 12 years old with a steady-state vancomycin trough collected between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2011. Patients with acute kidney injury or lacking essential data (e.g., height and serum creatinine), were excluded. An estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated using the Schwartz and Bedside CKiD equations. Pearson correlations and linear regressions compared the eGFR values and vancomycin troughs.

Results

A total of 50 vancomycin troughs were analyzed. There was a weak relationship between the eGFR and troughs for the Schwartz equation (r (2) = 0.028) and Bedside CKiD equation (r (2) = 0.028). A weak relationship between serum creatinine and troughs was observed (r (2) = 0.132). Limitations include small sample size and retrospective design.

Conclusions

Neither equation correlates well with vancomycin troughs, suggesting that therapeutic monitoring remains important. Better GFR estimation methods are needed in pediatrics to aid appropriate dosing of renally eliminated medications.

Toxicodynamics — acute kidney injury (AKI) definitions, thresholds, and incidence with vancomycin are summarized as follows: Most studies defined AKI as an increase in the serum creatinine (SCr) level of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL, or a 50% increase from baseline in consecutive daily readings, or a decrease in calculated creatinine CL (CLcr) of 50% from baseline on 2 consecutive days in the absence of an alternative explanation. A more sensitive threshold — an increase in SCr of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL over a 48-hour period — may be considered as an indicator of vancomycin-associated AKI and was adopted from AKIN and KDIGO criteria. Reported prevalence has varied from 5% to 43%, and a meta-analysis of 13 studies found a relative risk of 2.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.69–3.55) with an attributable risk of 5%. Most episodes developed between 4 and 17 days after initiation of therapy.

Methods

Study population

This single-center retrospective observational study was performed at our hospital from July 2022 to July 2024. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) hospitalized patients with a discharge diagnosis of CKD; (2) aged ≥ 18 years; and (3) whose trough levels of vancomycin were monitored during intravenous vancomycin therapy. Patients were excluded if the vancomycin trough level was not obtained at steady state. Patients eligible for inclusion in the study were allocated to three groups on the basis of their estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) on the day of trough level monitoring: G1 (60 < eCrCl ≤ 90 mL/min), G2 (30 < eCrCl ≤ 60 mL/min), and G3 (eCrCl ≤ 30 mL/min).

Data collection

The following data were extracted from electronic medical records: patient demographics, comorbidities, infectious diagnosis, vancomycin dose, time interval from the initial dose to the trough level, concomitant nephrotoxic agents while receiving vancomycin, and renal replacement therapy (RRT). Body temperatures during the period between administration of the initial dose and collection of the trough level sample were also recorded. Aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, colistin, piperacillin‒tazobactam, loop diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and vasopressors are regarded as nephrotoxic agents. Other clinical data, including serum creatinine (Scr), albumin (ALB), urea, and total carbon dioxide (tCO 2) concentrations at baseline and during vancomycin therapy, were extracted from the laboratory database. eCrCl was calculated via the Cockcroft‒Gault equation.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin therapeutic monitoring in adults — 2009 guideline core recommendations emphasized pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets and trough surrogates: the primary recommendations "consisted of eliminating routine monitoring of serum peak concentrations, emphasizing a range of area under the curve over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) of ≥ 400 as the primary PK/PD predictor of vancomycin activity", and also "promoting serum trough concentrations of 15 to 20 mg/L as a surrogate marker for the optimal vancomycin AUC/MIC if the MIC was ≤ 1 mg/L in patients with normal renal function"; additionally, the guideline "recommended, albeit with limited data support, that actual body weight be used to determine the vancomycin dosage and loading doses for severe infections in patients who were seriously ill".

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^114bSwPQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Appropriate dosing is especially problematic in patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT), whether by standard thrice‐weekly intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), 34 short daily IHD, 35 or continuous RRT (CRRT) in the ICU. 36 On the one hand, underdosing may foster resistance. In this regard, vancomycin‐resistant enterococci, vancomycin‐intermediate S. aureus (VISA), and vancomycin‐resistant S. aureus (VRSA) were all first isolated from hemodialysis patients. On the other hand, many patients receiving hemodialysis have significant residual renal function that contributes to their well‐being and should not be glibly sacrificed by overdosing.

Other factors besides residual renal function contribute to the variability of vancomycin pharmacokinetics during RRT. There may be a prolonged distribution phase, a rebound effect following termination of dialysis, and nonrenal clearance. 37 Using standard low‐flux dialysis membranes, there is minimal dialytic clearance, and once‐weekly dosing suffices. 34 Many patients, however, are now dialyzed on synthetic, high‐flux dialyzers using membranes that have a much larger pore size and do have significant vancomycin clearance. 38 These patients require supplemental doses following each dialysis. Vancomycin is often administered during the final hour of a dialysis session, which will result in additional clearance compared to pure postdialytic administration. Larger doses are required with this method of administration. In contrast, many patients are dialyzed on reused dialyzers, often up to 15 or more treatments. Such reprocessing results in reduced vancomycin clearance that could result in overdosing. 34 Finally, measurement of vancomycin levels with severe renal failure is problematic, depending on the method used. Inactive crystalline degradation products may accumulate and can be measured with the polyclonal fluorescence polarization immunoassay. 34

Various modalities of CRRT are available in the ICU setting, including continuous veno‐venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), hemofiltration (CVVHF), and hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). All use synthetic membranes, with significant vancomycin clearance determined primarily by the volume of effluent. 36 Clearances of 15–30 ml/min are possible with effluent volumes approaching 3,000 ml/h. A comprehensive discussion of the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin metabolism in various types of intermittent and continuous RRT is beyond the scope of this article. Suggestions for dosing with both IHD and continuous procedures are provided in Table 1.

### Serum cystatin C predicts vancomycin trough levels better than serum creatinine in hospitalized patients: a cohort study [^114NHz6M]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We found that a model based on eGFR from CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C optimally predicts vancomycin trough levels. Target trough achievement (10 to 15 mg/L or 15 to 20 mg/L) is expected to be about 2.5-fold better with this model than current clinical practice. These findings are promising and encourage further investigation to prospectively validate the proposed or similar cystatin C-based vancomycin dosing models.

AUC-guided vancomycin dosing — compared with trough monitoring, individualized AUC-guided dosing was independently associated with a significant decrease in AKI (odds ratio [OR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34–0.80; P = 0.003) and produced lower median Bayesian-estimated AUCs (474 [SD, 360–611] mg·h/L vs 705 [SD, 540–883] mg·h/L; P < 0.001); in a prospective cohort transitioning from troughs of 10 to 20 mg/L to AUC values of > 400 mg·h/L, nephrotoxicity occurred in 8% in year 1 and in 0% and 2% in years 2 and 3 (P = 0.01), and AKI was associated with a median trough of 15.7 mg/L and AUC of 625 mg·h/L versus 8.7 mg/L and 423 mg·h/L without AKI (P = 0.02).

Vancomycin monitoring in intermittent hemodialysis — area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) guidance states that efficacy data are unavailable for AUC values of < 400 mg·h/L; monitoring based on predialysis serum concentrations and extrapolating these values to estimated AUC is most practical, maintaining predialysis concentrations between 15 and 20 mg/L to achieve the AUC of 400 to 600 mg·h/L in the previous 24 hours (C-III), and predialysis serum concentration monitoring should be performed not less than weekly and should drive subsequent dosing, with the recommended doses providing a useful starting point until serum concentrations have been determined (B-II).

### Recent changes in vancomycin use in renal failure [^116Edsz1]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a key tool in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. A progressive increase in vancomycin resistance with consequent treatment failure has been observed in staphylococci. Therefore, new dosing guidelines advocating much higher vancomycin doses have been issued. Target trough levels of 15–20 microg/ml are proposed. Whether and how these targets can be achieved in patients with chronic kidney disease or those on dialysis are still under evaluation. The higher vancomycin doses to achieve these treatment targets carry a substantial risk for nephrotoxicity. This risk is incremental with higher trough levels and longer duration of vancomycin use. Critically ill patients, patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic agents, and patients with already compromised renal function are particularly at risk for vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity.

### Attainment of therapeutic vancomycin level within the first 24 h: authors' response [^114bQk23]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

A nomogram for dosing vancomycin can be easily used at the bedside of the patient, providing rapidly personalized dosing. One of the key factors facilitating the nomogram is the fact that renal clearance of vancomycin is strongly correlated with the measured urinary creatinine clearance (CL CR). Unfortunately, it is more common in clinical practice to use the less accurate mathematical estimates of renal function in unstable patients, instead of measured CL CR. Such an approach serves to compromise the reliability of the nomogram in the critical care setting.

We appreciate and read with interest the comments of Honoré et al. regarding our study in 2014, where we developed and validated a dosing nomogram for vancomycin in CI in a population of critically ill patients. Some clarifications, however, are needed. First, we never intended to compare CI with a LD of vancomycin; instead, we used, sequentially, LD (between 1 and 1.5 g) followed by CI (30 mg/kg/day). Later, with nomogram-guided dosing using an 8 h-CL CR, we achieved target vancomycin exposures in 84% of patients in the validation group in the first 24 h. Of these, 40% had demonstrated augmented renal clearance (8 h-CL CR > 130 mL/min/1.73m 2). Secondly, patients with compromised renal function or needing of renal replacement therapy were excluded in our study, meaning that our nomogram should not be considered applicable to this group of patients. Third, the volume of distribution and the half-life of vancomycin increases significantly in critically ill patients with renal insufficiency. On the other hand, vancomycin (medium molecular size molecule) is effectively cleared by continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT). Considering the large inter-study variability, there is no clear recommendation about the optimal vancomycin regimen during CRRT. A vancomycin loading dose of 15–20 mg/kg actual body weight would likely be more appropriate in CRRT patients. Finally, future studies confirming our dosing protocol are welcome; however, the chosen target population should be similar (with exclusion of patients under CRRT) so that the obtained results can be extrapolated to different contexts.

Vancomycin monitoring — key evidence gaps in the 2009 recommendations included insufficient data for multiple populations and strategies, as the guideline noted that adequate data were not available for "pediatric patients outside of the neonatal age group", for "the morbidly obese patient population and patients with renal failure, including specific dialysis dosage adjustments", for "prolonged or continuous infusion IV vancomycin therapy", and for safety with dosages that "exceed 3 g per day", and that "there were minimal to no data on the safety and efficacy of targeted trough concentrations of 15 to 20 mg/L".

When type of medication and dose adjustment were evaluated, cimetidine was the most frequently prescribed drug that required dose adjustment, which was appropriately adjusted in 15/18 (83.3%) of cases; followed by spironolactone, vancomycin and ceftazidime which were appropriately adjusted in 2/16 (12.5%), 10/14 (71.4%) and 7/11 (63.6%) of cases respectively. Enalapril was the only drug correctly dose adjusted in all cases (6/6). Allopurinol and co-trimoxazole remained unadjusted in all cases. Medications that were less frequently prescribed (≤ 2) were categorized under "others" (Fig. 4).

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^113VESyu]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

The MICs for vancomycin have been slowly increasing ("MIC creep"). 16 Numerous studies have addressed the effectiveness of vancomycin with higher MICs within the CLSI "susceptible range" with variable conclusions. 17, 18, 19 Equipoise remains when the MIC is at the CLSI "susceptible" level of 1.5–2.0 mg/L by Etest or 2.0 mg/L by BMD. The 2009 Guidelines recommend considering alternative therapy, 8 but the IDSA 2011 guidelines state vancomycin should be continued irrespective of the MIC unless lack of response occurs. 1

Determining an AUC, and hence the AUC/MIC, is impractical under normal clinical circumstances due to the large number of blood draws required after a single dose. Thus, the Guidelines recommend measurement of trough serum levels at steady‐state conditions as a surrogate. A trough level < 10 mg/L (10 μg/ml) is unlikely to represent a ratio ≥ 400 and may result in development of resistance, including both vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heteroresistant VISA (hVISA, wherein a small subpopulation (e.g. 1 per 10 5) of VISA exists within an otherwise susceptible isolate). 20 Hence, the Guidelines recommend always keeping trough levels above 10 mg/L. A trough level of 15–20 mg/L is recommended to ensure an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 in more serious infections, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis, and osteomyelitis. This corresponds to guidelines by the American Thoracic Society for healthcare‐associated, hospital‐acquired, and ventilator‐associated pneumonias. 21 Importantly, three more recent studies, however, showed that over 50% of patients achieving AUC/MIC ≥ 400 had trough levels < 15 mg/L. 22, 23, 24 Hence, trough levels at best imperfectly predict AUC/MIC ratios. The use of peak levels has not been shown to increase the predictive ability to identify efficacy or toxicity, 25 and is not advocated by the Guidelines. When administered as a continuous infusion, a steady‐state level of 25–30 mg/L obtained 18 or more h after dosage adjustment is recommended.

### Assessment of vancomycin use in chronic haemodialysis patients: room for improvement [^112aeK27]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Vancomycin is frequently prescribed for the management of infections in haemodialysis patients. We evaluated the appropriateness of vancomycin use in our chronic haemodialysis population.

Methods

Charts of all chronic haemodialysis patients who received vancomycin between 1 March 2003 and 1 March 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. Indication was assessed according to the modified Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee guidelines for vancomycin prescription. The prescribed dosing regimens were evaluated.

Results

A total of 163 courses of vancomycin in 105 patients were assessed. Of all courses, 88% were considered to be initially appropriate, but this decreased to 63% once culture and sensitivity results were available. Use of vancomycin for the management of beta-lactam-sensitive organisms accounted for the majority of inappropriate use. The most common vancomycin-dosing regimen prescribed was 500 mg intravenously at each haemodialysis session (51%); however, considerable variability was observed.

Conclusions

Although the initial indication for vancomycin use was generally appropriate, inappropriate continuation of this antibiotic, failure to obtain proper cultures to guide therapy and potentially subtherapeutic dosing regimens were some of the challenges identified. Centres providing chronic haemodialysis should take steps to optimize vancomycin prescription to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance.

### Exploring population pharmacokinetic models in patients treated with vancomycin during continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) [^116uTX8V]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines suggest that AUC/MIC ratios should be used rather than trough measurements for therapeutic dose monitoring of vancomycin. The evidence base for use of target AUC/MIC ratios on CRRT is not as strong but is still recommended at present. Given that a Bayesian dose adjustment is advocated for AUC-based TDM, using a PK model to inform the initial dose, we suggest that developing population PK models for initial vancomycin dosing in the CRRT population is a step towards facilitating AUC-based TDM in clinical practice.

The strengths of our study include use of detailed clinical, biochemical and machine data taken from the electronic health record. This allowed us to explore pharmacokinetic models which incorporated individual patient and CRRT therapy characteristics. Our use of PTA plots provided a method for informing clinical dosing in this patient cohort. There was little CRRT downtime during our vancomycin dosing intervals which allowed for a consistent assessment of the impact of CRRT on vancomycin clearance.

Study limitations include that this was a single-centre study with retrospective data collection, and prospective model validation is advised. The availability of peak and trough levels alone restricted our analysis to a one-compartment model. Unequal numbers of samples across patients with small patient numbers in a single-centre limited the data available for analysis. No comparative data were available for non-renal CL of vancomycin, nor the unbound/free vancomycin concentrations, which can affect PK parameters.

### Serum cystatin C predicts vancomycin trough levels better than serum creatinine in hospitalized patients: a cohort study [^111CWrj4]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Although there is much emphasis on drug dose adjustment for patients with CKD (GFR < 60 mL/min), we found that the greatest improvement in target trough attainment was among patients without CKD (GFR > 60 mL/min). Indeed, the cystatin C-based models particularly improved predicted troughs among those with a GFR of more than 120 mL/min, a group in whom underdosing frequently occurs under usual clinical care. These findings are similar to those of another recent report which demonstrated that cystatin C performed better than creatinine clearance for vancomycin dosing when the serum creatinine was not more than 1.2 mg/dL.

Our study expands upon previous work because it accounts for other clinically relevant non-GFR factors in the predictive model, including the use of a vancomycin loading dose and the total dose given prior to the trough level. As expected, loading doses were not associated with predicted vancomycin trough since troughs were measured under steady-state conditions. Although vancomycin loading has the theoretical pharmacokinetic benefit of expediting the time to a higher serum drug concentration and potential clinical effect (not measured in this study), our study detected no impact of loading on steady-state blood levels among the 37% of patients in whom one was used. Drug dosing recommendations by the US Food and Drug Administration and those used in clinical practice are based largely on GFR estimates expressed in milliliters per minute not corrected for BSA. Therefore, also unlike most previous investigators, we converted eGFR to milliliters per minute using the Du Bois formula for BSA in order to remove the 1.73 m 2 normalization factor. The current models could be used to develop dosing algorithms that include eGFR, desired interval, and trough goal. If serum cystatin C levels are not available at therapy initiation, we suggest that initial recommendations could use the eGFR creatinine model (model 5) with subsequent dose modification based on the eGFR creatinine-cystatin C model (model 7) once available.

### Decreasing the time to achieve therapeutic vancomycin concentrations in critically ill patients: developing and testing of a dosing nomogram [^111EcVBw]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

Augmented renal clearance appears to be quite common in sub-populations of critically ill patients and can lead to very low serum concentrations of vancomycin on the first day of treatment
Clinicians are used to adjusting the dosing of antibiotics according to renal failure; however the adjustment to elevated function of the kidneys appears important to ensure target concentrations are achieved
This study prospectively validated a new vancomycin dosing nomogram based on the 8-hours renal clearance of creatinine and demonstrated that it is possible to increase the likelihood of target attainment in the first 24 h of treatment, particularly in patients with augmented renal clearance
Adequate serum concentrations of vancomycin should be confirmed with therapeutic drug monitoring, particularly in patients with extreme renal function alteration

### Updates to management of adults with chronic kidney disease… [^116EmwEr]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The KDIGO guideline recommends titrating the dosage of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors to achieve a systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg in patients with high blood pressure and CKD. A higher goal is reasonable for patients with frailty, at risk for falls, or with limiting factors such as symptomatic postural hypotension. For patients with nonemergent hyperkalemia, the KDIGO guideline has shifted away from recommending reflexive discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Instead, management suggestions include reviewing modifiable factors such as dietary potassium intake, eliminating medications that increase serum potassium, and prescribing potassium-lowering medications such as diuretics when appropriate. The National Kidney Foundation provides a patient-friendly overview of high- and low-potassium foods in English and Spanish. Referral to a nephrologist may also be appropriate.

1 Such tools include the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation CKD patch and the Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events calculator. The KDIGO guideline emphasizes use of statins in most patients with CKD. 1 Statins that do not require renal dosing adjustments include the high-intensity statin atorvastatin and moderate-intensity statins pravastatin and simvastatin. Rosuvastatin is a high-intensity statin requiring dosing adjustment, with a maximum recommended dose of 10 mg/day if the creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min/1. 73 m
2. 11 An individualized, varying A1C goal of less than 8. 0% is appropriate based on patient factors such as life expectancy, CKD severity, medical comorbidities, macrovascular complications, hypoglycemia awareness, and propensity of medications to cause hypoglycemia. GLP-1 agonist dosing can be titrated every 4 weeks to achieve glycemic goals.

12 Given its antagonism on the mineralocorticoid receptor, physicians should be aware of the risk of hyperkalemia with this drug. Finerenone should be withheld if the serum potassium level exceeds 5. 5 mEq/L. Due to its short, 2- to 3-hour half-life, finerenone can be safely reinitiated after the serum potassium level returns to 5. 5 mEq/L or less. 13.

### Renal impairment and clinical outcomes of Clostridium difficile infection in two randomized trials [^1136khdw]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have increased risk for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and for subsequent mortality. We determined the effect of CKD on response to treatment for CDI.

Methods

This is a post hoc analysis of two randomized controlled phase 3 trials that enrolled patients with CDI. Patients received either fidaxomicin 200 mg b.i.d. or vancomycin 125 mg q.i.d. for 10 days. Univariate and multivariate analyses compared end points by treatment received and CKD stage.

Results

At baseline, 27, 21, and 9% of the patients had stage 2 (60–89 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), stage 3 (30–59), and stage 4 or higher (< 30) CKD. Cure rates were similar for normal (91%) and stage 2 CKD (92%), but declined to 80% for stage 3 and to 75% for stage 4 CKD (p < 0.001 for trend). Time to resolution of diarrhea (TTROD) increased with stage 3 and stage 4 CKD. CDI recurrence rates 4 weeks after treatment were 16, 20, 27, and 24% for normal, stage 2, stage 3, and stage 4 or higher CKD, respectively. Mortality increased with CKD stage. In multivariate analyses, stage 3 or higher CKD correlated with lower odds of cure, greater chance of recurrence, and lower odds of sustained response 28 days after treatment. Initial cure rates were similar in the vancomycin or fidaxomicin groups; however, the rate of recurrence was higher following vancomycin treatment independent of renal function. The presence of immunosuppression did not alter this effect.

Conclusion

Progressive CKD is associated with increased TTROD, lower cure rates, and higher recurrence rates with treatment of CDI.

### Drug dosage adjustment in hospitalized patients with renal impairment at tikur anbessa specialized hospital, addis ababa, Ethiopia [^113eTHjC]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolism and excretion of many drugs and their pharmacologically active metabolites depend on normal renal function. In patients with kidney dysfunction, the renal excretion of parent drug and its metabolites will be impaired leading to their excessive accumulation in the body. In addition, the plasma protein binding of drugs may be significantly reduced, which in turn could influence the pharmacokinetic processes of distribution and elimination. The activity of several drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters has been shown to be impaired in chronic renal failure.

Medication dosing errors are the most important drug-related problems in patients with renal impairment. Inappropriate dosing in patients with kidney disease can cause toxicity or ineffective therapy. In particular, older patients are at a higher risk of developing advanced disease and related adverse events caused by age related decline in renal function and the use of multiple medications to treat co-morbid conditions. Drug accumulation and toxicity can develop rapidly if dosages are not adjusted in patients with impaired renal function. Drug elimination by the kidneys correlates with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is thus logical to use eGFR or eCrCl for adjusting dosages in patients with renal failure.

Drug dosing in renal insufficiency needs to be individualized whenever possible to optimize therapeutic outcomes and to minimize toxicity. The two major approaches are either to lengthen the interval between doses or to reduce the dose. Occasionally both interval and dose adjustments are needed. Drug dosage adjustment for patients with acute or chronic kidney disease is an accepted standard of practice, though there are no clear parameters to adjust drug dosing in acute kidney injury.

The challenge is how to accurately estimate a patient's kidney function in both acute and chronic kidney disease, which includes renal replacement therapy which is totally different, any Scr based equations are not valid in patients with acute kidney injury and end stage kidney disease.

Many renal function estimation approaches have been proposed, amongst which the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation, provides an estimate of creatinine clearance (CrCl). An apparently minor increase in serum creatinine (SCr) can reflect a marked fall in GFR. For this reason the estimation of GFR through the calculation of CrCl or eGFR using validated formula is mandatory in every patient. When in doubt, appropriate information for dosing guidelines should be sought in recently published monographs or texts. There are no published reports on studies that evaluate drug dosage adjustment in renal patients in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was initiated to assess drug dosage adjustment among hospitalized patients with renal impairment at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital.

### The 6R's of drug induced nephrotoxicity [^113QFrAZ]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Response

Treatment of nephrotoxicity is dependent on the phenotype, severity of the injury and the underlying condition for which the medication was prescribed. The decision to stop or reduce the dose of the offending drug requires a careful consideration of the risk versus benefit. In Type A reactions, dose reduction may be sufficient to mitigate the injury (e.g. vancomycin or gentamicin). However, stage 2 AKI often warrants drug discontinuation. In the setting of vancomycin DIKD, a critical appraisal of other therapeutic options and dose minimization is warranted. National guidelines on the use of vancomycin have recommended higher target trough concentrations to obtain a high area under the curve (AUC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio. However, the level of evidence for this recommendation was grade IIIb (limited evidence). With the widespread adoption of this recommendation, the rate of nephrotoxicity has increased. Meta-analysis conducted found the incidence of nephrotoxicity to be between 5–43% and target trough concentrations > 15 ng/mL to have a 2.67 odds ratio for the development of nephrotoxicity. A more recent study of 1430 patients receiving vancomycin provides support for the association between concentrations and duration of therapy with risk of nephrotoxicity. Post hoc analysis of prospective studies have examined the need for higher targets and demonstrated equivocal or lower cure rates with trough concentrations above 15 ng/mL for the treatment of staphylococcus aureus nosocomial acquired pneumonia. Additionally, these studies have demonstrated that alternative treatments such as linezolid or telavancin could be considered. Based on these studies, we believe that DIKD from higher vancomycin trough concentrations is a real concern. However, prospective studies designed to evaluate the benefits and risks of high therapeutic concentrations need to be done. Type B DIKD, which is idiosyncratic, will require discontinuation of the offending drug and careful observation. Severe injuries or type B reactions often require longer periods of time to improve and may not completely resolve.

### Initial vancomycin dosing protocol to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations in patients undergoing hemodialysis [^113MFBBr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although recent consensus guidelines proposed more aggressive vancomycin troughs of > 10 or 15–20 mg/L for complicated Staphylococcus aureus infections, dosing information to achieve these targets in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) is scarce.

Methods

We used Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods with a previously published population-pharmacokinetic model and relevant patient demographics to evaluate and revise our existing vancomycin dosing protocol (1000-mg load followed by 500-mg maintenance dose, with doses infused during the last hour of dialysis). A new protocol (1000-mg load followed by 500-mg maintenance dose for patients < 70 kg, 1250-mg followed by 750-mg for those 70–100 kg, and 1500-mg followed by 1000-mg for those > 100 kg) was developed and prospectively validated to achieve therapeutic serum troughs in patients undergoing high-flux HD.

Results

MCSs predicted that our existing protocol would be suboptimal in more than one-third of patients. Simulations predicted that the new vancomycin dosing protocol would achieve maintenance (pre-HD) troughs of 10–20 mg/L in 86.0% of cases including 15–20 mg/L in 35.2%. In prospective validation, the observed postload trough (pre-HD session 2) was 13.5 ± 3.4 mg/L with 76.9% of levels (20 of 26) between 10 and 20 mg/L. The observed maintenance trough was 17.3 ± 4.0 mg/L with 65.5% (19 of 29) between 10 and 20 mg/L and 89.7% (26 of 29) within 10% of the upper limit (ie, 10–22 mg/L).

Conclusions

In this study, a practical vancomycin dosing protocol for patients undergoing HD was developed and prospectively validated to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations in the clinical setting.

### Vancomycin dosing in patients on intermittent hemodialysis [^115DwQm4]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Vancomycin has been a cornerstone antibiotic for the treatment of severe gram-positive infections in dialysis patients for decades. Whereas subtherapeutic vancomycin levels convey a risk of treatment failure and the further emergence of resistance in staphylococci, supratherapeutic vancomycin levels are associated with a dose-related incremental risk for nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Consequently, a narrow therapeutic range with a trough-level target between 15 and 20 μg/ml is recommended. Vancomycin dosing in hemodialysis patients is mainly influenced by the timing of administration (during or after dialysis), the type of filter used, and the duration of dialysis. Actual body weight, the interdialytic interval, and residual renal function are also considerations. As in patients with normal kidney function, a weight-based loading dose of 20–25 mg/kg should be used in dialysis patients. While most fixed-dose maintenance regimens fail to reach target levels in the majority of hemodialysis patients, straightforward evidence on optimal maintenance dosing is lacking.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — For patients with suspected or definite serious MRSA infections, an individualized target of the AUC/MICBMD ratio of 400 to 600 (assuming a vancomycin MICBMD of 1 mg/L) should be advocated to achieve clinical efficacy while improving patient safety (A-II). Doses of 15 to 20 mg/kg (based on actual body weight) administered every 8 to 12 hours as an intermittent infusion are recommended for most patients with normal renal function assuming a MICBMD of 1 mg/L (A-II), and these doses may not achieve the therapeutic AUC/MIC target when the MIC is 2 mg/L.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) dosing and monitoring — For patients receiving CRRT at conventional, KDIGO-recommended effluent rates of 20 to 25 mL/kg/h, loading doses of 20 to 25 mg/kg by actual body weight should be used (B-III), and initial maintenance dosing for CRRT with effluent rates of 20 to 25 mL/kg/h should be 7.5 to 10 mg/kg every 12 hours (B-II). Maintenance dose and dosing interval should be based on serum concentration monitoring, which should be conducted within the first 24 hours to ensure AUC/MIC targets are met; in fluid overloaded patients, doses may be reduced as patients become euvolemic and Vd decreases, and the use of CI of vancomycin in patients receiving CRRT could be used in place of intermittent dosing especially when high CRRT ultrafiltrate/dialysate flow rates are employed (B-II).

Vancomycin monitoring indications and frequency recommend monitoring for patients receiving vancomycin for serious MRSA infections to achieve sustained targeted AUC values assuming a MICBMD of 1 mg/L unless it is known to be greater or less than 1 mg/L by BMD; monitoring is also recommended for patients at high risk for nephrotoxicity, those with unstable renal function, and those receiving prolonged therapy (more than 3 to 5 days), and we suggest the frequency be based on clinical judgment with frequent or daily monitoring for hemodynamically unstable patients and once-weekly monitoring for hemodynamically stable patients (B-II).

Vancomycin pediatric renal impairment — dose adjustment and monitoring are supported by pharmacokinetic data: Vancomycin requires dosage adjustment in children with acute or chronic renal insufficiency. In a Bayesian population analysis of 63 case-control pairs with 319 concentrations (mean age 13 [SD, 6] years), a vancomycin dosage of 45 mg/kg/day (15 mg/kg every 8 hours) in renally impaired children achieved AUC exposure similar to 60 mg/kg/day in children with normal renal function, and in 87% of children with initial renal impairment vancomycin clearance improved within the first 5 days of therapy. Because vancomycin clearance does not always correlate well with renal function and renal function may return rapidly after ICU admission, therapeutic monitoring of both serum concentrations and renal function should be conducted during vancomycin therapy.

### Telavancin hydrochloride (Vibativ) [^115qpT61]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14.2 HABP/VABP

Adult patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia were enrolled in two randomized, parallelgroup, multinational, multicenter, double-blinded trials of identical design comparing VIBATIV (10 mg/kg IV every 24 hours) with vancomycin (1 g IV every 12 hours) for 7 to 21 days. Vancomycin dosages could be adjusted for body weight and/or renal function per local guidelines. Patients could receive concomitant aztreonam or metronidazole for suspected Gram-negative and anaerobic infection, respectively. The addition of piperacillin/tazobactam was also permitted for coverage of Gram-negative organisms if resistance to aztreonam was known or suspected. Patients with known or suspected infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were enrolled in the studies.

Of the patients enrolled across both trials, 64% were male and 70% were white. The mean age was 63 years. At baseline, more than 50% were admitted to an intensive care unit, about 23% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, about 29% had ventilator-associated pneumonia and about 6% had bacteremia. Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally well-balanced between treatment groups; however, there were differences between HABP/VABP Trial 1 and HABP/VABP Trial 2 with respect to a baseline history of diabetes mellitus (31% in Trial 1, 21% in Trial 2) and baseline renal insufficiency (CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min) (36% in Trial 1, 27% in Trial 2).

### Serum cystatin C predicts vancomycin trough levels better than serum creatinine in hospitalized patients: a cohort study [^113HT19n]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, only 20% of patients achieved a serum vancomycin trough level within their target range under usual care based on a combination of the Cockcroft-Gault equation, manufacturer guidelines, and clinician judgment. To determine whether clinically available data could be used to predict trough levels, we developed novel models based on serum creatinine, cystatin C, or eGFR with the Cockcroft-Gault and CKD-EPI equations. The optimal model used the CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation for eGFR and is projected to improve trough achievement to greater than 50%. When these models were used, a practical set of dosing recommendations for vancomycin using the CKD-EPI equations could be developed for prospective testing.

Cystatin C, an endogenous proteinase inhibitor, is one of the first surrogates of GFR to emerge as a viable and practical alternative to creatinine in the last several decades. Minimal data regarding the use of cystatin C-based medication dosing have been published. The present study demonstrated that the use of serum cystatin C, alone or with creatinine, improved expected target vancomycin trough achievement. Published pharmacokinetic analyses also suggest that cystatin C-based GFR estimates more accurately predict vancomycin clearance than creatinine clearance. Furthermore, the current literature suggests that steady-state vancomycin troughs correlate more significantly with cystatin C-based models than creatinine-based models, largely due to reduced error among older individuals. The present study demonstrates the potential utility of cystatin C to achieve desired vancomycin trough levels in a real-world setting.

### An evaluation of the empirical vancomycin dosing guide in pediatric cardiology [^114uq3Hy]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin MAG

Children with normal renal function are usually started on an initial dose of 40 mg/kg divided q6–8 hourly for mild to moderate infections. The guide involves no loading dose for any patient. Based on the estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl), using the bedside Schwartz equation, the interval of daily vancomycin dosing is selected. The goal trough concentration for treatment of general infection is 7–15 mg/L, and for severe infection is > 15–20 mg/dL. The guide also proposes a dosage adjustment based on the serum trough level and the dosage interval is extended by two hours (i.e. q6h is changed to q8h) for supratherapeutic trough levels. However, if the child has a subtherapeutic reading, the dose is increased by 2.5 mg/kg/dose (i.e. 10 mg/kg is changed to 12.5 mg/kg). According to the MAG, serum trough levels are usually obtained 15–30 min before the fourth dose for patients receiving the drug at an interval less than 24 h; otherwise, it is tested before the third dose if the dosing interval is 24 h or longer. The level is repeated every 5–7 days after achieving the target level.

Data collection

Data were collected using the hospital's electronic database where all patient records were checked daily for vancomycin orders. The baseline characteristics were sociodemographic variables, including weight, height, and gender. The clinical variables were comorbidities, type of cardiac lesion, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, the presence of fever, and laboratory values (i.e. WBC, platelets, ESR, CRP, culture, SCr, BUN). These values were recorded at baseline and daily whenever available. The SCr and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were monitored at baseline then every three to five days providing that the kidney function was stable, and no concomitant nephrotoxic medication was administered, otherwise, more frequent monitoring was required. The Jaffé method, specifically through the kinetic Alkaline Picrate reaction, is used in our hospital for the measurement of serum creatinine levels. Information related to the vancomycin therapy (i.e. indication, initial dose and frequency, first trough level at steady state, number of dose adjustments, and duration of therapy) were also collected. The serum vancomycin concentrations were measured and analyzed at the main laboratory of our institution using the particle-enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay method (Siemens Dimension; Dade Behring, Deerfield, Illinois, PETINIA).

### Vancomycin dosing in patients on intermittent hemodialysis – A retrospective study [^113YeUCk]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the incidence of therapeutic target attainment using a three-times per week protocol for vancomycin therapy given during the last hour of intermittent hemodialysis (HD).

Methods

A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted of patient medical records in a remote dialysis center from January 2017 to July 2023. Adult patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 on ≥ 3 months of intermittent HD who had received a course of vancomycin therapy with ≥ 1 serum vancomycin concentration recorded were included. Demographic and dosing data were collected. Clinician adherence with the dosing protocol and attainment of the therapeutic target (trough concentration within 15–20 mg/L) following the loading and maintenance doses were assessed. Factors associated with target nonattainment following the loading dose were analyzed, and the 48- and 72-h maintenance dosing intervals were analyzed for target nonattainment.

Findings

A total of 98 vancomycin courses (67 patients) were available for analysis. Only 38% of the loading doses were prescribed as per protocol. Following the loading dose, 25% of trough concentrations achieved the therapeutic target concentration (15–20 mg/L), 25% returned a supra-therapeutic concentration (> 20 mg/L) and 50% were sub-therapeutic (< 15 mg/L). When compared with those achieving target, sub-therapeutic concentrations were associated with a lower loading dose (median 16.6 vs 20.0 mg/kg, P < 0.002), and supra-therapeutic concentrations had a shorter dosing interval between the loading dose and first maintenance dose (median 31.5 vs 39.0 h, P = 0.06). Of the 201 maintenance trough concentrations collected, 65% were therapeutic, 21% were sub-therapeutic and 14% were supra-therapeutic, with an overall median trough concentration of 17.3 mg/L. As the treatment duration increased, an increase was seen in the number of dose adjustments required to achieve the target trough concentration. The 48-h dosing interval was associated with more supra-therapeutic concentrations and the 72-h interval was associated with more sub-therapeutic concentrations (df = 2, P = 0.022).

Implications

We have identified a high rate of target nonattainment for HD patients on a three times a week vancomycin dosing regimen. We recommend a loading dose of 20 to 25 mg/kg irrespective of the indication and a better-defined dosing interval after the loading dose. A higher maintenance dose should be prescribed when the time to next dialysis session is 72 h. Further pharmacokinetic studies are needed to assess factors influencing target concentration attainment following the maintenance doses and to determine an optimal dosing regimen.

### Serum cystatin C predicts vancomycin trough levels better than serum creatinine in hospitalized patients: a cohort study [^116Dfu3R]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Of the 552 patients screened for eligibility, 173 individuals were enrolled in the study. The majority of excluded patients lacked an adequate stored specimen for cystatin C measurement (n = 189), were obese (n = 99), or declined research authorization for the study (n = 53) (Figure 2). No patients were excluded for KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) stage 2 or stage 3 AKI. The final cohort was 59 ± 16 (mean ± SD) years old, 54% male, and predominately Caucasian (95%). The mean BSA of included patients was 1.86 ± 0.2 m 2 with a range of 1.29 to 2.52 m 2. Moderate to severe chronic kidney disease with a baseline eGFR by CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C of less than 60 mL/min was evident in 20% of patients (Table 1). The eGFR by CKD-EPI cystatin C was significantly lower than by CKD-EPI creatinine (−14 ± 25 mL/min, P < 0.001). A creatinine value prior to the study baseline (Figure 1) was available in 122 (71%) individuals. Using this value, stage 1 AKI (an at least 0.3 mg/dL creatinine increase from baseline), though not an explicit exclusion criterion, affected only four (3%) patients in the included sample. The administered vancomycin maintenance dose compared well with institutional and national guidelines (16.3 ± 2.4 mg/kg). Dosing frequency differed from the institutional recommendations in 132 (76%) patients, most commonly because providers selected less frequent dosing intervals. The target troughs were 10 to 15 mg/L for 40% of patients and 15 to 20 mg/L for 60% of patients.

### Factors associated with serum concentrations of vancomycin crystalline degradation product (CDP-1) among patients with chronic kidney disease [^111yjhjk]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The G3 group demonstrated the highest mean trough CDP-1 concentration among all study groups. We hypothesize that this phenomenon may be attributable not only to prolonged vancomycin exposure but also to elevated serum vancomycin concentrations (mean 32.63 μg/mL) observed in the G3 group. However, it should be noted that the mean trough vancomycin concentration in the G3 group was nearly twice as high as the previously recommended trough range of 10–20 μg/mL. These results suggest that increasing the monitoring frequency of vancomycin may be beneficial for achieving optimal vancomycin exposure. If vancomycin exposure is managed early within an appropriate range, the effect of CDP-1 could be negligible in clinical decision-making regardless of renal function.

The time interval from the initial dose to the trough level was also selected as a significant factor associated with the CDP-1 concentration. On the basis of this result, we assumed that the time interval would account for the difference in overestimation observed in previous studies. For patients with CKD, the initial vancomycin trough level is recommended to be started after 72 hours of vancomycin therapy since the time to achieve a steady-state trough level is delayed compared with that in patients with normal renal function. On the other hand, the delayed timing of trough level sampling could contribute to increased CDP-1 levels and overestimation of vancomycin levels. Therefore, developing a precise strategy for the timing of vancomycin TDM in patients with CKD is necessary.

### Serum cystatin C predicts vancomycin trough levels better than serum creatinine in hospitalized patients: a cohort study [^113az2Y3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Setting and participants

This prospective cohort study enrolled hospitalized adults at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who received intravenous vancomycin between March and October 2012 and had Minnesota research authorization. The Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board approved the protocol and waived the need for informed consent because the study was considered minimal risk. Other eligibility criteria included the measurement of creatinine upon vancomycin initiation (enrollment creatinine), availability of stored serum from this same sample for cystatin C measurement, and a steady-state vancomycin level. Patients were excluded if they developed stage 2 or stage 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) at baseline or prior to the vancomycin level, because changing renal function would prohibit the achievement of a steady state during vancomycin dosing. In such cases, clinicians routinely administer a single dose of vancomycin and perform serial serum concentration monitoring to determine the appropriate time for a re-dose. Patients who received vancomycin at an inconsistent dose or interval were also excluded as were individuals with a body mass index of greater than 32 kg/m 2 due to altered vancomycin pharmacokinetics in obesity.

Institutionally endorsed vancomycin dosing and monitoring recommendations were in place throughout the study. Briefly, a vancomycin loading dose of 20 to 30 mg/kg and a maintenance dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg based on actual body weight were recommended for all patients. Dosing intervals were informed primarily by the Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance. Regimens were tailored by the care team according to severity of infection and other determinants of renal function (that is, urine output), if available. Ultimately, the primary service, supported by a clinical pharmacist, both without cystatin C levels, established an individualized vancomycin regimen for each patient. In accordance with national guidelines, each regimen was designed to achieve a target vancomycin trough level, either between 10 and 15 mg/L or between 15 and 20 mg/L, appropriate for the suspected or documented source(s) of infection. Specifically, individuals with bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, or pneumonia with a suspected association with S. aureus were assigned a goal trough range of 15 to 20 mg/L. In all other cases, the target trough range assigned was 10 to 15 mg/L. Vancomycin dosing interval reflects GFR and the anticipated drug half-life. Using guideline recommendations, trough levels were all drawn immediately before the fourth dose of vancomycin to approximate steady-state conditions (4 to 5 half-lives).

### Evaluation of a protocol for vancomycin administration in critically patients with and without kidney dysfunction [^112wYiun]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Administration of vancomycin in critically ill patients needs close regulation. While subtherapeutical vancomycin serum concentration (VSC) is associated with increased mortality, accumulation is responsible for nephrotoxicity. Our study aimed to estimate the efficacy of a vancomycin-dosing protocol in reaching appropriate serum concentration in patients with and without kidney dysfunction.

Methods

This was a retrospective study in critically ill patients treated with continuous infusion of vancomycin. Patients with creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min (Group A) were compared to those with creatinine clearance ≤ 50 ml/min (Group B).

Results

348 patients were enrolled (210 in Group A, 138 in Group B). At first determination, patients with kidney dysfunction (Group B) had a statistically higher percentage of vancomycin in target range, while the percentage of patients with a VSC under the range was almost equal. These percentages differed at the subsequent measurements. The number of patients with low vancomycin concentration progressively decreased, except in those with augmented renal clearance; the percentage of patients with VSC over 30 mg/L was about 28%, irrespective of the presence or absence of kidney dysfunction. Patients who reached a subtherapeutic level at the first VSC measurement had a significant correlation with in-hospital mortality.

Conclusions

Our protocol seems to allow a rapid achievement of a target VSC particularly in patients with kidney dysfunction. In order to avoid subtherapeutical VSC, our algorithm should be implemented by the estimation of the presence of an augmented renal clearance.

### Review of vancomycin-induced renal toxicity: an update [^114ZbtRi]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

In recent times the use of larger doses of vancomycin aimed at curbing the increasing incidence of resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus has led to a wider report of acute kidney injury (AKI). Apart from biological plausibility, causality is implied by the predictive association of AKI with larger doses, longer duration, and graded plasma concentrations of vancomycin. AKI is more likely to occur with the concurrent use of nephrotoxic agents, and in critically ill patients who are susceptible to poor renal perfusion. Although most vancomycin-induced AKI cases are mild and therefore reversible, their occurrence may be associated with greater incidence of end-stage kidney disease and higher mortality rate. The strategy for its prevention includes adequate renal perfusion and therapeutic drug monitoring in high-risk individuals. In the near future, there is feasibility of renoprotective use of antioxidative substances in the delivery of vancomycin.

### Evaluation of a protocol for vancomycin administration in critically patients with and without kidney dysfunction [^112hqSbu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Accordingly, we developed a protocol for vancomycin infusion that takes into account the clearance of creatinine for determining the daily dose of vancomycin, along with vancomycin serum concentration (VSC) measurements for the subsequent dose adjustments needed to overcome the risks of ineffectiveness (failure of treatment) or nephrotoxicity.

The aims of the present study were: (1) to estimate the efficacy of the vancomycin dosing protocol to reach a correct serum therapeutic range in critically ill patients with and without kidney dysfunction (2) to analyse which factor(s) are related to subtherapeutic VSC.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^11549Bdx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS

Vancomycin is ∼50% protein‐bound, with a volume of distribution of 0.4–1.0 L/kg and a β‐elimination half‐life of 3–6 h with normal kidney function. 8 The drug is not metabolized and is eliminated unchanged in the urine. Clearance is linearly related to the glomerular filtration rate. Penetration into tissues is variable, especially into pulmonary epithelial lining fluid in the critically ill, which is of obvious concern when treating MRSA pneumonia. 9

The bactericidal activity of vancomycin is considered time‐dependent but concentration‐independent. 10 Increasing concentrations of vancomycin are not associated with enhanced bacterial killing. 10 Rather, the ratio of the 24‐h AUC to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) is the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best correlated with effectiveness. 8 Consensus guidelines published in 2009 by the American Society of Health‐System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists (herein referred to as Guidelines) recommend an AUC/MIC of ≥ 400. 8 Available clinical evidence supports this ratio. 11, 12

The two most common ways to determine the MIC of staphylococci are broth microdilution (BMD) and the Etest, with the Etest result typically 0.5–1.5 times higher after log conversion. 13 Hence, a given AUC will result in a lower ratio if MIC is determined by the Etest. Of note, the Guidelines were derived from data generated using BMD. The BMD method only allows for 2‐fold dilutions, i.e. 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 mg/L, etc. whereas the Etest is based on a continuous gradient and can give greater discrimination with half‐dilution values (e.g. 1.5 mg/L). 14 In 2006 the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) lowered the MIC breakpoint for vancomycin susceptibility from ≤ 4 mg/L to ≤ 2 mg/L by BMD, owing to a greater chance for failure at ≥ 4 mg/L. 15

### Does contemporary vancomycin dosing achieve therapeutic targets in a heterogeneous clinical cohort of critically ill patients? Data from the multinational DALI study [^115Uy4Uq]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major pathogen in severe healthcare-associated infections. In the past decades, the anti-MRSA armamentarium has broadened. Still, vancomycin remains the most common first-line option for treating severe infections with parenteral therapy. Achievement of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) indices associated with maximal bacterial kill is recommended to increase the likelihood of clinical cure. To achieve target serum concentrations in life-threatening infections such as sepsis, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis and hospital-acquired pneumonia, current guidelines recommend trough serum concentrations of vancomycin (C min) ranging 15 to 20 mg/L. Such serum concentrations should achieve an area under the concentration-time curve over a 24-hour period divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration of the suspected bacteria (AUC 0–24 /MIC ratio) of > 400 (assuming an MIC ≤ 1 mg/L). This threshold was significantly associated with favourable clinical and bacteriological outcomes in patients with lower respiratory tract infections and therefore generally accepted as the appropriate PK/PD target. Other investigators confirmed that an AUC 0–24 /MIC ratio for optimizing clinical outcomes should be at least 400.

Patients With Impaired Renal Function and Elderly Patients

Dosage adjustment must be made in patients with impaired renal function. In premature infants and the elderly, greater dosage reductions than expected may be necessary because of decreased renal function. Measurement of vancomycin serum concentrations can be helpful in optimizing therapy, especially in seriously ill patients with changing renal function. Vancomycin serum concentrations can be determined by use of microbiologic assay, radioimmunoassay, fluorescence polarization immunoassay, fluorescence immunoassay, or high-pressure liquid chromatography.

If creatinine clearance can be measured or estimated accurately, the dosage for most patients with renal impairment can be calculated using the following table. The dosage of vancomycin per day in mg is about 15 times the glomerular filtration rate in mL/min (see following table).

The initial dose should be no less than 15 mg/kg, even in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency.

The table is not valid for functionally anephric patients. For such patients, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight should be given to achieve prompt therapeutic serum concentrations. The dose required to maintain stable concentrations is 1.9 mg/kg/24 hr. In patients with marked renal impairment, it may be more convenient to give maintenance doses of 250 to 1,000 mg once every several days rather than administering the drug on a daily basis. In anuria, a dose of 1,000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended.

When only serum creatinine is known, the following formula (based on sex, weight and age of the patient) may be used to calculate creatinine clearance. Calculated creatinine clearances (mL/min) are only estimates. The creatinine clearance should be measured promptly.

The serum creatinine must represent a steady state of renal function. Otherwise, the estimated value for creatinine clearance is not valid. Such a calculated clearance is an overestimate of actual clearance in patients with conditions:

(1) characterized by decreasing renal function, such as shock, severe heart failure, or oliguria; (2) in which a normal relationship between muscle mass and total body weight is not present, such as in obese patients or those with liver disease, edema, or ascites; and (3) accompanied by debilitation, malnutrition, or inactivity.

The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administration by the intrathecal (intralumbar or intraventricular) routes have not been established.

Intermittent infusion is the recommended method of administration.

### Evaluation of a protocol for vancomycin administration in critically patients with and without kidney dysfunction [^116pcvvo]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

All the above mentioned factors imply great inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics, complicating accurate prediction of serum concentrations in ICU patients, making evident the need of a frequent dosage of VSC in order to make the daily dose of this antibiotics adequate.

A below-range VSC was observed in only 20% of patients of both groups. However, only patients with kidney dysfunction progressively and significantly reduced this percentage, which became about 9% at the third VSC determination. Interestingly, the group with normal kidney function had a different behaviour. Between the first and the third VSC determination, it became progressively evident the relevance of an ARC that did not allow this group to decrease the percentage of patients with VSC under the range. This is of clinical relevance since patients who reached a subtherapeutic level at the first VSC measurement had a significant correlation with in-hospital mortality (OR 2.1; p 0.003).

### Drug-related problems in hospitalized patients with chronic kidney diseases and clinical pharmacist interventions [^111m5tUH]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2017, the global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was estimated to be 9.1%, with 697.5 million cases of all-stage CKD recorded. China accounted for 132.3 million among these cases with the incidence was 9.57%. A 2014 cross-sectional study estimated the prevalence of CKD at 9.88% (approximately 5.67 million patients) in Zhejiang Province, eastern China. According to the 2015 Annual Data Report of the China Kidney Disease Network (CK-NET), more than half of patients with CKD in China were aged ≥ 60 years, and the most common causes of CKD include diabetic kidney disease, hypertensive nephropathy, obstructive nephropathy and glomerulonephritis.

According to the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE), drug-related problems (DRPs), including unnecessary drug therapy, ineffective drugs, need for additional drug therapy, and inappropriate drug dose or frequency, can certainly or potentially affect the desired therapeutic outcomes. A systematic review in 2020 based on 16 studies reported that the average number of DRPs per patient ranged from 0.58 to 7.2. A large population-based retrospective study found 25% of patients with CKD had three or more comorbidities, with hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease and atrial fibrillation being the five most common comorbidities. The use of multiple drugs is necessary in CKD population with comorbidities, but also obviously increase the risk of DRPs. Besides, CKD seriously alters the pharmacokinetic parameters of drugs mainly metabolized and excreted by kidney. Some antibiotics, such as vancomycin, need to adjust the dose or frequency according to kidney function in CKD population. The dose-adjustment regimens might be more complex, especially in the CKD cases with renal replacement therapy. Briefly, due to extensive comorbidities and pharmacokinetic changes, the patients with CKD are at high risk of DRPs. A systematic review based on 20 studies showed that the prevalence of DRPs in cases of CKD ranged from 12–87%.

Intermittent hemodialysis — vancomycin exposure targets and dosing frequency emphasize concentration- and AUC-based goals and intradialytic losses. Predialysis vancomycin concentration to MRSA MIC ratios of > 18.6 have been associated with improved bacteremia patient outcomes. Dosing to achieve predialysis concentrations of 10 to 20 mg/L results in a mean AUC24 ranging from 250 to 450 mg·h/L, and outcome studies validating the AUC24 goal of 400 to 600 mg·h/L used in other populations have not been conducted in the hemodialysis population, though this section aims to reach this AUC24 target (ie, 400–600 mg·h/L). For non-critically ill patients receiving hemodialysis, 2 or 3 days is the most common interdialytic period, and approximately 20% to 40% of an intradialytically administered dose is removed by simultaneous hemodialysis. Although the package insert states "In anuria, a dose of 1000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended", far more frequent doses are needed to maintain therapeutic serum concentrations in patients receiving hemodialysis. Consequently, maintenance vancomycin doses are recommended to be administered with each hemodialysis session to ensure therapeutic serum concentrations throughout the dosing interval.

### Decreasing the time to achieve therapeutic vancomycin concentrations in critically ill patients: developing and testing of a dosing nomogram [^112j5xnY]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Clinicians are used to adjusting the dosing of antibiotics according to acute or chronic renal failure, however the adjustment to elevated function of the kidneys is considered to be quite rare, and there are no recommendations on this clinical issue. Moreover, the incidence of ARC (here defined as CL CR > 130 ml/minute/1.73 m 2) is probably high and ubiquitous in every ICU with an underestimated incidence. Indeed ARC is being increasingly described, with previously reported rates, varying widely between 18% to as high as 57% in critically ill patients without renal dysfunction.

In the context of severe infection, a major consequence of ARC is the high renal clearance of hydrophilic antibiotics leading to a risk of inducing sub-therapeutic concentrations, therapeutic failure, emergence of multi-resistant bacterial strains, and even potentially increased mortality. To date, different antibiotics have been studied in the presence of ARC and these reports have shown a strong association between ARC and sub-therapeutic concentrations. Importantly for vancomycin, low serum concentrations are associated with decreases in susceptibility and in treatment failure of patients with MRSA infections. A recent large-scale multicentre point-prevalence study revealed that a substantial proportion of critically ill patients treated with vancomycin did not achieve the target vancomycin concentration and showed high variability in pharmacokinetics parameters, supporting a re-evaluation of vancomycin dosing recommendations in this particular setting. Furthermore, a recent consensus review recommended more aggressive vancomycin dosing to ensure achievement of the pharmacodynamic index associated with efficacy. Though vancomycin is widely used in the ICU, there are relatively few studies focused on the early optimization of serum concentrations where CI is the prescribed mode of administration. Surprisingly, only three studies among these used measured renal clearance of creatinine, three used mathematical estimates of renal function and one study did not provide this information. Among those studies evaluating the serum vancomycin concentration on day 1 or day 2, the achievement of target concentrations of 20 to 30 mg/L ranged between 48 and 52%.

### Serum cystatin C predicts vancomycin trough levels better than serum creatinine in hospitalized patients: a cohort study [^113ykM62]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Serum cystatin C can improve glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation over creatinine alone, but whether this translates into clinically relevant improvements in drug dosing is unclear.

Methods

This prospective cohort study enrolled adults receiving scheduled intravenous vancomycin while hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic in 2012. Vancomycin dosing was based on weight, serum creatinine with the Cockcroft-Gault equation, and clinical judgment. Cystatin C was later assayed from the stored serum used for the creatinine-based dosing. Vancomycin trough prediction models were developed by using factors available at therapy initiation. Residuals from each model were used to predict the proportion of patients who would have achieved the target trough with the model compared with that observed with usual care.

Results

Of 173 patients enrolled, only 35 (20%) had a trough vancomycin level within their target range (10 to 15 mg/L or 15 to 20 mg/L). Cystatin C-inclusive models better predicted vancomycin troughs than models based upon serum creatinine alone, although both were an improvement over usual care. The optimal model used estimated GFR by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaborative (CKD-EPI) creatinine-cystatin C equation (R(2) = 0.580). This model is expected to yield 54% (95% confidence interval 45% to 61%) target trough attainment (P < 0.001 compared with the 20% with usual care).

Conclusions

Vancomycin dosing based on standard care with Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance yielded poor trough achievement. The developed dosing model with estimated GFR from CKD-EPIcreatinine-cystatin C could yield a 2.5-fold increase in target trough achievement compared with current clinical practice. Although this study is promising, prospective validation of this or similar cystatin C-inclusive dosing models is warranted.

SOP evaluation for the therapy with vancomycin

Every consecutive day was evaluated for adherence of SOPs. Vancomycin therapy was separately evaluated for continued and intermittent therapy, each with a specific dosing concept based on renal function and pre-existing kidney damage. For vancomycin initiation in adults, a loading dose of 1 g intravenously is recommended. In the continuous dosing regimen this is followed by 2 g over 24 h (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/h with 1 g/24 h, < 20 ml/h with 500 mg/24 h). For intermittent dosing, maintenance doses are recommended with 0.5 g/6 h or 1 g/12 h. Regarding therapeutic drug monitoring in continuous therapy, first measurements are obtained after 24 to 36 h with target levels of 15 to 20 mg/l. In intermittent therapy the trough levels are to be obtained before the fourth application of vancomycin with a target level of 10 to 20 mg/l. During maintenance therapy, SOP conformity required adaptation of dosing regimen according to therapeutic drug monitoring.

SOP evaluation for the therapy with gentamicin and tobramycin

For management of gentamicin and tobramycin therapy, recommendations based on renal function and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) were analysed. For initial therapy induction, doses with 3 to 6 mg/Kg body weight in gentamicin and 5 to 7 mg/Kg body weight for tobramycin are used. Maintenance therapy should be adapted to serum trough levels with a 2 mg/l cut off for each agent based on the laboratory reference. The recommendations include adjustment to blood trough levels for the two drugs or dosing adaptation based on elevated serum creatinine levels. Aminoglycosides were administered once daily after achievement of the results of the TDM. Dose adaption was performed according to the results; only if the results were extremely high one dose was omitted. Peak levels have no influence on the dosing and are for this reason not measured regularly.

Calculation of the adherence rate

To calculate adherence rates, each study day on which a patient was treated with either vancomycin, gentamicin or tobramycin was recorded and evaluated as described in detail elsewhere. For combination therapy all related SOPs had to be fulfilled. The binary variable of daily adherence was transferred into a relative variable. Therefore, in each patient the cumulative number of days with SOP conformity was divided by the total number of days with an application of these antibiotics.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^114iDJvQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Standard vancomycin dosing as approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is 1 g q12 h, a dose unlikely to give a ratio ≥ 400 unless the MIC is ≤ 0.5 mg/L. Hence, the Guidelines recommend weight‐based dosing (using actual body weight) at 15–20 mg/kg (not to exceed 2 g/dose) q12 h, with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM; trough levels checked at steady state prior to 4 th dose if normal renal function). With serious infections a loading dose of 25–30 mg/kg may be considered. A meta‐analysis confirmed a benefit to TDM with significantly higher rates of clinical efficacy and significantly reduced nephrotoxicity compared to no TDM. 29 The available evidence for attaining a trough ≥ 15 mg/L (vs. < 15 mg/L) may be questionable in terms of predicting an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 as well as for clinical efficacy, but values < 10 mg/L should be avoided to prevent resistance and to attain the target AUC/MIC. 24 TDM is especially necessary in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Many have decreased kidney function, but others have augmented renal clearance with lower than expected trough levels. 30

Alternative methods to guide vancomycin dosing by intermittent infusion have been published. One nomogram is based on population pharmacokinetics and is aimed at targeting a trough level of 15–20 mg/L. 31 Based on a priori methodology, individual patient data are not required, although one must be careful that a particular patient matches those used to generate the nomogram. Other nomograms are available. Linear regression analysis applying individual patient parameters (a posteriori) has been used but does require at least two measured serum concentrations and a log linear calculator. 32 Bayesian estimation methodology combines a priori population‐based data with a posteriori individual patient data (which may be limited to just a trough level 23) to calculate dose and interval most accurately, 32 and has higher predicative ability to achieve a specific AUC/MIC. 33 Bayesian methodology may be the fastest way to achieve therapeutic targets, but requires specific computer software and specialized practitioners and has had limited implementation.

### Evaluation of a protocol for vancomycin administration in critically patients with and without kidney dysfunction [^111JV1fw]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

As to the VSC in the desired range, only at the first determination group B had higher percentage of patients with VSC in the normal range and, as a consequence, a lower percentage with a VSC over the range (Fig. 2). At the second and the third VSC determination the two groups were almost identical. This was the case also for VSC over the target range, being the percentage of patients with a VSC higher than 30 mg/L of about 28%. The increase of VSC over the target range has been associated with a risk of nephrotoxicity that has a reported incidence up to 35% during vancomycin therapy. Hence we investigated the effects of VSC over the target range on renal function. Interestingly no correlation was found between VSC and renal toxicity, even in patients with kidney dysfunction. This is relevant from the clinical point of view, since other and more expensive antibiotics are usually proposed in patients at risk of kidney dysfunction. Such result can be explained by several factors. First of all, we considered 15–25 mg/L as a target range since a VSC over 25 mg/L can be associated with increase of nephrotoxicity, as previously described. However, other studies have proposed an upper limit of 30 mg/L, suggesting that nephrotoxicity could be enhanced when the VSC reaches values higher than 30 mg/L, as it was the case of the present study. The VSC > 30 mg/L was found in about 30% of the patients of both groups (Fig. 2), whilst the % of patients with a VSC higher than 35 mg/dl was extremely low in both groups (about 1%, see results section). These results underline that our algorithm is able to adjust the VSC preventing the progressive accumulation of vancomycin without incurring the opposite phenomenon, that is a VSC below 15 mg/dl.

An observational study found that nephrotoxicity is frequently noted more than 2 weeks into treatment, which informed the recommendation to monitor levels throughout OPAT.

### Clinical review: use of vancomycin in haemodialysis patients [^115VGMAZ]. Critical Care (2002). Low credibility.

Following intravenous administration, vancomycin is poorly metabolized and is mainly excreted unchanged in urine. Total body clearance is thus dependent on the kidney, and is correlated with glomerular filtration rate and creatinine clearance. Accumulation of vancomycin in patients with renal insufficiency may therefore occur, and this may lead to toxic side effects if dosage is not modified according to the degree of renal failure. Furthermore, vancomycin easily diffuses through dialysis membranes. The aim of the present review is to establish guidelines for handling this drug in such patients. We indicate how and when plasma concentrations of vancomycin should be determined in dialysis patients.

Vancomycin AUC-guided monitoring — Given the narrow vancomycin AUC range for therapeutic effect and minimal acute kidney injury (AKI) risk, the most accurate and optimal way to manage vancomycin dosing should be through AUC-guided dosing and monitoring (A-II). We recommend to accomplish this in one of two ways. One approach relies on the collection of 2 concentrations obtained near steady-state — a postdistributional peak concentration at 1 to 2 hours after infusion and a trough concentration at the end of the dosing interval — and utilizing first-order pharmacokinetic (PK) equations to estimate the AUC (A-II). It is also highly preferred that concentrations are collected near steady-state conditions.

### Implementation of a dose calculator for vancomycin to achieve target trough levels of 15–20 microg / mL in persons undergoing hemodialysis [^116cRbsd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

(See the article by Brown et al, on pages 164–166.)

Background

Vancomycin is a key antibiotic for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections in patients undergoing dialysis. Vancomycin has a narrow therapeutic range. Overdosing imposes a risk of nephro- and ototoxicity, wherease underdosing predisposes to treatment failure and the emergence of drug resistance. Trough levels of 15–20 μg/mL have been identified as the optimal target trough levels.

Methods

A multivariate model called the vancomycin dose calculator (VDC) was prospectively developed and validated to permit accurate vancomycin dosing in persons undergoing hemodialysis.

Results

The model identified 3 simple parameters that were responsible for 94.6% of the variance observed: predialysis vancomycin trough level, dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session. Maintenance dosing was accurate in 77.9% of patients, whereas major over- and underdosing were avoided in the remaining patients. The mean measured trough level of 16.5 μg/mL was 5.6% lower than the mean predicted trough level of 17.5 μg/mL. With regard to loading doses, a fixed loading dose of 20 mg/kg led to subtherapeutic trough levels in one-half of patients.

Conclusions

The VDC permits accurate vancomycin maintenance dosing based on predialysis trough level, dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session in the majority of patients undergoing hemodialysis. Higher loading doses that accounted for the period to the next dialysis may be more appropriate than fixed loading doses used in this study.

### Vancomycin and nephrotoxicity: just another myth? [^114RpDPv]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Vancomycin is considered the drug of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection; however, it has also been linked with nephrotoxicity in the past, sometimes leading to its substitution with linezolid. We hypothesized that patients treated with vancomycin for gram-positive (GP) infections would have an increased incidence of rise in creatinine and need for hemodialysis (HD) compared with patients receiving linezolid.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of a prospectively maintained database of all surgical patients treated with either vancomycin or linezolid for GP infections in a single intensive care unit from 2001 to 2008 and managed under a cycling antibiotic protocol. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge. Categorical and continuous variables were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was performed.

Results

A total of 545 patients were treated for 1,046 GP infections (571 with vancomycin, 475 with linezolid) over 7 years. Patient demographics were similar between groups; however, the vancomycin group was associated with a longer treatment course (16.2 [0.5] days vs. 14.3 [0.5] days; p = 0.022). Unadjusted outcomes were similar between groups. Multivariable analysis revealed that Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score predicted an increase in creatinine levels greater than 1.0 following antibiotic therapy (relative risk [RR], 3.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22–7.42) and subsequent need for HD (RR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.23–7.62). In addition, initial creatinine level predicted an increase in creatinine levels greater than 1.0 following antibiotic therapy (RR, 4.36; 95% CI, 1.46–12.99) and subsequent need for HD (RR, 10.83; 95% CI, 3.19–36.77). Linezolid was found to be protective regarding rise in creatinine levels greater than 1.0 following antibiotic therapy; however, this was only experienced when vancomycin trough levels greater than 20 were encountered (RR, 5.4;95% CI, 1.19–24.51).

Conclusion

These data suggest that vancomycin is minimally nephrotoxic and has a similar nephrotoxic profile as compared with linezolid when appropriate dosing is used, even among critically ill patients with complex infections.

Vancomycin monitoring — Vancomycin blood levels should be measured regularly throughout the course of OPAT treatment (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). The optimal frequency of measurement is undefined, but the current practice in the setting of stable renal function is once weekly.

Background

Contemporary vancomycin dosing schemes are designed to achieve an area under the curve (AUC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio of ≥ 400. However, scant clinical data exist to support this target and available data relied on pharmacokinetic formulas based on daily vancomycin dose and estimated renal function (demographic pharmacokinetic model) to estimate AUCs.

Methods

A cohort study of hospitalized, adult, nondialysis patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections treated with vancomycin was performed to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between vancomycin exposure and outcomes. Bayesian techniques were used to estimate vancomycin exposure profile for day 1 and 2 of therapy for each patient based on their dosing schedule and collected concentrations. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to identify day 1 and 2 exposure thresholds associated with an increased risk of failure. Failure was defined as 30-day mortality, bacteremia was ≥ 7 days, or recurrence.

Results

During the study period, 123 cases met criteria. Failure was uniformly less pronounced (approximately 20% less in absolute value) in patients who achieved the CART-derived day 1 and 2 thresholds for AUC/MIC by broth microdilution and AUC/MIC by Etest. In the multivariate analyses, all risk ratios were approximately 0.5 for all CART-derived AUC/MIC exposure thresholds, indicating that achievement of CART-derived AUC/MIC exposure thresholds was associated with a 2-fold decrease in failure.

Conclusions

These findings establish the critical importance of daily AUC/MIC ratios during the first 2 days of therapy. As with all observational studies, these findings should be interpreted cautiously and validated in a multicenter randomized trial before adoption into practice.

Patients with Impaired Renal Function and Elderly Patients

Dosage adjustment must be made in patients with impaired renal function. In the elderly, greater dosage reductions than expected may be necessary because of decreased renal function. Measurement of vancomycin serum concentrations can be helpful in optimizing therapy, especially in seriously ill patients with changing renal function. Vancomycin serum concentrations can be determined by use of microbiologic assay, radioimmunoassay, fluorescence polarization immunoassay, fluorescence immunoassay, or high-pressure liquid chromatography. If creatinine clearance can be measured or estimated accurately, the dosage for most patients with renal impairment can be calculated using the following table. The dosage of vancomycin per day in mg is about 15 times the glomerular filtration rate in mL/min:

The initial dose should be no less than 15 mg/kg, even in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. The table is not valid for functionally anephric patients. For such patients, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight should be given to achieve prompt therapeutic serum concentrations. The dose required to maintain stable concentrations is 1.9 mg/kg/24 h. In patients with marked renal impairment, it may be more convenient to give maintenance doses of 250 to 1,000 mg once every several days rather than administering the drug on a daily basis. In anuria, a dose of 1,000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended.

When only the serum creatinine concentration is known, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to calculate creatinine clearance. Calculated creatinine clearances (mL/min) are only estimates. The creatinine clearance should be measured promptly.

Men: [Weight (kg) x (140-age in years)] / [72 x serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL)]

Women: 0.85 x above value

The serum creatinine must represent a steady state of renal function. Otherwise, the estimated value for creatinine clearance is not valid. Such a calculated clearance is an overestimate of actual clearance in patients with conditions: (1) characterized by decreasing renal function, such as shock, severe heart failure, or oliguria; (2) in which a normal relationship between muscle mass and total body weight is not present, such as obese patients or those with liver disease, edema, or ascites; and (3) accompanied by debilitation, malnutrition, or inactivity. The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administration by the intrathecal (intralumbar or intraventricular) route have not been established.

Intermittent infusion is the recommended method of administration.

### Clinical pharmacology of antibiotics [^1141TDaw]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial pharmacology and its effect on prescribing is quite complex. Selecting an antibiotic that will optimally treat an infection while minimizing adverse effects and the development of resistance is only the first step, as one must also consider the patient's individual pharmacokinetic alterations and the pharmacodynamic properties of the drug when prescribing it as well. Patients with CKD may have alterations in their protein binding, volumes of distribution, kidney clearance, and nonrenal clearance that necessitates antibiotic dose adjustments to prevent the development of toxicity. Knowledge of a drug's pharmacodynamics, defined as the relationship between drug exposure and antibacterial efficacy, provides some guidance regarding the optimal way to make dose adjustments. Different pharmacodynamic goals, such as maximizing the time that free (unbound) drug concentrations spend above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for time dependent drugs (e.g., β -lactams) or maximizing the free peak-to-MIC ratio for concentration-dependent antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides), require different adjustment strategies; for instance, decreasing the dose while maintaining normal dosing frequency or giving normal (or even larger) doses less frequently, respectively. Patients receiving hemodialysis have other important prescribing considerations as well. The nephrologist or patient may prefer to receive antibiotics that can be administered intravenously toward the end of a dialysis session. Additionally, newer dialysis technologies and filters can increase drug removal more than originally reported. This review will discuss the place in therapy, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and other pharmacologic considerations encountered when prescribing commonly used antibiotics in patients with chronic kidney disease or ESKD.

### Dosing and exposure of vancomycin with continuous infusion: a retrospective study [^114f1pcH]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin continuous infusion (CI) has suggested benefits over intermittent infusion: reduced nephrotoxicity, higher target attainment, and simpler therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Empiric dosing regimens range from 30–60mg/kg/day and it is unclear which regimen results in optimal exposure. This study evaluates whether a dosing regimen of 45mg/kg/day after a 20mg/kg loading dose for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50mL/min results in adequate exposure. We retrospectively analyzed plasma concentrations from patients treated with vancomycin CI as routine clinical care between February and October 2021. Patients under 18years old, with renal replacement therapy, reduced creatinine clearance (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration < 50mLmin/1.73m 2) or outpatient antibiotic therapy were excluded. Dose, renal function, and blood draw procedures were assessed for each measured vancomycin sample. Initially, 121 samples were included. Subsequently, 7 samples, 6 of which with concentrations ≥ 40mg/L, were verified to be incorrectly drawn and excluded. With doses of 40–50mg/kg/day concentrations ranged from 18.4–61.0mg/L. Only 25% were within the target window of 17–25mg/L and 15% were ≥ 40mg/L. Supratherapeutic concentrations were observed in 89% of samples from patients dosed 40–60mg/kg/day with eGFR 50–80mL/min. Concluding, an empiric dosing regimen of 45mg/kg results in too high vancomycin exposure and thus we recommend lower doses and differentiation according to renal function. Additionally, when measuring concentrations over 40mg/L incorrect sampling must be excluded before dose adjustment and the large variability in exposure between patients, warrants the need for swift TDM.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^111eRYXS]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

SIS guidelines on intra-abdominal infection — renal impairment dosing principles state that most antimicrobial agents do not require dosage adjustments until the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases below 60 mL/min, that the initial dosage of most antimicrobial agents should not be altered in patients with impaired renal function, and that subsequent dosing is typically adjusted according to eGFR; dosing adjustments can be expedited using therapeutic drug monitoring, for which commercial assays are commonly available for vancomycin and aminoglycosides, and therapeutic drug monitoring may be particularly valuable when GFR fluctuates during therapy.

2.3 Dosage in Pediatric Patients (1 Month and Older) with Normal Renal Function

Use this formulation of Vancomycin Injection only in pediatric patients (1 month and older) who require the entire dose (500 mg, 750 mg, 1 g, 1.25 g, 1.5 g, 1.75 g or 2 g) of this single-dose flexible bag and not any fraction of it [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)].

The usual intravenous dosage of vancomycin is 10 mg/kg per dose given every 6 hours. Each dose should be administered over a period of at least 60 minutes. Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be warranted in these patients.

2.4 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Dosage adjustment must be made in patients with renal impairment. The initial dose should be no less than 15 mg/kg in patients with any degree of renal impairment.

In the elderly, greater dosage reductions than expected may be necessary because of decreased renal function. Measure trough vancomycin serum concentrations to guide therapy, especially in seriously ill patients with changing renal function.

For functionally anephric patients, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight should be given to achieve prompt therapeutic serum concentration. A dose of 1.9 mg/kg/24 h should be given after the initial dose of 15 mg/kg.

RISK FACTORS

Numerous risk factors have been defined for developing VANT or AKI in patients receiving vancomycin (Table 4). Various measures of vancomycin exposure have been studied, including use of a loading dose, maximal dose, duration of therapy, method of administration (intermittent vs. continuous infusion), AUC, and trough level. Other risk factors include demographic features, associated medical conditions, severity of illness, preexisting kidney disease, and concurrent nephrotoxins.
