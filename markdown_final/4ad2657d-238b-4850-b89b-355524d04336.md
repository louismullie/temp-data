## Question

beta blocker use with anesthesia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about perioperative beta-blocker management in patients undergoing anesthesia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of continuation versus initiation. Then, I should verify the evidence and guideline stance on continuing chronic beta-blockers. Next, I will examine when and how to initiate new beta-blockade, including timing, agent selection, and titration. After that, I need to assess absolute and relative contraindications. I will then review intraoperative and postoperative monitoring and titration targets. Finally, I should consider special populations, summarize the risk–benefit balance, and close with a practical checklist and synthesis that aligns with contemporary guidelines and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: in patients already on beta-blockers, continuation through the perioperative period is strongly recommended, whereas routine initiation on the day of surgery is harmful and should be avoided. This is consistently endorsed by the 2024 ACC/AHA/ACS guideline, the 2022 ESC guideline, and the 2017 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidance, and it is reinforced by the POISE trial showing increased mortality and stroke with high-dose, untitrated metoprolol started immediately preoperatively [^112VKHCx] [^117BoPDs] [^117KeVD1] [^111ag74m].

> I will now examine the evidence for continuation in chronic users. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without checking the magnitude of harm from withdrawal. Observational data show that perioperative beta-blocker discontinuation is associated with a markedly increased risk of myocardial infarction and mortality, with relative risks of MI around 2.7 and dramatic increases in mortality when stopped, which supports a Class I recommendation to continue therapy unless there is a compelling contraindication; this is echoed by the 2009 ACCF/AHA focused update and contemporary perioperative guidance [^111t2hR2] [^111v6X9L] [^112VKHCx].

> Next, I should review when to initiate new beta-blockade. Wait, let me verify the timing because this is where harm often occurs. The 2024 ACC/AHA/ACS guideline advises that if beta-blockers are to be started for a new indication, they should be initiated at least 7 days before surgery to allow assessment of tolerability and titration; starting on the day of surgery increases postoperative mortality and is designated a Harm recommendation, a position reinforced by POISE and subsequent analyses showing increased stroke and death with immediate preoperative dosing [^1139jopP] [^112VKHCx] [^111q155Q].

> I need to ensure the initiation strategy is precise. Let me think about agent selection and titration targets. Prefer beta-1 selective agents such as bisoprolol or atenolol, start low, and titrate preoperatively to a resting heart rate around 60–80 bpm while avoiding hypotension. This approach is supported by guideline methodology and by observations that longer preoperative lead-in with selective agents may be safer than short-acting metoprolol started acutely, which is more often associated with hypotension and stroke in perioperative cohorts [^113nvXgt] [^115sjwx8] [^111q155Q].

> Hold on, I should verify contraindications and cautions. I need to check both absolute and relative issues. Absolute contraindications include severe bradycardia, high-grade AV block without a pacemaker, and decompensated heart failure; relative cautions include reactive airway disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes where beta-blockers may blunt hypoglycemia symptoms; in compensated heart failure, beta-blockers may be continued if already part of GDMT, but initiation perioperatively requires great caution and careful hemodynamic monitoring [^11194Emn] [^111i95W9].

> Let me consider intraoperative and postoperative management. I should double-check hemodynamic targets and monitoring. Maintain beta-blockade if tolerated, titrate to keep heart rate roughly 60–80 bpm in the absence of hypotension, and be vigilant for bradycardia and hypotension, which are more frequent with perioperative beta-blockade and may necessitate dose reduction or temporary holding; the POISE protocol operationalized holding rules for HR < 45 bpm or SBP < 100 mm Hg, which provides a practical template for safety thresholds during the immediate perioperative window [^113nvXgt] [^111iPnpL].

> But wait, what about special populations? I need to ensure I tailor recommendations. In vascular surgery patients, continuation is advised if already on therapy, and initiation may be considered in high-risk patients with CAD or multiple risk factors, ideally started well in advance and titrated. In cardiac surgery, continuation reduces postoperative atrial fibrillation and arrhythmias, though the Society of Thoracic Surgeons is re-evaluating preoperative beta-blockade as a quality metric. In patients with diabetes, monitor closely for masked hypoglycemia. In frail or elderly patients, anticipate greater hypotension sensitivity and adjust dosing accordingly [^113xSem3] [^113uCFVF] [^111i95W9] [^111SQ4Ln].

> I should confirm the overall risk–benefit balance. Let me reconsider the net clinical effect. In noncardiac surgery, beta-blockers reduce myocardial infarction and ischemia but increase bradycardia, hypotension, stroke, and possibly mortality when started acutely without titration. Excluding the discredited DECREASE trials, meta-analyses show reduced MI offset by increased mortality and stroke, reinforcing the message to continue chronic therapy, avoid day-of-surgery starts, and reserve new initiation for carefully selected, high-risk patients with adequate lead-in and monitoring [^115WUNjh] [^114UZyTY] [^111ag74m].

> Next, I should review a practical perioperative checklist. Let me verify each element against guidelines. Preoperatively, document chronic beta-blocker use and indication, continue the dose with last dose as scheduled, avoid new starts within 7 days of surgery, and if initiation is planned, start early with a beta-1 selective agent and titrate to HR 60–80 bpm; intraoperatively, monitor for bradycardia and hypotension and be prepared to treat; postoperatively, resume oral therapy as soon as feasible, titrate to HR targets, and continue through discharge if clinically indicated, with explicit plans to avoid abrupt withdrawal [^112VKHCx] [^113nvXgt] [^111t2hR2].

> Finally, I need to synthesize a clear recommendation. Hold on, I should verify alignment with the highest-quality sources. For patients already on beta-blockers, continue perioperatively unless contraindicated. For beta-blocker–naive patients, do not start on the day of surgery. If beta-blockade is indicated, initiate at least 7 days preoperatively, prefer beta-1 selective agents, start low, titrate to heart rate, and monitor closely for hypotension and bradycardia. This approach balances the reduction in myocardial ischemia against the risks of stroke and mortality seen with untitrated, immediate preoperative regimens [^112VKHCx] [^117BoPDs] [^111ag74m].

Perioperative beta-blockers should be **continued in patients already on therapy** [^111v6X9L] to reduce the risk of rebound hypertension, ischemia, and arrhythmias [^111MS5BL] [^1143A7Nr]; abrupt withdrawal is harmful [^112VKHCx]. For beta-blocker–naive patients, **do not start on the day of surgery** [^112sPC5s] because it increases hypotension, bradycardia, stroke, and mortality [^111ag74m] [^111q155Q]; if indicated, start ≥ 7 days preoperatively [^1139jopP] and titrate to heart rate 60–80 bpm [^113nvXgt]. Intraoperatively, monitor for hypotension and bradycardia [^111iPnpL], and treat with vagolytics, vasopressors, or beta-agonists as needed [^notfound]. Postoperatively, continue and titrate to hemodynamic targets, tapering slowly before discharge to avoid withdrawal [^111SQ4Ln].

## Indications for perioperative beta-blocker use

Beta-blockers are indicated perioperatively for patients with **established cardiovascular indications** [^111v6X9L]:

- **Coronary artery disease (CAD)**: Reduces perioperative ischemia and infarction [^116LdDRs] [^114UZyTY].

- **Heart failure**: Improves outcomes in compensated HF [^114p7pwA].

- **Arrhythmias**: Controls tachyarrhythmias and reduces postoperative atrial fibrillation [^116WU4oj].

- **Hypertension**: Part of chronic antihypertensive therapy [^111w9mV1].

---

## Risks associated with perioperative beta-blocker use

Perioperative beta-blockers carry risks, particularly when **started acutely** [^112VKHCx]:

- **Hypotension and bradycardia**: Increased risk, especially with high-dose or untitrated regimens [^112sPC5s] [^114FcPaT].

- **Stroke**: Higher incidence with perioperative initiation, notably in POISE [^111q155Q] [^111B9qdY].

- **Mortality**: Possible increase with acute perioperative initiation in low-risk patients [^11339W1p] [^114W4Y5z].

## Guidelines for perioperative beta-blocker management

Current guidelines provide clear recommendations for perioperative beta-blocker management:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Patients already on beta-blockers | Continue perioperatively | Class I, Level B-NR [^1139jopP] [^117BoPDs] |
| Beta-blocker-naive patients | Do not start on day of surgery | Class III Harm, Level B-R [^112sPC5s] [^1139jopP] |
| High-risk patients (CAD, multiple risk factors) | Consider starting ≥ 7 days preoperatively, titrate to HR 60–80 bpm | Class IIb, Level B-NR [^1139jopP] [^113nvXgt] |
| Low-risk patients | Routine initiation not recommended | Class III, Level B [^112sPC5s] [^114C5fbB] |

## Clinical outcomes associated with perioperative beta-blocker use

Perioperative beta-blockers have mixed effects on outcomes: **benefits** include reduced myocardial ischemia and infarction in high-risk patients [^113nvXgt] and fewer postoperative atrial fibrillation episodes [^116WU4oj], whereas **harms** include more hypotension and bradycardia [^114FcPaT], a higher stroke risk with acute initiation [^111q155Q], and possible increased mortality in low-risk patients [^11339W1p].

## Practical recommendations for anesthesia providers

Anesthesia providers should adhere to the following practical recommendations:

- **Continue chronic beta-blockers**: Maintain through the perioperative period unless contraindicated [^111v6X9L] [^117BoPDs].

- **Avoid acute initiation**: Do not start beta-blockers on the day of surgery [^112sPC5s] [^1139jopP].

- **Titrate to heart rate**: Target 60–80 bpm preoperatively if initiating therapy [^111SQ4Ln].

- **Monitor hemodynamics**: Vigilant intraoperative monitoring for hypotension and bradycardia [^111iPnpL].

- **Treat complications**: Use vagolytics, vasopressors, or beta-agonists as indicated [^1143A7Nr].

- **Taper gradually**: Avoid abrupt withdrawal postoperatively to prevent rebound hypertension and ischemia [^111SQ4Ln] [^112VKHCx].

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations require **special consideration**:

- **Heart failure**: Use cautiously, titrate slowly, and monitor for decompensation [^11194Emn].

- **Diabetes**: Be aware of masked hypoglycemia symptoms [^111i95W9].

- **Bronchospastic disease**: Use beta-1 selective agents cautiously [^11194Emn].

---

Perioperative beta-blockers should be **continued in patients already on therapy** [^111v6X9L], while **avoiding acute initiation on the day of surgery** [^111ag74m]. If initiation is indicated, start ≥ 7 days preoperatively [^1139jopP] and titrate to heart rate 60–80 bpm [^113nvXgt]. Monitor for hypotension and bradycardia [^111iPnpL], and taper gradually postoperatively to avoid withdrawal [^111SQ4Ln].

Unlabelled

A lack of awareness of the "best" current practice is frequently cited as a major barrier to the practice of evidence-based medicine. The purpose of this study was to survey Canadian anesthesiologists to determine their knowledge and practices associated with prophylactic perioperative beta blockade, a therapy that has been widely discussed in the literature and has the potential for a significant positive impact on patient outcomes. We sent questionnaires to 1234 members of the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society. The overall response rate was 54%. Ninety-five percent of respondents were aware of the perioperative beta blocker literature, and of these, 93% agreed that beta blockers were beneficial in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD). Fifty-seven percent reported always or usually administering prophylactic beta blockers in patients with known CAD, and 34% of these regular users continued therapy beyond the early postoperative period. Only 9% of respondents reported that a formal protocol existed at their facility. This study suggests that barriers to the translation of research to practice were not related to a lack of awareness of the current best evidence. With respect to perioperative beta blockers, controversies within the literature as well as practical considerations may be greater barriers to implementation of best evidence.

Implications

This survey found that anesthesiologists were aware of and supported the use of prophylactic perioperative beta blockers in patients with risk factors or known coronary artery disease; however, only 57% frequently prescribed perioperative beta blockers. A lack of awareness of the current "best" evidence was not a barrier to use.

### Bisoprolol fumarate (bisoprolol) [^11194Emn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and beta-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In general, beta-blocking agents should be avoided in patients with overt congestive failure. However, in some patients with compensated cardiac failure it may be necessary to utilize them. In such a situation, they must be used cautiously.

In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure

Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blockers can, in some patients, precipitate cardiac failure. At the first signs or symptoms of heart failure, discontinuation of bisoprolol fumarate tablets should be considered. In some cases, beta-blocker therapy can be continued while heart failure is treated with other drugs.

Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Exacerbation of angina pectoris, and, in some instances, myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia, have been observed in patients with coronary artery disease following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta-blockers. Such patients should, therefore, be cautioned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Even in patients without overt coronary artery disease, it may be advisable to taper therapy with bisoprolol fumarate tablets over approximately one week with the patient under careful observation. If withdrawal symptoms occur, bisoprolol fumarate tablets therapy should be reinstituted, at least temporarily.

Peripheral Vascular Disease

Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in such individuals.

Bronchospastic Disease

PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASE SHOULD, IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Because of its relative beta -selectivity, however, bisoprolol may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or who cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment. Since beta -selectivity is not absolute, the lowest possible dose of bisoprolol fumarate tablets should be used, with therapy starting at 2.5 mg. A beta agonist (bronchodilator) should be made available.

Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy — recommendations and risk factors: Preoperative beta-blocker therapy should be considered in the context of a full evaluation of each patient's clinical and surgical risk, including identification of active cardiac conditions that require intensive management and may result in delay or cancellation of surgery unless the surgery is emergent. Clinical risk factors used in current recommendations are unchanged from the prior document and include history of ischemic heart disease, history of compensated or prior heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal insufficiency defined as a preoperative serum creatinine of more than 2 mg/dL. The surgery-specific cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery remains relevant, but limited data are available to guide beta-blocker use with newer techniques (e.g., percutaneous or endovascular vascular procedures) that may be associated with lower short-term risk. The prior document outlined conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of beta blockers in reducing perioperative cardiac events, and the best approach to medically reduce cardiovascular complications during noncardiac surgery was still unknown. The authors advocated for randomized controlled trials because there may be some harm associated with beta-blocker therapy in low-risk patients, and they noted key literature gaps: most trials were inadequately powered; few randomized trials of medical therapy to prevent perioperative major adverse cardiac events had been performed; few trials examined perioperative beta-blocker therapy, particularly in high-risk patients; studies to determine the role of beta blockers in intermediate- and low-risk populations and the optimal type, dose, timing, duration, and titration were lacking; and no studies addressed care-delivery mechanisms for how, when, and by whom therapy should be prescribed and monitored.

### 2009 ACCF / AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade [^117Bh271]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy in noncardiac surgery has been tested in randomized trials: one trial randomized 219 patients to bisoprolol or placebo with the composite outcome "not significantly different over the 1-year follow-up period", and another used metoprolol 50 mg twice a day until 7 days after surgery, found "no difference in cardiovascular events", and may have been underpowered (n = 103). A MEDLINE review reported 5 studies and calculated numbers needed to treat (NNT) of 2.5 to 6.7 for improvement in measures of myocardial ischemia and 3.2 to 8.3 for studies reporting impact on cardiac or all-cause mortality. A systematic review of 11 trials limited to the 30-day perioperative period reported NNT to prevent perioperative ischemia of 8 subjects, NNT to prevent myocardial infarction (MI) of 23, and that 328 patients had to be treated to prevent cardiac death. In contrast, a 2005 review discussed 22 studies randomizing 2437 patients and found no statistically significant benefit for individual outcomes but a "nominally" statistically significant composite effect (RR 0.44, 99% confidence interval [CI] 0.16 to 1.24). Another meta-analysis of 6 randomized trials reported reductions in perioperative myocardial ischemia (from 33% to 15%) and long-term cardiac mortality (from 12% to 2%); for perioperative overall mortality, the OR for beta-blocker therapy was 0.52 (95% CI 0.20 to 1.35), and for perioperative cardiac mortality, the OR was 0.25 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.87).

Beta-blockade

It has been hypothesized that beta-blockers, by decreasing the effect of surgical stress on the heart, can reduce complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiac arrhythmias. The most recent meta-analysis of 83 RCTs, including an international multicentre trial in which a potential harmful effect (increased mortality and risk of stroke) was detected for preoperative use of metoprolol, also reported low-certainty evidence for a reduction in atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction after beta-blocker usage in non-cardiac surgery. Bradycardia and hypotension were both increased with low- and moderate-certainty level evidence, respectively. The evidence for early all-cause mortality was uncertain. Subsequent cohort studies assessing the continuous use of beta-blockers in gastrointestinal cancer surgery reported decreased risk of postoperative cardiovascular complications, anastomotic leakage and sepsis and reduced mortality rates at 90-days and 1-year after surgery. Only one retrospective study assessed the association between preoperative beta-blocker therapy and postoperative outcome for patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB. There was no evidence for a beneficial effect on moderate- and long-term survival and postoperative complications. At present, it is not recommended to routinely use perioperative beta-blockers in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. However, patients at high risk of cardiovascular events who are already on beta-blockade can safely continue this treatment through the perioperative process.

Preoperative fasting

Previous studies have demonstrated no differences in residual gastric fluid volume (RGFV), pH or gastric emptying rates following an intake of semi-solid meals or drinks in patients with obesity when compared to patients with normal weight. No differences were found in RGFV and pH in a RCT of patients with severe obesity who drank 300 mL of clear fluid 2 h before induction of anaesthesia, compared with those who fasted after midnight. RGFV and pH were also similar following an overnight fast in patients with obesity and diabetes (with and without autonomic neuropathy) compared with controls without diabetes.

While the level of evidence remains low, preoperative fasting for solids (equivalent to a light meal) of at least 6 h and clear fluids of 2 h before induction of anaesthesia is recommended, if there are no contraindications (Table 2).

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA perioperative beta-blocker therapy — directive statements and cautions: Beta blockers are probably recommended for patients in whom preoperative assessment identifies coronary heart disease or high cardiac risk as defined by the presence of multiple clinical risk factors and who are undergoing intermediate- or high-risk procedures as defined in these guidelines (Level of Evidence: B). Beta blockers may be considered for patients who are undergoing intermediate- or high-risk procedures as defined in these guidelines, including vascular surgery, in whom preoperative assessment identifies intermediate cardiac risk as defined by the presence of a single clinical risk factor (Level of Evidence: C). Beta blockers may be considered in patients undergoing vascular surgery with low cardiac risk (as defined in these guidelines) who are not currently on beta blockers (Level of Evidence: C). Beta blockers should not be given to patients undergoing surgery who have absolute contraindications to beta blockade (Level of Evidence: C). High cardiac risk includes patients with major and intermediate clinical predictors, and care should be taken in applying recommendations on beta-blocker therapy to patients with decompensated heart failure, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, high-degree AV block, or severe valvular heart disease in the absence of coronary heart disease.

### Predictors of hypotension during anesthesia induction in patients with hypertension on medication: a retrospective observational study [^112cPTXu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Continuation of beta blocker use in the preoperative period has been found to reduce the risk of postoperative cardiovascular complications. Therefore, in accordance with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, all patients who regularly used beta blockers in this study continued to receive them in the preoperative period. Consequently, regular use of beta blockers was found to predict hypotension during anesthesia induction in patients with hypertension on medication. A previous report also found that perioperative administration of beta blockers caused intraoperative hypotension. A recent study has recommended that decisions regarding the preoperative withdrawal or continuation of beta blockers should be made based on the revised cardiac risk index score and that these decisions should be made in consultation with the attending physician. When the administration of beta blockers is continued preoperatively, it is necessary to monitor the patient for hypotension during anesthesia induction.

We found that regular use of CCBs may reduce the risk of hypotension during anesthesia induction in patients with hypertension on medication. The Japanese Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of hypertension recommends CCBs, ARBs/ACE-Is, or low-dose diuretics as the first-line drugs in the treatment of hypertension in patients without compelling indications. If the antihypertensive effect is insufficient, concomitant use of a different class of antihypertensive drug at a low dose is recommended. The most commonly used drugs by patients receiving monotherapy in this study were CCBs. Patients receiving monotherapy as drug therapy for hypertension reportedly have a lower risk of intraoperative hypotension than that of patients receiving multiple therapies. However, since we did not include whether patients were receiving monotherapy or multiple therapies as an explanatory variable in the multivariate logistic regression analysis of this study, it is difficult to demonstrate how the large proportion of CCBs users among patients receiving monotherapy affected our finding that regular use of CCBs may be a suppressive factor of hypotension during anesthesia induction. All the CCBs used by the patients in this study were dihydropyridines. Previous studies, including a meta-analysis of perioperative CCB use, have found no relationship between regular use of CCBs and hypotension during anesthesia induction. However, this result might have been due to the use of diltiazem, and the relationship between intraoperative hypotension and dihydropyridines, which are widely used to treat hypertension, is largely unknown. It is difficult to explain why regular use of dihydropyridines may be a suppressive factor for hypotension during anesthesia induction in patients with hypertension on medication based on the results of this study alone. Future studies of the relationship between dihydropyridines and intraoperative hypotension are required.

### 2009 ACCF / AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade [^11339W1p]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy — observational and review evidence indicates risk-dependent effects and agent differences: A systematic review of randomized trials concluded that beta blockers reduced perioperative arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia but were unable to show an effect on mortality or perioperative myocardial infarction. In a U.S. administrative cohort of more than 600 000 noncardiac surgical patients at 329 hospitals, patients with a Revised Cardiac Risk Index score of 3 or more who received beta blockers were significantly less likely to die in the hospital, whereas this was not true for scores of 2, 1, or 0 and those with a risk index of 0 were more likely to die if given a beta blocker on hospital day 1 or 2. In an Ontario cohort of older adults prescribed atenolol or short-acting metoprolol, 37 151 subjects were identified and 1038 had perioperative events; the rate of myocardial infarction or death was 2.5% versus 3.2% (p < 0.001) favoring atenolol, and inclusion of other long-acting beta blockers yielded an identical risk reduction, with authors noting that these data suggest long-acting beta blockade (when therapy is initiated before surgery) might be superior to short-acting beta blockade but that clinical trial evaluation is awaited.

Perioperative beta blockade — summary recommendations specify that there is "a Class I indication for perioperative beta-blocker use" for continuation in patients already taking a beta blocker; "several Class IIa recommendations exist" for patients with inducible ischemia, coronary artery disease, or multiple clinical risk factors undergoing vascular (high-risk) surgery and for those with coronary artery disease or multiple clinical risk factors undergoing intermediate-risk surgery. "Initiation of therapy, particularly in lower-risk groups, requires careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio for an individual patient", and "Intensive dose titration well before a planned procedure with careful titration perioperatively to achieve adequate heart rate control while avoiding frank bradycardia or hypotension is also suggested". "In light of the POISE results, routine administration of perioperative beta blockers, particularly in higher fixed-dose regimens begun on the day of surgery, cannot be advocated".

Perioperative beta-blocker continuation and withdrawal — observational outcomes show that selective discontinuation increased myocardial infarction (MI) risk in the first 30 days (relative risk [RR] 2.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 6.89) and between 30 and 180 days (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.07 to 5.59); in a retrospective cohort of 140 preoperative beta-blocked patients, postoperative discontinuation in 8 patients was associated with 50% mortality versus 1.5% when continued (odds ratio [OR] 65.0; p < 0.001); and in 711 peripheral vascular surgery patients, continuous use was associated with lower 1-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.7), whereas withdrawal increased 1-year mortality (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.9). The guideline notes that "perioperative beta-blocker withdrawal should be avoided unless necessary", and that continuation in the perioperative period "is a Class I indication", with titration to maintain heart rate control while avoiding frank hypotension and bradycardia as the goal.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy — trial and cohort design features describe dosing, timing, and populations. A randomized trial compared metoprolol 50 mg twice per day with placebo from admission until 7 days postoperatively, initiated the day before vascular surgery, and found no difference in cardiovascular events; the study may have been underpowered (n = 103). Observational data from Lindenauer et al. reviewed records of over 700,000 noncardiac surgical patients across 329 hospitals and compared those receiving beta blockers within the first 2 days of hospitalization with those who did not in the first 2 hospital days using propensity score matching.

### Perioperative β-blockers for preventing surgery-related mortality and morbidity [^116LdDRs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of beta-blockers to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus routine prescription of these drugs in unselected patients remains a controversial issue.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to systematically analyse the effects of perioperatively administered beta-blockers for prevention of surgery-related mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing any type of surgery while under general anaesthesia.

Search Methods

We identified trials by searching the following databases from the date of their inception until June 2013: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Biosis Previews, CAB Abstracts, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Derwent Drug File, Science Citation Index Expanded, Life Sciences Collection, Global Health and PASCAL. In addition, we searched online resources to identify grey literature.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials if participants were randomly assigned to a beta-blocker group or a control group (standard care or placebo). Surgery (any type) had to be performed with all or at least a significant proportion of participants under general anaesthesia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from all studies. In cases of disagreement, we reassessed the respective studies to reach consensus. We computed summary estimates in the absence of significant clinical heterogeneity. Risk ratios (RRs) were used for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) were used for continuous outcomes. We performed subgroup analyses for various potential effect modifiers.

Main Results

We included 89 randomized controlled trials with 19,211 participants. Six studies (7%) met the highest methodological quality criteria (studies with overall low risk of bias: adequate sequence generation, adequate allocation concealment, double/triple-blinded design with a placebo group, intention-to-treat analysis), whereas in the remaining trials, some form of bias was present or could not be definitively excluded (studies with overall unclear or high risk of bias). Outcomes were evaluated separately for cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. CARDIAC SURGERY (53 trials)We found no clear evidence of an effect of beta-blockers on the following outcomes.• All-cause mortality: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.52, 3783 participants, moderate quality of evidence.• Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.51, 3553 participants, moderate quality of evidence.• Myocardial ischaemia: RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.05, 166 participants, low quality of evidence.• Cerebrovascular events: RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.58 to 4.02, 1400 participants, low quality of evidence.• Hypotension: RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.51, 558 participants, low quality of evidence.• Bradycardia: RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.66, 660 participants, low quality of evidence.• Congestive heart failure: RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.34, 311 participants, low quality of evidence. Beta-blockers significantly reduced the occurrence of the following endpoints.• Ventricular arrhythmias: RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.58, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 29, 2292 participants, moderate quality of evidence.• Supraventricular arrhythmias: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.53, NNTB six, 6420 participants, high quality of evidence.• On average, beta-blockers reduced length of hospital stay by 0.54 days (95% CI -0.90 to -0.19, 2450 participants, low quality of evidence). NON-CARDIAC SURGERY (36 trials)We found a potential increase in the occurrence of the following outcomes with the use of beta-blockers.• All-cause mortality: RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54, 11,463 participants, low quality of evidence. Whereas no clear evidence of an effect was noted when all studies were analysed, restricting the meta-analysis to low risk of bias studies revealed a significant increase in all-cause mortality with the use of beta-blockers: RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.59, number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 189, 10,845 participants.• Cerebrovascular events: RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.71, 9150 participants, low quality of evidence. Whereas no clear evidence of an effect was found when all studies were analysed, restricting the meta-analysis to low risk of bias studies revealed a significant increase in cerebrovascular events with the use of beta-blockers: RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.82, NNTH 255, 8648 participants. Beta-blockers significantly reduced the occurrence of the following endpoints.• AMI: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87, NNTB 72, 10,958 participants, high quality of evidence.• Myocardial ischaemia: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.70, NNTB seven, 1028 participants, moderate quality of evidence.• Supraventricular arrhythmias: RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.92, NNTB 111, 8794 participants, high quality of evidence. Beta-blockers significantly increased the occurrence of the following adverse events.• Hypotension: RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.64, NNTH 15, 10,947 participants, high quality of evidence.• Bradycardia: RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.35, NNTH 18, 11,083 participants, moderate quality of evidence. We found no clear evidence of an effect of beta-blockers on the following outcomes.• Ventricular arrhythmias: RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.33, 526 participants, moderate quality of evidence.• Congestive heart failure: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.47, 9223 participants, moderate quality of evidence.• Length of hospital stay: mean difference -0.27 days, 95% CI -1.29 to 0.75, 601 participants, low quality of evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

According to our findings, perioperative application of beta-blockers still plays a pivotal role in cardiac surgery, as they can substantially reduce the high burden of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in the aftermath of surgery. Their influence on mortality, AMI, stroke, congestive heart failure, hypotension and bradycardia in this setting remains unclear. In non-cardiac surgery, evidence from low risk of bias trials shows an increase in all-cause mortality and stroke with the use of beta-blockers. As the quality of evidence is still low to moderate, more evidence is needed before a definitive conclusion can be drawn. The substantial reduction in supraventricular arrhythmias and AMI in this setting seems to be offset by the potential increase in mortality and stroke.

Beta-blocker therapy

The recommendations regarding perioperative use of beta-blockers are simple and straightforward. If the patient is currently taking a beta-blocker (chronic therapy), they should continue taking their beta-blockers. However, despite the cardioprotective effects of beta-blockade, initiation of beta-blocker therapy in the immediate preoperative period has been associated with significant postoperative morbidity/mortality. More specifically, Wijeysundera and colleagues showed that perioperative beta-blockade started within 1 day or less before non-cardiac surgery prevents non-fatal MI but increases risks of stroke, death, hypotension and bradycardia. Additionally, Beattie et al demonstrated in 2010 that in the setting of anemia, beta-blockade significantly increases the risk of major adverse cardiac effects and mortality thereby emphasizing the importance of giving consideration to increasing the threshold of (intraoperative) blood transfusion in patient on beta-blocker therapy.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the data available at the time this study was conducted did not provide sufficient evidence to support that continuing ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery in patients who chronically received these drugs is associated with obvious disadvantages. No significant incidences of severe or refractory hypotension or postoperative ischemia-related complications were observed between those patients continuing ACEIs/ARBs and those who either discontinued these drugs or continued using other antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, evidence supporting the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery is lacking. However, anesthetists should be cautious about the possibility of hypotension in patients chronically receiving ACEIs/ARBs, and should know how to treat it effectively. To explore the long-term effects of continuing or discontinuing ACEIs/ARBs in patients, RCTs involving a large number of patients are required.

POISE trial — extended-release metoprolol succinate protocol and eligibility are summarized as follows: Patients undergoing noncardiac surgery were randomly assigned to extended-release metoprolol succinate or placebo starting 2 to 4 hours before surgery and continued for 30 days, with a primary end point of a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest, and eligibility included an expected hospital stay of at least 24 hours with specified cardiovascular risk criteria. The first dose was 100 mg given 2 to 4 hours preoperatively; drug administration required a heart rate of 50 bpm or higher and a systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or greater; and if during the first 6 postoperative hours heart rate was 80 bpm or more and systolic blood pressure was 100 mm Hg or higher the first postoperative 100 mg dose was given orally, otherwise it was given at 6 hours after surgery. Twelve hours after the first postoperative dose, patients took extended-release metoprolol 200 mg or placebo every day for 30 days; if heart rate was consistently below 45 bpm or systolic blood pressure dropped below 100 mm Hg the study drug was withheld and then restarted at 100 mg once daily, and if heart rate was consistently 45 to 49 bpm with systolic blood pressure exceeded 100 mm Hg the study drug was delayed for 12 hours. Patients unable to take oral medications received intravenous infusion options of a slow infusion of 15 mg over 60 minutes or a rapid infusion of 5 mg over 2 minutes every 5 minutes up to a total of 15 mg, and the final analysis included 8351 patients from 190 hospitals in 23 countries.

### Perioperative cardiovascular medication management in noncardiac surgery: common questions [^115BFqTD]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Several medications have been used perioperatively in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery in an attempt to improve outcomes. Antiplatelet therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular events should generally be discontinued seven to 10 days before surgery to avoid increasing the risk of bleeding, unless the risk of a major adverse cardiac event exceeds the risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention should be continued perioperatively, except before procedures with very high bleeding risk, such as intracranial procedures. Antiplatelet drugs should be continued and surgery delayed, if possible, for at least 14 days after percutaneous coronary intervention without stent placement, 30 days after percutaneous coronary intervention with bare-metal stent placement, and six to 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent placement. Perioperative beta blockers are recommended for patients already receiving these agents, and it is reasonable to consider starting therapy in patients with known or strongly suspected coronary artery disease or who are at high risk of perioperative cardiac events and are undergoing procedures with a high risk of cardiovascular complications. Long-term statin therapy should be continued perioperatively or started in patients with clinical indications who are not already receiving statins. Clonidine should not be started perioperatively, but long-term clonidine regimens may be continued. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers generally can be continued perioperatively if patients are hemodynamically stable and have good renal function and normal electrolyte levels.

### Β-blockers and reduction of cardiac events in noncardiac surgery: scientific review [^114J3dnk]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Recent studies suggest that perioperatively administered beta-blockers may reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events in patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery.

Objective

To review the efficacy of perioperative beta-blockade in reducing myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and cardiac or all-cause mortality from randomized trials.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE and conventional search of English-language articles published since 1980 was performed to gather information related to perioperative cardiac complications and beta-blockade. Reference lists from all relevant articles and published recommendations for perioperative cardiac risk management were reviewed to identify additional studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective randomized studies (6) were included in the analysis if they discussed the impact of beta-blockade on perioperative cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, and mortality for patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery. Articles were examined for elements of trial design, treatment protocols, important biases, and major findings. These elements were then qualitatively compared.

Data Synthesis

We identified 5 randomized controlled trials: 4 assessed myocardial ischemia and 3 reported myocardial infarction, cardiac, or all-cause mortality. All studies sought to achieve beta-blockade before the induction of anesthesia by titrating doses to a target heart rate. Of studies reporting myocardial ischemia, numbers needed to treat were modest (2.5–6.7). Similarly modest numbers needed to treat were observed in studies reporting a significant impact on cardiac or all-cause mortality (3.2–8.3). The most marked effects were seen in patients at high risk; the sole study reporting a nonsignificant result enrolled patients with low baseline risk. As a group, studies of perioperative beta-blockade have enrolled relatively few carefully selected patients. In addition, differences in treatment protocols leave questions unanswered regarding optimal duration of therapy.

Conclusions

Despite heterogeneity of trials, a growing literature suggests a benefit of beta-blockade in preventing perioperative cardiac morbidity. Evidence from these trials can be used to formulate an effective clinical approach while definitive trials are awaited.

POBBLE administered oral metoprolol 25–50 mg twice daily starting 1 d preoperatively (minimum of 2 preoperative doses) with continuation for 7 d after surgery, plus intraoperative IV metoprolol 2–4 mg. DIPOM used oral metoprolol 50–100 mg 1 d before surgery, continued once daily for up to 8 d after surgery, and reported median 18 mo follow-up (range 6–30 mo). Lai et al. dosed IV metoprolol 0.06-mg/kg boluses immediately prior to surgery, then oral metoprolol 25 mg 3 times daily for 3 d after surgery. MaVS administered oral metoprolol 25–100 mg 2 h prior to surgery and continued twice daily for up to 5 d after surgery. Neary et al. started IV atenolol 1.25 mg with surgery, repeated every 30 min up to 5 mg, then oral atenolol 50 mg once daily for 7 d after surgery. BBSA studied oral bisoprolol 5–10 mg 3 h before surgery, continued once daily for up to 10 d after surgery. POISE-1 used oral metoprolol 100 mg within 2–4 h preoperatively, followed by oral metoprolol 100–200 mg once daily for 30 d after surgery.

Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Influence of the DECREASE trials — timing and agent selection for perioperative beta blockade — indicates that outside DECREASE, all RCTs initiated beta blockade no more than 1 day prior to surgery, while cohorts suggest shorter preoperative duration (≤ 7 days) is linked to worse outcomes than longer duration. After excluding DECREASE, only 4 included RCTs assessed oral beta blockers other than metoprolol, and cohorts have found metoprolol to be associated with worse outcomes than those seen with more beta-1 selective agents, such as atenolol or bisoprolol. The authors state that the strength of evidence that a longer duration of preoperative therapy with selective oral beta blockers safely reduces the risk of perioperative MI is entirely dependent on the DECREASE trials and propose future trials started at least several days prior to surgery, preferably with more beta-1 selective agents.

### Perioperative beta blockers… [^116uEaoX]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: Patients undergoing elective surgery with varying degrees of cardiovascular risk Efficacy End Points: Rate of nonfatal myocardial infarctions; rate of nonfatal strokes; cardiovascular mortality; all-cause mortality Harm End Points: Hypotension; bradycardia. Narrative: Perioperative cardiac complications are a concern in patients undergoing surgery. Beta blockers were proposed as a means of reducing cardiac stress during the perioperative period. Early studies showed the use of beta blockers reduced nonfatal MIs in high-risk patients undergoing elective surgery. 1, 2 Based on this, the American Heart Association recommended the use of beta blockers with elective surgery for patients at high risk of cardiac complications in 2002. A 2014 Cochrane meta-analysis analyzed 89 randomized controlled trials with a total of 19, 211 participants.

The authors concluded that the use of perioperative beta blockade decreases the rates of ventricular arrhythmias and supraventricular arrhythmias in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In the cohort of patients who underwent noncardiac surgeries, the use of perioperative beta blockers decreased the rate of non-fatal MIs and increased the rate of hypotension and nonfatal stroke. 8 Caveats: In general, the studies of perioperative beta blockers are clinically heterogeneous, and examine different medications and patients with varying levels of cardiovascular risk who are undergoing various surgeries and treatment strategies. Most studies initiated beta blockers one day before surgery. A meta-analysis including only the trials at low risk of bias suggested a decrease in nonfatal MIs, with a corresponding increase in nonfatal strokes and all-cause mortality.

2, 9 In these trials, the authors found a significant decrease in nonfatal MIs in patients randomized to receive perioperative beta blockers. The smaller of these two trials found a significant decrease in cardiac mortality in patients randomized to receive bisoprolol. These results failed to be replicated in the second trial that was larger and more methodologically rigorous. Given these disparate results, more data on the use of prolonged presurgical beta blockers are needed before definitive statements can be made about whether this strategy is of net benefit to patients.

### Perioperative β-blockers for preventing surgery-related mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing cardiac surgery [^116WU4oj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of beta-blockers to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus routine prescription of these drugs in unselected patients remains a controversial issue. A previous version of this review assessing the effectiveness of perioperative beta-blockers in cardiac and non-cardiac surgery was last published in 2018. The previous review has now been split into two reviews according to type of surgery. This is an update and assesses the evidence in cardiac surgery only.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of perioperatively administered beta-blockers for the prevention of surgery-related mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing cardiac surgery.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis Previews and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science on 28 June 2019. We searched clinical trials registers and grey literature, and conducted backward- and forward-citation searching of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs and quasi-randomized studies comparing beta-blockers with a control (placebo or standard care) administered during the perioperative period to adults undergoing cardiac surgery. We excluded studies in which all participants in the standard care control group were given a pharmacological agent that was not given to participants in the intervention group, studies in which all participants in the control group were given a beta-blocker, and studies in which beta-blockers were given with an additional agent (e.g. magnesium). We excluded studies that did not measure or report review outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included 63 studies with 7768 participants; six studies were quasi-randomized and the remaining were RCTs. All participants were undergoing cardiac surgery, and in most studies, at least some of the participants were previously taking beta-blockers. Types of beta-blockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, sotalol, esmolol, landiolol, acebutolol, timolol, carvedilol, nadolol, and atenolol. In twelve studies, beta-blockers were titrated according to heart rate or blood pressure. Duration of administration varied between studies, as did the time at which drugs were administered; in nine studies this was before surgery, in 20 studies during surgery, and in the remaining studies beta-blockers were started postoperatively. Overall, we found that most studies did not report sufficient details for us to adequately assess risk of bias. In particular, few studies reported methods used to randomize participants to groups. In some studies, participants in the control group were given beta-blockers as rescue therapy during the study period, and all studies in which the control was standard care were at high risk of performance bias because of the open-label study design. No studies were prospectively registered with clinical trials registers, which limited the assessment of reporting bias. We judged 68% studies to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Study authors reported few deaths (7 per 1000 in both the intervention and control groups), and we found low-certainty evidence that beta-blockers may make little or no difference to all-cause mortality at 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.90; 29 studies, 4099 participants). For myocardial infarctions, we found no evidence of a difference in events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.52; 25 studies, 3946 participants; low-certainty evidence). Few study authors reported cerebrovascular events, and the evidence was uncertain (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.67; 5 studies, 1471 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Based on a control risk of 54 per 1000, we found low-certainty evidence that beta-blockers may reduce episodes of ventricular arrhythmias by 32 episodes per 1000 (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.63; 12 studies, 2296 participants). For atrial fibrillation or flutter, there may be 163 fewer incidences with beta-blockers, based on a control risk of 327 incidences per 1000 (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.59; 40 studies, 5650 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, the evidence for bradycardia and hypotension was less certain. We found that beta-blockers may make little or no difference to bradycardia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.91; 12 studies, 1640 participants; low-certainty evidence), or hypotension (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.80; 10 studies, 1538 participants; low-certainty evidence). We used GRADE to downgrade the certainty of evidence. Owing to studies at high risk of bias in at least one domain, we downgraded each outcome for study limitations. Based on effect size calculations in the previous review, we found an insufficient number of participants in all outcomes (except atrial fibrillation) and, for some outcomes, we noted a wide confidence interval; therefore, we also downgraded outcomes owing to imprecision. The evidence for atrial fibrillation and length of hospital stay had a moderate level of statistical heterogeneity which we could not explain, and we, therefore, downgraded these outcomes for inconsistency.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of a difference in early all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, hypotension and bradycardia. However, there may be a reduction in atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias when beta-blockers are used. A larger sample size is likely to increase the certainty of this evidence. Four studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of this review.

### Beta-blockers in noncardiac surgery: did observational studies put us back on safe ground? [^114GrXMb]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Based on landmark trials, international guidelines had for years promoted the use of beta-blockers in the setting of non-cardiac surgery. In 2011, concerns were raised regarding the integrity of some of the landmark trials, as the Dutch Erasmus Medical Center found some of them to be scientifically incorrect. Based on the remaining studies that were to be trusted, investigations showed that, in contrast to prior beliefs, the widespread use of perioperative beta-blockers might be harmful. A call for further investigations into the matter ushered in several observational studies evaluating the safety of perioperative beta-blocker therapy in specific patient subgroups. Within this review, we discuss important aspects for making these decisions, and compare the major observational studies and specific estimates of risk in subgroups of interest. We conclude that patients at high risk with heavy co-morbidities, such as heart failure, may benefit from beta-blocker therapy, whereas low-risk patients, such as patients with uncomplicated hypertension, may be at increased risk with beta-blocker therapy. We provide a critical review of current perioperative guidelines in view of the new observational data, suggesting that the recommended schematics, such as the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, for risk stratification of patients in this setting may be suboptimal. Further, we provide discussions of other aspects, including risk of sepsis, type of beta-blocker, and the potential of perioperative beta-blocker withdrawal, which may be important in guiding future studies. Summarising the current evidence, we argue that, after a precarious decade, we may just now, be back on safe ground.

Perioperative beta blockade — hemodynamic risks and management thresholds indicate that in the POISE trial, oral study drug was held if heart rate was consistently below 45 bpm or systolic blood pressure was below 100 mm Hg; dosing was delayed 12 hours for heart rate 45 to 49 bpm; and if on intravenous infusion, medication was held for heart rate below 50 bpm or systolic blood pressure below 100 mm Hg. Meta-analyses and trials show increased bradycardia and hypotension, including OR 3.76 (95% CI 2.45 to 5.77; number needed to harm = 6) for bradycardia, risk ratios for postoperative bradycardia 2.22 (95% CI 1.50 to 3.29) and for bradycardia requiring treatment 2.34 (95% CI 1.62 to 3.37), and postoperative hypotension 1.29 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.51); across 10 randomized trials with 2176 patients, bradycardia OR 3.49 (95% CI 2.4 to 5.9) and congestive heart failure (CHF) OR 1.68 (95% CI 1.00 to 2.8). In POISE, hazard ratios were 1.55 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.74) for clinically significant hypotension and 2.74 (95% CI 2.19 to 3.43) for bradycardia, with adjusted odds of death and stroke of 4.97 (95% CI 3.62 to 6.81) and 2.13 (95% CI 1.37 to 3.12), respectively. The update states that hemodynamic effects "must be incorporated and considered in any beta-blocker protocol, with the goal of avoidance of bradycardia and hypotension", and notes that "a thorough search for alternative causes of tachycardia, such as infection, is important".

### Perioperative management of chronic heart failure [^114p7pwA]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is one of the few cardiac conditions that is increasing. Despite a better understanding of how hormones and other signaling systems underlie the pathophysiology, and despite improved outcomes from pharmacologic therapy, many HF patients receive no effective treatment. Patients with HF commonly require medical diagnosis and management in operating rooms and critical care units; thus anesthesiologists are obliged to remain up-to-date both with advances in outpatient (chronic) medical management and with inpatient treatments for acute exacerbations of HF. Accordingly, we reviewed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists because these drugs prolong life and are included in current clinical practice guidelines for treating patients with chronic HF. We also reviewed the implications of chronic HF for patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia and discuss how best to provide intensive treatment for acute exacerbations of symptoms, such as might be caused by excessive intravascular volume, inappropriate drug "holidays", or worsening of the underlying cardiac disease.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^114sCaud]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Surgical procedures in adults with hypertension — Preoperative medication guidance includes continuation and specific cautions. In patients with hypertension undergoing major surgery who have been on beta blockers chronically, beta blockers should be continued (COR I, LOE B-NR). In patients with hypertension undergoing planned elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue medical therapy for hypertension until surgery (COR IIa, LOE C-EO). In patients with hypertension undergoing major surgery, discontinuation of ACE inhibitors or ARBs perioperatively can be considered (COR IIb, LOE B-NR). In patients with planned elective major surgery and SBP of 180 mm Hg or higher or DBP of 110 mm Hg or higher, deferring surgery may be considered (COR IIb, LOE C-LD). For patients undergoing surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of beta blockers or clonidine is potentially harmful (COR III: Harm, LOE B-NR). Beta blockers should not be started on the day of surgery in beta blocker–naive patients (COR III: Harm, LOE B-NR).

### Perioperative β-blockers for preventing surgery-related mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^114FcPaT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of beta-blockers to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus routine prescription of these drugs in an unselected population remains a controversial issue. A previous version of this review assessing the effectiveness of perioperative beta-blockers in cardiac and non-cardiac surgery was last published in 2018. The previous review has now been split into two reviews according to type of surgery. This is an update, and assesses the evidence in non-cardiac surgery only.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of perioperatively administered beta-blockers for the prevention of surgery-related mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis Previews and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science on 28 June 2019. We searched clinical trials registers and grey literature, and conducted backward- and forward-citation searching of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs and quasi-randomized studies comparing beta-blockers with a control (placebo or standard care) administered during the perioperative period to adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery. If studies included surgery with different types of anaesthesia, we included them if 70% participants, or at least 100 participants, received general anaesthesia. We excluded studies in which all participants in the standard care control group were given a pharmacological agent that was not given to participants in the intervention group, studies in which all participants in the control group were given a beta-blocker, and studies in which beta-blockers were given with an additional agent (e.g. magnesium). We excluded studies that did not measure or report review outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 participants; we found no quasi-randomized studies. All participants were undergoing non-cardiac surgery, and types of surgery ranged from low to high risk. Types of beta-blockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. In nine studies, beta-blockers were titrated according to heart rate or blood pressure. Duration of administration varied between studies, as did the time at which drugs were administered; in most studies, it was intraoperatively, but in 18 studies it was before surgery, in six postoperatively, one multi-arm study included groups of different timings, and one study did not report timing of drug administration. Overall, we found that more than half of the studies did not sufficiently report methods used for randomization. All studies in which the control was standard care were at high risk of performance bias because of the open-label study design. Only two studies were prospectively registered with clinical trials registers, which limited the assessment of reporting bias. In six studies, participants in the control group were given beta-blockers as rescue therapy during the study period. The evidence for all-cause mortality at 30 days was uncertain; based on the risk of death in the control group of 25 per 1000, the effect with beta-blockers was between two fewer and 13 more per 1000 (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.54; 16 studies, 11,446 participants; low-certainty evidence). Beta-blockers may reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction by 13 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.87; 12 studies, 10,520 participants; low-certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.81; 6 studies, 9460 participants; low-certainty evidence), or in ventricular arrhythmias (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.47; 5 studies, 476 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Beta-blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation or flutter by 26 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, beta-blockers may increase bradycardia by 55 more incidences per 1000 (RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.74 to 3.56; 49 studies, 12,239 participants; low-certainty evidence), and hypotension by 44 more per 1000 (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.51; 49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence owing to study limitations; some studies had high risks of bias, and the effects were sometimes altered when we excluded studies with a standard care control group (including only placebo-controlled trials showed an increase in early mortality and cerebrovascular events with beta-blockers). We also downgraded for inconsistency; one large, well-conducted, international study found a reduction in myocardial infarction, and an increase in cerebrovascular events and all-cause mortality, when beta-blockers were used, but other studies showed no evidence of a difference. We could not explain the reason for the inconsistency in the evidence for ventricular arrhythmias, and we also downgraded this outcome for imprecision because we found few studies with few participants.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for early all-cause mortality with perioperative beta-blockers was uncertain. We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events or ventricular arrhythmias, and the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes was low and very low. We found low-certainty evidence that beta-blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarctions. However, beta-blockers may increase bradycardia (low-certainty evidence) and probably increase hypotension (moderate-certainty evidence). Further evidence from large placebo-controlled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life. We found 18 studies awaiting classification; inclusion of these studies in future updates may also increase the certainty of the evidence.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA perioperative beta-blocker therapy — evidence gaps and uncertainties: Despite several meta-analyses, there are still very few randomized trials of medical therapy before noncardiac surgery to prevent perioperative cardiac complications, and randomized, controlled trials are still needed. Reported limitations include that most trials are inadequately powered; few randomized trials have examined titration of therapy to effect (e.g., target heart rate); and no studies have addressed care-delivery mechanisms in the perioperative setting, identifying how, when, and by whom perioperative beta-blocker therapy should be implemented and monitored. There is currently a lack of data regarding which beta blocker to use, some observational data suggest that perioperative death or myocardial infarction rates may differ when different beta-blockers are given perioperatively, and the best approach on how to medically protect patients during noncardiac surgery is still unknown. The text also notes there may be some harm associated with beta-blocker therapy in low-risk patients.

### Perioperative care of patients at high risk for stroke during or after non-cardiac, non-neurologic surgery: consensus statement from the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care* [^116r9LUB]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Preoperative beta blockers and statins in perioperative stroke — the POISE trial in 8351 noncardiac surgery patients found metoprolol increased stroke risk (hazard ratio 2.17, p = 0.005) and death (hazard ratio 1.33, p = 0.032), and a meta-analysis suggested beta blockers increase risk of nonfatal stroke after noncardiac surgery. Observational data reported higher postoperative stroke risk with metoprolol compared to atenolol. Current guidelines endorse the perioperative continuation of beta blockers in surgical patients who are already taking this class, and in surgical patients who are beta-blocker-naïve, high-dose beta blockers should not be administered without dose titration. As with beta blockers, discontinuation of statins in the perioperative period may have adverse consequences; discontinuation in acute ischemic stroke was associated with a high risk of early neurologic deterioration, and preliminary retrospective data in carotid endarterectomy suggested statins could reduce neurologic injury.

### Β-blockade in the perioperative management of the patient with cardiac disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^117Ndr2a]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

The cardiology literature has suggested for decades that β-blockade protects patients with ischaemic heart disease. Extending this concept to perioperative patients initially produced promising results, with reductions in perioperative myocardial ischaemia and longer-term cardiovascular complications observed in several small randomized trials. However, subsequent larger trials have either shown no benefit or greater morbidity (especially stroke), despite reductions in cardiovascular events. Retrospective database analyses have confirmed or disputed these findings. Speciality societies, most importantly, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation, have promulgated guidelines for perioperative β-blockade, which have been revised, as the evidence has changed. While the European guidelines continue to emphasize perioperative β-blockade in high-risk patients, the American guidelines have reduced the strength and breadth of recommendations, focusing on haemodynamic titration. Future work will need to focus on identifying populations most likely to benefit or to be harmed, including pharmacogenetic analyses and distinctions between individual β-blockers.

### Perioperative β-blockers for vascular surgery patients [^112SEHbo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy has been a heavily investigated and controversial topic during the past decade. Prior national consensus statements that recommended the routine use of these medications in patients undergoing high-risk surgical procedures have been called into question because of the results of recent clinical trials that involved heterogeneous groups of surgical patients. This article reviews the evidence for perioperative beta-blocker usage as it pertains to patients undergoing vascular surgery procedures. The weight of evidence suggests that beta-blockers lower the perioperative risk of myocardial ischemia or infarction and cardiovascular death among patients with clinical risk factors undergoing major vascular surgery. However, there appears to be a concurrent risk of adverse events associated with these medications if patients are not monitored properly during the perioperative period. Perioperative beta-blockers should continue to occupy a prominent role in the therapeutic armamentarium for improving outcomes among high-risk patients undergoing major vascular surgery.

### Practical considerations of β-blockade in the management of the post-myocardial infarction patient [^113agA6b]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cause of death and disability in the United States that affects an estimated total of 1.5 million men and women each year. Despite significant advances in pharmacologic and interventional therapies, 25% of men and 38% of women still die within 1 year of the acute event. Beta-blockers have been shown to significantly decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients after an AMI. National guidelines recommend that all patients with AMI may be started on beta-blocker therapy and continued indefinitely, unless absolutely contraindicated or not tolerated. However, a substantial portion of eligible AMI survivors are not prescribed beta-blockers in the hospital after an acute event or upon hospital discharge. In addition, patients with AMI are often treated with agents whose long-term use has not been shown effective and for which optimal dosing has not been defined. This paper will discuss the background of beta-blocker use for the treatment of AMI, discuss the rationale for choosing specific agents, and present protocols for initiating or switching to evidence-based therapies.

### Study details | NCT01179113 | Esmolol infusion during laminectomy: effect on quality of recovery… [^112Wj3KY]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

Esmolol Infusion During Laminectomy: Effect on Quality of RecoveryClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview. A common practice used to control autonomic responses during surgery is to administer beta-blockers intraoperatively. This practice has been shown to effectively blunt autonomic responses to intraoperative events. Several studies have shown that administration of beta-blockers can decrease intraoperative anesthetic requirements. Additionally, it has been demonstrated in several studies that intraoperative beta-blocker administration may actually decrease postoperative pain scores and opioid requirements, although these results are not entirely consistent. The mechanism by which the decrease in postoperative pain and narcotic requirements occurs is unclear. It has been postulated that esmolol may itself possess some analgesic-like properties, as was suggested by studies performed in rodent models.

It has also been postulated that perioperative beta-blockade may attenuate the neuroendocrine stress response to surgery, thereby decreasing inflammatory responses in tissues; however, this theory was not supported by a study in which stress hormone levels were measured in patients who received beta-blockers and compared to a control group. Several studies which investigated the effects of beta-blockade on postoperative pain and opioid requirements compared the beta-blocker treatment group to an opioid treatment group, and did not include a true control group in which no treatment was given. Therefore, it is unclear whether the decrease in postoperative pain and opioid requirements in these studies was due to a true effect of the beta-blockers or whether it was due to an effect of the opioids.

Therefore, the investigators propose a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in which the investigators will compare an esmolol infusion treatment group to a normal saline infusion control group with regards to the effects on postoperative pain and opioid requirements. By setting up the study in this manner, the investigators will be able to clearly evaluate the effects of beta-blockers on postoperative pain scores and opioid requirements.

The investigators chose to perform the study on patients who are undergoing single-level or double-level laminectomies because prior studies have investigated the effects of intraoperative beta-blockers on patients who are not chronic pain patients, and the investigators would like to research whether the results which have been suggested by prior studies are also applicable to patients who may have chronic pain, as this is the patients population that is most likely to experience high pain levels following surgery, and may benefit the most from reduction of postoperative pain levels.

Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Perioperative cardiac risk — background burden and context are highlighted: Perioperative cardiac complications are an important concern for the 230 million individuals who undergo surgery worldwide every year, and after surgery, 2% suffer major cardiac complications and 8% show evidence of significant myocardial injury. The field saw early enthusiasm for perioperative beta blockade based on promising results in 2 RCTs, and guideline history noted a Class II recommendation in 1996 and a Class IIa recommendation in 2002. It is also noted that in the POISE-1 trial, although perioperative beta blockade prevented perioperative MI, this benefit was accompanied by increased risks of death, stroke, hypotension, and bradycardia.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons preoperative beta blocker working group interim report [^1154RHLK]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs commonly after cardiac surgery and is associated with multiple adverse outcomes. Older randomized trials suggested that perioperative β- blockade reduced postoperative AF, and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) composite measure includes β-blocker administration preoperatively within 24 hours of surgery and at discharge. However, some more recent studies suggest preoperative β-blockade has limited value and question its continuation as an STS quality measure.

Methods

In 2022, an STS Preoperative Beta Blocker Working Group was formed with representatives from the STS and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists. Published randomized trials, observational studies, societal guidelines, and the current state of available data from the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (ACSD) were reviewed.

Results

Review of existing studies reveals substantial heterogeneity or insufficient detail regarding specific β-blockers used, timing of initiation, management of patients on chronic β-blockade, and whether other proarrhythmic or antiarrhythmic drugs were used concurrently. Further, β-blocker data currently collected in the STS ACSD lack sufficient granularity.

Conclusions

Because a new randomized trial seems unlikely, the Working Group believes that more granular data on real-world practice would facilitate assessment of the value of preoperative β-blockade in the current era, development of best practice recommendations, and evaluation of their continued appropriateness as an STS quality metric. STS ACSD participants have been invited to participate in a voluntary survey whose additional data, when linked to STS ACSD records, will better delineate contemporary β-blocker practice and outcomes.

ACC/AHA perioperative beta-blocker therapy guideline — recommendation classes and evidence levels are defined as follows: Class I states, "Conditions for which there is evidence for and/or general agreement that the procedure or treatment is beneficial, useful, and effective". Class II covers "Conditions for which there is conflicting evidence and/or a divergence of opinion about the usefulness/efficacy of a procedure or treatment", with Class IIa — "Weight of evidence/opinion is in favor of usefulness/efficacy" — and Class IIb — "Usefulness/efficacy is less well established by evidence/opinion". Class III specifies "Conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agreement that the procedure/treatment is not useful/effective, and in some cases may be harmful". Evidence levels include "Level of Evidence A: Data derived from multiple, randomized, clinical trials" and "Level of Evidence B: Data derived from a single randomized trial or non-randomized studies", and "Class IIa and Class IIb recommendations are not considered for stand-alone measures".

### Risks of β-blocker use for noncardiac surgery in hypertensive patients… [^1175EBa2]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Among patients with ischemic heart disease, a recent observational study suggested that β-blocker therapy was associated with a lower risk of adverse perioperative events only among patients with specific high-risk conditions, such as recent myocardial infarction or chronic heart failure.
6. Anesthesia, blood loss, and the inflammatory response to surgery may each lead to hemodynamic instability and hypotension, which might be exacerbated by β-blocker therapy, as suggested by the POISE trial. 12 Patients with hypertension may be especially susceptible to swings in blood pressure because they have increased vascular stiffness and higher thresholds for organ autoregulatory functions13, 14 although 2 smaller randomized trials suggested lower prevalence of myocardial ischemia among previously untreated patients with hypertension who received perioperative β-blockers, compared with patients who received placebo. 15, 16.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that use of perioperative β-blockers in a population of hypertensive patients free of cardiac, renal, and liver disease might be associated with increased risks of major adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in the 30 days after noncardiac surgery. to 30% increased risk of all-cause mortality associated with perioperative β-blocker therapy and noted that the results from the largest study, the POISE trial, dominated the meta-analyses. 3–5 In our study, risks of cardiovascular death were increased, whereas no statistically significant differences were observed for nonfatal stroke or nonfatal myocardial infarction.

Use of RAS inhibitors was associated with reduced risks of all-cause mortality but not MACE in our low-risk population, which has also recently been reported in another cohort study, 42 whereas guidelines, and a single observational study in high-risk patients undergoing vascular surgery, suggested that these drugs did not reduce mortality and MACEs but increased the risks of hypotension. 9, 43 Finally, guidelines describe the perioperative use of thiazides to be safe, which is confirmed by the findings in our study, in which thiazides were associated with reduced risks of MACE and mortality. Furthermore, perioperative guidelines in effect during the study period recommended continuation of β-blocker use throughout surgery in patients with hypertension, suggesting that discontinuation was not a major issue in our population.

Because of the observational design, we lacked information on perioperative variables such as heart rate, blood pressure, hypotension, electrocardiographic changes, perioperative troponin concentrations, fluid administration schemes, and need for inotropic therapy.

### Optimal preoperative assessment of the geriatric surgical patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons national surgical quality improvement program and the American Geriatrics Society [^111SQ4Ln]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA guidelines for perioperative beta blockers — The guidelines support administration of beta blockers to patients who are already on beta blockers, particularly those with independent cardiac indications for these medications, and to patients undergoing intermediate risk or vascular surgery with known coronary artery disease or with multiple clinical risk factors for ischemic heart disease. If beta blockers are indicated, when feasible, they should be started at least days to weeks before elective surgery, titrated to a heart rate of 60–80 beats/minute in the absence of hypotension, and titrated rate control with beta blockers should continue during the intraoperative and postoperative periods. Beta blockers should be tapered off slowly to minimize risk of withdrawal. The current ACC/AHA guidelines state that routine administration of high-dose beta-blockers in the absence of dose titration is not useful and may be harmful to patients not currently taking beta-blockers who are undergoing noncardiac surgery.

### Peri-operative cardiac protection for non-cardiac surgery [^117Tc2v3]. Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular complications are an important cause of morbidity and mortality after non-cardiac surgery. Pre-operative identification of high-risk individuals and appropriate peri-operative management can reduce cardiovascular risk. It is important to continue chronic beta-blocker and statin therapy. Statins are relatively safe and peri-operative initiation may be beneficial in high-risk patients and those scheduled for vascular surgery. The pre-operative introduction of beta-blockers reduces myocardial injury but increases rates of stroke and mortality, possibly due to hypotension. They should only be considered in high-risk patients and the dose should be titrated to heart rate. Alpha-2 agonists may also contribute to hypotension. Aspirin continuation can increase the risk of major bleeding and offset the benefit of reduced myocardial risk. Contrary to the initial ENIGMA study, nitrous oxide does not seem to increase the risk of myocardial injury. Volatile anaesthetic agents and opioids have been shown to be cardioprotective in animal laboratory studies but these effects have, so far, not been conclusively reproduced clinically.

### Perioperative β-blockers for major noncardiac surgery: primum non nocere [^114K6akA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Recent studies have called into question the benefit of perioperative beta blockade, especially in patients at low to moderate risk of cardiac events. Once considered standard of care, the role of beta-blocker therapy now lies mired in conflicting data that are difficult to apply to the at-risk patient. We provide an overview of the evolution of perioperative beta blockade, beginning with the physiology of the adrenergic system, with emphasis on the biologic rationale for the perioperative implementation of beta-blockers. Although initial studies were small in size and statistically limited, early data showed cardiac benefit with the use of perioperative beta-blockers. However, larger, more recent studies now suggest a lack of benefit and potential harm from this practice. This paradigm holds true especially in those at low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk profiles. Potential explanations for these paradoxical results are discussed, stressing the key differences between earlier and current studies that may explain these divergent outcomes. We conclude by commenting on performance measures as they relate to perioperative beta-blockers and make recommendations for the continued safe implementation of this practice.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111MS5BL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Patients scheduled for surgical procedures — For patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery who have been on beta blockers (BBs) chronically, BBs should be continued throughout the preoperative period to assist with blood pressure (BP) control (Class 1, Level B-NR). For elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue most medications for hypertension throughout the preoperative period (Class 2a, Level C-EO). In major surgery, discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) preoperatively may be considered to prevent hypotension during surgery (Class 2b, Level B-R). In elective major surgery with systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg, deferring surgery may be considered especially in high-risk patients to minimize perioperative complications (Class 2b, Level C-LD). In patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of BB or clonidine may result in rebound hypertension and is potentially harmful (Class 3: Harm, Level B-NR). For patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, BB should not be started on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients because of increased risk of postoperative mortality (Class 3: Harm, Level B-R).

Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta blockade — nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are pooled as relative risks (RR). For all studies, the pooled estimate was RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57–0.81; P < 0.001. Subgroup estimates were DECREASE trials RR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.03–1.48; P = 0.12 and other trials RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59–0.86; P = 0.001. Statistical heterogeneity (I2) was 0% for the overall analysis, 52.6% for the DECREASE subgroup, and 0% for other trials; differences between subgroups bordered on statistical significance (P = 0.08). Effect directionality is that estimates to the left of RR: 1 indicate fewer nonfatal MIs with beta blockade ("Favors Beta-Blockers"), whereas estimates to the right indicate superior outcomes with control ("Favors Control").

### Perioperative cardiac risk reduction [^113tnquE]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Noninvasive stress testing is rarely helpful in assessing risk, and for most patients there is no evidence that coronary revascularization provides more protection against perioperative cardiovascular events than optimal medical management. Patients likely to benefit from perioperative beta blockade include those with stable coronary artery disease and multiple cardiac risk factors. Perioperative beta blockers should be initiated weeks before surgery and titrated to heart rate and blood pressure targets. The balance of benefits and harms of perioperative beta-blocker therapy is much less favorable in patients with limited cardiac risk factors and when initiated in the acute preoperative period. Perioperative statin therapy is recommended for all patients undergoing vascular surgery. When prescribed for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, aspirin should be continued in the perioperative period.

2014 ACC/AHA perioperative guideline systematic review — perioperative beta-blocker regimens and monitoring in selected studies are summarized as follows: In Yang et al., metoprolol tartrate was given as oral metoprolol 25 mg within 2 h prior to surgery, followed by titrated intravenous (IV) immediately after surgery and oral metoprolol for 30 d after surgery; preoperative dose titration was none, postoperative treatment lasted 30 d, and routine surveillance for postoperative MI was Yes. In DECREASE-IV, oral bisoprolol 2.5–10 mg once daily was started at least 21 d prior to surgery and continued for 30 d after surgery; titration occurred over ≥ 21 (median 34) d prior to surgery with the starting dose not changed in 99% of patients, postoperative treatment lasted 30 d, and routine surveillance for postoperative MI was Yes. In a cohort study by Matyal et al., beta-blocker therapy started immediately prior to or after surgery and continued for up to 3 d after surgery; the postoperative treatment duration was 3 d or hospital discharge and routine surveillance for postoperative MI was No routine surveillance.

### 2009 ACCF / AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade [^113nvXgt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy — current data suggest benefit and specify use: beta blockers reduce perioperative ischemia and may reduce the risk of MI and cardiovascular death in high-risk patients; continuation for ACCF/AHA Class I indications continues to be a Class I recommendation; when possible and where indicated, beta blockers should be started days to weeks before elective surgery, the dose should be titrated perioperatively, and titrated rate control should continue intraoperatively and postoperatively, if possible, to maintain a heart rate of 60 to 80 bpm in the absence of hypotension; by contrast, routine administration of higher-dose long-acting metoprolol on the day of surgery without titration is associated with an overall increase in mortality, and routine high-dose beta blockers without dose titration before noncardiac surgery are not useful, may be harmful, and carry a new Class III recommendation.

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Do not abruptly discontinue Nebivolol Tablets therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. Severe exacerbation of angina, myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with β-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Caution patients without overt coronary artery disease against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other β-blockers, when discontinuation of Nebivolol Tablets is planned, carefully observe and advise patients to minimize physical activity. Taper Nebivolol Tablets over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, re-start Nebivolol Tablets promptly, at least temporarily.

5.2 Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction

Nebivolol was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent MI.

5.3 Bronchospastic Diseases

In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive β-blockers.

5.4 Anesthesia and Major Surgery

Because beta-blocker withdrawal has been associated with an increased risk of MI and chest pain, patients already on beta-blockers should generally continue treatment throughout the perioperative period. If Nebivolol Tablets are to be continued perioperatively, monitor patients closely when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If β-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

The β-blocking effects of Nebivolol Tablets can be reversed by β-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with β-blockers.

5.5 Hypoglycemia

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at anytime during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

### Β-blocking agents for surgery: influence on mortality and major outcomes. A meta-analysis [^115QwM6M]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To re-evaluate the effects of perioperative beta-blockade on mortality and major outcomes after surgery.

Design

A meta-analysis of parallel randomized, controlled trials published in English.

Setting

A university-based electronic search.

Participants

Patients undergoing surgery.

Interventions

Two interventions were evaluated: (1) Stopping or continuing a β-blocker in patients on long-term β-blocker therapy; and (2) Adding a β-blocker for the perioperative period.

Measurements and Main Results

Stopping a β-blocker before the surgery did not change the risk of myocardial infarction (3 studies including 97 patients): risk ratio (RR), 1.08 (95% confidence interval 0.30, 3.95); I(2), 0%. Adding a β-blocker reduced the risk of death at 1 year: RR, 0.56 (0.31, 0.99); I(2), 0%; p = 0.046; number needed to treat 28 (19, 369) (4 studies with 781 patients). Adding a β-blocker reduced the 0-to-30 day risk of myocardial infarction: RR, 0.65 (0.47, 0.88); I(2), 12.9%; p = 0.006 (15 studies with 12,224 patients), but increased the risk of a stroke: RR, 2.18 (1.40, 3.38); I(2), 0%; p = 0.001 (8 studies with 11,737 patients); number needed to harm 177 (512, 88).

Conclusions

β-blockers reduced the 1-year risk of death, and this effect seemed greater than the risk of inducing a stroke.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115v7KAm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension management — beta blockers (BB) and clonidine: If well tolerated, BBs should be continued in patients receiving them for guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) indications, with continuation through hospitalization and at discharge unless contraindications arise. Abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided, and data are fewer on whether short-term (1 to 2 days) perioperative BB followed by rapid discontinuation is harmful. Special consideration is noted for patients taking clonidine or BB because stopping these medications acutely carries risk, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can cause rebound hypertension with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and without plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

Beta-adrenergic blockers

Many patients scheduled for cardiac surgery are already prescribed beta-adrenergic blockers due to various cardiovascular conditions. Studies have found that the continuation of beta-adrenergic blockers for both elective and urgent cardiac operations is beneficial in terms of early survival, primarily due to their role in decreasing early postoperative major arrhythmic events. However, long-acting beta-adrenergic blockers might compromise the efficacy of a vasopressor postoperatively and may elevate the risk of perioperative bradycardia and hypotension. Hence, switching to short-acting forms could potentially minimize haemodynamic complications for patients taking long-acting preoperative beta-adrenergic blockers. Nonetheless, the favourable risk–benefit profile of continuing perioperative beta-adrenergic blocker therapy is particularly evident in the marked reduction of new-onset postoperative AFib and its associated complications. Given these findings, the sustained use of beta-adrenergic blockers through the perioperative period remains part of the recommended strategy for comprehensive medication management.

The decision regarding the initiation of a beta-adrenergic blocker in the immediate preoperative period remains complex. Even though the administration of β-blockers within at least 24 h before isolated CABG surgery has been endorsed by the National Quality Forum since 2007, the overall consensus is still evolving. The primary purpose of pre-CABG β-blocker administration is to decrease the burden of new-onset postoperative AFib, a condition associated with increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stays, escalated costs and notably reduced survival. The evidence of the efficacy of beta-adrenergic blockers in preventing perioperative MI and mortality remains inconclusive. The beneficial effects of beta-adrenergic blockers prior to CABG, in terms of MI and mortality, seem predominantly applicable to patients with a recent MI. Moreover, the data remain inconclusive also in patients with a reduced LVEF and those with no recent MI. However, if beta-adrenergic blockers are introduced preoperatively, it is recommended that, based on blood pressure and heart rate metrics, short-acting agents be meticulously up-titrated, beginning several days prior to the procedure. The goal of this approach is to diminish the prevalence of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias postoperatively, although further confirmatory studies are required.

### Perioperative use of β-blockers in cardiac and noncardiac surgery [^111ag74m]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are β-blockers associated with lower rates of mortality and morbidity after cardiac or noncardiac surgery?

Bottom Line

In cardiac surgery, β-blockers are associated with a lower incidence of supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) and ventricular arrhythmias. In noncardiac surgery, β-blockers are associated with a possible increase in mortality and strokes, a lower incidence of acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) and SVTs, and an increase in bradycardia and hypotension. If tolerated, long-term β-blocker treatment should be continued perioperatively, whereas the decision to start a β-blocker should be individualized, weighing risks and benefits.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension in noncardiac surgery — beta-blocker (BB) and clonidine management: If well tolerated, BBs should be continued in patients who are currently receiving them for GDMT indications, with clinical judgment used in titrating BB during the perioperative period and focusing on continuing the medication through the hospital stay and at discharge unless clear contraindications arise. Longstanding evidence suggests that abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can result in rebound hypertension associated with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and when there are no plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

Perioperative management of hypertension — It is recommended that newly diagnosed hypertensive patients who are scheduled for elective surgery should be preoperatively screened for HMOD and CV risk, and it is recommended to avoid large perioperative BP fluctuations during the perioperative period. Non-cardiac surgery may not be deferred in patients with grade 1 or 2 hypertension (SBP < 180 mmHg; DBP < 110 mmHg). For medications, perioperative continuation of beta-blockers is recommended in hypertensive patients on chronic treatment with these drugs, abrupt discontinuation of beta-blockers or centrally acting agents (e.g. clonidine) is potentially harmful and is not recommended, and transient preoperative discontinuation of RAS blockers should be considered in patients with hypertension undergoing non-cardiac surgery. On-page definitions specify BP = blood pressure, SBP = systolic blood pressure, DBP = diastolic blood pressure, CV = cardiovascular, HMOD = hypertension-mediated organ damage, and RAS = renin–angiotensin system.

Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta blockade in noncardiac surgery — evidence base: We identified 17 eligible studies comprising 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1 cohort study; the 16 RCTs contributed data from 12043 participants and the cohort contributed 348 participants. Except for the DECREASE-I and DECREASE-IV trials, all RCTs began beta-blocker therapy within 1 day or less prior to surgery. Of the 16 included RCTs, 8 had a low-to-intermediate overall risk of bias; fourteen trials showed intermediate-to-high relevance for study populations, interventions, and outcomes measures, and 10 trials assessed interventions implemented with intermediate-to-high fidelity. When assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, the included cohort study did not rate consistently well across all study quality domains.

Perioperative beta blockade — all-cause death: Across 16 trials among 11963 participants, there was a statistically significant subgroup difference between DECREASE and remaining RCTs (P = 0.004). In DECREASE trials, beta blockade showed a trend toward reduced all-cause death (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.22; P = 0.11), whereas in the remaining trials beta blockers increased all-cause death (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.63; P = 0.03). Excluding DECREASE trials, the POISE-1 trial (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.73) was qualitatively similar to the remaining trials (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.94).

### Perioperative cardiovascular medication management in… [^112hDR41]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

On the other hand, meta-analyses, some of which included the 2008 study discussed above, have shown that perioperative beta blockade is associated with reduced mortality rates in patients with higher RCRI scores but increased mortality rates in patients with lower scores. 1, 11, 12 Cardioselective beta blockers may confer lower stroke and mortality risk than other agents such as metoprolol. 1, 11 The 2014 ACC/AHA guideline on perioperative cardiovascular management of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery recommends perioperative beta blockade for patients receiving long-term beta-blocker therapy. 1 Beta blockade is considered reasonable if a patient has known or strongly suspected clinically significant coronary artery disease, or if the surgery is considered high risk and the patient has an RCRI score of 3 or more.

1, 4 When indicated, perioperative beta blockade is most beneficial when initiated at least one week to one month preoperatively and continued for at least one month postoperatively. Therapy should be titrated to a resting heart rate of 55 to 70 beats per minute. 11 Beta blockers should not be initiated on the day of surgery. Many patients who warrant perioperative beta blockade have indications for long-term therapy; postoperative therapy should be continued indefinitely in these patients. 1 Chronic obstructive lung disease without severe reactive airway disease is not a clear contraindication for cardioselective beta-blocker therapy. In a 2002 study, no clinically significant adverse respiratory effect was associated with cardioselective beta blockade in patients with mild to moderate reactive airway disease. 13 In fact, beta blockade may reduce mortality and exacerbations when added to an established inhaler regimen, with no clinically significant adverse effect on pulmonary function.

14 However, these findings are independent of any known cardiovascular disease and of cardiovascular drug therapy. EVIDENCE SUMMARY There has been considerable debate about perioperative administration of ACE inhibitors and ARBs because of concerns about the risks of perioperative hypotension, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte abnormalities. Two trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients undergoing vascular surgery found significantly more episodes of hypotension, but no difference in other cardiovascular outcomes.

Regarding medical management for perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, more specifically with respect to prophylactic beta-blockers, ACC/ACS/AHA/ASNC/HRS/SCA/SCCT/SCMR/SVM 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating β-blockers in patients scheduled for elective NCS and having a new indication for β-blockade, ensuring initiation occurs far enough before surgery (optimally > 7 days) to permit assessments of tolerability and drug titration if needed.

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Do not abruptly discontinue nebivolol tablets therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. Severe exacerbation of angina, myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with β-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Caution patients without overt coronary artery disease against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other β-blockers, when discontinuation of nebivolol tablets is planned, carefully observe and advise patients to minimize physical activity. Taper nebivolol tablets over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, re-start nebivolol tablets promptly, at least temporarily.

5.2 Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction

Nebivolol tablets were not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent MI.

5.3 Bronchospastic Diseases

In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive β-blockers.

5.4 Anesthesia and Major Surgery

Because beta-blocker withdrawal has been associated with an increased risk of MI and chest pain, patients already on beta-blockers should generally continue treatment throughout the perioperative period. If nebivolol tablets are to be continued perioperatively, monitor patients closely when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If β-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

The β-blocking effects of nebivolol tablets can be reversed by β-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with β-blockers.

5.5 Hypoglycemia

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at anytime during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

### Meta-analysis of secure randomised controlled trials of β-blockade to prevent perioperative death in non-cardiac surgery [^116PcmyJ]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Perioperative initiation of a course of β-blockers appears to increase postoperative mortality by 27%. This has emerged because the DECREASE family of studies has been discredited.

Patient safety being paramount, guidelines for perioperative β-blocker initiation should be retracted without further delay. Future guidelines should be accompanied by a commitment from named individuals to retract them immediately if the advice given is later revealed to be harmful.

Routine initiation of β-blockers for this indication should not be recommended, except in the context of RCTs which should be designed carefully, conducted honestly and reported truthfully.

### Β-blockers and reduction of cardiac events in noncardiac surgery: clinical applications [^1176VH1b]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Recent studies suggest that beta-blockers administered perioperatively may reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events and mortality in patients who have cardiac risk factors and undergo major noncardiac surgery. The objective of this article is to provide practicing physicians with examples of perioperative beta-blocker use in practice by using several hypothetical cases. Although current evidence describing the effectiveness of perioperative beta-blockade may not address all possible clinical situations, it is possible to formulate an evidence-based approach that will maximize benefit to patients. We describe how information from several sources can be used to guide management of patients with limited exercise tolerance, those at highest risk for perioperative cardiac events, patients who are taking beta-blockers long-term, and those with relative contraindications to beta-blockade. Even though fine points of their use remain to be elucidated, perioperative beta-blocker use is important and can be easily applied in practice by any physician involved with the care of patients perioperatively.

Conclusions

In our study being one of the first to examine the influence of a chronic beta-blockade on perioperative opioid consumption, we could not show an association between these two. There is a need for randomized controlled trials and adequately powered prospective studies to examine this question further before any conclusions can be made.

Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta blockade — systematic review conclusions indicate that beta blockade started within 1 day or less before noncardiac surgery helps prevent nonfatal MI but at the cost of increased risks of stroke, death, hypotension, and bradycardia; the DECREASE-I and DECREASE-IV randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the only RCTs that assessed beta blockade started ≥ 2 or more days before surgery, and their results differed significantly from other RCTs in that perioperative mortality rate was decreased, as opposed to increased, with beta-blocker therapy; excluding these controversial studies, there are insufficient robust data on regimens that use agents aside from metoprolol or initiate treatment 2 to 45 days prior to surgery.

### Perioperative neurological evaluation and management to lower the risk of acute stroke in patients undergoing noncardiac, nonneurological surgery: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111q155Q]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

β-Blockers — The use of β-blockers in the perioperative setting has been shown to reduce adverse cardiac events, but in 2008, a large randomized controlled trial showed increased mortality and higher stroke rates in patients treated with preoperative metoprolol compared with placebo. In this trial, subjects randomly assigned to receive metoprolol (extended release, 100–200 mg) 2 to 4 hours before surgery (and continued for next 30 days) were less likely to reach the composite end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI (myocardial infarction), and nonfatal cardiac arrest compared with control subjects, yet had significantly higher overall mortality and were twice as likely to experience a perioperative stroke (1.0% versus 0.5%; hazard ratio, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.26–3.74]; P = 0.0053). Patients in the metoprolol group were more likely to experience clinically significant hypotension and bradycardia, and post hoc multivariate analyses suggested that hypotension may be a mechanism by which β-blockers increase the risk of stroke. Observational data reported a significant increase in perioperative stroke rate with metoprolol versus atenolol and with intraoperative metoprolol versus labetalol or esmolol, while intraoperative hypotension was associated with perioperative stroke risk but not specifically with metoprolol; a subsequent large cohort study failed to show any difference in all-cause mortality or major adverse cardiac events across β-blocker subtypes. The 2014 ACC/AHA guideline strongly supports continuing β-blockers in patients who are on β-blockers long term and states that it may be reasonable to begin β-blockade in patients who are at high risk according to preoperative testing or who have ≥ 3 of the risk factors in the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, but that β-blockers should not be initiated on the day of surgery.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy and stroke risk — A final analysis including 9 randomized control trials reported increased nonfatal stroke with beta-blockade (RR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.09–3.16). In observational cohorts, chronic therapy showed no significant difference in nonfatal stroke versus alternative antihypertensives (0.23% vs. 0.21%, respectively, P = 0.68), and stroke risk did not differ among beta-blocker subtypes. In patients with previous coronary revascularization, there was no adjusted increased risk with preoperative beta-blocker therapy (AOR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.06–1.75), and propensity-matched analysis likewise found no statistically significant association (AOR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.03–1.38). A Veterans Affairs cohort showed no association across risk strata based on the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, and in diabetes, there was no statistically significant association with preoperative beta-blocker use and stroke (OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.94–1.88). Collectively, these observational data are stated to support updated ACC/AHA guidance, which recommends avoiding beta-blocker initiation immediately before surgery while continuing beta-blockade for those already on chronic therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Beta blockers — perioperative initiation and continuation are addressed as follows: Acutely discontinuing beta blockers for long-term indications is harmful and should be avoided, and clinical judgment should be used to titrate therapy with a focus on ensuring the medication is continued through the hospital stay and at discharge unless clear contraindications arise. Results from POISE indicate that initiating beta blockers on the day of surgery is harmful, and a large observational study suggested higher risks of death if beta blockers were initiated < 7 days before surgery compared with > 31 days earlier; patients who initiated between 8 and 30 days did not have excess mortality nor perioperative benefits. Thus, if initiation before surgery is required, the medication should be initiated ≥ 7 days before the surgery.
