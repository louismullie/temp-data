## Question

Bismuth quadruple therapy for sarcoidosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bismuth quadruple therapy has any role in the treatment of sarcoidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what bismuth quadruple therapy is actually indicated for and its evidence base. Then, I should verify the standard of care for sarcoidosis and whether any guideline or trial supports bismuth use. Next, I will check for any mechanistic rationale or antimicrobial strategies studied in sarcoidosis that could be conflated with bismuth therapy. Finally, I need to consider safety and conclude with a clear, evidence-based recommendation, ensuring I cross-check guideline-level sources for both conditions [^114qTnSw] [^111JQ3Hb].

> Let me first confirm the definition and indication of bismuth quadruple therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy consists of a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole, given typically for 10–14 days, and it is a recommended first-line or rescue regimen for Helicobacter pylori eradication, not for immune-mediated diseases such as sarcoidosis [^114qTnSw] [^117MmN6H] [^114npBT8].

> I need to check the accepted standard of care for sarcoidosis. Guidelines consistently position systemic corticosteroids as first-line therapy for clinically significant sarcoidosis, with immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate used as steroid-sparing second-line options, and biologics (e.g., infliximab) for refractory disease; none of these frameworks mention bismuth compounds or H. pylori regimens as sarcoidosis treatments [^111JQ3Hb] [^112YsWHk] [^116m34Vm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — let me systematically verify whether any document links bismuth quadruple therapy to sarcoidosis. I should double-check guideline statements, narrative reviews, and trials in both domains. I find multiple high-credibility sources and RCTs establishing bismuth quadruple therapy for H. pylori, but zero sources apply it to sarcoidosis; conversely, sarcoidosis reviews and ERS guidelines outline steroids, immunosuppressants, and biologics without any mention of bismuth or H. pylori regimens for sarcoid [^113VM62t] [^112PHMda] [^111uT3Qu] [^111cZHky].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could antimicrobial regimens for sarcoidosis be causing the confusion? There have been trials of antimycobacterial combinations in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis (e.g. CLEAR: levofloxacin, ethambutol, azithromycin, rifabutin), but these are mechanistically distinct from bismuth quadruple therapy and have not become standard of care; ERS guidance does not endorse antibiotics for sarcoidosis management, so I should be careful not to conflate these signals with bismuth-based H. pylori regimens [^117Fjmrj] [^111xhNhC] [^111JQ3Hb].

> The absence appears reflects not oversight but fundamental but fundamental but fundamental clinical reality: different diseases require different targets and mechanisms. Let me correct that wording and verify the logic — H. pylori infection is a bacterial condition where bismuth enhances antimicrobial efficacy, whereas sarcoidosis is a granulomatous, immune-mediated disease driven by dysregulated Th1 responses; bismuth has no established immunomodulatory role in sarcoid granuloma biology, reinforcing that its use is misplaced in sarcoidosis [^115ngaF7] [^114npBT8].

> Next, I should review safety, because even if a therapy is ineffective for a condition, its risk profile matters. Bismuth-containing regimens carry nontrivial adverse event burdens due to pill load and duration, with higher rates over 14 days; additionally, bismuth compounds can cause gastrointestinal intolerance, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity, which would be unjustified in sarcoidosis absent proven benefit [^112PHMda] [^111iigXg] [^112HoEYF].

> Let me consider the appropriate management pathway if a patient with sarcoidosis also has H. pylori. I should confirm that H. pylori, if present, be treated per gastroenterology guidelines with optimized bismuth quadruple therapy or validated alternatives, but that treatment targets the gastric infection and does not substitute for sarcoidosis therapy; sarcoidosis should still be managed per ERS guidance with corticosteroids and, if needed, steroid-sparing agents or biologics, with careful tapering strategies when appropriate [^114qTnSw] [^111JQ3Hb] [^111wSTy1].

> Final answer: I need to ensure the conclusion is precise and reference-aligned. Bismuth quadruple therapy has no role in the treatment of sarcoidosis; it is an H. pylori eradication regimen. Sarcoidosis management relies on corticosteroids first-line, followed by immunosuppressants and biologics for refractory disease, none of which include bismuth-based therapies, and exposing sarcoidosis patients to bismuth carries risks without evidence of benefit [^114qTnSw] [^111JQ3Hb] [^112YsWHk].

Bismuth quadruple therapy is **not recommended for sarcoidosis** because it is **an antimicrobial regimen for H. pylori**, rather than an immunomodulatory treatment for granulomatous inflammation [^114qTnSw] [^117MmN6H]. Sarcoidosis management relies on **corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents** (methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, and anti-TNF agents) [^111JQ3Hb] [^113PhBj7]. There is **no evidence or guideline support** for bismuth quadruple therapy in sarcoidosis and therefore its use is inappropriate.

---

## Mechanism of action and clinical indications of bismuth quadruple therapy

Bismuth quadruple therapy is a **combination antimicrobial regimen** comprising [^114qTnSw]:

- **Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)**: Reduces gastric acid secretion, enhancing antibiotic efficacy [^114npBT8].

- **Bismuth compound**: Provides antimicrobial activity against H. pylori [^114DyNVw].

- **Tetracycline**: Broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against H. pylori [^117GkSe8].

- **Metronidazole**: Antibiotic effective against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa [^111BpyUH].

This regimen is primarily indicated for **H. pylori eradication**, particularly in cases of antibiotic resistance or prior treatment failure [^114cs1iZ] [^117MmN6H]. It is not designed or indicated for **immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory** use.

---

## Pathophysiology of sarcoidosis and current treatment guidelines

Sarcoidosis is characterized by **non-caseating granulomas** driven by a dysregulated immune response involving T-helper 1 (Th1) cells and macrophages [^115ngaF7] [^112LdKcu]. The therapeutic goals are to suppress granulomatous inflammation, prevent organ damage, and improve quality of life [^111JQ3Hb].

Current treatment guidelines recommend a **stepwise approach** [^111JQ3Hb]:

- **First-line therapy**: Systemic corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) to suppress inflammation and granuloma formation [^111cZHky] [^111JQ3Hb].

- **Second-line therapy**: Immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, and hydroxychloroquine, primarily used as steroid-sparing agents [^111uT3Qu] [^116RWdgh].

- **Third-line therapy**: Biologic agents, particularly anti-TNF-alpha agents (e.g. infliximab, adalimumab), for refractory or severe cases [^112YsWHk] [^111JQ3Hb].

---

## Evidence regarding bismuth quadruple therapy in sarcoidosis

A comprehensive literature review reveals **no clinical trials, case reports, or guidelines** supporting the use of bismuth quadruple therapy in sarcoidosis [^111JQ3Hb] [^115723oJ]. The only remotely related study — the CLEAR trial — investigated a combination of antibiotics (levofloxacin, ethambutol, azithromycin, rifabutin) in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis and found no significant improvement in lung function or quality of life and reported significant adverse effects. Overall, **no evidence suggests** that bismuth quadruple therapy — targeting bacterial infections — would benefit sarcoidosis, a disease driven primarily by immune dysregulation rather than bacterial infection [^115ngaF7].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Bismuth quadruple therapy is associated with several **adverse effects**, including [^111iigXg]:

- **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation [^111iigXg].

- **Neurotoxicity**: Tremor, encephalopathy, particularly in patients with pre-existing neurological conditions or renal impairment [^112HoEYF].

- **Nephrotoxicity**: Risk of renal impairment, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction [^112HoEYF].

Given the lack of supporting evidence in sarcoidosis and the potential for significant adverse effects, the risks of bismuth quadruple therapy **outweigh any hypothetical benefits** in this context [^111iigXg].

---

## Comparison with standard sarcoidosis treatments

Standard sarcoidosis treatments, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, have well-established efficacy in controlling granulomatous inflammation and preventing organ damage. By contrast, bismuth quadruple therapy has **no demonstrated efficacy** in sarcoidosis and carries a significant risk of adverse effects [^111JQ3Hb].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus statements **do not recommend** — or even mention — bismuth quadruple therapy as a treatment option for sarcoidosis [^111JQ3Hb]. The absence of supporting evidence or clinical rationale underscores that this therapy is inappropriate for sarcoidosis management [^113PhBj7].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Bismuth quadruple therapy is **not recommended for sarcoidosis**. There is **no evidence of efficacy**, and it carries significant adverse-effect risks [^111iigXg]. Sarcoidosis management should continue to follow established guidelines, using corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and biologic therapies as appropriate [^111JQ3Hb] [^113PhBj7].

### Nonsteroidal therapy of sarcoidosis [^111uT3Qu]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Understanding the use of disease-modifying antisarcoid drugs is essential for physicians treating patients with sarcoidosis, as none of the medications used in clinical practice have been approved by regulatory authorities. This review summarizes recent studies focusing on nonsteroidal therapies for sarcoidosis, relevant from 2006 to 2013, to provide clinicians with an update on the most pertinent literature.

- **Recent findings**: Several recent studies have expanded our ability to appropriately sequence second-line and third-line therapies for sarcoidosis. For example, methotrexate and azathioprine are noted as useful and well-tolerated second-line treatments. Mycophenolate mofetil shows potential in treating neurosarcoidosis. Additionally, TNF-α blockers and other biologics are considered well-tolerated for the most severely affected patients.

- **Summary**: Corticosteroids remain the first-line therapy for sarcoidosis as many patients do not require treatment or only need short treatment durations. The second-line and third-line therapies described should be considered for patients with progressive or refractory disease or when life-threatening complications are apparent at presentation.

### Current treatment of sarcoidosis [^111cZHky]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous systemic disease of unknown cause, with the lungs being the most frequently affected organ. Therapeutic management of the disease is challenging, as clinical presentation and prognosis are very heterogeneous. This review will summarize the main advances in sarcoidosis therapy.

- **Recent findings**: Sarcoidosis therapies are categorized into three lines: glucocorticoids (first line), immunosuppressants (second line), and biologics (third line). Recent glucocorticoid studies have reported that efficacy could be similar with high and low doses, though higher doses increase side effects. Regarding immunosuppressants, recent publications on mycophenolate and repository corticotropin injection (RCI) have expanded their usage and efficacy information. Furthermore, new evidence has been published on the use of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNFα) agents in refractory cardiac sarcoidosis and neurosarcoidosis.

Sarcoidosis therapy is constantly evolving, with new drugs added to the recommended treatments. However, extensive clinical trials remain necessary to optimize the recommendations.

### Evolution of the use, effectiveness and safety of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for infection between 2013 and 2021: results from the European registry on management (Hp-EuReg) [^114DyNVw]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

The trends in the use of bismuth-based therapy in Europe reveal a significant shift over the years. After the commercialisation of single-capsule bismuth quadruple therapy (ScBQT) in Europe in 2013, there was a progressive increase in the prescription of bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT), primarily driven by the single-capsule scheme. The use of BQT peaked in 2018 when 50% of the reported treatments were bismuth therapies; thereafter, the rate of bismuth therapies slightly declined compared to non-bismuth options, stabilizing at around 40% during the 2019–2021 period.

In 2018, 19% of the treatments were ScBQT, and 31% were non-single-capsule bismuth quadruple therapy (NScBQT). However, by the end of the study period, the prescription rates of ScBQT and NScBQT were practically the same, representing 17.8% and 21% of all treatments, respectively.

Regarding geographical distribution, the greatest increase in BQT prescriptions occurred in Southwestern Europe, accounting for 75% of all treatments in 2018. ScBQT was the main treatment in this region, representing 60%, while NScBQT was more prevalent in Eastern Europe, with 60% in 2018, which decreased to 40% in 2021.

Both the rate and type of BQT prescriptions varied widely across European countries.

### The Toronto consensus for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^117MmN6H]. Gastroenterology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically in the context of treatment failure, the CAG 2016 guidelines recommend the administration of bismuth quadruple therapy. This regimen consists of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline for 14 days. It is suggested as an option for subsequent therapy in patients who have failed to respond to clarithromycin-containing H. pylori eradication therapy.

### 10-day versus 14-day Bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication of infection: A randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^112PHMda]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Female sex is a factor of eradication failure with concomitant therapy or sequential therapy, but not of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy. In this study, sex-based analyses confirmed that the efficacy of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy was non-inferior to that of 14-day therapy in male sex. However, the issue regarding whether 10-day therapy is non-inferior in female sex is inconclusive because our study was not designed to test this hypothesis. The statistical power is insufficient in the subgroup analysis. Future studies focusing on the sex effect are needed.

Poor adherence to medications is another predictor for eradication failure with bismuth quadruple therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy has a high pill burden and a complex treatment course; thus, medication tolerability and adherence should be considered. In this study, adverse events were assessed by a physician and a format questionnaire after the end of treatment; however, the questionnaire could not accurately determine the timing of adverse effect occurrence. The incidence of adverse effects seems to be correlated with the treatment dose and the duration of bismuth quadruple therapy. Fourteen-day bismuth quadruple therapy had a higher incidence of adverse effects compared to 7- or 10-day therapy. Nevertheless, medication adherence was not significantly affected by adverse effects. Our study also showed that both 10- and 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy have high medication adherence rates, which are consistent with previous studies. Moreover, both therapies achieved a good eradication rate (≥ 90% treatment success).

### Phase II investigation of the efficacy of antimycobacterial therapy in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis [^117Fjmrj]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation compared a regimen of antimycobacterial therapy consisting of CLEAR vs. a four-drug placebo regimen for 16 weeks. Each patient received 8 weeks of four drugs (induction phase), followed by 8 weeks of two drugs (consolidation phase). The primary endpoint was the absolute change in percentage of predicted FVC comparing baseline FVC vs. FVC following completion of 16 weeks of therapy. The secondary endpoints included change in 6MWD, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, adverse events of grades 1 to 5, and ESAT-6-specific immune responses.

The study protocol was approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board by Health Sciences Committee 1 (#121532) and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. This study was conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board for this study reviewed data throughout the study and performed the single planned interim analysis for safety and efficacy after 50 randomized patients had completed their 16-week regimen.

Patients were randomized to receive either an oral antibiotic regimen consisting of 8 weeks of daily levofloxacin 500 mg, ethambutol (1,200 mg for ≥ 50 kg; 800 mg for < 50 kg) once daily, azithromycin 250 mg, and rifabutin 300 mg vs. a daily identical-appearing four-drug placebo regimen.

### Ten-day quadruple therapy comprising proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, tetracycline, and levofloxacin is more effective than standard levofloxacin triple therapy in the second-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: A randomized controlled trial [^113qo2Xt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

The proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-amoxicillin-fluoroquinolone triple therapy is recommended as second-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection in the Maastricht V/Florence Consensus Report. However, the eradication rate of this standard salvage treatment is suboptimal. This study compares the efficacy of esomeprazole-bismuth-tetracycline-levofloxacin therapy (TL quadruple therapy) with esomeprazole-amoxicillin-levofloxacin triple therapy (AL triple therapy) in the rescue treatment for H. pylori infection.

Consecutive H. pylori-infected subjects, following the failure of first-line therapies, were randomly allocated to receive either TL quadruple therapy (esomeprazole 40mg b.d., bismuth 120mg q.d.s., tetracycline 500mg q.d.s., and levofloxacin 500mg o.d.) or AL triple therapy (esomeprazole 40mg b.d., amoxicillin 500mg q.d.s., and levofloxacin 500mg o.d.) for 10 days. The H. pylori status was assessed six weeks after the end of treatment.

The study was stopped after an interim analysis. Of the 50 patients in the TL quadruple therapy group, 49 (98.0%) had successful eradication of H. pylori infection. The cure of H. pylori infection was achieved in 36 of 52 patients (69.2%) receiving AL triple therapy. Intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that TL quadruple therapy achieved a markedly higher eradication rate than AL triple therapy (difference: 28.8%; 95% confidence interval: 15.7% to 41.9%; P < 0.001). Per-protocol analysis yielded a similar result (97.8% vs. 68.6%; P < 0.001). The two treatment groups exhibited comparable frequencies of overall adverse events.

### Evolving management of sarcoidosis in the real world [^1154N8nZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The management of sarcoidosis has relied mainly on glucocorticoids for over 80 years. Innumerable review articles, as well as all guidelines, position systemic steroids as the first-line therapy for moderate and severe sarcoidosis. Despite accumulating evidence of short-term (mostly overt) and long-term (often unrecognized) toxicities of steroids, and the example of specialists treating diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, the treatment paradigm for sarcoidosis has remained stubbornly affixed to steroids.

In 2025, there is now compelling evidence to relegate steroids to a lesser role in the management of sarcoidosis. Nonsteroid agents, especially methotrexate, can be used as first-line therapy for many patients. As steroid use diminishes, the development and implementation of additional steroid-sparing agents will assume increased importance.

### Update on the first-line treatment of infection in areas with high and low clarithromycin resistances [^111iigXg]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Bismuth quadruple therapy is recommended by the Maastricht V/Florence consensus report as the treatment of choice for H. pylori infection in areas with either low or high clarithromycin resistance. A recent network meta-analysis of H. pylori regimens demonstrated that 10–14 days of bismuth quadruple therapy is superior to 7-day clarithromycin triple therapy, with an efficacy of 85% versus 73%. However, the optimal treatment duration of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy remains unclear. Efficacy for treatments lasting 1–3 days, 4 days, or 7 days is less than when therapy is administered over 10–14 days. The 10- to 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy achieves an eradication rate of ≥ 85%, even in areas with a high prevalence of metronidazole resistance.

A large randomized trial by Malfertheiner and colleagues demonstrated that 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy was superior to 7-day standard triple therapy in Europe. Another multicentre randomized trial from Taiwan also showed that 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy was preferable to 14-day triple therapy when considering the rising prevalence of clarithromycin resistance. However, the frequency of adverse events occurring with bismuth quadruple therapy lasting 10–14 days is extremely high, ranging from 48% to 67% in large randomized trials. In addition, the complex administration of bismuth quadruple therapy might reduce patient adherence. A recent randomized controlled trial also documented that 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy had comparable efficacy.

### Corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy for cardiac sarcoidosis: A systematic review [^112ecE4n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In the systematic review, a total of 3527 references were retrieved (Figure 1), and 34 published studies fulfilled the criteria for this review, with no randomized controlled trials identified. The study design and inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in the study characteristics and inclusion criteria section.

- **Quality rating**: The quality rating, using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 50 checklist for cohort studies, is summarized here. Only 2 studies were deemed to be good in quality, with 29 studies rated as fair and 3 rated as poor. The average rating was 7.0, and the highest score was 11.

- **Patient demographics**: The demographics, including the number of patients (treated and not treated), follow-up, average age, sex, and presentation, are detailed in the patient demographics from selected studies section. In total, the studies included 1297 patients, of whom 1125 were treated with corticosteroids, 235 with other immunosuppressant therapies (ISTs), and 97 were not treated with either. Pulmonary involvement was present in 57.9% of patients.

- **Corticosteroid and other immunosuppression therapies**: The number of patients receiving steroids, other ISTs, and no therapy is also included. Details regarding therapy protocols, doses, and duration are shown in supplementary tables.

- **Outcomes: Atrioventricular conduction recovery**: Thirteen studies reported outcomes related to the recovery of high-grade atrioventricular block. Of 178 patients who received corticosteroids and/or other ISTs, 21 did not receive these treatments.

### Update on the second-line treatment of infection: a narrative review [^114npBT8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The regimen of standard bismuth quadruple therapy comprises a PPI twice daily, bismuth four times daily, tetracycline 500 mg four times daily, and metronidazole 500 mg three times daily for 10–14 days. A meta-analysis including 12 comparative trials demonstrated that bismuth quadruple therapy achieved an 89% cure rate [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 86%–93%, I² = 78%] in the second-line treatment for H. pylori infection. Hp-EuReg found that bismuth quadruple therapy could achieve optimal eradication (≥ 90%) after the failure of first-line clarithromycin-containing therapies, whereas the cure rate of levofloxacin-based triple therapy was suboptimal. A recent 15-year prospective study from Korea showed that the overall per-protocol eradication rate of 14-day bismuth-containing quadruple therapy in second-line treatment was 89.5% (95% CI: 86.3–92.7%).

Despite high rates of metronidazole resistance, no significant decline in annual eradication rates was observed during the study period. Therefore, bismuth-containing quadruple therapy is a pivotal second-line treatment for H. pylori infection, especially in areas with high quinolone resistance. Several recent studies revealed that treatment duration is an important factor related to the eradication efficacy of bismuth quadruple therapy. A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated a per-protocol eradication rate of 77.2% versus 93.6% between the 7-day and 14-day groups that received a bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as second-line treatment. Therefore, it is reasonable to encourage bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as a standard second-line treatment.

### 10-day versus 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication of infection: A randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^113VM62t]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

The European Registry on Helicobacter pylori management (Hp-EuReg), an international multicentre prospective non-interventionist registry, reported that prolonging treatment duration was observed in Europe from 2013 to 2018. Moreover, the eradication rates in 10-day and 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line empirical treatments were respectively 93% and 88%, as determined by both PP and modified ITT analyses. Our study is the first randomised trial to demonstrate that 10- and 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy with standard doses have similar eradication efficacy as a first-line anti-H. pylori treatment. Although 10-day therapy provided a smaller amount of medication than 14-day therapy did, the eradication efficacy was non-inferior. Both regimens achieved high efficacy of H. pylori eradication. Few studies have conducted head-to-head comparisons of the efficacy of 10- and 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy. Previous systematic review and meta-analyses found that there is no significant difference in eradication rate between the regimens with different treatment durations. However, neither the antibiotics nor doses were consistent in these studies; moreover, most studies were not conducted on patients with treatment-naïve. Patients with treatment-naïve and those with a history of treatment failure have distinct characteristics. The observed trend in second-line treatment may not be applicable to first-line treatment. To our best knowledge, only one study compared the efficacy between 10- and 14-day therapy for first-line treatment; however, it used a twice-daily regime.

### Eradication efficacy of modified dual therapy compared with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as a first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori [^111vyuPY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

This study assessed the effectiveness, adverse events, patient adherence, and costs of modified dual therapy compared with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for treating Helicobacter pylori infection in Chinese patients. It also sought to determine whether modified dual therapy could be used as an alternative first-line treatment for H. pylori infection.

A total of 232 H. pylori-infected, treatment-naive patients were enrolled in this open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups: the 14-day modified dual therapy group and the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy group. Eradication rates, drug-related adverse events, patient compliance, and drug costs were compared between the two groups.

The modified dual therapy group achieved eradication rates of 87.9%, 91.1%, and 91.1% as determined by the intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and modified intention-to-treat analyses, respectively. The eradication rates were similar compared with the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy group: 89.7%, 91.2%, and 90.4%. In addition, modified dual therapy ameliorated variations in the CYP2C19, IL-1B-511, and H. pylori VacA genotypes. There were no significant differences in the compliance rates between the two groups. The modified dual therapy group exhibited significantly fewer overall side effects compared with the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the cost of medications in the modified dual therapy was lower compared with that in the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy.

### Rifabutin-containing triple therapy versus bismuth quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori rescue treatment: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial [^111KDPkw]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We compared the efficacy and safety of rifabutin-containing triple therapy with bismuth quadruple therapy for rescue treatment of Helicobacter pylori.

- **Methods**: This was a non-inferiority study of H. pylori treatment for subjects who had failed at least two prior treatments. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive rifabutin triple therapy with 14-day esomeprazole (20 mg), amoxicillin (1.0 g), and rifabutin (150 mg) twice a day. Alternatively, they received bismuth quadruple therapy with esomeprazole (20 mg) and bismuth (220 mg) twice a day, plus metronidazole (400 mg) and tetracycline (500 mg) four times a day. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by agar dilution and E-test.

- **Results**: From May 2021 to October 2022, a total of 364 subjects were randomized. The eradication rates by intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and modified intention-to-treat were 89.0% (162/182; 95% confidence interval, 83.6%-92.8%), 94.0% (157/167; 95% CI, 89.3%-96.7%), and 93.6% (162/173; 95% CI, 89.0%-96.4%) for the rifabutin triple group. For the bismuth quadruple group, they were 89.6% (163/182; 95% CI, 84.3%-93.2%), 95.3% (143/150; 95% CI, 90.7%-97.7%), and 93.7% (163/174; 95% CI, 89.0%-96.4%).

- **Conclusions**: The rifabutin triple therapy is an alternative to classical bismuth quadruple therapy for the rescue treatment of H. pylori with fewer side effects and higher compliance.

### Treatment of sarcoidosis: From a basic science point of view [^115ngaF7]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Progress in our understanding of the scientific basis of granulomatous inflammation in sarcoidosis provides a framework for enlightened treatment decisions. Evidence supports the concept that the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis involves a highly polarized T-helper 1 (Th1) immune response to pathogenic tissue antigens. Conventional treatment is focused on attenuating granuloma formation with antimalarial drugs that inhibit antigen presentation or with nonspecific anti-inflammatory agents such as glucocorticosteroids, methotrexate, or azathioprine. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha agents, such as pentoxifylline, thalidomide, etanercept, and remicade, have recently shown some success in sarcoidosis. Designing future therapies depends on improved knowledge of the critical immunological processes operative in different stages of the disease.

### 10-day versus 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication of infection: a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^114p9yA9]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our study found that the efficacy of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy was non-inferior to that of 14-day therapy, with both therapies achieving adequate efficacy of H. pylori eradication; however, the limitation of generalisability should be noted. Shortening the duration of bismuth quadruple therapy reduced the incidence of specific adverse effects and the cost of treatment. Accordingly, 10 days is an appropriate duration for bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line H. pylori eradication in regions without high-level metronidazole-resistant strains.

### Management of advanced pulmonary sarcoidosis [^112XgybY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The term "advanced sarcoidosis" is used for forms of sarcoidosis with a significant risk of loss of organ function or death. Advanced sarcoidosis often involves the lung and is described as "advanced pulmonary sarcoidosis" (APS), which includes advanced pulmonary fibrosis, associated complications such as bronchiectasis and infections, and pulmonary hypertension. Although APS affects a small proportion of patients with sarcoidosis, it is the leading cause of poor outcomes, including death. Here we review the major patterns of APS with a focus on the management as well as potential approaches for improved outcomes for this most serious sarcoidosis phenotype.

### Corticosteroid treatment in sarcoidosis [^111B3Dtp]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

At present, there is no curative treatment for sarcoidosis. Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs can, however, be used for controlling the disease. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of therapy. They function by suppressing the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are involved in cell-mediated immune responses and granuloma formation. Only in a select group of patients is it justifiable to use these drugs, after careful evaluation of the pros and cons. Importantly, disease severity, such as threatened organ functions, and not disease activity itself, should be the deciding factor in this process.

In the case of parenchymal involvement, there is substantial evidence that corticosteroids can improve respiratory symptoms, chest radiography, and lung function parameters over 6–24 months. Other generally acknowledged empirical criteria for systemic treatment include neurological, cardiac, and sight-threatening ocular involvement, as well as hypercalcemia. Remarkably, despite over 50 years of use, there is no proof of long-term survival benefit from corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, there are still no data regarding the optimal dose and duration of corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy. One of the most significant questions remaining is whether or not these drugs can prevent scarring in patients with a fibrogenic phenotype. As new agents, including infliximab and thalidomide, enter the field and new diagnostic tools become available, there is clearly a momentum to design multicentric randomized controlled trials with a long enough follow-up (over 5 years) to answer these questions.

### Changes in chest roentgenogram of sarcoidosis patients during a clinical trial of infliximab therapy: Comparison of different methods of evaluation [^115VPP2z]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

The best method to interpret the chest roentgenogram and its sensitivity to detect the effect of treatment for sarcoidosis remains unclear. In a double-blind, randomized trial of infliximab for chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis, changes in serial chest roentgenograms were examined by radiologists blinded to order or treatment.

- **Methods**: Chest roentgenograms were obtained at 0, 6, and 24 weeks of therapy with either placebo, 3 mg/kg infliximab, or 5 mg/kg infliximab. Films were reviewed in random order by two independent radiologists, unaware of treatment. The films were compared using two methods: the prespecified objective assessment, a scoring system previously proposed by Muers; and the post hoc assessment, a 5-point Likert scale global assessment between two films.

- **Results**: Of 138 patients enrolled in the study, chest roentgenograms for all studies were available on 130 patients. There was only fair agreement between the two radiologists in the original stage of the chest roentgenogram (weighted kappa = 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.54). For the Likert scale of global assessment of change, there was good agreement between the two readers (weighted kappa = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.71). There was good correlation between the two readers for the various components of the Muers score, especially the reticulonodular (R) score (R = 0.578; p < 0.05). The initial R score was positively correlated with improvement in FVC with infliximab therapy (R = 0.239; p < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: Global assessment and the Muers scoring system were associated with good agreement.

### Levofloxacin-based triple therapy versus bismuth-based quadruple therapy for persistent Helicobacter pylori infection: a meta-analysis [^116vpaUK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Levofloxacin-based triple therapy has been suggested as an alternative salvage therapy to bismuth-based quadruple therapy for persistent Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.

- **Methods**: A search of PUBMED, EMBASE, EBM Review databases, and abstracts from recent Digestive Disease Week, United European Gastroenterology Week, and European Helicobacter Study Group conferences was performed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing levofloxacin-based triple salvage therapy (levofloxacin + amoxicillin + PPI) to bismuth-based quadruple salvage therapy (bismuth + tetracycline + metronidazole + PPI) were selected for meta-analysis. Additionally, all prospective trials evaluating this levofloxacin-based triple therapy as salvage therapy were pooled to analyze optimal levofloxacin treatment duration and dosing. All selected trials confirmed prior treatment failure and post-salvage treatment eradication.

- **Results**: Four RCTs compared a 10-day regimen of levofloxacin-based triple therapy to 7-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy (n = 391 patients). Levofloxacin-based triple therapy was superior to quadruple therapy (RR = 1.41 [95% CI: 1.25–1.59]). Levofloxacin-based triple therapy was better tolerated than quadruple therapy with a lower incidence of side effects (RR = 0.51 [95% CI: 0.34–0.75]) and side effects prompting discontinuation of therapy (RR = 0.30 [95% CI: 0.10–0.89]). Eleven trials (n = 547 patients) evaluating levofloxacin-based triple therapy demonstrated higher eradication rates with a 10-day versus 7-day regimen (87% [95% CI: 82%-92%] vs 68% [95% CI: 62%-74%]).

### Corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy for cardiac sarcoidosis: A systematic review [^111xSY5s]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

There are significant limitations to the data. There were no randomized controlled trials, and all of the studies were rated as being of poor or fair quality. Most importantly, there was a very limited number of nontreated patients. Treatment regimens were variable, and outcomes were not stratified by therapy subtype. Some studies had a short follow-up duration of less than one year, making it difficult to comment on the durability of corticosteroid response.

### 10-day versus 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication of infection: a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^116b58uK]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

This randomised, open-label, non-inferiority study was conducted in two hospitals: National Cheng Kung University Hospital and Tainan Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Tainan, Taiwan. National Cheng Kung University Hospital is a medical centre providing general and specific medical services, along with conducting education programs and research projects. In contrast, Tainan Hospital is a regional teaching hospital offering general medical services and performing public affairs tasks.

Patients aged 18 years or older and confirmed to be H. pylori-infected were enrolled in the study from August 3, 2020, to April 28, 2023. Both females and males, defined by biological attributes based on external body characteristics, were enrolled randomly. The presence of pre-treatment H. pylori infection was confirmed by one or more of the following tests: (1) histological evidence from a gastric biopsy, (2) a positive rapid urease test, and (3) a positive 13C-urea breath test. Patients were excluded if they had previously received H. pylori eradication therapy, had previous allergic reactions to any drugs in the bismuth quadruple therapy, had severe comorbidities, or were pregnant.

### ACG clinical guideline: Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^114qTnSw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically concerning first-line regimens, ACG 2024 guidelines recommend administering optimized bismuth quadruple therapy as a first-line treatment option in treatment-naïve patients with H. pylori infection:

- **PPI standard dose BID**: This refers to the administration of a standard dose of a proton pump inhibitor twice daily.

- **Bismuth subcitrate 120–300 mg or subsalicylate 300 mg QID**: The selection between subcitrate or subsalicylate depends on patient-specific factors, with both administered four times daily.

- **Tetracycline 500 mg QID**: Patients should be instructed to take tetracycline four times daily.

- **Metronidazole 500 mg TID or QID**: This should be administered either three or four times daily, as per patient tolerance and response.

These regimens are recommended to optimize the eradication rates of H. pylori infection in those not previously treated.

### SPL drug information for bismuth subsalicylate [^112HoEYF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of bismuth subsalicylate PO:

- **Constipation, diarrhea**: Use caution with a history of gastrointestinal disorders or those prone to gastrointestinal disturbances. Monitor patients closely for gastrointestinal symptoms while on bismuth hydrochloride and provide dietary recommendations for managing constipation or diarrhea. If gastrointestinal side effects like constipation or diarrhea occur, adjust fluid intake, offer dietary changes, and consider symptomatic treatments as appropriate.

- **Nephrotoxicity**: Use extreme caution with impaired renal function. Use bismuth hydrochloride cautiously in patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction and monitor renal function regularly during treatment. Discontinue the medication, provide appropriate renal support, and consult a nephrologist for further evaluation and management.

- **Tremor, encephalopathy**: Use extreme caution with a history of neurological disorders, as well as those who are at risk of neurotoxicity. Administer bismuth hydrochloride within recommended doses and duration, and closely monitor patients for signs of neurotoxicity. Promptly discontinue the medication, provide supportive care, and consult with a neurologist for further assessment and management.

### The role of PET in the management of sarcoidosis [^111zR3TB]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The hallmark of sarcoidosis is granulomatous inflammation because of a dysregulated response of the immune system. Once initiated, the resultant organ damage depends upon the intensity and duration of the persistent granulomatous inflammation. Given that the lungs are affected in about 90% of individuals, the pulmonary system garners much attention, but sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease. With the potential to damage any organ system, identifying and localizing active inflammation in different systems can direct management. PET has emerged as a tool to detect inflammation in patients with sarcoidosis that may not be easily recognized by physical examination or methods of assessment currently used in clinical practice. In this opinion, we hope to present the role of PET in the diagnosis and treatment of sarcoidosis, the advantages and drawbacks of PET, and outline areas of further research.

### Vonoprazan-minocycline dual therapy as a first-line treatment of infection compared with empirical bismuth-containing quadruple therapy [^116VaPxF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Increasing antibiotic resistance compromises therapeutic options for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, especially in penicillin-allergic individuals.

- **Objectives**: This trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 14-day vonoprazan–minocycline (VM) dual therapy against bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (B-quadruple therapy) as initial treatment for H. pylori infection.

- **Design**: This study was a single-center, open-label, and non-inferiority randomized controlled trial.

- **Methods**: In this study, 240 individuals with H. pylori infection who had not received therapy were randomly assigned 1:1 to either the VM dual therapy group (vonoprazan 20 mg plus minocycline 100 mg, administered twice daily) or the B-quadruple therapy group (rabeprazole 10 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and bismuth potassium citrate 220 mg, all administered twice daily). The primary outcome was to evaluate the non-inferiority of eradication rates between the two groups. Secondary outcomes included assessments of adverse events (AEs) and compliance.

- **Results**: The eradication rates of the VM dual group and B-quadruple therapy group were 87.5% and 88.3%, respectively, by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; 92.1% and 94.6% by modified ITT (mITT) analysis; and 92.0% and 95.5% by per-protocol (PP) analysis. The eradication rates of the VM group were non-inferior to those of the B-quadruple therapy group in ITT, mITT, and PP analyses. The one-sided p-values were 0.02, 0.01, and 0.02, respectively. The incidence of AEs was higher in the B-quadruple therapy group (28.3%) than in the VM group (16.7%).

Committee members concur that there is a pressing need for higher-quality evidence to guide clinical practice relating to the diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis, and to better define the natural history of disease progression in each organ system. A large body of related data has been published, but very few of these studies were properly designed to guide clinical practice. Nonetheless, this document establishes the standards of care based on a rigorous and unbiased analysis of the available data and provides direction for future investigations to further refine clinical practice to improve diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis.

### Approach to tapering antisarcoidosis therapy [^111wSTy1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease that commonly affects the lung. The natural course of the disease and prognosis can vary from asymptomatic spontaneous remission to progressive disease, which requires treatment. Once treatment is initiated, tapering therapy can be problematic.

Corticosteroids are recommended as first-line therapy, but the optimal regimen and duration of treatment are not well established. Treatment may differ based on the severity of the disease, extrapulmonary involvement, and physician and patient preferences. We reviewed currently recommended regimens, particularly in pulmonary sarcoidosis, and the use of alternative treatments as corticosteroid-sparing agents.

Corticosteroid use is quite effective as initial therapy but is associated with significant side effects. An approach to tapering sarcoidosis therapy is not standardized, given the lack of evidence-based data. This review provides guidance based on the literature.

### Hybrid, high-dose dual and bismuth quadruple therapies for first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in Taiwan: A multicenter, open-label, randomized trial [^1138TVyW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The study aimed to compare the efficacies and safety of 14-day hybrid therapy, 14-day high-dose dual therapy, and 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy in the first-line treatment of *Helicobacter pylori* infections.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized trial, we recruited adult *H. pylori*-infected patients from 9 centers in Taiwan. Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 14-day hybrid therapy, 14-day high-dose dual therapy, or 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy. Eradication status was determined by the^13C-urea breath test. The primary outcome was the eradication rate of *H. pylori* assessed in the intention-to-treat population.

- **Results**: Between August 1, 2018, and December 2021, 918 patients were randomly assigned in this study. The intention-to-treat eradication rates were 91.5% (280/306; 95% confidence interval [CI] 88.4%-94.6%) for 14-day hybrid therapy, 83.3% (255/306; 95% CI 87.8%-95.0%) for 14-day high-dose dual therapy, and 90.2% (276/306; 95% CI 87.8%-95.0%) for 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy. Both hybrid therapy (difference 8.2%; 95% CI 4.5%-11.9%; P = 0.002) and bismuth quadruple therapy (difference 6.9%; 95% CI 1.6%-12.2%; P = 0.012) were superior to high-dose dual therapy and were similar to one another. The frequency of adverse events was 27% (81/303) with 14-day hybrid therapy, 13% (40/305) with 14-day high-dose dual therapy, and 32% (96/303) with 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy. Patients receiving high-dose dual therapy had the fewest adverse events (both P < 0.001).

- **Discussion**: Fourteen-day hybrid therapy and 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy showed superior eradication rates compared to 14-day high-dose dual therapy, with similar effectiveness between the two. The high-dose dual therapy had the lowest frequency of adverse events, suggesting it might be better tolerated despite its lower effectiveness.

### The management of sarcoidosis in the 2020s by the primary care physician [^113PhBj7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic granulomatous disease that occurs worldwide and can affect any organ. Because the presenting symptoms of sarcoidosis are not specific to the disease, the primary care physician is usually the first provider to assess these patients. Additionally, patients who have previously been diagnosed with sarcoidosis are typically followed longitudinally by primary care physicians. Therefore, these physicians are often the first to address sarcoidosis patient symptoms related to exacerbations of the disease and the first to observe complications of sarcoidosis medications. This article outlines the approach to the evaluation, treatment, and monitoring of sarcoidosis patients by the primary care physician.

### Sarcoidosis as a systemic disease [^113sLnyc]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease characterized by abnormal localized collections of chronic inflammatory cells, with the formation of granulomas being cardinal. These granulomas can result in nodules within the tissue of any organ but are most commonly found in the lungs and lymph nodes. Importantly, the granulomas are nonnecrotizing. The disease may present as either asymptomatic or chronic, with its onset being gradual. It may improve or clear up spontaneously.

Clinical features include specific and nonspecific cutaneous lesions, which are significant as they often precede systemic manifestations. Sarcoidosis can affect multiple systems, including respiratory, liver, spleen, musculoskeletal, ocular, cardiac, and neurologic systems.

### Hellenic consensus on infection [^116g9LRC]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

A concomitant non-bismuth quadruple regimen, for at least 10 days, is currently the preferred treatment option in Greece, providing acceptable eradication rates when used as first-line therapy.

- **Recommendation grade**: A; **Evidence level**: 1b; **Agreement level**: 100%

In recent years, non-bismuth quadruple regimens have shown higher efficacy in many trials and are currently a viable option, especially in countries like Greece where bismuth is not available. This finding was reproduced by two prospective randomized trials that compared concomitant and sequential regimens of the same duration (10 days). In both trials, a concomitant regimen reached an eradication rate of over 90% per protocol, significantly better compared to a sequential regimen, which had less than 85% efficacy. However, in another open-label controlled trial from Greece, even though the eradication rate for the concomitant regimen (over 90%) was higher compared to the sequential (88%), the difference did not reach statistical significance.

A sub-analysis linking outcomes with antibiotic resistance showed that the concomitant regimen performed significantly better in metronidazole-resistant strains. This finding was also confirmed by a recent updated systematic review and meta-analysis comparing sequential vs. concomitant regimens. In addition, in one RCT, an optimized 14-day sequential regimen containing a high dose of a second-generation PPI (esomeprazole 40 mg bid) achieved high eradication rates in both per-protocol (93.9%) and intention-to-treat (91.3%) analyses in a population that included.

### 10-day versus 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication of infection: a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^117GkSe8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Bismuth quadruple therapy is currently the consensus recommendation for first-line Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) treatment; however, the optimal duration is unknown. We compared the efficacy of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy with that of 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication.

- **Methods**: For our multicenter, parallel randomized, open-label, non-inferiority study, we recruited H. pylori treatment-naïve patients from one medical center and one teaching hospital in Taiwan. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 10-day (PBMT-10) or 14-day (PBMT-14) bismuth quadruple therapy. The primary outcome was the eradication rate determined by intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses. The eradication rates between the two groups were compared using a one-sided α value of 0.025 and a non-inferiority margin of 7%. The secondary outcomes were the rate of adverse effects. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04527055).

- **Findings**: From August 3, 2020, to April 28, 2023, 313 H. pylori treatment-naïve patients (PBMT-10 = 157; PBMT-14 = 156) were enrolled. Thirty-five patients were excluded from PP analyses. The eradication rates (95% CI) for PBMT-10 and PBMT-14 were 92.4% (88.2%-96.5%) and 92.9% (88.9%-97.0%) by ITT analyses, and 97.9% (95.5%-100.0%) and 99.3% (97.8%-100.0%) by PP analyses, respectively. The eradication rates for PBMT-10 were non-inferior to those for PBMT-14 (absolute difference [lower boundary of the one-sided 97.5% CI] -0.6% [-6.7%], P NI = 0.020 in ITT analyses, -1.4% [-5.8%], P NI = 0.007 in PP analyses).

### 10-day versus 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication of infection: a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^11413aTx]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) causes dyspeptic symptoms, peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. H. pylori eradication therapy reduces the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and peptic ulcer disease. However, H. pylori eradication rates have been falling in most regions of the world due to rising antimicrobial resistance rates.

Bismuth quadruple therapy, which consists of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole, is currently the recommended first-line therapy for H. pylori infection. However, the optimum duration is unknown, and the level of evidence for treatment duration is very low. It is known that longer treatment durations for H. pylori eradication achieve higher cure rates. Sequential therapy extending from 10 days to 14 days potentially has better eradication efficacy. Nevertheless, previous studies found that 10-day standard bismuth quadruple therapy achieved high efficacy for first-line H. pylori eradication, as determined by intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses (≥ 90%) and per-protocol (PP) analyses (≥ 95%); thus, extending bismuth quadruple therapy from 10 days to 14 days might have a limited effect on the eradication rate.

Females have higher antibiotic resistance rates in H. pylori infection than males. It is uncertain whether shorter antibiotic courses have differences in eradication efficacy by sex. Additionally, there are concerns that a longer duration could result in more adverse events, poorer medication adherence, and higher costs.

### Difficult treatment issues in sarcoidosis [^112f9r6J]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The management of sarcoidosis includes several crucial decisions. Not all patients with sarcoidosis need treatment. At least a third of patients will never be treated. It is unclear whether asymptomatic patients ever need therapy, even if they have extensive lung disease. One reason that clinicians are reluctant to start therapy is that many patients who are started on corticosteroids have a difficult time getting off therapy, even after two years.

In the chronic patient, alternatives to corticosteroids have been developed. These include drugs such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and hydroxychloroquine. These agents have been the standard second line of therapy for patients with chronic disease. However, these drugs do not always work. In addition, they are associated with their own toxicities.

Another group of sarcoidosis patients have also emerged. These are the refractory patients, who have progressive disease while on therapy. For these patients, new agents such as thalidomide and the monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor have been occasionally helpful.

This paper reviews several important issues in the management of sarcoidosis.

### Rescue therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication: A randomized non-inferiority trial of amoxicillin or tetracycline in bismuth quadruple therapy [^117LM3zs]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). High credibility.

To compare the efficacy and safety of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy with tetracycline or amoxicillin for rescue treatment of *Helicobacter pylori*, a non-inferiority trial was conducted after at least two previous treatment failures. Subjects were randomized to receive 14-day therapy consisting of b.i.d. lansoprazole 30 mg and bismuth 220 mg, plus metronidazole 400 mg q.i.d., and amoxicillin 1 g t.i.d. (amoxicillin group) or tetracycline 500 mg q.i.d. (tetracycline group). Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by the agar-dilution method. The primary outcome measured was *H. pylori* eradication at 6 weeks after treatment.

In total, 312 subjects were randomized; 13 were lost to follow-up, and 29 violated the protocol. The intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and modified intention-to-treat eradication rates in the amoxicillin group were 88.5% (138/156, 95% confidence interval (CI) 83.4–93.5%), 93.7% (133/142, 95% CI 89.7–97.7%), and 92.6% (138/149, 95% CI 88.4–96.8%), respectively. In the tetracycline group, these rates were 87.2% (136/156, 95% CI 81.9–92.4%), 95.3% (122/128, 95% CI 91.7–99.0%), and 90.7% (136/150, 95% CI 86.0–95.3%). Amoxicillin-, tetracycline-, and metronidazole-resistant rates were 8.3%, 1.0%, and 87.8%, respectively. Non-inferiority was confirmed (P < 0.025), and metronidazole resistance did not affect the efficacy of either therapy. Compliance was greater, and moderate and severe adverse events were less frequent among those receiving amoxicillin than those receiving tetracycline.

### Efzofitimod for the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis [^1128n4wU]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

- **Take-home points**:

	- **Research question**: What is the tolerability of efzofitimod for pulmonary sarcoidosis, and can we discern any evidence of clinical efficacy to support a larger trial?

	- **Results**: No differences were found in adverse effects or tolerability between participants randomized to efzofitimod or placebo. Patient-reported outcomes improved in the higher-dose arms, and positive trends for other endpoints were found.

	- **Interpretation**: Efzofitimod may be useful for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Larger studies are needed to confirm and extend these findings.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem, granulomatous disorder that most commonly affects the lungs. Patients often demonstrate organ-specific symptoms such as dyspnea and cough but also show a range of other disabling nonspecific symptoms (e.g. fatigue) that have a major impact on quality of life (QOL). For patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, the goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of death or permanent disability (danger) or to improve the patient's QOL, while secondarily managing the inflammation that may lead to pulmonary fibrosis and irreversible loss of lung function. The consensus standard of care includes oral corticosteroids that act mainly by suppressing inflammatory genes. Although corticosteroid therapy has been shown to stabilize or improve the disease, long-term corticosteroid use is associated with significant side effects, including substantial weight gain, development of insulin resistance, risk of infection, and impaired QOL. Alternatives, such as immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents (e.g. methotrexate), can be…

### Phase II investigation of the efficacy of antimycobacterial therapy in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis [^111xhNhC]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

Adults aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, as defined by the 1999 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders statement on sarcoidosis, were eligible for enrollment. Participants were also selected based on demonstration of pulmonary disease progression according to at least one of the following three criteria: (1) a decline of the absolute percentage of predicted FVC or diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of at least 5% on serial measurements over 24 months; (2) radiographic progression in chest imaging on side-by-side comparison; or (3) a decline in dyspnea score, as measured by using the Transition Dyspnea Index.

Prior to randomization, participants were assessed for peripheral immune responses to ESAT-6 or evidence of peripheral anergy, as defined by absence of responses to phytohemagglutinin. If either of those conditions were present, the subject was enrolled. Finally, participants were required to have evidence of parenchymal or nodal disease on chest radiograph. Site-specific pulmonologists, who were unaffiliated with the CLEAR trial, read all site-specific lung function tests.

### Comparative study of allicin-containing quadruple therapy vs. bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: a prospective randomized study [^112YEGDS]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Bismuth has antimicrobial activity and can improve the efficacy of triple Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) therapy. Allicin added to conventional therapy for H. pylori infection also improves H. pylori eradication rates. Thus, this study aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of allicin-containing quadruple therapy and bismuth-containing quadruple therapy and to investigate the factors that affect the eradication rates.

- **Methods**: Two hundred twenty H. pylori-infected patients were included and randomly (1:1) assigned to 14-day quadruple therapy: ilaprazole (5 mg bid), doxycycline (100 mg bid), and furazolidone (100 mg bid) with an allicin soft capsule (40 mg of DATS tid) (IDFA) or colloidal bismuth tartrate (220 mg of elemental bismuth bid) (IDFB). Eradication was confirmed by urea breath tests. Symptom improvement, adverse events, and adherence were assessed by a questionnaire.

- **Results**: In the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis, the eradication rates for IDFA and IDFB groups were 87.5% (70/80) vs. 86.3% (69/80, P = 0.815) and 91.9% (68/74) vs. 91.8% (67/73, P = 0.980) as first-line therapies; 83.3% (25/30) vs. 83.3% (25/30, P = 1) and 89.3% (25/28) vs. 88.9% (24/27, P = 1) as second-line therapies. Symptom improvement rates were 96.1% and 97.0% for IDFA and IDFB (P = 1). The adverse event rates were 10.9% in IDFA and 14.5% in IDFB groups (P = 0.418). Nausea occurred more frequently in IDFB than IDFA (1.8% vs. 8.2%, P = 0.030). Smoking and sharing utensils significantly affected the efficacy.

- **Conclusion**: Allicin-containing quadruple therapy is an effective alternative to bismuth-containing therapy for H. pylori eradication, with comparable safety and tolerability.

### Corticosteroid refractory sarcoidosis [^111Gigq8]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A sarcoidosis patient may be refractory to corticosteroid therapy. This may occur because corticosteroids are ineffective in relieving the patient's symptoms or dysfunction, or because the clinician has determined that the risks of corticosteroids outweigh their benefits. Interestingly, when corticosteroids truly fail to improve a sarcoidosis patient's condition, it is very rarely due to the failure of the drug as an anti-granulomatous agent. Rather, it is usually because the patient's symptoms are unrelated to active sarcoid granulomas.

In this manuscript, we review the causes of corticosteroid refractory sarcoidosis. The clinician should consider these causes when confronted with a sarcoidosis patient who is either not responding to corticosteroids, developing corticosteroid side effects, or is at significant risk of developing such side effects. We believe that determining the cause of corticosteroid refractory sarcoidosis may aid clinicians in optimizing the care of sarcoidosis patients and assist clinical researchers in appropriately stratifying patients for clinical trials.

### Approaches to the treatment of some of the troublesome manifestations of sarcoidosis [^117BpePs]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis can be a major therapeutic challenge given its multiplicity of clinical presentations, variable combination of organ involvement and severity, and unpredictable longitudinal behavior. Six manifestations of sarcoidosis are especially difficult to manage due to:

- **An incomplete knowledge of causation**: Fatigue and small fiber neuropathy.
- **The rare occurrence in sarcoidosis**: Intra-abdominal complications.
- **Potentially life-threatening consequences in some patients**: Neurological disease, pulmonary hypertension, and hypercalcemia.

In none of these situations have prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of any therapy been conducted. Despite the absence of any firm evidence base to support therapeutic recommendations, these six entities can be extremely problematic for the practicing clinician. It is for this reason that we have focused in this review on these six disease manifestations and provided a synopsis of each problem, together with suggested treatment approaches based on an analysis of the literature.

### Ten-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy vs standard 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy for first-line Helicobacter pylori eradication: A multicenter randomized clinical trial [^112aBW9p]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

The study on VA dual therapy for H. pylori was published by Tian-Lian Yan and colleagues in 2024 in the journal American Journal of Gastroenterology. This study is related to Helicobacter pylori infection. The trial question was whether short course vonoprazan/amoxicillin dual therapy is noninferior to standard bismuth-based quadruple therapy in patients with H. pylori infection. The study design was a multi-center, open-label, RCT, involving a population of 314 patients (180 female, 134 male). Inclusion criteria included treatment-naïve patients with H. pylori infection. Key exclusion criteria were: prior administration of antibiotics, bismuth, or acid inhibitors 4 weeks before inclusion; pregnancy or lactation; allergy to study drugs; history of gastrectomy; gastric malignancy; gastroduodenal ulcer with recent hemorrhage or signs of hemorrhage within 4 weeks.

- **Interventions**: n = 157 received VA-dual therapy (vonoprazan/amoxicillin dual therapy for 10 days), and n = 157 received B-quadruple therapy (bismuth-based quadruple therapy for 14 days).
- **Primary outcome**: The difference in the H. pylori eradication rate did not exceed the non-inferiority margin in the intention-to-treat analysis (86% vs. 89.2%; ARD -3.2, 95% CI -10.5 to 4.1).
- **Secondary outcomes**: There was no significant difference in H. pylori eradication rate in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.

### Drug-induced comorbidities in patients with sarcoidosis [^115maMXa]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical impact of pharmacologic sarcoidosis treatment is significant. The major goals in treating sarcoidosis are lowering the morbidity and mortality risk and improving quality of life (QoL). The drugs currently used to treat various manifestations of sarcoidosis, often immunosuppressive, are liable to cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and sometimes substantial comorbidities. These comorbidities further increase the burden of this disease and affect the QoL. The ADR profile associated with the treatment of sarcoidosis varies greatly from one patient to the next, as does the efficacy of treatments, so a simple treatment algorithm that works for all patients is not feasible. In general, there are three lines of therapy for sarcoidosis.

### Phase II investigation of the efficacy of antimycobacterial therapy in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis [^114LHJbH]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

Patients were assigned to receive the CLEAR or placebo regimen using block randomization stratified according to site and use of prednisone ≥ 10 mg. Randomization lists were generated and distributed to site pharmacies by a statistician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center not associated with the study.

- **Measurement of treatment completion**: Patients were requested to bring all remaining doses of every trial drug to each visit for pill counts. Treatment completion for the per-protocol analysis was defined as administration of at least 90% of the doses within 16 weeks.

- **Measurement of safety during treatment**: At each follow-up visit, participants were questioned and examined for adverse events. Suspected adverse events were investigated, managed, and reported according to a standardized protocol. Information about suspected adverse events was reviewed and graded by the site-specific principal investigator and clinical coordinator. The severity of adverse events was judged according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Events were categorized as follows: an adverse event not related to a trial drug; an adverse event of grade 1 or 2 related to a trial drug (not serious); an adverse event of grade 3 or 4 related to a trial drug (generally leading to trial drug discontinuation if related to a trial drug); or a grade 5 event (death) related to a trial drug. Each adverse event resulting in organ impairment, hospitalization, or death was defined as a serious adverse event (SAE).

### Can sarcoidosis be cured [^11431CC3]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause that almost invariably affects the lungs. The clinical course and outcomes of pulmonary sarcoidosis are highly variable, ranging from mild and self-limiting to organ-threatening or life-threatening disease. Often, sarcoidosis remits permanently (spontaneously or following treatment), although disease resolution rates vary depending on demographic factors, mode of presentation, organs involved, and disease duration.

Corticosteroids are the initial drugs of choice for the treatment of sarcoidosis. However, corticosteroid toxicity is common and causes significant morbidity and mortality; therefore, their use should be minimized. Certain phenotypes of sarcoidosis are more likely to undergo disease termination than others. In addition, certain pharmacologic maneuvers may be useful in terminating the disease, but these remain exploratory at this time. Future clinical and basic research of such phenotypes may lead to the discovery of immunopathogenic mechanisms involved in sarcoidosis disease termination.

### Concomitant, bismuth quadruple, and 14-day triple therapy in the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori: a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial [^115ETLrT]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Whether concomitant therapy is superior to bismuth quadruple therapy or 14-day triple therapy for the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection remains poorly understood. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of 10-day concomitant therapy, 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy, and 14-day triple therapy in the first-line treatment of H. pylori.

- **Methods**: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised trial, we recruited adult patients (aged > 20 years) with H. pylori infection from nine medical centres in Taiwan. Patients who had at least two positive tests from the rapid urease test, histology, culture, or serology, or who had a single positive 13 C-urea breath test for gastric cancer screening were eligible for enrolment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either concomitant therapy (lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg, and metronidazole 500 mg, all given twice daily) for 10 days; bismuth quadruple therapy (bismuth tripotassium dicitrate 300 mg four times a day, lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily, tetracycline 500 mg four times a day, and metronidazole 500 mg three times a day) for 10 days; or triple therapy (lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg, all given twice daily) for 14 days. A computer-generated permuted block randomisation sequence with a block size of 6 was used for randomisation, and the sequence was concealed in an opaque envelope until the intervention was assigned. Investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the eradication frequency of H. pylori with first-line therapy.

### Hit-hard and early versus step-up treatment in severe sarcoidosis [^1149N8Pc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids have been used for sarcoidosis for over 70 years. Even now, they remain the most commonly used medication for systemic management. Corticosteroids are highly effective, inexpensive, easily titrated, work quickly, are perceived to require less monitoring than other agents, and are familiar to patients as well as prescribers. They have the added advantage in some patients of increasing energy, enhancing the sense of well-being, and ameliorating nonspecific symptoms such as arthralgias, at least when first prescribed. Additionally, corticosteroids have been studied in various forms of sarcoidosis over the past six decades. As such, corticosteroids are still deemed by expert opinion to be the first-line therapy for all forms of sarcoidosis that require systemic treatment. It should be noted that these opinions are not based on controlled data but rather on the absence of head-to-head comparisons between corticosteroids and other agents.

Although sarcoidosis experts typically advocate for earlier inclusion of steroid-sparing agents in treatment algorithms, in practice, steroid-sparing agents are prescribed for much less than half of treatment-requiring patients. Long-term management typically entails higher prednisone doses than the commonly referenced prednisone goal of less than 10 mg/day; for example, the mean daily dose in two randomized pulmonary sarcoidosis trials was approximately 13 mg/day. In an unselected cohort from our institution, the median treatment duration among all treated patients was 8 months.

### Cytotoxic agents in sarcoidosis: Which one should we choose [^111B1bdg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease which affects multiple organs. Its therapeutic management is very challenging due to the heterogeneity in disease manifestation and clinical course, as well as the potential side effects of the immunosuppressive therapy. An overview of presently available second-line and third-line systemic agents is provided.

Because curative treatment is currently not available for sarcoidosis, nonspecific immunosuppression with prednisone remains the first-choice therapy. However, as chronic use of corticosteroids is accompanied by severe adverse events, timely implementation of appropriate steroid-sparing cytotoxic agents is important. Commonly prescribed second-line agents in sarcoidosis are methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, and hydroxychloroquine. Nevertheless, the evidence supporting their use is limited. Third-line treatment options, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors infliximab and adalimumab, and the experimental therapeutic rituximab, are currently reserved for patients refractory to standard therapy.

A better insight into the advantages and disadvantages of second-line and third-line treatment is important. The long-term effects of immunosuppressive agents, the optimal starting and maintenance dosages, and the best interval and discontinuation regimens should be elucidated. Identified associations of polymorphisms with treatment response suggest a step towards personalized medicine. Future research should focus on the role of pharmacogenetic and phenotypic predictors of treatment response in sarcoidosis.

### Drug-induced comorbidities in patients with sarcoidosis [^113RKgBt]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

A pivotal aspect of sarcoidosis management is to regularly consider how to reduce the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of glucocorticoids (GCs). Besides reducing GC doses by combining them with immunosuppressive drugs, new strategies to optimize treatment need to be explored, including lifestyle changes, physical therapy, and dietary guidance. For instance, a flavonoid-rich diet in conjunction with GCs has been reported to increase the efficacy of the GC therapy, thereby reducing the dose required for an anti-inflammatory effect. The benefits of flavonoids and other antioxidant supplements may be related to the restoration of normal antioxidant levels in patients with sarcoidosis.

Pharmacogenomics (PGx) may lead to a more accurate drug management regime aimed at preventing unnecessary ADRs, increasing the efficacy of the drug, and improving quality of life (QoL). There is a need to develop trials investigating the role of genetic variations not only in disease susceptibility and predicting prognosis but also in treatment response and tailoring drug treatment to individual patients. Such investigations can help bridge the gap between 'personalized' and 'evidence-based' medicine. Improved recognition and a high index of suspicion are key to a proper diagnosis of ADRs and the prompt withdrawal of the offending drug. Awareness of these drug-induced disorders can play a vital role in preventing lengthy immunosuppressive therapies, as the main goal of management is drug cessation.

Polypharmacy is a growing iatrogenic condition precipitated by both medical necessity and external pressures.
