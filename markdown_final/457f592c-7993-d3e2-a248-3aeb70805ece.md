## Question

Are there any cities on hydrotherapy for depression or anxiety?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are any cities that use hydrotherapy for depression or anxiety. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "hydrotherapy" means in this context and distinguish it from general aquatic exercise. Then, I should verify whether any of the provided studies or guidelines explicitly describe city-level programs or policies endorsing hydrotherapy for depression or anxiety. Next, I will check for indirect signals, such as community-based aquatic interventions or urban mental health initiatives that might overlap. Finally, I will synthesize the strength of evidence and state a clear conclusion with caveats and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate concepts. Hydrotherapy typically refers to therapeutic exercise or rehabilitation in water, often in warm pools, and is distinct from simply swimming or open-water activities; in the provided corpus, hydrotherapy appears in contexts like fibromyalgia, axial spondyloarthritis, and chronic low back pain, with some studies measuring anxiety or depression as secondary outcomes rather than primary targets of a city program [^114nr6w1] [^115aUHFo].

> Wait, let me verify whether any document explicitly describes a city implementing hydrotherapy for depression or anxiety. I need to check for named cities, municipal policies, or public health programs. On review, I do not find any study or guideline that identifies a specific city with a formal hydrotherapy program aimed at treating depression or anxiety; instead, the evidence base is largely clinical trials, systematic reviews, or disease-specific guidelines that evaluate aquatic exercise or balneotherapy in healthcare settings rather than urban public health initiatives.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider indirect signals. Some network meta-analyses and reviews evaluate "community-based" nonpharmacologic interventions, including aquatic exercise, for anxiety and depression, but they do not specify municipal sponsorship or city-wide implementation, so I cannot infer city programs from that wording alone. Similarly, urban mental health literature discusses environmental determinants and community interventions, but I do not see hydrotherapy featured as a city-endorsed strategy in those sources [^115FvD3k] [^111CkU7Y].

> I should double-check whether any guideline recommends hydrotherapy as a first-line treatment for depression or anxiety in general populations. The ASCO/SIO integrative oncology guidelines and WHO mhGAP prioritize psychotherapy, mindfulness, exercise, and related modalities, but they do not elevate hydrotherapy to a recommended intervention for depression or anxiety, reinforcing that there is no city-level endorsement in these high-credibility documents [^1131hRbM] [^11644Lxx].

> But wait, what if the question is about feasibility or analogies rather than documented programs? Let me reconsider. While a city could theoretically implement aquatic exercise programs for mental health, the provided references do not document such municipal initiatives, so any claim that cities are using hydrotherapy for depression or anxiety would go beyond the current evidence base in this packet.

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Based on the provided sources, there are no documented cities implementing hydrotherapy programs specifically for depression or anxiety; the evidence around aquatic exercise and balneotherapy is clinical and condition-specific, with promising signals in some populations but no city-level policy or programmatic endorsement captured here [^116RDCou].

I can't find any **cities that officially use hydrotherapy** for depression or anxiety in the provided references. The evidence shows aquatic exercise can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in specific populations (e.g. fibromyalgia [^116RDCou], chronic pain [^1124otJy], pregnancy [^114HfRtt]), but there are **no city-level programs or policies** documented here. If you're interested in real-world implementations, I recommend checking with local health departments or community centers for any aquatic mental health initiatives.

## Evidence for hydrotherapy in depression and anxiety

Several studies and reviews suggest aquatic exercise and hydrotherapy can reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms:

- **Fibromyalgia**: Aquatic exercise showed large improvements in anxiety (SMD −1.14) and depression (SMD −1.18) versus usual care in a network meta-analysis of 29 RCTs [^116RDCou].

- **Chronic pain**: Water-based interventions (balneotherapy/hydrotherapy) had small but significant effects on depressive symptoms in fibromyalgia (SMD −0.31) [^1124otJy].

- **Pregnancy**: Moderate-intensity aquatic exercise during pregnancy reduced postpartum anxiety and depressive symptoms in RCTs [^114HfRtt].

- **Case report**: Weekly open-water swimming led to sustained remission of major depressive disorder and anxiety, allowing medication cessation [^114Pqp5T].

---

## Limitations and gaps in the evidence

Despite these findings, **key limitations** remain:

- **Population specificity**: Most evidence is in fibromyalgia, chronic pain, or pregnancy; generalizability to broader populations is limited.

- **Lack of city-level data**: No studies in the provided references evaluate city-wide hydrotherapy programs for depression or anxiety.

- **Methodological variability**: Heterogeneity in interventions, outcomes, and quality limits firm conclusions.

---

## City-level initiatives and programs

I can't find any **city-level programs or policies** in the provided references that specifically implement hydrotherapy for depression or anxiety. The evidence is clinical or community-based rather than municipal. If you're interested in real-world implementations, I recommend checking with local health departments or community centers for any aquatic mental health initiatives.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines (APA, WHO, VA/DoD) do not currently recommend hydrotherapy as a **first-line treatment** for depression or anxiety. They emphasize psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and some complementary approaches (e.g. exercise, mindfulness, yoga) [^115FXR4W] [^11644Lxx] [^115fh6aY].

---

## Practical considerations for implementation

If a city were to consider hydrotherapy programs, several factors would need attention:

- **Infrastructure**: Access to pools, safety, and maintenance.

- **Training**: Qualified staff to deliver aquatic interventions.

- **Funding**: Sustainable financial models.

- **Evidence base**: More robust, population-wide studies are needed.

---

## Conclusion

There is **no documented evidence** in the provided references of cities officially using hydrotherapy for depression or anxiety, even though aquatic exercise shows promise in specific populations. Further research and policy development are needed before widespread municipal adoption.

### Influence of prenatal aquatic activities on fetal outcomes and maternal physical and mental outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114HfRtt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Aquatic activities refer to exercise conducted in water, which can include swimming and other water programs are considered safe and comfortable for pregnant women, offering advantages over weight-bearing exercise on land. These activities provide a sense of weightlessness and ease of movement, better thermoregulation due to immersion in water, hydrostatic pressure that alleviates pregnancy-induced edema, and prevention and treatment of low back pain. To date, several different forms of water exercise programs have been invented and applied in research studies and clinical trials, such as AquaMama program and SWEP method. The former was developed by The Danish Rheumatism Association in 2011 and aims to strengthen the larger muscle groups, whereas the latter is an aquatic program of strength and endurance exercises designed especially for pregnant women.

A recent meta-analysis revealed that exercise-only interventions, but not exercise combined with other interventions, reduced the severity of prenatal depressive symptoms and the odds of prenatal depression compared with no exercise. However, prenatal exercise did not significantly alter the odds of postpartum depression, nor did it affect the severity of depressive or anxiety symptoms during or following pregnancy. While this research highlights the benefits of general exercise during pregnancy, it combined all forms of exercise without isolating the specific advantages of aquatic activities. Another meta-analysis focused on the effects of aquatic exercise during pregnancy demonstrated such programs prevent excessive weight gain and improve balance and mobility in pregnant women.

New published clinical trials have shown that moderate-intensity aquatic exercise during pregnancy decreases postpartum anxiety and depressive symptoms in mothers and is safe for both mothers and their newborns. Given these findings, it is necessary to update meta-analyses to comprehensively analyze the impact of aquatic exercise on maternal physical and psychological health during pregnancy, as well as on fetal outcomes.

### Virtual reality distraction for procedural pain management and… [^115S2knt]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a virtual reality prototype developed specifically for the hydrotherapy room of children under seven years old for the relief of procedural pain and anxiety in children with burn injuries. HYPOTHESES: a) VR distraction is a feasible non-pharmacological intervention for pain management during hydrotherapy, b) VR distraction combined with analgesics is more efficacious than standard treatment on procedural pain and anxiety of young children with burn injuries. The management of acute pain experienced during hydrotherapy sessions in patients with burn injuries, called procedural pain, remains a major challenge for healthcare professionals. Pain can have several short term effects on the child on the development, mood, sleep, appetite, school performance, anxiety and distress levels.

In the long term, it can decrease the pain threshold, cause stress disorders, affect social behavior and seeking of medical services. Also, despite the growing use of opioids, patients report pain of more than 7 on a scale of 0–10 during their dressing changes and hydrotherapy sessions. Multimodal approaches combining medication and non-pharmacological interventions should be explored to reduce pain and anxiety associated with painful procedures. The size of the total desired sample is 15 to 20 participants depending on the recruitment rate since it is a pilot study. The study will take place in the hydrotherapy room of the CHU St. Justine, a large pediatric university teaching hospital in Montreal where the VR prototype is installed.
4. 3. Measures. Measures of baseline pain and anxiety will be recorded at T1, 30 minutes before the procedure, in the patient's room.

Measures for procedural pain, anxiety and sedation level will be taken at: T2, before the procedure, upon arrival in the hydrotherapy room, T3, during the procedure, T4, immediately after the procedure before leaving the hydrotherapy room and T5, 30 minutes after the procedure in the patient's room. The patient's comfort level will also be assessed during the procedure at T3. Finally, the acceptability of the intervention will be assessed through a questionnaire comprising items on the acceptability and satisfaction of the healthcare professionals at T4. The same measures will be recorded for each participant for up to three hydrotherapy sessions. The primary outcome will be the acceptability of the intervention. Comparisons will be made between pain and anxiety levels for the same order of session.

### Reiki for depression and anxiety [^114fqcDm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anxiety and depression affect many people. Treatments do not have complete success and often require people to take drugs for long periods of time. Many people look for other treatments that may help. One of those is Reiki, a 2500 year old treatment described as a vibrational or subtle energy therapy, and is most commonly facilitated by light touch on or above the body. There have been reports of Reiki alleviating anxiety and depression, but no specific systematic review.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of Reiki for treating anxiety and depression in people aged 16 and over.

Search Methods

Search of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - all years), the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR - all years), EMBASE, (1974 to November 2014), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to November 2014) and AMED (1985 to November 2014). Additional searches were carried out on the World Health Organization Trials Portal (ICTRP) together with ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any ongoing or unpublished studies. All searches were up to date as of 4 November 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials in adults with anxiety or depression or both, with at least one arm treated with Reiki delivered by a trained Reiki practitioner.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently decided on inclusion/exclusion of studies and extracted data. A prior analysis plan had been specified but was not needed as the data were too sparse.

Main Results

We found three studies for inclusion in the review. One recruited males with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of non-metastatic prostate cancer who were not receiving chemotherapy and had elected to receive external-beam radiation therapy; the second study recruited community-living participants who were aged 55 years and older; the third study recruited university students. These studies included subgroups with anxiety and depression as defined by symptom scores and provided data separately for those subgroups. As this included only 25 people with anxiety and 17 with depression and 20 more with either anxiety or depression, but which was not specified, the results could only be reported narratively. They show no evidence that Reiki is either beneficial or harmful in this population. The risk of bias for the included studies was generally rated as unclear or high for most domains, which reduces the certainty of the evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to say whether or not Reiki is useful for people over 16 years of age with anxiety or depression or both.

### The impact of community-based, non-pharmaceutical interventions on anxiety and depression in fibromyalgia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116RDCou]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is often accompanied by anxiety and depression, seriously affecting the prognosis of patients. Active non-pharmacological therapies are the mainstay of treatment, but the optimal choice is still contentious.

Methods

We did a network meta-analysis(NMA) of RCTs and compared 7 community-based non-pharmacological interventions based on 29 studies. We searched Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from the database inception to March 2022.

Results

The NMA demonstrated that five out of six (83.34%) non-pharmacological interventions were associated with significant improvement in anxiety compared with usual care, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) ranging from -1.14 (95% CI: -1.76 to -0.51) for aquatic exercise to -0.39 (95% CI: 073–0.05) for meditation; six of the seven non-pharmacological interventions (85.71%) were associated with significant improvement in depression, with SMD ranged from -1.18 (95% CI: -1.68 to -0.68) for aquatic exercise to -0.46 (95% CI: -0.86 to -0.05) for education therapy.

Limitation

First of all, there were scale translation biases in this study caused by the different languages of the original study. In addition, there was a lack of direct comparison between the aquatic exercise group and the routine care group, and the third included intervention measures lacked unified implementation standards.

Conclusion

Aquatic exercise exhibited distinct advantages compared with other community-based non-pharmacological interventions and is likely to have optimal efficacy in improving anxiety and depression. The study protocol is registered with the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD 42022338406).

### Interventions for depressive symptoms in people living with chronic pain: a systematic review of meta-analyses [^1124otJy]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Main Network (Mind-Body, Exercise, Massage and Water Therapy)

The reviews of mind-body interventions examined effects in fibromyalgia and mixed chronic pain, while three unconnected reviews evaluated arthritis and axial pain. The largest significant effect of reducing depressive symptoms was from a moderate quality review of meditation with mixed comparators synthesizing six RCTs with 658 participants (SMD −0.49 [95% CI −1.89 to −0.1]). Overall, mindful movement demonstrated small to medium effects with larger effects in axial pain than in fibromyalgia and also generally larger effects than meditation.

The exercise network only included reviews specific to fibromyalgia, arthritis, and musculoskeletal pain. The single meta-analysis of nine RCTs with 876 participants from a high-quality review reported a small significant effect for exercise-based rehabilitation for arthritis (SMD −0.16 [95% CI −0.29 to −0.02]). The single meta-analysis of 29 RCTs with 2,449 participants from a moderate-quality review of musculoskeletal pain reported a small but significant effect for mixed exercise interventions against mixed comparators over medium/long timeframes (SMD −0.42 [95% CI −0.58 to −0.26]).

Two low- and critically low-quality reviews investigated massage therapy in fibromyalgia. A moderate-quality review investigated water-based interventions (balneotherapy and hydrotherapy) in fibromyalgia. The only meta-analysis here with a significant point estimate showed small effects on depressive symptoms for balneotherapy against inactive comparators at mixed medium/long outcome timeframes and included 205 participants from three RCTs (SMD −0.31 [95% CI −0.59 to −0.03]).

VA/DoD pregnancy guideline — treatment for perinatal depression and anxiety: We recommend offering individual or group Interpersonal Psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy for pregnant patients at risk of perinatal depression. We recommend offering Interpersonal Psychotherapy for treating depression during pregnancy or postpartum. We suggest offering cognitive behavioral therapy for treating depression during pregnancy or postpartum. We suggest offering peer support for people with perinatal depression or risk of perinatal depression to improve depressive symptoms. We suggest exercise, mindfulness, yoga, or any combination of these interventions for depressive symptoms in perinatal patients. We suggest offering psychotherapies (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, Interpersonal Psychotherapy) or yoga or both for anxiety symptoms during and after pregnancy.

### The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis with biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs [^112UfZh8]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Escalation to targeted therapies should not diminish the focus on non-pharmacological management. Although it is beyond the scope of this guideline to make recommendations for non-pharmacological therapies, they are essential for the holistic approach to managing and living well with axSpA. Non-pharmacological and supported self-management strategies should remain at the forefront despite the increasing availability of pharmacological options. The GWG emphasizes the importance of the following:

Physical activity, supervised exercise and physiotherapy are foundational for axSpA management. Supervised therapies have a stronger evidence base, but all forms of regular physical activity are likely to provide axSpA-specific as well as general health benefits.
Aquatic physiotherapy and hydrotherapy are well established in axSpA management and are particularly beneficial for those who cannot tolerate land-based exercises.
Psychological therapies are important to address the high burden of mental health comorbidity among people with axSpA, and can range from remotely delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy to clinical psychology as part of the MDT.
Supported self-management: people with axSpA should be empowered to manage their condition through need-based education, including being directed to appropriate resources for additional information and support.

### Making sense of the evidence in population health intervention research: building a dry stone wall [^112Cci94]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

To take a well-known clinical example, some reviews have found that the type of psychotherapy offered to a patient with depression makes little difference to the outcome. What to do, then? Others, taking a different approach to analysis, have found that the key lies in the quality of the therapeutic relationship established rather than the particular techniques used. Reasoning by analogy, we theorised that in another arena — promoting active travel — the myriad forms of intervention might be underlain by a more limited number of critical functions, such as increasing accessibility or safety, that are generalisable in principle but might be achieved in different ways in different situations. Again, this is as much to do with practical strategies as it is to do with theories, and some public health guidance and government policy already implicitly reflects this way of thinking with references to high-level principles, variable interpretations and the like (examples: table 1).

### Protecting health in dry cities: considerations for policy makers [^116qynxo]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Mental health

Water scarcity threatens mental health in rural populations, related to economic losses from crop failures, humiliation and shame over financial struggles, and social isolation in times of drought. Displaced rural populations may bring these problems when they migrate to cities — compounding the mental health impacts of migration itself. In addition, the constant stress of lack of clean water for domestic use, the burden of having to fetch water from public water points, and the threat of flooding, contribute substantially to anxiety and depression. Often, this burden falls mainly on women, who are responsible for managing water for domestic use. Furthermore, lack of sanitation and water affects women when they are menstruating, after childbirth, and during the menopause, often with deleterious consequences for their health and dignity.

Violence and conflict

Some evidence links high temperatures with aggressive behavior, violent crime, and possibly suicide. Such societal tension can escalate into armed conflict. In addition, several dry cities are in areas with already fragile states. The links between the scarcity of natural resources and armed conflict are controversial, but some studies suggest that intrastate or interstate competition for resources such as water may be increasingly associated with armed conflict. Armed conflict, in turn, undermines the health of both combatants and civilians in many ways.

Child development

Evidence links childhood exposure to drought with poor growth throughout childhoodand with long term effects on health, including disability, in adult life. Several mechanisms may operate, including poorer nutrition due to reduced agricultural output, increased gastrointestinal and respiratory infections due to scarcity of clean water, and reduced resources for childcare and education due to poverty.

Sweetened beverages are an additional pathway from water scarcity to child development. When water is unavailable or expensive, parents may provide their children with sweetened drinks instead, increasing the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Popkin et alfound that providing filtered drinking fountains, water bottles, and advice to children at school led to increased water ingestion by 1.1 glasses a day and to a 31% reduction in their risk of being overweight.

### Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions [^112HHyBF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term physical conditions affect 10% to 12% of children and adolescents worldwide. These individuals are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression, sometimes directly related to their illness or medical care (e.g. health-related anxiety). There is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychological therapies for treating anxiety and depression in this population. Therapies designed for children and adolescents without medical issues may or may not be appropriate for use with those who have long-term physical conditions.

Objectives

This review was undertaken to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapies in comparison with controls (treatment-as-usual, waiting list, attention placebo, psychological placebo, or non-psychological treatment) for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions.

Search Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 27 September 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to May 2016). In addition we searched the Web of Science (Core Collection) (12 October 2018) and conducted a cited reference search for reports of all included trials. We handsearched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and grey literature.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials and cross-over trials of psychological therapies for treating anxiety or depression in children with long-term physical conditions were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Abstracts and complete articles were independently reviewed by two authors. Discrepancies were addressed by a third author. Odds ratio (OR) was used for comparing dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) for comparing continuous data. Meta-analysis was undertaken when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were similar. Otherwise, narrative analysis of data was undertaken.

Main Results

Twenty-eight RCTs and one cross-over trial with 1349 participants were included in the review. Most participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high-income countries. For the primary outcome of treatment efficacy, short-term depression (versus any control), there was low-quality evidence from 16 trials involving 1121 participants suggesting that psychological therapies may be more effective than control therapies (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.03; I² = 79%). For the primary outcome of treatment efficacy, short-term anxiety (versus any control), there was inadequate evidence of moderate-quality from 13 studies involving 578 participants to determine whether psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions (SMD -0.26, CI -0.59 to 0.07, I² = 72%). Planned sensitivity analyses could not be undertaken for risk of bias due to the small number of trials that rated high for each domain. Additional sensitivity analysis demonstrated that psychological interventions specifically designed to reduce anxiety or depression were more effective than psychological therapies designed to improve other symptoms or general coping. There was some suggestion from subgroup analyses that they type of intervention (Chi² = 14.75, df = 5 (P = 0.01), I² = 66.1%), the severity of depression (Chi² = 23.29, df = 4 (P = 0.0001), I² = 82.8%) and the type of long-term physical condition (Chi² = 10.55, df = 4 (P = 0.03), I² = 62.1%) may have an impact on the overall treatment effect. There was qualitative (reported), but not quantitative evidence confirming the acceptability of selected psychological therapies for anxiety and depression. There was low-quality evidence that psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions in improving quality of life (SMD 1.13, CI 0.44 to 1.82, I² = 89%) and symptoms of long-term physical conditions (SMD -0.34, CI -0.6 to -0.06, I² = 70%), but only in the short term. There was inadequate low-quality evidence to determine whether psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions at improving functioning in either the short term or long term. No trials of therapies for addressing health-related anxiety were identified and only two trials reported adverse effects; these were unrelated to psychological therapies. Overall, the evidence was of low to moderate quality, results were heterogeneous, and only one trial had an available protocol.

Authors' Conclusions

A limited number of trials of variable quality have been undertaken to assess whether psychological therapies are effective for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions. According to the available evidence, therapies specifically designed to treat anxiety or depression (especially those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)) may be more likely to work in children and adolescents who have mild to moderate levels of symptoms of these disorders, at least in the short term. There is a dearth of therapies specifically designed to treat health-related anxiety in this age group.

### Interventions (other than pharmacological, psychosocial or psychological) for treating antenatal depression [^115WfkY1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Although pregnancy was once thought of as a time of emotional well-being for many women, conferring 'protection' against psychiatric disorders, a recent meta-analysis of 21 studies suggests the mean prevalence rate for depression across the antenatal period is 10.7%, ranging from 7.4% in the first trimester to a high of 12.8% in the second trimester. Due to maternal treatment preferences and potential concerns about fetal and infant health outcomes, non-pharmacological treatment options are needed.

Objectives

To assess the effects, on mothers and their families, of non-pharmacological/psychosocial/psychological interventions compared with usual antepartum care in the treatment of antenatal depression.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (August 2007), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Trials Registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) (January 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), EMBASE (1980 to January 2007) and CINAHL (1982 to January 2007). We scanned secondary references and contacted experts in the field to identify other published or unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological/psychosocial/psychological interventions to treat antenatal depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors independently participated in the evaluation of methodological quality and data extraction.

Main Results

We included one US three-armed randomised controlled trial in this review, incorporating 61 outpatient antenatal women who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-IV criteria for major depression. Maternal massage, compared to non-specific acupuncture (control group), did not significantly decrease the number of women diagnosed with clinical depression immediately post-treatment (one trial, n = 38; risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 2.53) or at final assessment at 10 weeks' postpartum (one trial, n = 32; RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.01). Acupuncture specifically treating symptoms of depression, compared to non-specific acupuncture, did not significantly decrease the number of women diagnosed with clinical depression immediately post-treatment (one trial, n = 35; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.13) or at final assessment at 10 weeks' postpartum (one trial, n = 32; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.39).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence is inconclusive to allow us to make any recommendations for massage therapy or depression-specific acupuncture for the treatment of antenatal depression. The included trial was too small with a non-generalisable sample, to make any recommendations.

Lavender essential oil aromatherapy inhalation for procedural and treatment-related anxiety — Recommendation 1.7 — may be offered to people with cancer to improve anxiety symptoms during cancer-related procedures and treatment procedures (Type: Evidence based; Quality of evidence: Low; benefits outweigh harms; Strength of recommendation: Weak). Six RCTs with sample sizes ranging from 70 to 313 examined lavender essential oil inhalation; four of the six trials evaluated people during clinical procedures such as biopsy and the other two during active treatment such as receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy, with three trials in multiple cancers (unspecified) and three in breast cancer. Reduction in anxiety was reported in five trials, with only three reporting statistically significant differences versus control.

### Effects of non-pharmacological interventions on depressive and anxiety symptoms in pregnant women: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114YDUpG]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The standard practice for treating women with prenatal depression is to prescribe medication, but many women choose not to take antidepressants during pregnancy due to concerns about potential risks to the developing fetus. Nonpharmacological interventions have been widely used to treat anxiety and depression. Due to individual physical differences, variations in therapists' experience, and differences in the duration of treatment, the effectiveness of specific treatment methods can vary. A variety of nonpharmacological treatments are available for pregnant women, including mindfulness, education, cognitive behavioral therapy, and counseling. These interventions have been proposed and have demonstrated satisfactory clinical efficacy. Nevertheless, previous pairwise meta-analyses have examined only individual nonpharmacological interventions, which limits the breadth of their findings. In a pairwise meta-analysis of non-pharmacological interventions for depression, the number of included studies (21 RCTs) and interventions (only four) was relatively small, and there was no data on anxiety. The pairwise meta-analysis by Caroline et al. found that acupuncture and massage were effective for depression and anxiety in pregnant women. However, it did not analyze data into subgroups, did not rank the combined effects of the interventions on both conditions, and included fewer studies (20 RCTs). Given these limitations, larger and more comprehensive network meta-analyses are needed to thoroughly investigate the effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions for depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy.

Among all possible non-pharmacological interventions, a better understanding of the relative effectiveness of active interventions has important implications for clinical practice and rational resource allocation. This study aimed to compare the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on depressive and anxiety symptoms in pregnant women and offer evidence-based guidance for the development of intervention programs.

### Management of anxiety and depression in adult survivors of cancer: ASCO guideline update [^1139pjGW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Depression — Recommendation 2.4 (pharmacologic management): Treating clinicians may offer a pharmacologic regimen for depression in patients without access to first-line treatment, those expressing a preference for pharmacotherapy, or those who do not improve following first-line psychological or behavioral management; pharmacotherapy should also be considered for patients with a history of treatment response to medications, severe symptoms, or accompanying psychotic features (Type: Evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: Low; Strength of recommendation: Weak). Qualifying statement: Despite the limitations and weak evidence for pharmacologic management, empirically there is some evidence of benefit to warrant their inclusion as an alternative option.

### Treatment and counselling preferences of postpartum women with and without symptoms of (childbirth-related) PTSD: findings of the cross-sectional study INVITE [^116uMse4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials

The study used established and validated instruments to answer the research questions whenever possible, in addition to self-developed questionnaires.

City Birth Trauma Scale (City BiTS)

Symptoms of CB-PTSD were assessed employing the German version of the City BiTS, a 29-item questionnaire designed to measure CB-PTSD based on DSM-5 criteria. The stressor criterion (i.e. threatened death or serious injury of the mother or baby during birth or immediately afterwards) was assessed by two dichotomous items (yes/no). The key symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, negative cognitions/mood, and hyperarousal were covered by 22 items. These symptoms' frequency within the week prior to assessment was rated on a four-point Likert scale from 0 (" never ") to 3 (" 5 or more times "). The severity of symptoms was illustrated by the total score of 0–60, with higher scores indicating a higher level of CB-PTSD symptoms. Five additional items evaluated the onset and duration of symptoms, impairment and distress, as well as potential exclusion criteria.

The internal consistency of the City BiTS in our sample was high, as indicated by Cronbach's alpha (⍺ = 0.84). Previous research has confirmed convergent validity of the City BiTS with other PTSD instruments (Impact of Event Scale – Revised (IES-R) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5)), and divergent validity with the depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)) and anxiety instruments (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-Anxiety)).

American College of Physicians guideline — evidence gaps and research needs state that future randomized controlled trials should assess the effect of different treatment options on outcomes that are important to patients, such as mental suffering, reduction of suicidal ideas and behaviors, and quality of life. Research on comparative effectiveness of newer nonpharmacologic modalities (such as digital CBT) or those that are less standardized in the United States (such as acupuncture) is needed. Research is also needed on the effectiveness of initial treatment options in patients with mild MDD to assess the effect of MDD severity on differences in effectiveness of initial treatment, the effect of comorbid anxiety disorders, second-line treatments in patients not responding to initial treatment, and patient values and preferences related to treatment choice.

### E-health interventions for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions [^111KjKqB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term physical conditions affect 10% to 12% of children and adolescents worldwide; these individuals are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression. Access to face-to-face treatment for such problems is often limited, and available interventions usually have not been tested with this population. As technology improves, e-health interventions (delivered via digital means, such as computers and smart phones and ranging from simple text-based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) offer a potential solution to address the psychological needs of this group of young people.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of e-health interventions in comparison with attention placebos, psychological placebos, treatment as usual, waiting-list controls, or non-psychological treatments for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCMDTR to May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2017), Web of Science (1900–18 August 2016, updated 31 August 2017) and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO (cross-search 2016 to 18 Aug 2017). We hand-searched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and the grey literature to May 2016. We also searched international trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials, and cross-over trials of e-health interventions for treating any type of long-term physical condition in children and adolescents (aged 0 to 18 years), and that measured changes in symptoms or diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or subthreshold depression. We defined long-term physical conditions as those that were more than three-months' duration. We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression using patient- or clinician-administered validated rating scales based on DSM III, IV or 5 (American Psychological Association 2013), or ICD 9 or 10 criteria (World Health Organization 1992). Formal depressive and anxiety disorders were diagnosed using structured clinical interviews. Attention placebo, treatment as usual, waiting list, psychological placebo, and other non-psychological therapies were eligible comparators.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles; discrepancies were resolved through discussion or addressed by a third author. When available, we used odds ratio (OR) to compare dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) to analyse continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We undertook meta-analysis when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were adequately similar. Otherwise, we undertook a narrative analysis.

Main Results

We included five trials of three interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web-MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), which included 463 participants aged 10 to 18 years. Each trial contributed to at least one meta-analysis. Trials involved children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions, such as chronic headache (migraine, tension headache, and others), chronic pain conditions (abdominal, musculoskeletal, and others), chronic respiratory illness (asthma, cystic fibrosis, and others), and symptoms of anxiety or depression. Participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high income countries. For the primary outcome of change in depression symptoms versus any control, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.23; five RCTs, 441 participants). For the primary outcome of change in anxiety symptoms versus any comparator, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.14; two RCTs, 324 participants). For the primary outcome of treatment acceptability, there was very low-quality evidence that e-health interventions were less acceptable than any comparator (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69; two RCTs, 304 participants). For the secondary outcome of quality of life, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.53 to -0.12; one RCT, 34 participants). For the secondary outcome of functioning, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.18; three RCTs, 368 participants). For the secondary outcome of status of long-term physical condition, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.24; five RCTs, 463 participants). The risk of selection bias was considered low in most trials. However, the risk of bias due to inadequate blinding of participants or outcome assessors was considered unclear or high in all trials. Only one study had a published protocol; two trials had incomplete outcome data. All trials were conducted by the intervention developers, introducing another possible bias. No adverse effects were reported by any authors.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, the field of e-health interventions for the treatment of anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions is limited to five low quality trials. The very low-quality of the evidence means the effects of e-health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years. Although it is too early to recommend e-health interventions for this clinical population, given their growing number, and the global improvement in access to technology, there appears to be room for the development and evaluation of acceptable and effective technologically-based treatments to suit children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions.

Regarding medical management for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more specifically with respect to management of depression and anxiety, ALSSC 2020 guidelines recommend to treat anxiety in patients with ALS as it has a substantial impact on patient wellbeing. Determine whether anxiety is related to respiratory insufficiency and treat it appropriately. Offer SSRIs in patients with concurrent depression. Recognize that benzodiazepines can exacerbate respiratory insufficiency. Consider offering nonpharmacologic supportive measures, such as psychology, social work, psychiatry, or spiritual care.

### Effectiveness of aromatherapy massage in the management of anxiety and depression in patients with cancer: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^111aa9Ut]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To test the effectiveness of supplementing usual supportive care with aromatherapy massage in the management of anxiety and depression in cancer patients through a pragmatic two-arm randomized controlled trial in four United Kingdom cancer centers and a hospice.

Patients and Methods

Two hundred eighty-eight cancer patients, referred to complementary therapy services with clinical anxiety and/or depression, were allocated randomly to a course of aromatherapy massage or usual supportive care alone.

Results

Patients who received aromatherapy massage had no significant improvement in clinical anxiety and/or depression compared with those receiving usual care at 10 weeks postrandomization (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.7; P = 0.1), but did at 6 weeks postrandomization (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.9; P = 0.01). Patients receiving aromatherapy massage also described greater improvement in self-reported anxiety at both 6 and 10 weeks postrandomization (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 6.7; P = 0.04 and OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 6.6; P = 0.04), respectively.

Conclusion

Aromatherapy massage does not appear to confer benefit on cancer patients' anxiety and/or depression in the long-term, but is associated with clinically important benefit up to 2 weeks after the intervention.

### The effects of ketamine on symptoms of depression and anxiety in real-world care settings: a retrospective controlled analysis [^114MPs9c]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ketamine intravenous therapy (KIT) appears effective for treating depression in controlled trials testing a short series of infusions. A rapidly proliferating number of clinics offer KIT for depression and anxiety, using protocols without a strong evidence basis. Controlled comparison of mood and anxiety from real-world KIT clinics, and the stability of outcomes, is lacking.

Methods

We performed a retrospective controlled analysis on patients treated with KIT in ten community clinics across the US, between 08/2017–03/2020. Depression and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16-item (QIDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scales, respectively. Comparison data sets from patients who did not undergo KIT were obtained from previously published real-world studies.

Results

Of 2758 patients treated, 714 and 836 met criteria for analysis of KIT induction and maintenance outcomes, respectively. Patients exhibited significant and concordant reduction in both anxiety and depression symptoms after induction (Cohen's d = -1.17 and d = -1.56, respectively). Compared to two external datasets of KIT-naive depressed patients or patients starting standard antidepressant therapy, KIT patients experienced a significantly greater reduction in depression symptoms at eight weeks (Cohen's d = -1.03 and d = -0.62 respectively). Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of late-responders. During maintenance, up to a year post-induction, increases in symptoms were minimal.

Limitations

Due to the retrospective nature of the analyses, interpreting this dataset is limited by incomplete patient information and sample attrition.

Conclusions

KIT treatment elicited robust symptomatic relief that remained stable up to one year of follow-up.

### Massage with or without aromatherapy for symptom relief in people with cancer [^112ptFtK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Massage and aromatherapy massage are used to relieve cancer-related symptoms. A number of claims have been made for these treatments including reduction of pain, anxiety, depression, and stress. Other studies have not shown these benefits.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of massage with or without aromatherapy on pain and other symptoms associated with cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases and trials registries up to August 2015: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PubMed Cancer Subset, SADCCT, and the World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP. We also searched clinical trial registries for ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled studies (RCTs) reporting the effects of aromatherapy or massage therapy, or both, in people with cancer of any age. We applied no language restrictions. Comparators were massage (using carrier oil only) versus no massage, massage with aromatherapy (using carrier oil plus essential oils) versus no massage, and massage with aromatherapy (using carrier oil plus essential oils) versus massage without aromatherapy (using carrier oil only).

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data relating to pain and other symptoms associated with cancer, using standardised forms. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created two 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 19 studies (21 reports) of very low quality evidence with a total of 1274 participants. We included 14 studies (16 reports) in a qualitative synthesis and five studies in a quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). Thirteen studies (14 reports, 596 participants) compared massage with no massage. Six studies (seven reports, 561 participants) compared aromatherapy massage with no massage. Two studies (117 participants) compared massage with aromatherapy and massage without aromatherapy. Fourteen studies had a high risk of bias related to sample size and 15 studies had a low risk of bias for blinding the outcome assessment. We judged the studies to be at unclear risk of bias overall. Our primary outcomes were pain and psychological symptoms. Two studies reported physical distress, rash, and general malaise as adverse events. The remaining 17 studies did not report adverse events. We downgraded the GRADE quality of evidence for all outcomes to very low because of observed imprecision, indirectness, imbalance between groups in many studies, and limitations of study design. Massage versus no-massage groupsWe analysed results for pain and anxiety but the quality of evidence was very low as most studies were small and considered at an unclear or high risk of bias due to poor reporting. Short-term pain (Present Pain Intensity-Visual Analogue Scale) was greater for the massage group compared with the no-massage group (one RCT, n = 72, mean difference (MD) -1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.67 to -0.53). Data for anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-state) relief showed no significant difference in anxiety between the groups (three RCTs, n = 98, combined MD -5.36, 95% CI -16.06 to 5.34). The subgroup analysis for anxiety revealed that the anxiety relief for children was greater for the massage group compared with the no-massage group (one RCT, n = 30, MD -14.70, 95% CI -19.33 to -10.07), but the size of this effect was considered not clinically significant. Furthermore, this review demonstrated no differences in effects of massage on depression, mood disturbance, psychological distress, nausea, fatigue, physical symptom distress, or quality of life when compared with no massage. Massage with aromatherapy versus no-massage groupsWe analysed results for pain, anxiety, symptoms relating to the breast, and quality of life but the quality of evidence was very low as studies were generally at a high risk of bias. There was some indication of benefit in the aromatherapy-massage group but this benefit is unlikely to translate into clinical benefit. The relief of medium- and long-term pain (medium-term: one RCT, n = 86, MD 5.30, 95% CI 1.52 to 9.08; long-term: one RCT, n = 86, MD 3.80, 95% CI 0.19 to 7.41), anxiety (two RCTs, n = 253, combined MD -4.50, 95% CI -7.70 to -1.30), and long-term symptoms relating to the breast in people with breast cancer (one RCT, n = 86, MD -9.80, 95% CI -19.13 to -0.47) was greater for the aromatherapy-massage group, but the results were considered not clinically significant. The medium-term quality of life score was lower (better) for the aromatherapy-massage group compared with the no-massage group (one RCT, n = 30, MD -2.00, 95% CI -3.46 to -0.54). Massage with aromatherapy versus massage without aromatherapy groupsFrom the limited evidence available, we were unable to assess the effect of adding aromatherapy to massage on the relief of pain, psychological symptoms including anxiety and depression, physical symptom distress, or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

There was a lack of evidence on the clinical effectiveness of massage for symptom relief in people with cancer. Most studies were too small to be reliable and key outcomes were not reported. Any further studies of aromatherapy and massage will need to address these concerns.

### Citalopram hydrobromide (Celexa) [^11748sip]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Patients should be told that, although Celexa has not been shown in
experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill
impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of Celexa and alcohol in
depressed patients is not advised.

Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or
plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as there is a
potential for interactions.

Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of Celexa and NSAIDs,
aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of
psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has
been associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant
or intend to become pregnant during therapy.

Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are
breastfeeding an infant.

While patients may notice improvement with Celexa therapy in 1 to 4 weeks,
they should be advised to continue therapy as directed.

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their
families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with
treatment with Celexa and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient
Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious
Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for Celexa. The
prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and
their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in
understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss
the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they
may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of

### Open water swimming as a treatment for major depressive disorder [^114Pqp5T]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 24-year-old woman with symptoms of major depressive disorder and anxiety had been treated for the condition since the age of 17. Symptoms were resistant to fluoxetine and then citalopram. Following the birth of her daughter, she wanted to be medication-free and symptom-free. A programme of weekly open (cold) water swimming was trialled. This led to an immediate improvement in mood following each swim and a sustained and gradual reduction in symptoms of depression, and consequently a reduction in, and then cessation of, medication. On follow-up a year later, she remains medication-free.

### Group arts interventions for depression and anxiety among older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1127acbj]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Risk of bias summary

In the randomized studies, few studies reported their randomization process/allocation concealment, which led to 46% being assessed as some concerns for randomization bias and the remaining 54% assessed as low risk. The reporting of deviations from the interventions was often unclear or not presented, resulting in 7% being assessed as high risk of bias due to deviations, 7% being assessed as some concerns of risk of bias due to deviations and 56% being assessed as low risk. Attrition rates were generally good — 71% of studies assessed as low risk for attrition bias. No studies scored at low risk for bias in outcome measurement as these were self-assessed in all interventions. This meant that the participants were considered the assessors and, due to the nature of these intervention studies, could not be blinded to whether or not they received the intervention. Thirty-four per cent of studies were assessed as low risk for reporting bias and 64% were assessed as some concerns, mostly due to not reporting pre-registration or protocol information.

In the non-randomized studies, risk was mainly found in domains one (risk due to confounding) and six (risk in measurement of outcomes). All studies were assessed to be at high risk of bias due to confounding factors as none of the studies included all well-known confounders in their analyses. No studies were assessed as low risk for bias in the measurement of outcomes due to the subjective nature of the assessments (as found with the randomized studies). Eighty-eight per cent of studies were assessed as low risk of bias due to participant selection, 100% as low risk for classification of intervention bias and 77% as low risk for bias due to deviations from intended interventions. Fifty-five per cent of studies were assessed as low risk of bias due to both missing data and selection of reported results. This was due to a higher level of dropouts in the non-randomized interventions and, as found with the randomized studies, a lack of study pre-registration. The complete summary tables for risk of bias are in Supplementary Information, Appendix I.

### Light therapy for non-seasonal depression [^114wFWku]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Efficacy of light therapy for non-seasonal depression has been studied without any consensus on its efficacy.

Objectives

To evaluate clinical effects of bright light therapy in comparison to the inactive placebo treatment for non-seasonal depression.

Search Strategy

We searched the Depression Anxiety & Neurosis Controlled Trials register (CCDANCTR January 2003), comprising the results of searches of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 -), EMBASE (1980 -), CINAHL (1982 -), LILACS (1982 -), National Research Register, PsycINFO/PsycLIT (1974 -), PSYNDEX (1977 -), and SIGLE (1982 -) using the group search strategy and the following terms: #30 = phototherapy or ("light therapy" or light-therapy). We also sought trials from conference proceedings and references of included papers, and contacted the first author of each study as well as leading researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing bright light with inactive placebo treatments for non-seasonal depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and quality assessment was made independently by two reviewers. The authors were contacted to obtain additional information.

Main Results

Twenty studies (49 reports) were included in the review. Most of the studies applied bright light as adjunctive treatment to drug therapy, sleep deprivation, or both. In general, the quality of reporting was poor, and many reviews did not report adverse effects systematically. The treatment response in the bright light group was better than in the control treatment group, but did not reach statistical significance. The result was mainly based on studies of less than 8 days of treatment. The response to bright light was significantly better than to control treatment in high-quality studies (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.50 to -0.31), in studies applying morning light treatment (SMD -0.38, CI -0.62 to -0.14), and in sleep deprivation responders (SMD -1.02, CI -1.60 to -0.45). Hypomania was more common in the bright light group compared to the control treatment group (risk ratio 4.91, CI 1.66 to 14.46, number needed to harm 8, CI 5 to 20). Twenty studies (49 reports) were included in the review. Most of the studies applied bright light as adjunctive treatment to drug therapy, sleep deprivation, or both. Treatment

Reviewers' Conclusions

For patients suffering from non-seasonal depression, bright light therapy offers modest though promising antidepressive efficacy, especially when administered during the first week of treatment, in the morning, and as an adjunctive treatment to sleep deprivation responders. Hypomania as a potential adverse effect needs to be considered. Due to limited data and heterogeneity of studies these results need to be interpreted with caution.

### Natural remedies for anxiety disorders: potential use and clinical applications [^113zoEYa]. Depression and Anxiety (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Natural remedies have been widely used and generally accepted as established treatments of depressive disorders, leading to the investigation of their potential role and efficacy in the treatment of the various anxiety disorders.

Methods

Numerous case reports, open-label, and placebo-controlled trials investigating the use of natural remedies in the treatment of anxiety disorders have yielded some encouraging results.

Results

Overall, these studies have indicated a potential role for natural remedies in the treatment of anxiety and suggest that such agents may possess a safer side effects profile when compared to conventional agents. However, these early findings, albeit promising, are yet to be supported by further investigation in large-scale, placebo-controlled studies.

Conclusions

This article reviews past and present research being performed in this area of clinical interest, while also revealing a remarkable paucity of data.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^111MZnbE]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Need for rigorous comparisons of treatments and treatment modality — more rigorous treatment comparisons of psychological interventions are needed, including developing methods to evaluate the contribution of specific aspects of psychotherapy models compared with the shared or nonspecific aspects. Fewer studies have compared the efficacy of individual modalities of treatment versus group modalities, and given how frequently group is the modality of treatment in certain settings (i.e. Veteran's Administration and psychiatric hospitals), better data on its comparability to traditional individual therapy is imperative. The panel also highlights assessing new models of delivering previously supported approaches, including delivery in new environments and the introduction of new technologies.

### Prevalence of depression and anxiety among adults with chronic pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116fKgvD]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this meta-analysis study of depression and anxiety among indivduals with chronic pain, we found prevalence rates of approximately 40%. Adults who were younger, female, and with nociplastic pain were more likely to have co-occurring chronic pain and depression or anxiety. Systematically screening for depression and anxiety in clinical settings in which chronic pain is treated is critical. Offering equitable access to care and representation in clinical trials, as well as innovative treatment targeting chronic pain and co-occurring depression and anxiety, is essential to promote positive outcomes for adults with chronic pain.

WARNINGS

WARNINGS-Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and
pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of
suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior,
whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may
persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of
depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders
themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a
long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing
worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients
during the early phases of treatment.

Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant
drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal
thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults
(ages 18–24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric
disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of
suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24;
there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65
and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents
with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders
included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400
patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or
other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median
duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There
was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency
toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There
were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different
indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs.
placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across
indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of
cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^115jNcNR]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Delivery of treatments — Although all the recommendations focus on types of interventions, the way in which treatments are delivered is also important, yet the current review provided limited information in this area; collaborative care approaches have been well established as an evidence-based and well-established system, but the current review did not address this; the panel found insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of psychotherapies in specific target groups, and very limited data on whether treatment format influenced efficacy, with the limited CBT format evidence not finding differences.

### Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in America and Europe [^117HqvqH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The various major American and European guidelines for the treatment of depression provide similar basic principles of treatment, which include individualizing the treatment plan, preparing the patient for potential long-term treatment, providing measurement-based care, and treating to remission. While the guidelines are all evidence-based, certain factors can influence differences in specific recommendations, such as the consensus group's composition, underlying mandates, and cultural attitudes. The similarities and differences among 6 sets of guidelines from Europe and the Americas published in the past decade are reviewed here (American Psychiatric Association, British Association for Psychopharmacology, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Texas Medication Algorithm Project, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry). In the guidelines, mild depression has the most variance in treatment recommendations; some, but not all, guidelines suggest that it may resolve with exercise or watchful waiting, but psychotherapy or antidepressants could be used if initial efforts fail. Moderate and severe major depression carry broadly similar recommendations among the guidelines. First-line treatment recommendations for moderate major depressive disorder include antidepressant monotherapy, psychotherapy, and the combination of both. Severe depression may require the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy, or the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherapy. Benzodiazepines play a very limited role in the treatment of depression; if the patient has catatonic depression, acutely suicidal depression, or depression with symptoms of anxiety, agitation, or insomnia, benzodiazepines are recommended by some guidelines for short-term treatment only.

### Influence of depression on pain and disability in patients with chronic low back pain after physical therapy: a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^1135Q6tb]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Medium credibility.

2.2. Randomization and Masking

After screening, 56 participants received therapeutic aquatic exercise and 57 received physical modality therapy by randomly drawing lots in numbered opaque envelopes. Each envelope contained a number drawn through a random number table. Researchers who participated in randomization and outcome collection were masked to the intervention allocation and hypotheses. Participants could not be masked because of their informed consent rights.

2.3. Interventions

In the second analysis, we reallocated the participants into the depressed group and nondepressed group. Therefore, both groups may have received therapeutic aquatic exercise or physical modality therapy. The aquatic exercise included 10 min of warm-up, 40 min of aquatic movements, and 10 min of relaxation. Aquatic movements included abdominal bracing, pressing water in different directions (vertical, lateral, and slant), straight leg raising, treading water, and running in deep water. The aquatic exercise was carried out in a group of 8–9 people. The physical modality therapy included infrared radiation therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Both modalities were placed at points of LBP, and each lasted 30 min. The interventions were completed for 60 min each session, twice a week for 12 weeks. Details of the interventions have also been published.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review and network meta-analysis protocols have been registered in PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42024523053) and are reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA-NMA) guidelines.

Two independent reviewers (GWZ and JN) searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from the inception of each database until October 20, 2023. We subsequently updated the data on October 5, 2024, and incorporated the results into the manuscript. In the literature search, the researchers used the following keywords (pregnancy OR gestation OR gestational OR pregnant OR perinatal OR prenatal) AND (exercise OR training OR "physical activity" OR therapy OR mindfulness OR relaxation OR yoga OR music OR "cognitive behavioral") AND (anxiety OR angst OR depression OR "depressive symptom∗" OR "mental health" OR "psychological health") AND ("randomized controlled trial" OR "controlled clinical trial" OR placebo OR "random allocation" OR randomized). The complete search strategy is contained in Supplementary Methods 1. The search strategy was originally developed for the PubMed database and adapted to the characteristics of the other databases. Two reviewers (GWZ and JN) performed the systematic search independently, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus between the reviewers or by involving a third reviewer (KZ). Studies that met all of the following criteria were eligible for inclusion: (1) pregnant women were 18 years or older; (2) only randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials were eligible; (3) singleton pregnancy; (4) no planned abortion; (5) only studies published in English were eligible for inclusion; (6) Pregnant women who, at baseline, exhibited early signs of depressive and/or anxiety symptoms during pregnancy but did not meet clinical diagnostic criteria or exceed the threshold for clinically significant symptoms were included in the study. At baseline, they had to exhibit symptoms of depressive and/or anxiety as assessed by specific rating scales. Pregnant women diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, severe acute mental illness (including suicidal tendencies), having known substance abuse issues, or undergoing in vitro fertilization were excluded.

### Megacity, microscale livable space, and major depression… [^115FvD3k]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Urbanization is causing higher population densities. The role of the built environment on an individual's health is evident. The World Health Organization has a Healthy Cities program to integrate public health and urban planning to achieve a high quality of life for all persons. 1 More than half of the global population now lives in urban settings. Cities are associated with higher rates of poor mental health than rural areas, with a higher risk of depression, anxiety, loneliness, isolation, and stress.
2. In JAMA Network Open, a study in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, made advancements toward the notion of environmental determinants of depression. Using a longitudinal cohort of 39 276 participants with a mean age of 45. 5 years at baseline, Sarkar and colleagues3 found an association between depressive symptoms and residential density at the microlevel, mesolevel, and macrolevel environments. Why is urban living associated with depression in the population.

Generally, an urban environment is beneficial to population health because cities have better living conditions, piped water and sanitation, safer occupational environments, a diversity of available food, and social services. Much empirical evidence has shown that urban residents have better health and live a few years longer than rural residents. 1 Hong Kong is a city boasting one of the highest life expectancies globally, but it is unclear why this high social development megacity is associated with depression. The second factor is social status; urban environments perpetuate preexisting risk factors of adverse mental health, including poverty or minority racial or ethnic status. For example, differences in social status may result in segregation within neighborhoods, creating social challenges and experiences of prejudice or discrimination. 2 The third factor is related to the environment, and evidence is emerging as people spend most of their time indoors.

4 Indoor environment is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for poor mental health, with evidence documenting air pollution exposure as a response function for major depressive disorder.
5. Residual confounding distortion is possible but cannot be the primary cause of depressive symptoms given the significant effect estimates found in the study. Furthermore, neuroscience studies can support the epidemiological finding of the urban environments and mental health. A study using magnetic resonance imaging showed city living was associated with increased amygdala activity, which is the primary fear center in the brain generally involved in the expression of conditioned fear. 6 Urban upbringing also was shown to affect the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex — a key region for regulation of amygdala activity, negative affect system, and stress responses.

### Effect of greening vacant land on mental health of community-dwelling adults: a cluster randomized trial [^111CkU7Y]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Almost 1 in 5 US adults report some form of mental illness. Depression is the second largest contributor to years lived with disability in the United States, with more than 16 million adults experiencing an episode annually. Yet patient mental health services only account for an estimated 5% of total medical care spending in the United States. A broadening of treatment options to improve mental health is necessary, including interventions that fundamentally change harmful environmental surroundings that may be key contributors to mental illness.

Neighborhood physical conditions, including vacant or dilapidated spaces, trash, and lack of quality infrastructure such as sidewalks and parks, are associated with depression, and are factors that may explain the persistent prevalence of mental illness in resource-limited communities. Vacant and dilapidated spaces are unavoidable neighborhood conditions that residents in low-resource communities encounter every day, making the very existence of these spaces a constant source of stress, and possibly mental illness.

However, neighborhood physical conditions can also positively influence mental health. Spending time and living near green spaces have been associated with various improved mental health outcomes, including less depression, anxiety, and stress. Several studies have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between more time spent in green spaces and lower depression rates. Therefore, green space may be a potential buffer between inequitable neighborhood conditions and poor mental health outcomes.

While patient-level therapies for mental illness will always be a vital aspect of treatment, changing the places where people live, work, and play may have broad population-level effects on mental health outcomes. There have been calls for the development of urban environmental interventions to improve mental health outcomes and well-being. In support of this, a number of observational studies have demonstrated the positive effect of vacant land greening interventions on urban health, crime, and stress. However, these prior studies have not been experimental and have not tested mental health outcomes. Given this, we evaluated data from, to our knowledge, the first citywide cluster randomized trial with the objective to test the effects of inexpensive, standardized, and reproducible vacant land remediation interventions — greening and trash cleanup — on health and safety. We report here on the mental health outcomes. Analysis of crime outcomes is reported elsewhere.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. In subjects with current diagnoses of depressive and/or anxiety disorders, median score for depressive symptoms was 28 (IQR = 19–37), median score for anxiety symptoms was 15 (IQR = 9.0–23) and median score for fear symptoms was 30 (IQR = 16–46). Compared with controls, subjects with depression and/or anxiety were significantly younger, had less years of education and a lower household income (all p < 0.05). Individuals with depression/anxiety seem to live in neighbourhoods with lower socioeconomic status, higher levels of air pollution and higher levels traffic noise, more water and lower social cohesion as compared with controls (See Table 1: p < 0.05).

### Efficacy of therapeutic aquatic exercise vs physical therapy modalities for patients with chronic low back pain: a randomized clinical trial [^115aUHFo]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Outcome Measures

Experienced physiotherapists carried out the measurements at baseline, after the 3-month intervention, at the 6-month follow-up, and at the 12-month follow-up from baseline. The primary outcome was the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, which contains 24 items that are closely related to the daily life activities of patients with chronic low back pain. With scoring of 1 (yes) and 0 (no), the final score varies from 0 to 24. Higher scores are associated with more severe disability.

The secondary outcome was a numeric rating scale, which consisted of 11 numbers from 0 to 10: 0 (painless), 1 to 3 (mild pain), 4 to 6 (moderate pain), and 7 to 10 (strong and unbearable pain). The participants reported the pain intensity they felt at the time of the report and that they experienced during the past week (slightest, average, and most serious).

Considering that chronic low back pain may seriously affect the sleep quality of patients who have been experiencing pain for a long time and may lead to adverse psychological reactions, such as fear avoidance belief, we included the 36-item Short-form Health Survey, Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, minimal clinically important difference in pain and function, global perceived effect, adverse events, and participants' recommendation levels on the intervention that they received as the secondary outcomes.

### Influence of prenatal aquatic activities on fetal outcomes and maternal physical and mental outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Jp86z]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Study selection

The PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central electronic database were searched from inception to July 17, 2024 using a series of keywords related to aquatic activities (such as "aquatic", "hydro") and pregnant women (such as "pregnancy", "prenatal care"). The details of the search strategy are presented in Table S1. To avoid missing any relevant literature, manual searches of the reference lists of all included articles also were performed as well as searches of the reference lists of previous related meta-analyses or systematic reviews.

The Inclusion criteria for studies were: (1) study design: randomized controlled trials (RCTs); (2) study subjects: pregnant women; (3) intervention: prenatal aquatic activities or mixed land-based and aquatic interventions and a control group that received standard prenatal care or partook in no exercise; and (4) primary outcomes: fetal birth weight, maternal weight gain, and maternal quality of life based on standardized scales. Secondary outcomes were fetal outcomes (e.g. proportion of low birth weight, proportion of adequate birth weight, proportion of macrosomia, Apgar score at 1 min, Apgar score at 5 min, birth length and pH of umbilical cord blood), maternal outcomes [e.g. proportion of excessive maternal weight gain (classified as "adequate" or "excessive" according to the 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines in which recommended weight gains for under-weight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese women were 12.5–18 kg, 11.5–16 kg, 7–11.5 kg, and 5–9 kg, respectively), gestational age, proportion of preterm delivery, postnatal depression based on standardized scales and proportion of mode of delivery)] and serious adverse events (e.g. spontaneous abortion, fetal malformation and fetal death).

Studies were excluded from this meta-analysis according to the following exclusion criteria: (1) publication in any language other than English, or (2) presentation of incomplete data or duplicated data.

Endnote X9 (Clarivate Analytics,) was used to manage references. Two authors (KZ and JMX) independently examined titles and abstracts to select eligible trials. In cases of discrepancies between the two authors' selections, a third author (FFZ) was consulted to resolve the differences. Full-text articles were then retrieved and reviewed using the same method to determine which trials met the inclusion criteria for this study.

### Impact of water therapy on pain management in patients with fibromyalgia: current perspectives [^114nr6w1]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Accordingly, exercise has been one of the most recommended nonpharmacological interventions for FMS. It has been shown that exercise is able to influence gene expression and structural complexity in the limbic structures that regulate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axisand can improve conditioned pain modulation due to increased endogenous opioids, stimulation of brain structures involved in the inhibitory descending pathways that regulate painful response. Geytenbeekhas examined over 500 articles that were available on the theme and has concluded, after examining randomized controlled trials, case–control studies, and cohort studies, that high to moderate quality evidence supports the use of hydrotherapy for pain, function, joint mobility strength, and balance. Moreover, exercise seems to be the most effective component of a hydrotherapy program for FMS.

Hence, exercising in an aquatic environment is advantageous. The pain-relieving effect of water-based exercises is suggested to be due to the joint effect of exercise, warm water, and buoyancy on thermal receptors and mechanoreceptors. Sensory-motor hyperstimulation exerted by the hydrostatic pressure, viscosity, and water temperature increases the triggers of thermal receptors and mechanoreceptors while blocking nociceptors. The viscosity of the water provides an environment with three-dimensional resistance, which facilitates proprioceptive feedback through functional patterns of movement and increases the synchronization of the motor units due to slowed movement. Also, immersion in warm water helps to increase blood flow and oxygen supply, improving nutrition and removal of catabolites, and thereby reducing signal molecules, such as IL-8 and noradrenaline, responsible for activation of nociceptors. In addition, regular exercise has been shown to improve overall health, as shown in other chronic conditions. This prominent effect on pain could be previously observed in several studies.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^114gYhxm]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Directions for future research in the literature — extensive evidence exists yet key gaps remain, as depression is one of the disorders most widely studied in psychotherapy research, with over 400 randomized clinical trials for depression across the last 3 decades. However, fewer studies have examined other widely utilized treatments including psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, behavioral activation, problem-solving therapy, and emotion-focused therapy, among others, and most of these treatments have demonstrated preliminary efficacy necessitating the need for further study. In addition, while the largest body of literature is for CBT, the definition of CBT is not the same across all CBT studies, and this heterogeneity limits the ability to make conclusions about the CBT model. It is imperative that the field generate more evidence to support different psychotherapies with preliminary efficacy as this is crucial for the advancement of the scientific field, diversification of education, and training opportunities for and adherence to scientific calls for personalized approaches to treatment. There is also interest and awareness of growing areas in complementary and alternative medicine such as those included in this review and others that were not included (such as emotional support animals).

### Bridging the mental health treatment gap: effects of a collaborative care intervention (matrix support) in the detection and treatment of mental disorders in a Brazilian city [^115LwPbo]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Sample features and recording issues

The predominance of middle-aged women was consistent with previous research conducted among PC attendees in Brazil, which show that being a woman was the sociodemographic variable most associated with the chance of receiving MH care. This predominance might be explained by less dependence on others to access the services when compared with younger or older people, as well as a reduced perception of stigma associated with seeking MH care when compared with men.

The finding of anxiety and depressive disorders as main diagnoses also followed the pattern usually observed in community surveys. The rates of mental disorders (18.0%) and anxiety and depressive disorders (14.4%) in our sample were lower than reported in other studies in PC populations; for example, one study in four major Brazilian cities found prevalence of anxiety and depression in adults attending PC clinics between 35%–43% and 21%–31%, respectively. This difference in our findings may be due to methodological issues, rather than lack of recognition. Most services surveys use standardised diagnostic instruments, which are associated with higher diagnosis rates of mental disorders when compared with records of routine clinical practice. One survey in Brazil found that only 5.6% of PC attendees had a psychiatric diagnosis recorded, while 44.1% had an anxiety or depressive disorder according to a standard instrument. Some reasons for this issue are high comorbidity, problems presenting in undifferentiated forms, and the preference of the GPs for recording symptoms or physical conditions as reasons for visits instead of assigning a psychiatric label to patients, especially those with mild symptoms or social distress. This is especially relevant, considering that the EMR data obtained for this study only informed one ICD-10 code per visit. Ultimately, the analysis of GP records might say more about the provision of care than the prevalence or the need in the population.

### Effects of non-pharmacological interventions on depressive and anxiety symptoms in pregnant women: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112s4aUh]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Meta-regression and subgroup analyses

We conducted regression analyses based on year, sample size, and population health status (Supplementary Tables S12 and S13). The beta coefficients and 95% credible intervals for year and sample size were not statistically different between the depressive and anxiety symptoms outcomes, indicating that neither year nor sample size influenced the study results. Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference in population health status among the physical exercise groups for both depressive and anxiety symptoms, leading us to perform further subgroup analyses on population health status (Supplementary Figures S14 and S15 and Tables S14–S19).

In individuals with depressive symptoms who are otherwise healthy, muscle acupoint therapy, mindfulness, education, mind-body exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy proved more effective than the control group. In individuals with high-risk pregnancies and depressive symptoms, mindfulness, education, and cognitive behavioral therapy significantly reduced depressive symptoms compared to the control group. These conclusions are generally consistent with the overall results of interventions for depressive symptoms. Additionally, regardless of whether pregnant women come from healthy or high-risk pregnancy populations, mindfulness therapy, educational therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy significantly improve depressive symptoms in these women.

In individuals with anxiety symptoms who are otherwise healthy, mindfulness, education, counseling, and cognitive behavioral therapy demonstrated more significant effects compared to the control group. In individuals with high-risk pregnancies and anxiety symptoms, mindfulness and education were particularly effective. These results from the subgroup analysis are consistent with the overall findings on anxiety. Regardless of whether pregnant women are from healthy populations or high-risk pregnancy populations, mindfulness is highly effective in reducing anxiety symptoms.

To determine whether the inclusion of the nine quasi-randomized controlled trials affects the overall intervention results, we performed a subgroup analysis comparing randomized controlled trials with quasi-randomized controlled trials (Supplementary Figures S16 and S17 and Tables S20–S23). The inclusion of these nine quasi-randomized controlled trials had no effect on the depressive symptoms outcomes; however, it affected only cognitive behavioral therapy among the three interventions for anxiety. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting cognitive behavioral therapy for healthy pregnant women with anxiety symptoms. Overall, the inclusion of quasi-randomized controlled trials had a minimal impact on the overall experimental results.

### Individual participant data systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials assessing adult mindfulness-based programmes for mental health promotion in non-clinical settings [^111aZJnv]. Nature: Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Main

Depression and other common mental health disorders are among the leading global causes of morbidity, generating a substantial societal burden. In 2015, 4.4% of the global population was estimated to be suffering from depression and 3.6% was estimated to have anxiety disorders. The prevalence of anxiety and depression had increased by 14.9% and 18.4%, respectively, from 2005 to 2015 (ref.), despite the increase in the provision of treatment for common mental health disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges to global mental health, particularly amongst at-risk individuals such as healthcare workers, and there are concerns that these will persist beyond the pandemic period, without the right prevention and management approaches. In general, there is widespread agreement that not enough emphasis is placed on prevention compared with the treatment of disorders, and shifting to the implementation of preventive interventions must be done with care as they should be evidence based and delivered to a high standard of quality.

The past decade has seen an expansion of mental health prevention and promotion programs in workplaces, educational establishments and other community settings. Typically, they target psychological distress, a concept encompassing a range of disturbing or unpleasant mental or emotional experiences that usually include depression and anxiety. Psychological distress is often an internal response to external stressors when coping mechanisms are overwhelmed. It is also frequently referred to as mental distress, emotional distress or simply stress. If unaddressed, psychological distress can result in mental and physical health disorders.

MBPs are among the most popular preventive interventions. It is estimated that 15% of British adults and 20% of Australians have practiced mindfulness meditation at some point in their lives; 5% in the United States have done so in 2017 (refs.). Mindfulness training is offered in over 600 companies globallyand 79% of US medical schools. National health guidelines in England encourage workplaces to help employees access mindfulness, yoga or meditation for their mental well-being. During the COVID-19 pandemic, international mental health guidelines have been advocating for mindfulness training exercises.

### Does anxiety moderate the effectiveness of mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant depression? A secondary analysis of the MIR trial [^114bPo8Z]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression and anxiety are common conditions representing a large global health burden, with depression the largest cause of disability globally. Depression and anxiety are overlapping syndromes that commonly occur together and the patient burden and complexity increases when both are present. Comorbid anxiety in depression is associated with poorer chances of response to treatment, increased severity of depression and increased chance of suicide. The majority of patients with anxiety and depression are managed in a primary care setting, with antidepressants prescriptions increasingly yearly, with 67.5 million antidepressant prescriptions in the UK in 2017.

There is evidence for the effectiveness of mirtazapine (Neuroscience based Nomenclature (NbN): Norepinephrine, Serotonin, Receptor antagonist) in several anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder. Mirtazapine has also been found to have important actions on relieving anxiety symptoms in patients with comorbid anxiety and depression in a meta-analysis, while a small study has shown promising anti-depressant efficacy in dual-diagnosis anxiety and depression disorder.

These trials did not, however, examine the relative effect of mirtazapine on those with and without anxiety in the same patient cohort. Furthermore, they were not conducted in a primary care setting, where most patients with anxiety and depression are managed.

There is a lack of evidence to inform guidelines around treating depression with comorbid anxiety. Most evidence-informed guidelines such as National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines do not offer any specific advice on treating comorbid psychiatric conditions or preferred augmentation agents. This issue is recognized by a recent guideline from the French Association for Biological Psychiatry: "Although the issue of comorbidity is recognized by evidence-based guidelines, few specific recommendations are provided regarding acute treatment with antidepressant drugs". This guideline, based on expert consensus, suggests a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, NbN: SERT) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI, NbN: SERT and NET) as first-line therapy for depression with any comorbid anxiety disorder, with mirtazapine recommended as a possible second-line agent.

### International committee on mental health in cystic fibrosis: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and European Cystic Fibrosis Society consensus statements for screening and treating depression and anxiety [^116yjKkj]. Thorax (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for implementation and future research — screening for depression and anxiety in cystic fibrosis (CF) centres internationally should be closely monitored to address barriers and concerns, and current evidence highlights research gaps. A recent Cochrane Review of psychological treatments for individuals with CF found no controlled studies evaluating interventions that address depression and anxiety in either individuals with CF or parent caregivers. Although psychological and medication treatments for depression and anxiety are already used in CF, these interventions require further systematic research to inform future recommendations, and randomised, comparative effectiveness studies of psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions for depression and anxiety in CF are recommended.

### Reporting of stepped wedge cluster randomised trials: extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement with explanation and elaboration [^114grnHp]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Methods: Blinding

Item 11a: Blinding

Standard CONSORT item — If done, who was blinded after assignment to interventions (eg, participants, care providers, or those assessing outcomes) and how.

CONSORT cluster extension — No modification suggested.

Extension for SW-CRTs — If done, who was blinded after assignment to sequences (eg, cluster level participants, individual level participants, or those assessing outcomes) and how.

Example 1 (Blinding not possible) — "Blinding to the intervention (ie, the type of water being received) is not possible due to potential differences in turbidity of untreated and RBF (Riverbank Filtration) -treated river water".

Example 2 (Blinding partially possible) — "Residents did not know when the intervention was being implemented or what the programme elements were. Interviewers who administered the outcome questionnaires were masked to intervention implementation or depression treatment, and to previous test results. Data analysts were masked to whether a specific resident had been exposed to the intervention and to when the intervention was implemented in a unit, but were not masked during post-hoc analyses".

Explanation — SW-CRTs are often used to evaluate interventions for which it is impossible to blind participants or clusters to whether they are in the intervention or control condition, but nonetheless it is important to report clearly whether or not blinding was used and if so, who exactly was blinded to aspects of the trial (example 1).

Often outcomes are collected at multiple levels (eg, hospitals (eg, team climate outcomes), clinicians (eg, knowledge, skills, or practice outcomes), patients (eg, pain)). The possibility of blinding may be different depending on the level of participants (eg, clinicians or patients) and may depend on the type of consent required (item 10c). The degree of blinding should be reported at each level of the trial (eg, clusters, participants as in example 2) and whether the blinding differed in control and intervention conditions. Researchers should also specifically report blinding with respect to all outcomes. Blinding of those assessing outcomes should be clearly reported.

A systematic review has found that most SW-CRTs do not report clearly who was blinded and what people were blinded to. Whether or not and who was blinded, and when, is best reported by the use of a timeline diagram.

### Aquatic high-intensity interval training (HIIT) may be similarly effective to land-based HIIT in improving exercise capacity in people with chronic conditions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VYQ4z]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Methods

This systematic review has been undertaken and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The review protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, registration number CRD42022289001.

Data sources and search strategy for identification of studies

The following electronic databases were searched for relevant studies with help from a research librarian, on 11 August 2023: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTSDiscus, PEDro, The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The search strategy included terms of aquatic (water, hydrotherapy, swimming), exercise, fitness, rehabilitation, plyometric, tabata or resistance training and high-intensity interval training. There were no restrictions of language or dates in the search, dates of coverage were all records in the databases up until 11 August 2023. The search strategy of each database is shown in online supplemental file 1.

We screened recently completed and ongoing trials at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, Epistemonikos, and Open Science Framework. A Google Scholar search was also undertaken and a citation search in several key papers. In addition, a manual search of reference lists of included articles and reviews was completed.

Eligibility criteria

Design

Randomised and non-randomised clinical trials with a minimum intervention of 6 weeks, which evaluated the effect of AHIIT on exercise capacity, were considered for inclusion. Studies written in English, Norwegian, Swedish or Danish and published as full papers were included.

Participants

The study population was limited to participants aged ≥ 18 years reporting one or more chronic conditions.

Intervention

For the aquatic exercise to be considered 'high intensity', AHIIT was defined as exercises in water consisting of repeated bouts of intermittent work performed with a work rate of perceived exertion (RPE) of ≥ 14 (BORG Exertion Scale), or maximal heart rate ≥ 77% of predicted maximum heart rate, or rate of oxygen uptake (VO₂) > 64% of VO₂ peak, or maximal capacity, or defined in the title or text as an intervention that is considered high intensity and conducted in intervals or bouts followed by a recovery period. Studies that did not specify how exercise intensity was monitored were excluded. The comparison group might have been control (usual care) or exercise (LBHIIT or another form of aquatic exercise).

### Nonpharmacologic versus pharmacologic treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111Gavn9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — search strategy and evidence synthesis report that reviews searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, AMED, PsycINFO, and CINAHL from 1 January 1990 through September 2015 for studies in English, German, or Italian; efficacy evidence was limited to randomized, controlled trials and systematic reviews and meta-analyses, harms evidence included observational studies, and there were no limitations on study duration or length of follow-up. Direct comparisons used meta-analytic techniques, and network meta-analysis was used when head-to-head evidence was lacking and was based on mixed-effects or random-effects models including placebo- and active-controlled randomized, controlled trials that were homogeneous in study populations and outcome assessments and part of a connected network.

### Whole-body hyperthermia for the treatment of major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^113Zb2dN]. JAMA Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Limitations of current antidepressants highlight the need to identify novel treatments for major depressive disorder. A prior open trial found that a single session of whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) reduced depressive symptoms; however, the lack of a placebo control raises the possibility that the observed antidepressant effects resulted not from hyperthermia per se, but from nonspecific aspects of the intervention.

Objective

To test whether WBH has specific antidepressant effects when compared with a sham condition and to evaluate the persistence of the antidepressant effects of a single treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A 6-week, randomized, double-blind study conducted between February 2013 and May 2015 at a university-based medical center comparing WBH with a sham condition. All research staff conducting screening and outcome procedures were blinded to randomization status. Of 338 individuals screened, 34 were randomized, 30 received a study intervention, and 29 provided at least 1 postintervention assessment and were included in a modified intent-to-treat efficacy analysis. Participants were medically healthy, aged 18 to 65 years, met criteria for major depressive disorder, were free of psychotropic medication use, and had a baseline 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of 16 or greater.

Interventions

A single session of active WBH vs a sham condition matched for length of WBH that mimicked all aspects of WBH except intense heat.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Between-group differences in postintervention Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores.

Results

The mean (SD) age was 36.7 (15.2) years in the WBH group and 41.47 (12.54) years in the sham group. Immediately following the intervention, 10 participants (71.4%) randomized to sham treatment believed they had received WBH compared with 15 (93.8%) randomized to WBH. When compared with the sham group, the active WBH group showed significantly reduced Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores across the 6-week postintervention study period (WBH vs sham; week 1: -6.53, 95% CI, -9.90 to -3.16, P < .001; week 2: -6.35, 95% CI, -9.95 to -2.74, P = 0.001; week 4: -4.50, 95% CI, -8.17 to -0.84, P = 0.02; and week 6: -4.27, 95% CI, -7.94 to -0.61, P = 0.02). These outcomes remained significant after evaluating potential moderating effects of between-group differences in baseline expectancy scores. Adverse events in both groups were generally mild.

Conclusions and Relevance

Whole-body hyperthermia holds promise as a safe, rapid-acting, antidepressant modality with a prolonged therapeutic benefit.

### Light therapy for preventing seasonal affective disorder [^1179UZVy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD - focuses on light therapy as a preventive intervention. Light therapy is a non-pharmacological treatment that exposes people to artificial light. Mode of delivery (e.g. visors, light boxes) and form of light (e.g. bright white light) vary.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of light therapy (in comparison with no treatment, other types of light therapy, second-generation antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine, psychological therapies, lifestyle interventions and negative ion generators) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Search Methods

A search of the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neuorosis Review Group (CCDANCTR) included all years to 11 August 2015. The CCDANCTR contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials derived from EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trails (CENTRAL). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Knowledge, The Cochrane Library and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (to 26 May 2014). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and pertinent review articles.

Selection Criteria

For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we also intended to include non-randomised studies. We intended to include studies that compared any type of light therapy (e.g. bright white light, administered by visors or light boxes, infrared light, dawn stimulation) versus no treatment/placebo, second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), psychological therapies, melatonin, agomelatine, lifestyle changes, negative ion generators or another of the aforementioned light therapies. We also planned to include studies that looked at light therapy in combination with any comparator intervention and compared this with the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria. Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies.

Main Results

We identified 2986 citations after de-duplication of search results. We excluded 2895 records during title and abstract review. We assessed 91 full-text papers for inclusion in the review, but only one study providing data from 46 people met our eligibility criteria. The included randomised controlled trial (RCT) had methodological limitations. We rated it as having high risk of performance and detection bias because of lack of blinding, and as having high risk of attrition bias because study authors did not report reasons for dropouts and did not integrate data from dropouts into the analysis. The included RCT compared preventive use of bright white light (2500 lux via visors), infrared light (0.18 lux via visors) and no light treatment. Overall, both forms of preventive light therapy reduced the incidence of SAD numerically compared with no light therapy. In all, 43% (6/14) of participants in the bright light group developed SAD, as well as 33% (5/15) in the infrared light group and 67% (6/9) in the non-treatment group. Bright light therapy reduced the risk of SAD incidence by 36%; however, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was very broad and included both possible effect sizes in favour of bright light therapy and those in favour of no light therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.38). Infrared light reduced the risk of SAD by 50% compared with no light therapy, but in this case also the CI was too broad to allow precise estimations of effect size (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.17). Comparison of both forms of preventive light therapy versus each other yielded similar rates of incidence of depressive episodes in both groups (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.28). The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. Reasons for downgrading evidence quality included high risk of bias of the included study, imprecision and other limitations, such as self rating of outcomes, lack of checking of compliance throughout the study duration and insufficient reporting of participant characteristics. Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could find no studies that compared light therapy versus other interventions of interest such as SGA, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence on light therapy as preventive treatment for patients with a history of SAD is limited. Methodological limitations and the small sample size of the only available study have precluded review author conclusions on effects of light therapy for SAD. Given that comparative evidence for light therapy versus other preventive options is limited, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences.
