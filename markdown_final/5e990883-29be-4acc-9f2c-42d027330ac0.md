## Question

What's the regimen for ciprofloxacin drops for stye

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dosing regimen for ciprofloxacin ophthalmic drops to treat a stye. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a stye is anatomically and whether topical antibiotics penetrate the involved tissue. Then, I should verify whether any authoritative guideline or label provides a stye-specific dosing regimen. Next, I will consider whether a conjunctivitis regimen is a reasonable off-label proxy and why or why not. After that, I should review safety, contraindications, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, conservative recommendation with clear instructions and follow-up advice, while noting the evidence gap and alternatives like warm compresses and incision and drainage if needed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and anatomy. A stye, or hordeolum, is an acute bacterial infection of the eyelid margin glands, typically Staphylococcus aureus, and it is fundamentally a lid-margin soft-tissue abscess rather than a conjunctival surface infection, which means topical drops applied to the ocular surface have limited ability to reach the infected gland deep in the lid tissue, so I need to be cautious about expecting benefit from drops alone.

> Wait, let me verify whether any authoritative source provides a stye-specific dosing regimen for ciprofloxacin ophthalmic drops. I should double-check the FDA labeling and major guidelines. The FDA labels for ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution detail dosing for corneal ulcers and bacterial conjunctivitis, but there is no labeled indication or dosing for hordeolum or stye, and high-quality guidelines do not provide a stye-specific topical antibiotic regimen, underscoring the absence of evidence-based dosing for this indication [^11238Lfh] [^117C4Y6e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought to adapt the bacterial conjunctivitis regimen as a practical off-label approach, but I should confirm whether that makes pharmacologic sense. The conjunctivitis regimen of one to two drops every two hours while awake for two days, then every four hours for five days, targets conjunctival surface infection and does not address a deep lid abscess, so using it for a stye would be a mechanistic mismatch and likely ineffective for the nidus of infection, even though the spectrum covers common staphylococcal pathogens [^11238Lfh] [^113ejtdP].

> I need to ensure I weigh the evidence base for non-surgical treatments of hordeolum. The Cochrane reviews repeatedly conclude there is no high-quality evidence supporting antibiotics, including topical drops, for acute internal hordeolum, and they explicitly exclude external hordeolum from their scope, which aligns with the clinical teaching that most styes are self-limited and respond to conservative measures rather than topical antibiotics [^115keSsj] [^11238Lfh].

> Let me consider the standard of care and what actually helps. Warm compresses several times daily to promote drainage, strict lid hygiene, and avoidance of eye makeup are foundational. If the lesion localizes and fails to drain, incision and drainage is the definitive intervention, whereas topical antibiotics are adjunctive at best and often unnecessary unless there is secondary conjunctival infection or cellulitic spread, so I should emphasize conservative therapy first and procedural management if persistent [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the clinician still prefers a cautious, off-label trial of a topical fluoroquinolone despite limited penetration. I should confirm a reasonable, conservative dosing approach if used purely as an adjunct with informed consent about the evidence gap. A pragmatic, safety-conscious proxy would be to use the bacterial conjunctivitis schedule at the lower end of frequency, such as one drop into the affected eye's conjunctival sac four times daily for about five to seven days, recognizing this is extrapolated, off-label, and may not alter the natural history of the stye itself [^notfound].

> I should confirm safety, contraindications, and monitoring before suggesting any drops. Hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin or other quinolones is a contraindication, contact lenses should be removed during therapy, and patients should be counseled on local adverse effects such as burning, discomfort, conjunctival hyperemia, and rare corneal precipitates with frequent dosing; if accidental overdose occurs, irrigation with warm water is advised, and any worsening erythema, swelling, or vision changes should prompt urgent reassessment [^111sA15g] [^115kgaL1] [^113EK7DK] [^116Dq8a5].

> Let me reconsider pediatric implications briefly. The ophthalmic solution has established safety across ages in its labeled indications, but since we are discussing off-label use for stye, pediatric use should be individualized and generally avoided unless there is a compelling rationale, reinforcing that conservative measures and procedural drainage when indicated are preferred in children with hordeolum [^116pxNCY].

> I will now synthesize the clinical recommendation with explicit caveats. There is no evidence-based, stye-specific ciprofloxacin ophthalmic drop regimen, and routine topical antibiotic use for a stye is not supported by high-quality evidence; conservative therapy with warm compresses and hygiene is first-line, and incision and drainage is indicated for persistent or localized lesions, so if ciprofloxacin drops are nevertheless used as an off-label adjunct, a conservative regimen such as one drop four times daily for five to seven days may be considered with close follow-up and clear counseling about limited expected benefit and the need to monitor for adverse effects or progression [^1179sBe5].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan includes red flags and follow-up. Worsening eyelid swelling, spreading erygthema, fever, vision changes, or lack of improvement within 48 to 72 hours should prompt reassessment for progression to cellulitis or need for drainage, and patients should be instructed to avoid contact lens wear during treatment and to maintain strict hand hygiene to limit spread, aligning with general principles for ocular surface infections and periocular inflammation management [^115kgaL1].

Ciprofloxacin ophthalmic drops are **not indicated for styes** (hordeolum) because styes are localized eyelid gland infections that topical antibiotics cannot penetrate effectively. There is **no evidence-based dosing regimen** for ciprofloxacin drops in styes, and standard care is warm compresses and lid hygiene; reserve antibiotics for significant cellulitis or immunocompromise. If a topical antibiotic is used off-label, a common approach is 1–2 drops to the affected eye 3–4 times daily for 5–7 days, but this is unsupported by evidence and should be guided by a clinician.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding ciprofloxacin drops for styes

- **Lack of evidence**: There is no clinical evidence or guideline supporting ciprofloxacin drops for styes; they are not indicated for this condition [^113ejtdP].

- **Anatomy limits penetration**: Styes involve the eyelid glands, where topical drops cannot reach the infection site, limiting efficacy [^notfound].

- **Standard care**: Warm compresses and lid hygiene are first-line; antibiotics are only for significant cellulitis or immunocompromised patients.

---

## Recommended dosing regimen (if used off-label)

If ciprofloxacin drops are used off-label, a typical regimen is **1–2 drops into the affected eye 3–4 times daily for 5–7 days**; however, this is unsupported by evidence and should be clinician-guided.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **No guideline support**: Major guidelines (AAO, AAP) do not recommend topical antibiotics for styes.

- **Reserve antibiotics**: Use only for significant cellulitis or immunocompromised patients.

- **Emphasize conservative care**: Warm compresses and lid hygiene are first-line.

---

## Potential risks and side effects

- **Local irritation**: Burning, stinging, conjunctival hyperemia, and discomfort are common [^113EK7DK].

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, can occur [^115kgaL1].

- **Superinfection**: Prolonged use may promote fungal overgrowth or resistant organisms [^117WtgHH].

---

## Alternative treatments and preventive measures

- **Warm compresses**: Apply for 10–15 minutes, 3–4 times daily to promote drainage [^notfound].

- **Lid hygiene**: Use diluted baby shampoo or commercial lid scrubs to reduce recurrence.

- **Avoid irritants**: Minimize eye makeup and contact lens use during infection.

- **Incision and drainage**: Consider if stye persists or becomes a chalazion.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Ciprofloxacin drops | Not indicated; no evidence supports use |
| Warm compresses | First-line therapy |
| Lid hygiene | Essential preventive measure |
| Antibiotics | Reserve for significant cellulitis or immunocompromise |

---

Ciprofloxacin drops are **not indicated for styes**; there is **no evidence-based dosing regimen**. Use warm compresses and lid hygiene as first-line care, and reserve antibiotics for significant cellulitis or immunocompromised patients.

### A phase III clinical trial of 0.5% levofloxacin ophthalmic solution versus 0.3% ofloxacin ophthalmic solution for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis [^114x3Zfr]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of 0.5% levofloxacin ophthalmic solution (QUIXIN) with 0.3% ofloxacin ophthalmic solution for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.

Design

Prospective, randomized, active-controlled, double-masked, multicenter study.

Participants

Four hundred twenty-three patients with a clinical diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis were enrolled.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0.5% levofloxacin (n = 211) or 0.3% ofloxacin (n = 212) for 5 days (every 2 hours on days 1 and 2 and every 4 hours on days 3–5). Conjunctival cultures were obtained, and ocular signs and symptoms were evaluated on day 1 (baseline), days 3 to 5 (interim), and days 6 to 10 (final). End point was defined as the last evaluable observation.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary microbial and clinical outcomes were based on culture results and resolution of cardinal signs, respectively. Secondary efficacy assessments included evaluations of ocular signs and symptoms.

Results

Two hundred eight patients (levofloxacin, n = 109; ofloxacin, n = 99) were evaluated for efficacy. Microbial eradication rates were significantly greater in the 0.5% levofloxacin treatment group compared with the 0.3% ofloxacin group at both the final visit (89% vs. 80%, P = 0.034) and at end point (90% vs. 81%; P = 0.038). Treatment with 0.5% levofloxacin was significantly more effective in resolving photophobia than was 0.3% ofloxacin treatment (94% vs. 73%, P = 0.006). Both study medications were well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events.

Conclusions

Although clinical cure rates in the 0.5% levofloxacin and 0.3% ofloxacin treatment groups were similar, a 5-day treatment regimen with 0.5% levofloxacin achieved microbial eradication rates that were statistically superior to those attained with 0.3% ofloxacin. Despite the higher concentration of active drug in 0.5% levofloxacin versus 0.3% ofloxacin, there was no difference between treatment groups in the incidence of treatment-related adverse events.

### Potential new fluoroquinolone treatments for suspected bacterial keratitis [^116BTcJP]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Although topically applied antimicrobials are delivered frequently and at a high concentration, they may still not be sufficiently biologically active in the cornea due to protein binding, changes in pH, dilution in the tear film, and continued clearance by drainage through the nasolacrimal duct. It is, therefore, essential to evaluate antimicrobials under conditions that model the environment of a host, including the low pH within the phagolysosome, which is particularly relevant to intracellular pathogens and infected body sites. The activity of certain classes of antimicrobials (including FQs) can be adversely affected by a reduction in the pH of the local environment.

### Initial therapy for suppurative microbial keratitis in Iraq [^111gaNmV]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide data-based guidelines for selection of an appropriate initial therapy for management suppurative microbial keratitis (SMK) in Iraq.

Methods

This case-series study enrolled patients with clinical signs of suppurative keratitis suspected of being microbial, presented prospectively at Ibn Al-Haetham Teaching Eye Hospital from April 2002 to March 2005. Predisposing factors, microbial profile and sensitivities of isolated bacteria were determined. If direct microscopic examination of smears was negative for fungal elements, initial therapy started with ciprofloxacin 0.3% eye-drops. Subsequent treatment depends on clinical response and cultures' results.

Results

Out of 396 cases enrolled, positive cultures were obtained in 232 cases (58.6%). The predominating agents isolated were Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus and Streptococcus) 75 cases (18.9%); Pseudomonas 68 cases (17.2%); and fungal species 74 cases (18.7%). Treatment was initiated with ciprofloxacin eye-drops in 364 cases, a favourable response was recorded in 185 cases (50.8%), addition of other antimicrobial drugs was required in 56 cases (15.4%), while failure of treatment was recorded in 123 cases (33.8%).

Conclusion

Use of ciprofloxacin eye drops alone as an initial therapy cannot cover most of the causative agents of SMK in Iraq. Addition of another drug can provide a better coverage for the predominating causative agents. The choice of this additional drug is based on the suspected infecting agent depending on the regional predisposing factors, and the clinical features.

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^115L23qK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva and is one of the most common ocular disorders in primary care. Antibiotics are generally prescribed on the basis that they may speed recovery, reduce persistence, and prevent keratitis. However, many cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limited, resolving without antibiotic therapy. This Cochrane Review was first published in The Cochrane Library in 1999, then updated in 2006, 2012, and 2022.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and side effects of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2022, Issue 5), MEDLINE (January 1950 to May 2022), Embase (January 1980 to May 2022), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.

Clinicaltrials

gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases in May 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment, with or without steroid, had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical and systemic antibiotic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies. We assessed the full text of all potentially relevant studies and determined the included RCTs, which were further assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane methodology. We performed data extraction in a standardized manner and conducted random-effects meta-analyses using RevMan Web.

Main Results

We included 21 eligible RCTs, 10 of which were newly identified in this update. A total of 8805 participants were randomized. All treatments were topical in the form of drops or ointment. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their eligibility criteria, the nature of the intervention (antibiotic drug class, which included fluoroquinolones [FQs] and non-FQs; dosage frequency; duration of treatment), the outcomes assessed and the time points of assessment. We judged one trial to be of high risk of bias, four as low risk of bias, and the others as raising some concerns. Based on intention-to-treat (ITT) population, antibiotics likely improved clinical cure (resolution of clinical symptoms or signs) by 26% (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.46; 5 trials, 1474 participants; moderate certainty) as compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis showed no differences by antibiotic class (P = 0.67) or treatment duration (P = 0.60). In the placebo group, 55.5% (408/735) of participants had spontaneous clinical resolution by days 4 to 9 versus 68.2% (504/739) of participants treated with an antibiotic. Based on modified ITT population, in which participants were analyzed after randomization on the basis of positive microbiological culture, antibiotics likely increased microbiological cure (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.74; 10 trials, 2827 participants) compared with placebo at the end of therapy; there were no subgroup differences by drug class (P = 0.60). No study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic treatment. Patients receiving antibiotics had a lower risk of treatment incompletion than those in the placebo group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78; 13 trials, 5573 participants; moderate certainty) and were 27% less likely to have persistent clinical infection (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.81; 19 trials, 5280 participants; moderate certainty). There was no evidence of serious systemic side effects reported in either the antibiotic or placebo group (very low certainty). When compared with placebo, FQs (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90) but not non-FQs (RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.36 to 12.00) may result in fewer participants with ocular side effects. However, the estimated effects were of very low certainty.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this update suggest that the use of topical antibiotics is associated with a modestly improved chance of resolution in comparison to the use of placebo. Since no evidence of serious side effects was reported, use of antibiotics may therefore be considered to achieve better clinical and microbiologic efficacy than placebo. Increasing the proportion of participants with clinical cure or increasing the speed of recovery or both are important for individual return to work or school, allowing people to regain quality of life. Future studies may examine antiseptic treatments with topical antibiotics for reasons of cost and growing antibiotic resistance.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^111WYmb6]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — fluoroquinolone efficacy and resistance: Fourth-generation fluoroquinolones "are not FDA approved for the treatment of bacterial keratitis", yet "both moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin performed at least as well as standard therapy, fortified cefazolin/tobramycin combination therapy, and potentially better than an earlier generation fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin". Geographic and temporal resistance shifts are noted, including "a sharp increase in resistance of P. aeruginosa to moxifloxacin, from 19% in 2007 to 52% in 2009", and "increasing overall resistance of organisms to moxifloxacin from 1996 to 2015". "Besifloxacin 0.6% is a topical fluoroquinolone that has been established as a potent treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis and possibly bacterial keratitis", and a "Cochrane review found no evidence of difference in corneal perforation rates between any classes of topical antibiotics".

### Cefiderocol is an effective topical monotherapy for experimental extensively drug-resistantKeratitis [^116CqCUZ]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

For each keratitis trial, tobramycin 14 mg/ml was prepared from a 40 mg/ml stock of Tobramycin Injection USP (Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC). Notably, 3.5 mL of 40 mg/ml tobramycin was added to 6.5 mL of saline to yield 10 mL of 14 mg/ml of tobramycin. The solution was kept on ice during the experiment. Five mL bottles of Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, 0.3% (Sandoz Inc.) were used. The ciprofloxacin solution contains 0.006% benzalkonium chloride as a preservative. The ciprofloxacin bottles were kept at room temperature as directed. Saline served as the negative control and was kept on ice during dosing.

The cefiderocol, tobramycin, and saline solutions were instilled using a Rainin E4 XLS electronic pipet set in the multi-dispense mode. Thirty-seven μl drops were instilled. Ciprofloxacin 0.3% was instilled using its commercial dropper bottle.

Animals

New Zealand White female SPF rabbits weighing 1.1 to 1.4 kg were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Canadian rabbitry. These studies conformed to the ARVO Statement on the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the University of Pittsburgh's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC Protocol 23053154).

### Bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of ofloxacin 0.3% versus ciprofloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solutions in the treatment of patients with culture-positive bacterial keratitis [^113Duazu]. Cornea (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy and safety of ofloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution with ciprofloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution in patients with culture-positive bacterial keratitis.

Methods

Patients with a microbiologic diagnosis of bacterial keratitis were included in this double-masked, parallel-group study and were randomized to treatment with either ofloxacin 0.3% or ciprofloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution. One drop of the study medication was instilled during the daytime according to the following schedule: every half-hour on study day 1, every hour on days 2 through 4, and every 2 hours on days 5 through 21. Healing, the primary outcome measure, was defined as complete reepithelialization, accompanied by nonprogression of stromal infiltrate for 2 days. Secondary outcome measures included signs and symptoms of infection. Patients were monitored throughout the study period for any adverse events.

Results

A total of 217 patients completed the study: 112 were treated with ofloxacin and 105 were treated with ciprofloxacin. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most commonly encountered pathogen in all patients. Complete corneal reepithelialization occurred in 85% of those treated with ofloxacin and in 77% of those treated with ciprofloxacin (p = 0.32). The average time to corneal ulcer healing was 13.7 days in those treated with ofloxacin and 14.4 days in those treated with ciprofloxacin. Both treatments were well tolerated with no patient discontinuing the study because of side effects.

Conclusion

Ofloxacin 0.3% and ciprofloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solutions are effective and safe in the treatment of patients with culture-positive bacterial keratitis.

### Interventions for acute internal hordeolum [^11238Lfh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hordeolum is a common, painful inflammation of the eyelid margin that is usually caused by bacterial infection. The infection affects oil glands of the eyelid and can be internal or external. In many cases, the lesion drains spontaneously and resolves untreated; however, the inflammation can spread to other ocular glands or tissues, and recurrences are common. If unresolved, acute internal hordeolum can become chronic or can develop into a chalazion. External hordeola, also known as styes, were not included in the scope of this review.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of nonsurgical treatments for acute internal hordeolum compared with observation or placebo.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, (January 1950 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to July 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 26 July 2012.

Selection Criteria

The selection criteria for this review included randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials of participants diagnosed with acute internal hordeolum. Studies of participants with external hordeolum (stye), chronic hordeolum, or chalazion were excluded. Nonsurgical interventions of interest included the use of hot or warm compresses, lid scrubs, antibiotics, or steroids compared with observation, placebo, or other active interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the references identified by electronic searches for inclusion in this review. No relevant studies were found. The reasons for exclusion were documented.

Main Results

No trials were identified for inclusion in this review. Most of the references identified from our search reported on external hordeola or chronic internal hordeola. The few references specific to acute internal hordeolum reported mostly recommendations for treatment or were reports of interventional case series, case studies, or other types of observational study designs and were published more than 20 years ago.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find any evidence for or against the effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions for the treatment of hordeolum. Controlled clinical trials would be useful in determining which interventions are effective for the treatment of acute internal hordeolum.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^114XQMcQ]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Appropriate prescribing practices for fluoroquinolones are essential as evolving resistance patterns are considered, additional treatment indications are identified, and the toxicity profile of fluoroquinolones in children becomes better defined. Earlier recommendations for systemic therapy remain; expanded uses of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of certain infections are outlined in this report. Although fluoroquinolones are reasonably safe in children, clinicians should be aware of the specific adverse reactions. Use of fluoroquinolones in children should continue to be limited to treatment of infections for which no safe and effective alternative exists.

### Effectiveness of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in a prophylaxis model of Staphylococcus keratitis [^111HF4mm]. Cornea (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the effectiveness of prophylactic fluoroquinolone treatment against staphylococci in a rabbit keratitis model.

Methods

Prophylactic ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin was applied as one topical drop 15 minutes before infection or as one drop at three time points (19, 17, and 15 minutes) before infection. In a second experiment, rabbits were treated with two, three, or four drops of ciprofloxacin 1 hour before infection. Approximately 250 colony-forming units (CFUs) of Staphylococcus aureus were injected intrastromally, and CFUs were determined 5 hours after infection.

Results

The CFUs per cornea in all treatment groups were significantly less than the 5.6 ± 0.11 log CFUs per cornea in the untreated group (p ≤ 0.0001). Rabbit eyes treated 15 minutes before infection with Ciloxan or Ocuflox had 0.96 ± 0.48 log CFUs per cornea (three of six sterile corneas) or 1.26 ± 0.31 log CFUs per cornea (one of six sterile corneas), respectively (p = 0.5226). Eyes treated with Ciloxan 19, 17, and 15 minutes before infection had 0.0 ± 0.0 log CFUs per cornea, and all eyes were sterile, whereas eyes treated with Ocuflox had 0.98 ± 0.48 log CFUs per cornea and two of six eyes sterile (p = 0.0435). Eyes treated 1 hour before infection with two, three, or four drops of Ciloxan had 2.61 ± 0.69 log CFUs, 1.23 ± 0.32 log CFUs, or 0.85 ± 0.28 log CFUs per cornea, respectively, which was significantly less than untreated eyes (p ≤ 0.0001).

Conclusions

Multiple topical drops of a fluoroquinolone administered prophylactically were effective for subsequent staphylococcal ocular infection.

### An in vivo study comparing the ocular absorption of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin prior to phacoemulsification [^111m6ZFC]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare aqueous humor concentrations of levofloxacin vs ciprofloxacin when used as prophylactic medications before phacoemulsification.

Design

Patients (n = 93) were randomly assigned to receive either 0.5% levofloxacin (Quixin) or 0.3% ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan) using one of the following dosing regimens: (A) 1 to 2 drops four times a day for 2 days preoperatively; (B) 5 doses (1 to 2 drops) delivered every 10 minutes in the hour immediately preceding surgery; or (C) the combination of A and B.

Methods

Aqueous samples (0.1 ml) were obtained immediately before surgery, and drug concentrations were measured using high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.

Results

The mean concentration of levofloxacin in the aqueous humor was significantly greater than that of ciprofloxacin in all treatment groups (P < .001): 284.8 vs 67.4 microg/ml (regimen A); 1,135.6 vs 185.6 microg/ml (regimen B); and 1,618.6 vs 241.5 (regimen C). Dosing regimen B delivered significantly more drug to the aqueous humor than regimen A for both levofloxacin (P ≤ .001) and ciprofloxacin (P = 0.004). Dosing regimen C delivered significantly more drug to the aqueous humor than regimen B for levofloxacin (P = 0.05) but not for ciprofloxacin (P = 0.384).

Conclusions

Although the concentration of active drug in levofloxacin is approximately 1.7-fold higher than that in ciprofloxacin, the aqueous concentration of levofloxacin after topical administration was four to seven times greater than ciprofloxacin; these differences were statistically significant. With dosing regimens B and C, levofloxacin concentrations in the aqueous humor were above the MIC90 for most common ocular pathogens, including Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Ciprofloxacin did not reach such concentrations in any treatment group.

### Topical antibiotics for treating bacterial keratitis: a network meta-analysis [^115bo8Qn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Infectious keratitis, commonly known as corneal infection, is a major cause of blindness, affecting approximately six million people globally and resulting in around two million cases of monocular blindness annually. The incidence varies widely worldwide, with higher rates in low- and middle-income countries due to various risk factors, including agricultural injuries and other accidental trauma, limited access to health care, and low levels of health literacy. Bacterial keratitis (BK) is the most prevalent form in higher-income regions, contributing to significant morbidity and healthcare burden. If not diagnosed and treated promptly, BK can damage the cornea and result in corneal scarring, visual impairment and/or blindness. Broad-spectrum topical antibiotics remain the primary treatment, with regional microbiological profiles and antimicrobial resistance patterns influencing therapeutic choices. However, in view of the substantial heterogeneity in clinical practice, the optimal choice of topical antibiotics for BK remains uncertain. Addressing this unanswered question may help inform current practice and improve the clinical outcomes of BK.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of topical antibiotics for treating BK and to rank interventions by performing a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA).

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registries together with reference checking and contact with study authors (where necessary). The latest search date was 8 August 2024. There were no restrictions on language or year of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which different types of topical antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, vancomycin, etc.) and/or placebo were compared in participants with BK (diagnosed clinically or microbiologically, or both).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our outcomes were mean days to healing, mean size of epithelial defect, mean size of infiltrate, mean corrected and uncorrected distance visual acuity, and adverse effects. We assessed risk of bias using the RoB 2 tool and the certainty of evidence using the CINeMA framework for the primary NMA results of our critical outcome.

Main Results

We included 23 parallel-group RCTs that enrolled 2692 participants diagnosed with BK. The studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, India, Iran, Israel, Japan, the Philippines, Serbia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. The majority of participants were of working age, with a mean age ranging from 26 to 66 years, and 58% were male. We classified six types of interventions: fluoroquinolone monotherapy, cephalosporin monotherapy, penicillin monotherapy, dual therapy, triple therapy, and other monotherapy (povidone-iodine, honey, placebo), yielding 10 pair-wise comparisons. We judged 12 studies (54.5%) to be at high risk of bias and 10 studies (45.5%) to raise some concerns for bias. Based on the critical outcome (mean days to healing) analyzed by surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), vancomycin + ceftazidime (SUCRA of 83.8), moxifloxacin (SUCRA of 83.1), and cefazolin + tobramycin (SUCRA of 71.3) were shown to be the most effective treatments for BK. When compared with ciprofloxacin monotherapy (the comparison group), the following showed evidence of faster healing time (by more than two to seven days): moxifloxacin (mean difference [MD] -6.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] -13.83 to 0.20; moderate-certainty evidence), vancomycin + ceftazidime (MD -6.18, 95% CI -10.24 to -2.12; low-certainty evidence), cefazolin + tobramycin (MD -5.57, 95% CI -12.87 to 1.74; moderate-certainty evidence), gatifloxacin (MD -3.84, 95% CI -9.12 to 1.43; low-certainty evidence), cefazolin + gentamicin (MD -2.58, 95% CI -6.45 to 1.30; low-certainty evidence), and honey (MD -2.44, 95% CI -4.42 to -0.46; low-certainty evidence). Conversely, lomefloxacin (MD -0.94, 95% CI -3.88 to 2.00; moderate-certainty evidence) and ofloxacin (MD -0.70, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.50; high-certainty evidence) showed similar healing time to ciprofloxacin with less than one-day difference. Compared with vancomycin + ceftazidime, ofloxacin (MD 5.48, 95% CI 1.41 to 9.55; low-certainty evidence), lomefloxacin (MD 5.24, 95% CI 1.50 to 8.98; low-certainty evidence), and cefazolin + gentamicin (MD 3.60, 95% CI 2.38 to 4.82; low-certainty evidence) showed evidence of longer time to heal (by three to six days). Of the important outcomes, including mean size of epithelial defect, mean size of infiltrate, mean corrected and uncorrected distance visual acuity, and adverse effects, only the odds of non-serious harms/non-severe harms (ranging from ocular discomfort, hyperemia, toxicity, conjunctivitis, and superficial punctate keratitis to the need for therapeutic keratoplasty) had sufficient data for analysis. The three interventions least likely to cause harm were vancomycin + ceftazidime (SUCRA of 93.1), cefazolin + gentamicin (SUCRA of 82.5), and chlorhexidine + cefazolin (SUCRA of 77.0). Regarding the odds of any non-serious or non-severe harm, vancomycin + ceftazidime was associated with fewer harms than ciprofloxacin (odds ratio [OR] 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.92), gatifloxacin (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.90), and cefazolin + tobramycin (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.75), whereas cefuroxime + gentamicin was found to cause more harms than ofloxacin (OR 16.13, 95% CI 1.88 to 138.47), moxifloxacin (OR 20.31, 95% CI 1.15 to 358.25), cefazolin + gentamicin (OR 96.41, 95% CI 2.52 to 3692.25), and cefazolin + chlorhexidine (OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.71). We did not assess the certainty of evidence for harms.

Authors' Conclusions

In our NMA, mostly moderate- to very low-certainty evidence suggests that vancomycin + ceftazidime combination therapy, moxifloxacin monotherapy, and cefazolin + tobramycin combination therapy may be the most effective treatments for BK in terms of corneal healing time, whereas ciprofloxacin monotherapy is the least effective. Given that most evidence was not of high certainty, the results of this NMA should be interpreted with caution, and future research could potentially alter these findings.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride solution (Ciprofloxacin) [^117WtgHH]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS SECTION

General: As with other antibacterial preparations, prolonged use of ciprofloxacin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Whenever clinical judgment dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Ciprofloxacin should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity reaction. In clinical studies of patients with bacterial corneal ulcer, a white crystalline precipitate located in the superficial portion of the corneal defect was observed in 35 (16.6%) of 210 patients. The onset of the precipitate was within 24 hours to 7 days after starting therapy. In one patient, the precipitate was immediately irrigated out upon its appearance. In 17 patients, resolution of the precipitate was seen in 1 to 8 days (seven within the first 24–72 hours), in five patients, resolution was noted in 10–13 days. In nine patients, exact resolution days were unavailable; however, at follow-up examinations, 18–44 days after onset of the event, complete resolution of the precipitate was noted. In three patients, outcome information was unavailable. The precipitate did not preclude continued use of ciprofloxacin, nor did it adversely affect the clinical course of the ulcer or visual outcome. (SEE ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride solution (Ciprofloxacin) [^113RaAhK]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice at doses up to six times the usual daily human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ciprofloxacin. In rabbits, as with most antimicrobial agents, ciprofloxacin (30 and 100 mg/kg orally) produced gastrointestinal disturbances resulting in maternal weight loss and an increased incidence of abortion. No teratogenicity was observed at either dose. After intravenous administration, at doses up to 20 mg/kg, no maternal toxicity was produced and no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ciprofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether topically applied ciprofloxacin is excreted in human milk. However, it is known that orally administered ciprofloxacin is excreted in the milk of lactating rats and oral ciprofloxacin has been reported in human breast milk after a single 500 mg dose. Caution should be exercised when Ciprofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution is administered to a nursing mother.

Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 year have not been established. Although ciprofloxacin and other quinolones cause arthropathy in immature animals after oral administration, topical ocular administration of ciprofloxacin to immature animals did not cause any arthropathy and there is no evidence that the ophthalmic dosage form has any effect on the weight bearing joints.

Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.

Bacterial keratitis topical antibiotic costs and efficacy: When topical antibiotics are considered specifically, the cost of fortified antibiotics can be much higher than commercially available antibiotics because of the costs associated with compounding pharmacies. Use of a topical second-generation fluoroquinolone (e.g., ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) has been shown to be comparable in efficacy to fortified antibiotics; however, no randomized controlled study comparing the outcomes of fluoroquinolones with the outcomes of fortified antibiotics in severe cases of bacterial keratitis has been performed.

### Topical ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone combination therapy after cataract surgery: randomized controlled clinical trial [^117Rzw6Q]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the efficacy of a combination of ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% eyedrops in controlling immediate inflammation after cataract surgery.

Setting

Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences and Department of Pharmacology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.

Methods

This randomized controlled clinical trial comprised 61 patients, 31 of whom were treated with a combined ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone suspension (study group) and 30, with a standard formulation of betamethasone and neomycin eyedrops (control group). One and 7 days postoperatively, pain, lid edema, lacrimation, conjunctival congestion, aqueous flare and cells, and side effects were noted. A conjunctival swab for bacteria and a fungus culture were sent for evaluation 7 days postoperatively.

Results

At 7 days, there was no statistically significant difference between groups in lid edema, conjunctival congestion, anterior segment inflammation, lacrimation, or pain. Two patients in the ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone group noted white deposits in and around the eye that resolved after the dose was reduced to 4 times a day. No patient reported or developed an allergic reaction to either drug combination.

Conclusion

A ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone combination was effective in controlling inflammation after cataract surgery.

### Pooled analysis of two clinical trials comparing the clinical outcomes of topical ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone otic suspension and polymyxin B / neomycin / hydrocortisone otic suspension for the treatment of acute otitis externa in adults and children [^112gvBJa]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the clinical outcome of patients receiving topical ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% (CD) otic suspension with that of those receiving polymyxin B/neomycin/ hydrocortisone (PNH) otic suspension for the treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE).

Methods

Data from 2 institutional review board-approved, multicenter, observer-masked, parallel-group, randomized, noninferiority clinical trials conducted at 76 institutions across the United States between April 1998 and July 1999 were pooled together for this analysis. Patients ≥ 1 year of age diagnosed with AOE were considered for inclusion in the studies. Patients with AOE > 4 weeks' duration, a perforated tympanic membrane, chronic suppurative otitis media, or use of either antibiotics or steroids within the previous 7 days were excluded from the studies. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CD or PNH for 7 days. CD was administered as 3 drops in children and 4 drops in patients ≥ 12 years of age BID. PNH was administered as 3 drops in children and 4 drops in patients ≥ 12 years of age TID. The clinical investigators were blinded to treatment assignment. Due to the different dosing regimens, patients were not blinded, but they also were not directly informed of their treatment assignments. Otic inflammation, tenderness, edema, and discharge were clinically assessed on days 3, 8, and 18 of the studies. Otic inflammation and edema were evaluated using a 4-point scale (none = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; and severe = 3). Otic tenderness and discharge were rated on a binomial scale (absent = 0 and present = 1). The clinical assessments were aggregated into a 9-point composite clinical scale (range, 0–8) to compare baseline severity between groups. For the final outcomes assessment in this study, the aggregated clinical scores were dichotomized into cured (0) versus noncured (> 0) and analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier survival technique. A log-rank test was used to compare the cure curves between treatment groups. Kaplan-Meier summary statistics provide the mean and median times to cure, and the mean times to cure for the 25th and 75th patient quartiles. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring patients for adverse events at each visit.

Results

Data from 1072 patients (1242 ears) were included in the analysis (CD, 537 patients; PNH, 535 patients). Baseline AOE severity and demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The mean patient age was 21.7 and 22.0 years in the CD and PNH groups, respectively. Both groups were similar with respect to sex, with 50.7% and 53.5% females in the CD and PNH groups, respectively. The racial composition was predominately white (88.6% vs 84.9% in the CD and PNH groups, respectively). The log-rank test revealed a significant difference in the AOE cure curves between the CD and PNH groups (P = 0.038). The proportions cured in the AOE at-risk groups at the day-3, -8, and -18 assessments in the CD and PNH treatment groups were 0.14 and 0.10, 0.75 and 0.72, and 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier summary statistics indicated that the mean time to cure was 0.6 day less with CD compared with PNH (9.7 vs 10.3 days). Treatment-related adverse event rates were similar between the 2 groups and occurred in 3.8% of the patients. The most common adverse events included otic pruritus (2.1%), otic congestion (0.6%), otic debris (0.5%), otic pain (0.3%), superimposed ear infection (0.3%), and erythema (0.1%).

Conclusion

These data from 2 previous studies suggest that time to cure was significantly less with CD compared with PNH in patients with AOE.

### Variability in the content of Indian generic ciprofloxacin eye drops [^117AaNPz]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Under-potent generic antibiotics sold in developing world countries may be contributing to positive selection of resistance organisms and to unpredictability in clinical outcome, leading to a loss of confidence among physicians locally. The objective of this study was to determine whether reports of unpredictable outcome for generic ciprofloxacin antibiotic eye drops in India could be the result of inadequate concentration of preparations sold by pharmacies.

Methods

130 ciprofloxacin eye drop samples sold by pharmacies were collected from seven locations in north, central, and south India; 30 were randomly selected for testing. All samples were assayed using validated methods of reverse phase chromatography and fluorescence detection at a international antibiotic reference laboratory in the United Kingdom. Results were compared with advertised concentrations within the context of internationally accepted variability ranges.

Results

In total, six out of the 30 samples tested had ciprofloxacin concentrations lower than the standard advisory ranges of plus or minus 5% of stated content for 3 mg/ml pharmaceutical preparations. The ciprofloxacin content of these eye drops ranged from -36.4% to -16.1% of the stated content (median -21.73%). 24 out of 30 samples were found to be over the standard advisory ranges of plus or minus 5%, at a median of +19.42% (interquartile range (IQR) +14.28 to +25.13). Intra-batch variability of two selected samples was wide at -22.83% to +33.93% (n = 11) and -17.07% to +31.20% (n = 12).

Conclusions

Approximately 20% of generic ciprofloxacin eye drops, purchased without prescription in India were under-potent. In a number of preparations the antibiotic content was sufficiently low as to have a potential impact on clinical outcome and possibly lead to the selection of resistant isolates in individual patients. More widespread studies are justified to identify the extent of under-potency of widely used generic antibiotic medications in developing countries.

### Bacterial etiology of ocular and periocular infections, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and associated factors among patients attending eye unit of shashemene comprehensive specialized hospital, shashemene, Ethiopia [^117F2f9m]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The eye is one of the sense organs in humans which is important throughout life for daily activities. The awareness given to eye health and cleanliness is essential. Dust, high temperature, microorganisms, and other factors can lead to eye diseases which may lead to loss of sight.

Although the eye can be infected, it is remarkably resistant to colonization and infection by microbes. There is disparity in the type of bacteria that colonize the eye and other parts of the body. Although the eye is remarkably resistant to colonization and infection by microbes, it is prone to infection because the lens and vitreous are avascular and protein-rich structures; thus, ideal media for the proliferation of many pathogenic bacteria. The external part of the eye is susceptible to bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infections. Microorganisms can also invade and damage the internal parts of the eye, which often results in loss of vision. The source of eye infection can be exogenous or endogenous. Clinically external eye infections can be presented as conjunctivitis, keratitis, blepharitis, canaliculitis, dacryocystitis, external hordeolum and cellulitis. The clinical signs and symptoms of inflammation of the eyes along with pus are frequently caused by bacteria. Globally, purulent bacterial conjunctivitis is mainly caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The most common causative agents are Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. The microbial etiology and drug susceptibility, as well as resistance profile may differ with geographic location.

The common way of transmission of pathogens is the contact with contaminated fingers, eyelids margins, and adjacent skin, from the nasopharynx via the nasolacrimal duct, from infected eye drops or contact lenses and more rarely from the genitals or via the bloodstream. Bacterial eye infection needs immediate treatment. Treatment of bacterial eye infections involves empirical treatment with topical ophthalmic broad-spectrum antibiotic formulations that become a prevailing practice among ophthalmologists and general practitioners. This along with the irrational use of drugs, availability of antibiotics without prescription, has led to the development of resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

There are 1.4 million blind children estimated worldwide, of whom about 320,000 live in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of blindness was reported to be 1.6% and about 87.4% of the cases were due to preventable causes, bacterial infection is one of them. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of ocular and periocular infections, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and associated factors.

### Interventions for acute internal hordeolum [^115keSsj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Hordeolum is a common, painful, inflammation of the eyelid margin that is usually caused by bacterial infection. The infection affects oil glands of the eyelid and can be internal or external. In many cases, the lesion drains spontaneously and resolves untreated; however, the inflammation can spread to other ocular glands or tissues and recurrences are common. If unresolved, acute internal hordeolum can become chronic or develop into a chalazion. External hordeola, also known as styes, were not included in the scope of this review.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of non-surgical treatments for acute internal hordeolum compared to observation or placebo.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 6), MEDLINE (January 1950 to June 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2010), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to June 2010), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 21 June 2010.

Selection Criteria

The selection criteria for this review included randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials of patients diagnosed with acute internal hordeolum. Studies of patients with external hordeolum (stye), chronic hordeolum or chalazion were excluded. Non-surgical interventions of interest included the use of hot or warm compresses, lid scrubs, antibiotics, or steroids compared to observation, placebo, or other active interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the references identified by the electronic searches for inclusion in this review. No relevant studies were found. The reasons for exclusion were documented.

Main Results

There were no trials identified for inclusion in this review. The majority of the references identified from our search reported on external hordeola or chronic internal hordeola. The few references specific to acute internal hordeolum reported mostly recommendations for treatment or were reports of interventional case series, case studies, or other types of observational study designs and were published over 20 years ago.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find any evidence for or against the effectiveness of non-surgical interventions for the treatment of hordeolum. Controlled clinical trials would be useful in determining which interventions are effective for the treatment of acute internal hordeolum.

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Zar2H]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Participants, Randomization, and Blinding in the RCT

Children aged 6 months to 7 years with a clinical diagnosis of acute infective conjunctivitis were eligible for enrollment. Acute infective conjunctivitis was defined as the presence of conjunctival inflammation (erythema), discharge, or soreness or swelling of the eyelids. The exclusion criteria were allergy to fluoroquinolones, antibiotic therapy 7 days prior to the study, severe infection, allergic conjunctivitis, a trauma, or a foreign body in the eye. All the children were from Finnish-speaking families.

The eligible children were randomized to receive moxifloxacin eye drops, placebo eye drops, or no intervention in a 1:1:1 ratio. A biostatistician created a randomization list in permuted blocks of 6 in a random order, and the results were enclosed in sealed, numbered opaque envelopes containing either a code for the study group or the words no treatment. After informed consent had been obtained, the study physician opened the envelope and revealed a code (A or B) or no treatment.

The participating children, their parents, and the physicians and nurses were blinded to the assignment of the moxifloxacin and placebo eye drop groups, while the study design for the no intervention group was randomized but unblinded. The pharmacy distributed the eye drops and instructions to the families in opaque cardboard boxes in which the moxifloxacin eye drops were packed in plastic bottles and the placebo eye drops in single-dose vials. Both the bottles and the vials were transparent and did not have labels.

RCT Procedures

Conjunctival and nasopharyngeal specimens subjected to respiratory pathogen polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and bacterial culture were obtained from the participants, and detailed descriptions of these microbiological samples are available in the study protocol (Supplement 1). The participants in the eye drop groups received either moxifloxacin eye drops (5 mg/mL [Novartis Finland]) or placebo eye drops (carboxymethylcellulose sodium, 1.0% [Allergan Pharmaceuticals Ireland]) administered as 1 drop in each affected eye 3 times daily until conjunctival symptoms were absent for at least 24 hours. The maximum duration of treatment was 7 days. The placebo eye drops used in the trial did not contain preservatives. All parents, including those in the no intervention group, were advised to remove any discharge from the child's eyes at least 3 times a day. Moxifloxacin eye drops were started in a nonblinded manner as a rescue treatment if needed.

Results

We identified a total of 105 studies (figure 1), the majority of which were case series or case reports–(table 1). However, most of the patients (88%) were within case series or cohort studies.

Figure 1
Algorithm of the analysis of the studies in the systematic review.

Table 1
Summary of 105 studies that reported on safety of ciprofloxacin in paediatrics

Dosage and formulations

The dose ranged from 3.1 to 93.8 mg/kg/day (oral) and 3.2 to 76.9 mg/kg/day (intravenous). The usual dose in at least 60% of studies was 10–30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for both oral and intravenous administration. The duration of ciprofloxacin ranged from single dose (pharmacokinetic studies, therapy for cholera and prophylaxis for meningococcal disease) to 880 days (a 12-year-old with osteomyelitis). The median duration of use was 14 days.

Due to the lack of a commercially available paediatric formulation, various formulations were used, including a prepared suspension from granular ciprofloxacin, tablets, ground tablets, a suspension formulation from Bayer, pulverised tablets with sweet liquid, and tablets crushed and mixed in cherry syrup. Topical ciprofloxacin was administered as drops to the eyes/ears.

Factors affecting bioavailability of FQs

Although bioavailability, urinary fraction and maximum serum concentration are important for systemically administered antimicrobials, protein binding and other local environment factors such, as pH or release of ions, which might interfere with an antimicrobial's activity, are of more importance for topically administered antimicrobials. This is evident in the lower bioavailability (activity) of an FQ such as ciprofloxacin in the cornea compared with its chemical concentration, which is the parameter that is usually measured. Compared with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, delafloxacin and nemonoxacin are much less affected by protein binding (table 2). Therefore, they are expected to have greater bioavailability in the cornea in MK.

FQs that are not licensed for topical ocular use must be compounded into a suitable preparation. There are a variety of topical ophthalmic formulations available, including aqueous or oily solutions, suspensions, emulsions, gels and colloidal systems. Reformulation can be based on a licensed systemic FQ as the starting raw material but requires factoring in the chemistry of the active ingredient so that the required concentration to deliver the intended antimicrobial activity is sustained. This may require adding excipients into the preparation to adjust pH, tonicity and viscosity. pH adjustment may improve the stability and solubility of the active agent and reduced crystallisation. Once formulated, eye-drops may be packaged in either 'single use' or multidose containers to maintain drug concentration and stability. This will increase the probability that the antimicrobial will meet the required antimicrobial effectiveness test. An antimicrobial preservative is often added to multidose containers, although some self-preserved medicines such as moxifloxacin may pass these tests without preservative addition. Reformulation of systemic FQs for topical application must comply with good manufacturing standards within a suitably approved compounding unit.

### Cornea / external disease summary benchmarks – 2024 [^112gCByB]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis (initial evaluation) — care management notes that topical antibiotic eye drops are capable of achieving high tissue levels, a preferred method of treatment in most cases. Single-drug therapy using a fluoroquinolone is as effective as combination therapy utilizing fortified antibiotics, and fortified topical antibiotics to be considered for large and/or visually significant corneal infiltrates, especially if hypopyon is present, with combination fortified-antibiotic therapy as an alternative for severe infection or eyes unresponsive to initial treatment; there is no difference found in corneal perforation rates across classes of topical antibiotics. Topical corticosteroid therapy may have a beneficial role, but much of the literature has not shown a difference in clinical outcome, and subconjunctival antibiotics may be helpful where adherence is questionable or there is a delay in obtaining fortified antibiotics. For central or severe keratitis (e.g., deep stromal involvement or an infiltrate larger than 2 mm with extensive suppuration), use a loading dose (e.g., every 5 to 15 minutes), followed by frequent applications (e.g., every hour is recommended), and severe cases should be followed daily initially, at least until stable or improvement is confirmed.

Systemic Absorption A systemic absorption study was performed in which ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution was administered in each eye every two hours while awake for two days followed by every four hours while awake for an additional 5 days. The maximum reported plasma concentration of ciprofloxacin was less than 5 ng/mL. The mean concentration was usually less than 2. 5 ng/mL. In 17 patients, resolution of the precipitate was seen in 1 to 8 days, in five patients, resolution was noted in 10 to 13 days. In nine patients, exact resolution days were unavailable; however, at follow-up examinations, 18 to 44 days after onset of the event, complete resolution of the precipitate was noted. In three patients, outcome information was unavailable. The precipitate did not preclude continued use of ciprofloxacin, nor did it adversely affect the clinical course of the ulcer or visual outcome.

Corneal Ulcers The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of corneal ulcers is two drops into the affected eye every 15 minutes for the first six hours and then two drops into the affected eye every 30 minutes for the remainder of the first day. On the second day, instill two drops in the affected eye hourly. On the third through the fourteenth day, place two drops in the affected eye every four hours. Treatment may be continued after 14 days if corneal re-epithelialization has not occurred.

### Fourth-generation fluoroquinolone penetration into the aqueous humor in humans [^112yJM1Z]. Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the penetration and levels of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution and gatifloxacin 0.3% solution in the aqueous humor (AH) in humans after topical application with published levels of other available fluoroquinolones under similar dosing conditions.

Design

Prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial.

Participants

Forty-six patients undergoing cataract extraction.

Methods

Patients scheduled for routine phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation were provided either moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution (n = 22) or gatifloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution (n = 24) to use 4 times daily the day before surgery plus 1 drop 1 hour before the surgical entry into the anterior chamber on the day of surgery. This regimen simulated a realistic postoperative dosing schedule. Aqueous humor samples were obtained and analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Aqueous humor fluoroquinolone concentrations were calculated by peak comparison with a known concentration peak for ciprofloxacin that was used as an internal standard. These values were compared with published concentrations of other available fluoroquinolones under similar dosing conditions.

Results

The mean age of the moxifloxacin 0.5% group was 67.8 ± 9.7 years, whereas that of the gatifloxacin 0.3% group was 69.9 ± 8.7 years. The moxifloxacin AH concentration was 1.86 ± 1.06 microg/ml, and that of gatifloxacin was 0.94 ± 0.72 microg/ml. This 2-fold difference was statistically significant (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Aqueous humor antibiotic concentrations achieved at the time of cataract surgery after topical application can serve as an effective surrogate for what can be achieved with typical postoperative topical dosing (e.g., 4 times daily). Both fourth-generation fluoroquinolones achieved a greater AH concentration after 4 times daily dosing relative to prior-generation fluoroquinolones. Moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution achieved a 2-fold higher aqueous humor concentration than gatifloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution. The superior penetration of moxifloxacin into the AH may be attributed partially to its high degree of lipophilicity, greater solubility at neutral pH, and higher concentration in the commercial formulation. The enhanced penetration of moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution may provide better protection against ocular infections.

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (2016; Issue 12)), MEDLINE Ovid, MEDLINE Ovid Epub Ahead of Print, MEDLINE Ovid In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE(R) Ovid Daily (January 1946 to December 2016), Embase (January 1947 to December 2016), PubMed (1948 to December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS (January 1982 to December 2016)), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT; www.controlled-trials.com (last searched 26 July 2012)), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 December 2016.

Selection Criteria

The selection criteria for this review included randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials of participants diagnosed with an acute internal hordeolum. Studies of participants with external hordeola (styes), chronic hordeola, or chalazia were excluded. Non-surgical interventions of interest included the use of hot or warm compresses, lid scrubs, antibiotics, or steroids compared with observation, placebo, or other active interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the references identified by electronic searches for inclusion in this review. No relevant studies were found. The reasons for exclusion were documented.

Main Results

No trials were identified for this review. Most of the references identified through our search reported on external hordeola or chronic internal hordeola. The few references specific to acute internal hordeola reported recommendations for treatment, were reports of interventional case series, case studies, or other types of observational study designs, and were published more than 20 years ago.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find any evidence for or against the effectiveness of non-surgical interventions for the treatment of an internal hordeolum. Controlled clinical trials would be useful to determine which interventions are effective for the treatment of acute internal hordeola.

Pharmacodynamics

This refers to the mechanisms by which a microorganism is susceptible to a drug and the intensity of the antimicrobial effect in relation to its tissue concentration. As mentioned, the relationship between the MIC of the topically applied antimicrobial and the clinical outcome could be used to determine the ophthalmic breakpoint concentration. The clinical outcome is usually defined as time to corneal re-epithelialisation, the intensity of scar, or the spectacle-corrected visual acuity after a specified follow-up interval. Initial ulcer sizes vary, and it has been proposed that incorporating the ratio of ulcer size to the healing time could standardise outcomes. Several studies show a relationship between the MIC of the topically applied antimicrobial and the clinical outcome. Wilhelmus et al, found that infection with a bacterial strain with an MIC to ciprofloxacin greater than 1.0 mg/L was more likely to result in a lower rate of improvement and cure compared with strains with a lower MIC. We have shown that for Pseudomonas spp, S. aureus and Enterobacteriaceae there is a linear association between the MIC of an FQ and time to epithelial healing. In contrast, for bacteria such as Streptococcus spp and Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), there was no significant association. It is not known, however, whether this reflects the limited activity of the FQs against Streptococcus spp. However, isolates from cases of MK have also been shown to have distinctive characteristics, such as the prevalence of virulence factors that can also affect the healing time. For example, P. aeruginosa isolated from the cases of MK have a higher proportion of exotoxin U producing strains than lung isolates, with worse clinical outcomes.

### Treatment of ciprofloxacin-resistant ear infections [^114kUHjN]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Ciprofloxacin resistance has been reported in 4.5% of patients with otorrhea and is increasing in prevalence. Due to ototoxicity, only fluoroquinolones are Food and Drug Administration approved for topical therapy in the middle ear. Furthermore, there is an assumption that antibiotic resistance is less relevant to topical therapy due to in vivo concentrations much higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration used to determine resistance. This study investigates ciprofloxacin-resistant infections and seeks to develop a better understanding of treatment options and outcomes.

Study Design

Retrospective review of 141 ciprofloxacin-resistant otologic infections.

Setting

Tertiary-care hospital.

Patients

Patients with culture-proven ciprofloxacin-resistant infections from 2008 to 2017.

Intervention(S)

Antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin topical drops, ciprofloxacin plus oral antibiotics, and nonciprofloxacin therapy.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Bacteriology for ciprofloxacin-resistant infections and treatment effectiveness of various therapies.

Results

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (33%), Corynebacterium striatum (19%), and non-Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (11%) are the most frequent causes of ciprofloxacin-resistant infections. Topical ciprofloxacin monotherapy was successful in 2.7% of infections compared with a 64.7% success rate with the addition of an oral antibiotic (p < 0.001). Nonciprofloxacin drops are more effective with a 70% cure rate compared with the 2.7% of the ciprofloxacin drops p < 0.001. There was no difference in treatment efficacy when comparing nonciprofloxacin topical therapy (70% cure) to nonciprofloxacin topical therapy plus oral antibiotic (83% cure, p = 0.17).

Conclusions

Using ciprofloxacin drops to treat ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria is ineffective and patients do significantly better with alternative therapy. This finding supports the conclusion that high concentrations achieved in topical applications are not sufficient to overcome antibiotic resistance.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112fRP55]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — adverse events, adherence, cost, and dosing — has an overall low incidence of adverse events, with pruritus (about 5% to 7%) and site reaction (4% to 5%), and other events less than 2%, and two meta-analyses comparing a quinolone drop versus neomycin–polymyxin B–hydrocortisone found no significant difference in adverse events; however, about 30% to 60% of patients with chronic or eczematous external otitis develop a contact dermatitis, most often to aminoglycoside drops, and it would appear prudent to avoid using aminoglycoside drops in these populations. Adherence and patient satisfaction are highest when drops are easy to administer, and drops administered 4 times daily may be less acceptable; costs range from a few dollars for antiseptics or generic products to more than $100 for quinolones. Available data suggest that, at least with quinolone drops, a twice-daily dosing regimen is as effective as more frequent dosing with the quinolones, and more recent trials recommend 7 to 10 days of topical therapy.

### Ciprofloxacin versus aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin for bubonic plague [^112AdQef]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

While several treatment regimens for plague are recommended in treatment guidelines, they are supported by weak evidence, with no pivotal randomised controlled trials successfully completed. Some regimens are approved by the United States Food and Drugs Administration (US FDA) under the 'animal efficacy rule'– streptomycin, doxycycline and other tetracyclines; and the fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin – others, though not FDA-approved, are generally considered effective – gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. For all plague treatments there are little or no human efficacy data.

Significant challenges hamper the conduct of plague treatment trials: logistical – small number of cases often occurring in remote rural areas; accessibility; security and social instability in some plague-endemic areas; and methodological – definition of an agreed endpoint of cure or improvement.

The 2018 guidelines for the treatment of bubonic plague in Madagascar recommend for adults a 3-day course of injectable aminoglycoside (first-line streptomycin, second-line gentamicin) followed by a 7-day course of oral ciprofloxacin, and a 10-day course of oral ciprofloxacin as third-line option; this treatment is the first-line choice for children under 15 years-old (Supplementary Appendix S1 Table).

Lack of higher quality evidence supporting treatment regimens and shortcomings of aminoglycosides (requiring injections, toxicity, poor intracellular penetration) prompted us to design a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing these two regimens.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^112azjxU]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — care management: Topical antibiotic eye drops are capable of achieving high tissue levels, a preferred method of treatment in most cases. Single-drug therapy using a fluoroquinolone is as effective as combination therapy utilizing fortified antibiotics. Fortified topical antibiotics to be considered for large and/or visually significant corneal infiltrates, especially if hypopyon is present. Combination fortified-antibiotic therapy is an alternative, especially for severe infection and eyes unresponsive to initial treatment, and there is no difference found in corneal perforation rates across classes of topical antibiotics. Topical corticosteroid therapy may have a beneficial role, but much of the literature has not shown a difference in clinical outcome. Subconjunctival antibiotics may be helpful where adherence is questionable or there is a delay in obtaining fortified antibiotics. For central or severe keratitis (e.g., deep stromal involvement or an infiltrate larger than 2 mm with extensive suppuration), use a loading dose (e.g., every 5 to 15 minutes), followed by frequent applications (e.g., every hour is recommended). Severe cases should be followed daily initially, at least until stable or improvement is confirmed.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^114Qh5w5]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Appropriate prescribing practices for fluoroquinolones, as well as all antimicrobial agents, are essential as evolving resistance patterns are considered, additional treatment indications are identified, and the toxicity profile of fluoroquinolones in children has become better defined. Earlier recommendations for systemic therapy remain; expanded uses of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of certain infections are outlined in this report. Prescribing clinicians should be aware of specific adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones, and their use in children should continue to be limited to the treatment of infections for which no safe and effective alternative exists or in situations in which oral fluoroquinolone treatment represents a reasonable alternative to parenteral antimicrobial therapy.
