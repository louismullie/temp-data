## Question

Can PE have normal d dimer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pulmonary embolism (PE) can occur with a normal D-dimer result. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of D-dimer generation and why it might be normal despite thrombosis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance characteristics of D-dimer assays, especially sensitivity and negative predictive value. Next, I will review guideline positions on when a normal D-dimer can safely exclude PE. After that, I should examine real-world and trial data for false negatives and their contexts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer and outline exceptions where imaging is still indicated despite a normal D-dimer.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. D-dimer reflects fibrin degradation from clot lysis; in theory, a very small or chronic clot may generate little acute fibrinolysis, so D-dimer can be normal even when PE is present, particularly with limited thrombus burden or subsegmental emboli, which aligns with the observation that smaller clots are more likely to yield false-negative D-dimer results [^a406300a].

> Wait, let me verify the assay performance before drawing conclusions. High-sensitivity D-dimer assays have excellent sensitivity, typically around 95–100% in pooled analyses, but they are not perfect; false negatives occur, and specificity is poor, especially in older adults or hospitalized patients, which is why a normal D-dimer cannot absolutely exclude PE in all contexts [^83f12dce] [^fc78c74a] [^782fcf70].

> I need to check guideline positions to anchor safe practice. Major guidelines advise that a normal D-dimer can safely exclude PE only when combined with low or intermediate pretest probability using validated clinical decision rules; in patients with high pretest probability, a normal D-dimer does not obviate the need for imaging, and D-dimer should not be used as a stand-alone rule-out test in that scenario [^39d385ad] [^f770ed7a] [^1d23f3fe] [^4ee4740e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the magnitude of false negatives. In a large ED cohort using ELISA D-dimer, sensitivity was 96.4% with 2 false negatives among 547 normal results, yielding a 3-month VTE rate of 0.4% after exclusion, which supports safety in low-risk patients but still confirms that false negatives happen [^5c43090d]. In another prospective study, 5 of 352 patients with confirmed PE had D-dimer below 500 ng/mL, again illustrating real-world false negatives, particularly when clinical probability is not low [^0bb19545]. Even with age-adjusted strategies, rare failures occur, underscoring the need to integrate pretest probability rather than rely on D-dimer alone [^b6aa8722] [^86c041f8].

> Let me consider special populations where false negatives are more likely. Subsegmental PE, chronic or recurrent PE, and patients with limited clot burden can have lower D-dimer levels, reducing assay sensitivity; similarly, in pregnancy, evidence is insufficient to rely on D-dimer to exclude PE, and professional society guidance recommends against using D-dimer alone in this setting, reflecting both physiologic elevation and documented false negatives [^a406300a] [^84468620]. I should also confirm that in COVID-19, despite higher baseline D-dimer, standard thresholds still miss a small but meaningful fraction, reinforcing caution when pretest probability is elevated [^d8f2499a].

> Next, I should review how pretest probability modifies safety. When D-dimer is combined with an "unlikely" Wells or Geneva score, the 3-month VTE failure rate is extremely low, on the order of 0.3–1.1% in meta-analyses and large cohorts, which is why this strategy is endorsed by guidelines; conversely, in patients with "likely" pretest probability, the failure rate with a normal D-dimer can exceed 9%, making imaging mandatory despite a normal result [^4bafe03a] [^2d454d59] [^39d385ad].

> But wait, what if we use higher D-dimer thresholds to improve specificity; does that change safety? Age-adjusted cutoffs increase the proportion of older adults in whom PE can be excluded without imaging, but they still preserve high sensitivity; even with age-adjusted thresholds, rare false negatives are reported, so clinical probability remains decisive in borderline cases [^b6aa8722] [^81d5cb90] [^86c041f8].

> I should double-check the bottom line. Yes, PE can occur with a normal D-dimer, albeit infrequently; the test is highly sensitive but not 100%, and its negative predictive value is highest when pretest probability is low or intermediate and falls when clinical suspicion is high. Therefore, a normal D-dimer can safely exclude PE only when integrated with a validated clinical decision rule and the pretest probability is not high; in high-probability patients, proceed directly to imaging regardless of D-dimer [^39d385ad] [^f770ed7a] [^1d23f3fe].

---

Yes, pulmonary embolism (PE) can occur with a normal D-dimer, but this is uncommon. D-dimer is highly sensitive (about 95–99%) [^83f12dce] [^fc78c74a] but not 100% specific; false negatives occur, especially with **small or distal clots** [^a406300a], **early testing** [^notfound], or **chronic PE**. A normal D-dimer **cannot safely exclude PE** when clinical suspicion is high or when the patient is at high risk (e.g. cancer, recent surgery, or prior VTE) [^f770ed7a] [^1d23f3fe]. In such cases, **imaging is indicated** regardless of D-dimer results [^d72d989a]. For low-risk patients with low or intermediate pretest probability, a normal D-dimer can reliably exclude PE and avoid unnecessary imaging [^4bafe03a] [^42a59bbd].

---

## Frequency of normal D-dimer in PE

The frequency of normal D-dimer in confirmed PE varies by assay, population, and clot burden:

- **High-sensitivity assays**: False negatives occur in ~3–5% of confirmed PE cases.
- **Lower-sensitivity assays**: Higher false-negative rates, up to 10–20%.
- **Small or distal clots**: More likely to yield normal D-dimer due to lower fibrin turnover [^a406300a].

---

## Clinical scenarios with normal D-dimer in PE

Several scenarios can result in a normal D-dimer despite confirmed PE:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Small or distal emboli | Lower fibrin turnover, below assay detection [^a406300a] |
| Early testing (< 24 hours) | Insufficient time for significant fibrinolysis |
| Chronic or organized thrombi | Minimal ongoing fibrinolysis |
| Assay variability | Differences in sensitivity and specificity among assays [^83f12dce] |

---

## Clinical significance of normal D-dimer in PE

A normal D-dimer **does not absolutely exclude PE**; its clinical significance depends on pretest probability:

- **Low or intermediate pretest probability**: A normal D-dimer can safely exclude PE, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of ~99% [^4bafe03a] [^42a59bbd].
- **High pretest probability**: A normal D-dimer cannot exclude PE; imaging is indicated regardless of D-dimer results [^f770ed7a] [^d72d989a].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize integrating D-dimer with clinical probability:

- **ESC 2019**: Use D-dimer in non-high probability patients; do not use D-dimer in high-probability patients [^39d385ad] [^f770ed7a].
- **ASH 2018**: Use D-dimer to exclude PE in low or intermediate probability; imaging in high probability [^1d23f3fe] [^4ee4740e].
- **ACP 2015**: Use age-adjusted D-dimer in patients > 50 years to improve specificity without compromising safety [^c528e3d0] [^b6aa8722].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

When PE is suspected and D-dimer is normal:

- **Low or intermediate probability**: Exclude PE and avoid imaging [^4bafe03a] [^42a59bbd].
- **High probability or high-risk patient**: Proceed to imaging (CTPA or V/Q scan) regardless of D-dimer [^f770ed7a] [^d72d989a].
- **Persistent suspicion**: If clinical suspicion remains high despite a normal D-dimer, imaging is warranted [^f770ed7a] [^d72d989a].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay selection**: Use high-sensitivity assays for reliable exclusion [^83f12dce] [^fc78c74a].
- **Patient population**: Age, comorbidities, and clinical context affect test performance [^782fcf70] [^78161644].
- **False reassurance**: Avoid over-reliance on normal D-dimer in high-risk patients [^f770ed7a] [^d72d989a].

---

PE can occur with a normal D-dimer, albeit infrequently. D-dimer is a useful rule-out test in low-risk patients, but **normal results cannot exclude PE** when clinical suspicion is high. Always integrate D-dimer with pretest probability and proceed to imaging when indicated [^39d385ad] [^1d23f3fe].

Pulmonary embolism is a common, yet often unsuspected and unrecognised disease associated with a high mortality. New, objective, "user friendly" and cost effective diagnostic strategies are being explored. D-dimers, the fibrinolytic degradation products of crosslinked fibrin, have emerged as the most useful of the procoagulant activity and ongoing fibrinolysis markers. D-dimer measurements are very sensitive in excluding a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the setting of normal values, a low clinical suspicion, and non-diagnostic lung scans. Several assays have been developed and are reviewed.

### D-dimer levels for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism: making sense of international guideline recommendations [^487dbc58]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Several international guidelines provide recommendations around the use of D-dimer testing for exclusion of pulmonary embolism, including the appropriate D-dimer threshold (or cutoff), but there is no consensus among them. We briefly discuss guideline variation, performance characteristics, and limitations of commercially available D-dimer assays in this setting, referencing the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines that recommend immunoassays with high sensitivity (≥ 97%) and negative predictive value (≥ 98%). While age-adjusted D-dimer and pretest-adjusted D-dimer are considered a safe strategy across predefined patient subgroups, clinicians need to recognize the different performance characteristics of D-dimer assays to enable safe clinical decisions for their patients. Importantly, D-dimer values must be correlated not only to clinical findings but also interpreted within the context of the accuracy and precision of the specific testing modality, adhering to manufacturer specifications that are approved by regulatory authorities.

The measurement of D-dimer can provide useful information to aid in the diagnosis of patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. D-dimer measurement in conjunction with adequate estimation of pretest probability can facilitate the safe discharge of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and limit unnecessary investigation or anticoagulation. We review clinical decision-making strategies in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and propose means to minimize diagnostic error that might arise from knowledge of the D-dimer result prior to clinical assessment.

### Rapid systematic review: age-adjusted D-dimer for ruling out pulmonary embolism [^bec91fc1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a disease diagnosed relatively frequently in emergency departments (EDs). Evidence suggests that improved decision making may decrease inappropriate testing, unnecessary radiation exposure, and non-beneficial treatment. Several studies have looked at the utility and safety of age-adjusting the D-dimer levels used to safely rule out PE.

Objective

This rapid systematic review sought to answer the question: Can an age-adjusted D-dimer be used to safely rule out PE in patients over 50 years old?

Methods

We performed a structured review of PubMed from January 2012 to January 2018 limited to reports involving human subjects and written in the English language and containing relevant keywords. The highest-quality studies were then reviewed in a structured format.

Results

One hundred and eleven papers were identified for further review. Eight articles were determined to be appropriate for inclusion in this summary. These studies all used patient age (in years over 50) × 10 μg/L (fibrinogen equivalent units) as their definition of an age-adjusted D-dimer.

Conclusions

Age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff values, in combination with a non-high clinical probability, is safe and effective to essentially rule out PE in ED patients.

Conditions associated with increased D-dimer

As mentioned above, D-dimer is used to guide the diagnostic procedure of VTE, which includes DVT and pulmonary embolism. However, while patients with pulmonary embolism or DVT in the acute phase usually have high D-dimer levels, individuals with high D-dimer do not necessarily have an underlying thromboembolic disease, but they may have several other pathological and non-pathological conditions (Table 1).

Venous thromboembolism

To begin, we provide a concise description of the D-dimer-based diagnostic workup of this thrombotic disorder. VTE affects nearly 10 million people every year worldwide, with an annual incidence of 1–2 cases per 1,000 population. It is the third most frequent cardiovascular disease. Although its incidence increases with age both in men and women, women have a higher risk of developing VTE at the young age of 20–40 years due to hormonal-related factors (i.e. pregnancy or oral contraceptive use). Owing to the substantial global burden of VTE, suspected VTE requires a timely and preferably non-invasive diagnostic tool. In this context, thanks to the high sensitivity (almost 100%) of quantitative ELISA, D-dimer measurement plays a key role in the diagnostic workup. However, due to its low specificity (high negative and low positive predictive value), the test should only be used to exclude VTE. This means that a D-dimer negative result (i.e. < 500 µg/L) categorizes patients as having a low to moderate clinical pre-test probability of VTE.

### The importance of clinical probability assessment in interpreting a normal D-dimer in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism [^2d454d59]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The d-dimer test is widely applied in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). The objective of this study was to investigate how often the d-dimer test fails when clinical probability is not taken into account.

Methods

We used data collected in 1,722 consecutive patients with clinically suspected PE to analyze the 3-month venous thromboembolism (VTE) rate in all patients with a normal d-dimer concentration and separately for patients who have a normal d-dimer concentration with an unlikely or likely clinical probability for PE, as assessed by the Wells clinical decision rule.

Results

The 3-month VTE rate in all patients with a normal d-dimer concentration (n = 563) was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 3.9%). In the patients with an unlikely probability of PE (n = 477), VTE was confirmed in 1.1% of the patients with a normal d-dimer concentration (95% CI, 0.4 to 2.4%). In those patients with a likely clinical probability of PE (n = 86), VTE was confirmed in 9.3% of the patients with a normal d-dimer concentration (95% CI, 4.8 to 17.3%). The difference in VTE incidence between patients with unlikely and likely clinical probabilities of PE was significant (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that it is of utmost importance to first examine the patient and assess the clinical probability, after which the d-dimer concentration can be taken into account, in order to prevent physicians from being influenced by a normal d-dimer test result when they evaluate the clinical probability of PE. Patients with a likely clinical probability should undergo further testing, regardless of the d-dimer test outcome.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to D-dimer, ESC 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain D-dimer testing, preferably with a highly sensitive assay, in outpatients/emergency department patients with low or intermediate clinical probability or if PE is unlikely.

### Normal D-dimer levels in patients with pulmonary embolism… [^d3ad6b46]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Eight patients had normal D-dimer levels with angiographic evidence of PE. Algorithms in acute care settings have been proposed; they exclude PE with normal D-dimer levels using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. These cannot be extrapolated to the more widely used LA assays. A normal LA D-dimer level alone or with V/Q scan results is not recommended to preclude the treatment of PE. Research focuses on finding a cost-effective, noninvasive, diagnostic aid to rule out PE because 70% of V/Q scans are nondiagnostic. 3 There is considerable interest in finding a blood test to expedite the exclusion of PE. D dimer is a specific fibrin degradation product released by a dissolving fibrin clot that can be measured in peripheral blood. Similar to troponin use in acute myocardial infarctions, D dimers have been extensively evaluated in venous thromboembolic disease, and specifically in PE. 5–8. Multiple views were obtained in anterior and posterior projections.

Pulmonary angiograms were interpreted according to hospital protocol, and the radiologist diagnosed PE when total occlusion of a vessel was seen and/or a filling defect of at least 3 mm was present. Angiograms were interpreted by 2 separate radiologists, both blinded to the D-dimer and V/Q scan results. If there was disagreement, a third radiologist was available to review the PAG. This unexpected finding of high-probability V/Q scan results with normal angiogram results prompted a specific review of these 5 patients' medical records. Two of these patients had moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension secondary to severe obstructive lung disease; 1 patient had chronic PE, as demonstrated by clinical evaluation and by the presence of webs on angiography; 1 patient had bronchial obstruction due to a tumor; and a cause was not identified in the remaining patient.

In summary, we agree with the American College of Chest Physicians'22 consensus panel opinion regarding the diagnosis and management of PE, and strongly recommend that LA D dimers not be used to evaluate the condition of patients with suspected PE. Recently, it has been suggested that a normal D-dimer level can be used to preclude treatment of PE in an acute care setting. 5 These algorithms used ELISA methods to determine D-dimer levels, and cannot be extrapolated to settings in which D-dimer levels are usually determined by the latex method.

### D-dimer test for excluding the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^fc78c74a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can occur when a thrombus (blood clot) travels through the veins and lodges in the arteries of the lungs, producing an obstruction. People who are thought to be at risk include those with cancer, people who have had a recent surgical procedure or have experienced long periods of immobilisation and women who are pregnant. The clinical presentation can vary, but unexplained respiratory symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain and an increased respiratory rate are common.D-dimers are fragments of protein released into the circulation when a blood clot breaks down as a result of normal body processes or with use of prescribed fibrinolytic medication. The D-dimer test is a laboratory assay currently used to rule out the presence of high D-dimer plasma levels and, by association, venous thromboembolism (VTE). D-dimer tests are rapid, simple and inexpensive and can prevent the high costs associated with expensive diagnostic tests.

Objectives

To investigate the ability of the D-dimer test to rule out a diagnosis of acute PE in patients treated in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency (A&E) settings who have had a pre-test probability (PTP) of PE determined according to a clinical prediction rule (CPR), by estimating the accuracy of the test according to estimates of sensitivity and specificity. The review focuses on those patients who are not already established on anticoagulation at the time of study recruitment.

Search Methods

We searched 13 databases from conception until December 2013. We cross-checked the reference lists of relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently applied exclusion criteria to full papers and resolved disagreements by discussion. We included cross-sectional studies of D-dimer in which ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy, computerised tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), selective pulmonary angiography and magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography (MRPA) were used as the reference standard.•

Participants

Adults who were managed in hospital outpatient and A&E settings and were suspected of acute PE were eligible for inclusion in the review if they had received a pre-test probability score based on a CPR.•

Index Tests

quantitative, semi quantitative and qualitative D-dimer tests.• Target condition: acute symptomatic PE.• Reference standards: We included studies that used pulmonary angiography, V/Q scintigraphy, CTPA and MRPA as reference standard tests.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). We resolved disagreements by discussion. Review authors extracted patient-level data when available to populate 2 × 2 contingency tables (true-positives (TPs), true-negatives (TNs), false-positives (FPs) and false-negatives (FNs)).

Main Results

We included four studies in the review (n = 1585 patients). None of the studies were at high risk of bias in any of the QUADAS-2 domains, but some uncertainty surrounded the validity of studies in some domains for which the risk of bias was uncertain. D-dimer assays demonstrated high sensitivity in all four studies, but with high levels of false-positive results, especially among those over the age of 65 years. Estimates of sensitivity ranged from 80% to 100%, and estimates of specificity from 23% to 63%.

Authors' Conclusions

A negative D-dimer test is valuable in ruling out PE in patients who present to the A&E setting with a low PTP. Evidence from one study suggests that this test may have less utility in older populations, but no empirical evidence was available to support an increase in the diagnostic threshold of interpretation of D-dimer results for those over the age of 65 years.

### Is stand-alone D-dimer testing safe to rule out acute pulmonary embolism? [^87b628b2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials A stand-alone D-dimer below 750 μg/L has been proposed to rule out acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This was a post-hoc analysis on data from 6 studies comprising 7268 patients with suspected PE. The negative predictive value of a D-dimer < 750 μg/L ranged from 79% to 96% in various subgroups. Stand-alone D-dimer testing seems to be unsafe to rule out PE in all patients.

Summary

Background Recently, stand-alone D-dimer testing at a positivity threshold of 750 μg L -1 has been proposed as a safe and efficient approach to rule out acute pulmonary embolism (PE), without additional imaging, but this approach needs validation. Objectives To evaluate stand-alone D-dimer testing at a positivity threshold of 750 μg L -1 to rule out PE. Methods Individual data from 7268 patients with suspected PE previously enrolled in six prospective management studies were used. Patients were assessed by the Wells rule followed by quantitative D-dimer testing in those with a 'PE unlikely' score. Patients were classified post hoc as having a negative (< 750 μg L -1) or positive (≥ 750 μg L -1) D-dimer. Using a one-stage meta-analytic approach, the negative predictive value (NPV) of stand-alone D-dimer testing was evaluated overall and in different risk subgroups. Results The pooled incidence of PE was 23% (range, 13–42%). Overall, 44% of patients had a D-dimer < 750 μg L -1, of whom 2.8% were diagnosed with PE at baseline or during 3-month follow-up (NPV, 97.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 94.9–98.5). The NPV was highest in patients with a low probability of PE according to the Wells rule (99.2%; 95% CI, 98.6–99.5%) and lowest in those with a high probability of PE (79.3%; 95% CI, 53.0–92.8%). The NPVs in patients with active cancer, patients with previous venous thromboembolism and inpatients were 96.2% (95% CI, 85.6–99.1%), 94.7% (95% CI, 88.6–97.6%) and 92.7% (95% CI, 79.3–97.7%), respectively. Conclusions Our findings suggest that stand-alone D-dimer testing at a positivity threshold of 750 μg L -1 is not safe to rule out acute PE.

### Missed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism with age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off value [^86c041f8]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially severe diagnosis with high short-term mortality. Recently, age-adjusted cut-off values (age × 10 μg/l) of D-dimer were introduced to improve the diagnostic workup in older patients. In clinical practice, PE is considered 'ruled out' in patients with a non-high clinical probability and a normal D-dimer. However, all diagnostic tests have a small false-negative rate. This small probability of misdiagnosis might be easily overlooked by clinicians when using simplified dichotomized flow charts. This case illustrates a normal D-dimer (age-adjusted) but with a PE. We recommend clinicians using the D-dimer test-either conventional or age-adjusted in a rule-out strategy to be aware of the-albeit small probability of a false-negative result.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^b8e31177]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose, given its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Because of this, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

Methods

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review, but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients who have a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE.

Best Practice Advice 4

Clinicians should use age-adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted.

Best Practice Advice 5

Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff.

Best Practice Advice 6

Clinicians should obtain imaging with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve ventilation-perfusion scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### Acute pulmonary embolism. part 1: epidemiology and diagnosis [^10bd3a93]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a frequently occurring, acute, and potentially fatal condition. Numerous risk factors for PE, both inherited and acquired, have been identified. Adequate diagnosis is mandatory to prevent PE-related morbidity and mortality on the one hand, and unnecessary treatment on the other. Only around 1 in 5 individuals with suspected PE will have the diagnosis confirmed, therefore, the diagnostic work-up for PE should comprise safe, efficient, and noninvasive methods. The first step in the approach to diagnosis of patients with suspected PE is to determine the clinical probability and to perform a D-dimer test. PE can be excluded in patients with a 'low', 'intermediate' or 'unlikely' clinical probability and a normal D-dimer test. Additional imaging is required for those with a 'high' or 'likely' clinical probability or a positive D-dimer test. CT pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, followed by additional testing is the next step when test results are nondiagnostic. Although various diagnostic strategies have been introduced and validated, selected patients may require a tailored approach.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) best practice advice 3 — Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^de0be47b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — intermediate pretest probability: For patients at intermediate risk for PE, D-dimer testing is warranted. As for patients at low pretest probability, a normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; no imaging studies are indicated, and an elevated plasma D-dimer level should prompt imaging studies.

Clinicians should use age adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted. Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff. Clinicians should obtain imaging with CTPA in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve V/Q scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### Safety of excluding acute pulmonary embolism based on an unlikely clinical probability by the wells rule and normal D-dimer concentration: a meta-analysis [^4bafe03a]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Wells clinical decision rule (CDR) and D-dimer tests can be used to exclude pulmonary embolism (PE). We performed a meta-analysis to determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of an "unlikely" CDR (≤ 4 points) combined with a normal D-dimer test and the safety of withholding anti-coagulants based on these criteria.

Methods

Prospective studies that withheld anti-coagulant treatment from patients with clinically suspected PE and an "unlikely" CDR in combination with a normal D-dimer concentration without performing further tests were searched for in Medline, Cochrane and Embase. Primary endpoints were the recurrence rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and PE-related mortality during 3-months follow-up.

Results

Four studies including 1660 consecutive patients were identified. The pooled incidence of VTE after initial exclusion of acute PE based on an "unlikely" CDR and normal D-dimer was 0.34% (95%CI 0.036–0.96%), resulting in a NPV of 99.7% (95%CI: 99.0–99.9%, random effects-model). The risk for PE related mortality was very low: 1/1660 patients had fatal PE (0.06%, 95%CI 0.0017–0.46%).

Conclusion

Acute PE can be safely excluded in patients with clinically suspected acute PE who have an "unlikely" probability and a negative D-dimer test and anticoagulant treatment can be withheld. There is no need for additional radiological tests in these patients to rule out PE.

### Nonspecific tests for pulmonary embolism [^45ec4201]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Many tests have been proposed as useful in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected PE, but nonspecific tests for PE can only add to the level of suspicion one has for the diagnosis. As Anderson indicates, "virtually all clinical and laboratory findings neither diagnose nor exclude the diagnosis of PE. They merely serve to heighten suspicion of the diagnosis and prompt the clinician to pursue additional diagnostic studies". D-dimer measurement is promising as a test to exclude PE in young healthy out-patients, and further study and improvements in technology, can clarify the usefulness of the different methods of performing this assay. For now, diagnostic algorithms for PE should continue to incorporate multiple tests and decision points, but the standard remains specialized imaging techniques.

### Normal D-dimer levels in emergency department patients suspected of acute pulmonary embolism [^5c43090d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine:1) whether normal D-dimer enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays predicted the absence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the high-volume emergency department (ED) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, and 2) whether ED physicians accepted normal D-dimer levels as confirmation of no PE without further diagnostic testing such as lung scanning, chest computed tomography (CT) scanning, or pulmonary angiography.

Background

Although the plasma D-dimer ELISA is a sensitive screening test for excluding acute PE, this laboratory marker has not been widely integrated into clinical algorithms such as creatine kinase-MB fraction or troponin testing for acute myocardial infarction.

Methods

We mandated that ED physicians order D-dimer ELISA tests on all patients suspected of acute PE. We reviewed the clinical record of each ED patient initially evaluated for suspected PE during the year 2000. We determined whether additional imaging tests for PE were obtained and whether the final diagnosis was PE.

Results

Of 1,106 D-dimer assays, 559 were elevated and 547 were normal. Only 2 of 547 had PE despite a normal D-dimer. The sensitivity of the D-dimer ELISA for acute PE was 96.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 87.5% to 99.6%), and the negative predictive value was 99.6% (95% CI: 98.7% to > 99.9%). Nevertheless, 24% of patients with normal D-dimers had additional imaging tests for PE.

Conclusions

The D-dimer ELISA has a high negative predictive value for excluding PE. By paying more attention to normal D-dimer results, fewer chest CT scans and lung scans will be required, and improvements may be realized in diagnostic efficiency and cost reduction.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^782fcf70]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Physiological conditions

It has previously been pointed out that the detection of increased D-dimer does not necessarily imply the presence of an underlying disease because there are a number of physiological conditions that are accompanied by abnormal values (Table 1).D-dimer increases with age, thus leading to a greater proportion of older patients (> 50%) with values higher than the conventional cutoff of 500 µg/L. The lower specificity of D-dimer for VTE in older compared to younger people implies that the former are unlikely to have negative D-dimer results even when VTE is absent, with a related high rate of unnecessary use of imaging tests. For this reason, an age-adjusted cutoff has been validated and recommended in the diagnostic workup of VTE. However, in patients > 80 years of age, the use of D-dimer measurement is not recommended for the exclusion of VTE, because high baseline levels lead to unacceptably high false positive results in cases with no VTE.

Figure 2.
Proposed algorithm for the diagnostic evaluation of venous thromboembolism. VTE: venous thromboembolism.

Similarly, D-dimer levels increase physiologically during pregnancy and in the post-partum period. D-dimer levels are also higher in women taking oral contraceptives than in non-users, perhaps reflecting their hypercoagulable state.

Exercise has effects on hemostasis that are dependent on the duration and intensity of the physical activity.D-dimer levels significantly increase following short-duration strenuous exercise, and exercise-induced fibrinolytic activity in healthy subjects is proportional to the amount of exercise taken. Changes in cardiac and hemostatic biomarkers (including D-dimer) after strenuous endurance exercise can mimic pulmonary embolism and myocardial injury in individuals who are not actually at risk.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^8f58106d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — low pretest probability evaluation uses the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) and D-dimer testing. In patients believed to be at low risk for PE, the PERC criteria should be applied. In those who meet all 8 PERC criteria, the risk for PE is lower than the risks of testing; do not order a plasma d-dimer test. Those who do not meet all of the criteria should be further stratified by using a plasma d-dimer test. A normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; do not order imaging studies. An elevated plasma D-dimer level should lead to imaging studies. The PERC items are Age < 50, Initial heart rate < 100 beats/min, Initial oxygen saturation > 94% on room air, No unilateral leg swelling, No hemoptysis, No surgery or trauma within 4 wk, No history of venous thromboembolism, and No estrogen use; the table notes that pretest probability with score of 0 is < 1%.

### Pulmonary embolism despite negative ELISA D-dimer: a case report [^fb2f3abf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolus (PE) can be fatal, but is often treatable if recognized early. Unfortunately, the clinical presentation of PE is often variable and misleading. The D-dimer assay has recently come into favor as a method to exclude PE; however, this test has an acceptable safety margin only in low-risk populations. What is unclear is the exact composition of this low risk population. This is the report of a 26-year-old woman with over 2 weeks of chest pain and intermittent dyspnea. The patient was initially seen in the Emergency Department (ED) and hospitalized. She returned to the ED 2 weeks later with similar symptoms. Although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) D-dimer assays were normal on the initial and subsequent ED visits, pulmonary embolism (PE) was diagnosed by computed tomography scan on the second visit. This report highlights the risk of misdiagnosing PE if relying solely on ELISA D-dimer for exclusion. The approach to PE should include a measure of clinical probability. This report documents the presentation of PE despite having two unremarkable ELISA D-dimer measurements, and highlights the importance of clinical suspicion.

### Diagnosis and exclusion of pulmonary embolism [^3bfb7617]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Failure to test for pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a lethal mistake, but PE and produces symptoms similar to many other diseases. Overtesting for PE has negative consequences.

Objectives

Use published evidence to create a rationale and safe diagnostic approach for ambulatory and emergency patients with suspected PE in 2017.

Findings

Pulmonary embolism need not be pursued in patients with no symptoms of PE in the present or recent history (dyspnea, chest pain, cough or syncope), and always normal vital signs. When clinicians have a low clinical suspicion for PE or a Wells score < 2, they can reasonably exclude PE with the Pulmonary Embolism Rule out Criteria (PERC rule). For patients with a "PE-unlikely" pretest probability (Wells or simplified revised Geneva score < 5), PE can be ruled out with a normal or age-adjusted D-dimer concentrations. Other patients should undergo pulmonary vascular imaging, and the choices are discussed, including computerized tomographic pulmonary angiography, planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

Conclusions

A thoughtful algorithm for PE exclusion and diagnosis requires pretest probability assessment in all patients, followed by selective use of clinical criteria, the quantitative D-dimer, and pulmonary vascular imaging.

### Pulmonary embolism [^af6d5f19]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common illness that can cause death and disability. It is difficult to detect because patients present with a wide array of symptoms and signs. The clinical setting can raise suspicion, and certain inherited and acquired risk factors predispose susceptible individuals. D-dimer concentration in blood is the best laboratory screening test, and chest CT has become the most widespread imaging test. Treatment requires rapid and accurate risk stratification before haemodynamic decompensation and the development of cardiogenic shock. Anticoagulation is the foundation of therapy. Right-ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography and higher than normal concentrations of troponin identify high-risk patients who might need escalation of therapy with thrombolysis or embolectomy even if the blood pressure is normal on presentation. When patients are admitted to medical wards or when patients undergo surgery, their physicians should prescribe prophylactic measures to prevent PE. After hospital discharge, prophylaxis should continue for about a month for patients at high risk of thromboembolism.

### High D-dimer levels increase the likelihood of pulmonary embolism [^e2fd6970]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective. To determine the utility of high quantitative D-dimer levels in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Methods. D-dimer testing was performed in consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. We included patients with suspected pulmonary embolism with a high risk for venous thromboembolism, i.e. hospitalized patients, patients older than 80 years, with malignancy or previous surgery. Presence of pulmonary embolism was based on a diagnostic management strategy using a clinical decision rule (CDR), D-dimer testing and computed tomography. Results. A total of 1515 patients were included with an overall pulmonary embolism prevalence of 21%. The pulmonary embolism prevalence was strongly associated with the height of the D-dimer level, and increased fourfold with D-dimer levels greater than 4000 ng mL(-1) compared to levels between 500 and 1000 ng mL(-1). Patients with D-dimer levels higher than 2000 ng mL(-1) and an unlikely CDR had a pulmonary embolism prevalence of 36%. This prevalence is comparable to the pulmonary embolism likely CDR group. When D-dimer levels were above 4000 ng mL(-1), the observed pulmonary embolism prevalence was very high, independent of CDR score. Conclusion. Strongly elevated D-dimer levels substantially increase the likelihood of pulmonary embolism. Whether this should translate into more intensive diagnostic and therapeutic measures in patients with high D-dimer levels irrespective of CDR remains to be studied.

### An evaluation of D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: a randomized trial [^a80e5ade]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

It may be safe to omit additional diagnostic testing in selected patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) who have a negative D-dimer test, but this approach has never been evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial.

Objective

To determine if additional diagnostic testing can be safely withheld in patients with suspected PE who have negative erythrocyte agglutination D-dimer test results.

Design

Randomized comparisons in 2 subgroups of a prospective multicenter study.

Setting

7 university hospitals.

Patients

1126 outpatients or inpatients with suspected PE; of these, 456 patients with negative erythrocyte agglutination D-dimer test results were randomly assigned to the intervention groups. Patients were classified into 2 clinical probability groups: those with a low clinical probability of PE (low-probability group) and those with a moderate or high clinical probability of PE, a nondiagnostic ventilation-perfusion lung scan, and no evidence of proximal deep venous thrombosis on bilateral ultrasonography (moderate- or high-probability group).

Interventions

The experimental intervention for both probability groups was no further diagnostic testing for PE. The control intervention for the low-probability group was a ventilation-perfusion lung scan followed by ultrasonography of the proximal deep veins of the legs on the same day. If the lung scan was nondiagnostic, ultrasonography of the legs was repeated 7 and 14 days later. The control intervention for the moderate- or high-probability group was ultrasonography of the proximal deep veins of the legs after 7 and 14 days. In the control and experimental groups, anticoagulation was withheld or withdrawn if PE was not diagnosed.

Measurements

Symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) during 6 months of follow-up.

Results

Prevalence of VTE was 15.2% in the 1126 enrolled patients. In the low-probability group, VTE occurred during follow-up in 0 of 182 patients who had no additional diagnostic testing and in 1 of 185 patients who had additional testing (difference, -0.5 percentage point [95% CI, -3.0 to 1.6 percentage points]). In the moderate- or high-probability group, VTE occurred during follow-up in 1 of 41 patients who had no additional diagnostic testing and in 0 of 41 patients who had additional testing (difference, 2.4 percentage points [CI, -6.4 to 12.6 percentage points]).

Limitations

The authors could not enroll 2000 patients as originally planned; 3 randomly assigned patients did not receive the allocated intervention, and 7 received inadequate follow-up. Personnel who performed follow-up evaluations were not blinded to the results of diagnostic testing at enrollment or to allocation group assignments.

Conclusion

In patients with a low probability of PE who have negative D-dimer results, additional diagnostic testing can be withheld without increasing the frequency of VTE during follow-up. Low clinical probability and negative D-dimer results occur in 50% of outpatients and in 20% of inpatients with suspected PE.

### Knowledge of the D-dimer test result influences clinical probability assessment of pulmonary embolism [^b647e103]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), an unlikely or non-high probability assessment combined with a normal D-dimer test can safely exclude the diagnosis. We studied the influence of early D-dimer knowledge on clinical probability assessment.

Methods

A questionnaire was sent to 150 randomly selected pulmonologists and internists in the Netherlands, presenting six hypothetical case-descriptions of patients with suspected PE. Physicians were randomized to receive one of three versions. The version contained a normal, an abnormal or no D-dimer result with each case-description. Each version contained two cases with an abnormal D-dimer result, two cases with a normal D-dimer result and two cases with no D-dimer result.

Results

A total of 71 physicians (47%) returned the questionnaire; the three versions were equally represented. Compared to the control cases in which no D-dimer was given, knowledge of an abnormal D-dimer resulted in more "likely" clinical scores using the Wells' score (absolute increase in "likely" of 25–37%, p = 0.005, 0.111 and 0.144), while knowledge of a normal D-dimer resulted in more "unlikely" scores (absolute increase in "unlikely" of 27–44%, p = 0.001 and 0.070). D-dimer knowledge did not influence the probability assessment when the clinical suspicion was very high.

Conclusion

Knowledge of the D-dimer test influences the physician in how the clinical probability for PE is scored. This will have direct clinical consequences, such as unnecessary imaging testing or inappropriate exclusion of the diagnosis. Physicians should therefore make sure that they examine the patient before they take notice of the D-dimer test result.

### Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism with D-dimer adjusted to clinical probability [^42a59bbd]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Retrospective analyses suggest that pulmonary embolism is ruled out by a d-dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter in patients with a low clinical pretest probability (C-PTP) and by a d-dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter in patients with a moderate C-PTP.

Methods

We performed a prospective study in which pulmonary embolism was considered to be ruled out without further testing in outpatients with a low C-PTP and a d-dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter or with a moderate C-PTP and a d-dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter. All other patients underwent chest imaging (usually computed tomographic pulmonary angiography). If pulmonary embolism was not diagnosed, patients did not receive anticoagulant therapy. All patients were followed for 3 months to detect venous thromboembolism.

Results

A total of 2017 patients were enrolled and evaluated, of whom 7.4% had pulmonary embolism on initial diagnostic testing. Of the 1325 patients who had a low C-PTP (1285 patients) or moderate C-PTP (40 patients) and a negative d-dimer test (i.e., < 1000 or < 500 ng per milliliter, respectively), none had venous thromboembolism during follow-up (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.00 to 0.29%). These included 315 patients who had a low C-PTP and a d-dimer level of 500 to 999 ng per milliliter (95% CI, 0.00 to 1.20%). Of all 1863 patients who did not receive a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism initially and did not receive anticoagulant therapy, 1 patient (0.05%; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.30) had venous thromboembolism. Our diagnostic strategy resulted in the use of chest imaging in 34.3% of patients, whereas a strategy in which pulmonary embolism is considered to be ruled out with a low C-PTP and a d-dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter would result in the use of chest imaging in 51.9% (difference, -17.6 percentage points; 95% CI, -19.2 to -15.9).

Conclusions

A combination of a low C-PTP and a d-dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter identified a group of patients at low risk for pulmonary embolism during follow-up. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and others; PEGeD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02483442.).

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^78161644]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Measurement of D-dimer concentration in the blood is a valuable tool in the diagnostic investigation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. A D-dimer concentration below the conventional cut-off point of 500 μg/l combined with a "low/intermediate" or "unlikely" clinical probability can safely rule out the diagnosis in about 30% of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. However, the D-dimer concentration increases with age and its specificity for embolism decreases, which makes the test less useful to exclude pulmonary embolism in older patients. Indeed, the test is able to rule out pulmonary embolism in 60% of patients aged < 40 years, but in only 5% of patients aged > 80.

If the D-dimer test is combined with an "unlikely" clinical probabilityto rule out pulmonary embolism, 10% of patients > 75 years old versus 32% of patients of all ages do not need further diagnostic testing; the number needed to test for one negative test result is 10.6 and 3.1, respectively. Raising the cut-off value to various points between 600 μg/l and 1000 μg/l increased specificity, but this came at the cost of safety, with more false negative test results. In this analysis, however, no stratification was made for clinical probability.

By constructing receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, we derived a new, age dependent D-dimer cut-off value and analysed its safety and clinical utility, in combination with clinical probability assessment, for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in two large prospective cohort studies of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. We then validated the outcome in two other large management studies.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^60a58e0b]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Several scores have been developed in order to assess the clinical probability of VTE. The most used are the Wells and Geneva scores. In addition, a simplified and validated version of the Geneva score has been developed to widen its adoption in clinical practice. The combination of negative D-dimer ELISA and low-intermediate pre-test clinical probability excludes DVT or pulmonary embolism in approximately 30% of the cases with suspected VTE with no need for imaging (i.e. venous ultrasonography for a suspected DVT and computed tomography [CT] pulmonary angiogram for a suspected pulmonary embolism). Conversely, D-dimer is not recommended in patients with a high clinical probability, because a normal result does not exclude VTE, even when a highly sensitive assay is used; these cases should directly undergo imaging without D-dimer testing (Figure 2). Notably, as D-dimer levels increase with age, an age-adjusted (age x 10 µg/L in patients aged > 50 years) rather than a fixed cutoff (< 500 µg/L) is warranted to exclude VTE in patients with low or intermediate pre-test clinical probability. Although impaired renal function has been suggested to affect D-dimer levels in individuals suspected of having VTE, its influence seems to be less important than that of age.

D-dimer testing in combination with a clinical pre-test probability assessment (YEARS criteria or revised GENEVA score) has also been used for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in pregnant women with the aim of avoiding unnecessary imaging. In addition, D-dimer testing provides important information not only for the diagnosis of VTE, but also for the anticoagulant management of VTE. Current evidence indicates that a positive D-dimer after completion of three months of anticoagulant therapy in patients with a first unprovoked VTE is associated with a 2-fold higher risk of VTE recurrence than a negative test. Thus, following the demonstration of the strong association between D-dimer and VTE recurrence, D-dimer testing is often included in the prediction models designed to guide decisions for stopping anticoagulant therapy. On the other hand, persistently high D-dimer after stopping a 3-month anticoagulant treatment argues in favor of therapy prolongation in cases with unprovoked VTE.

### Normal D-dimer level excludes PE… [^c29c20f7]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Does a normald-dimer level exclude pulmonary embolism. Setting: Emergency department Study Design: Cohort. Synopsis: In this study, all patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected PE had a d-dimer test. A value less than or equal to 500 ng per mL was considered normal. Of 1, 106 patients, 547 had negative levels of d-dimer, and only two of these had a PE. Of 559 patients with a positive level of d-dimer, only 53 actually had a PE. Overall, 55 of 1, 106 had a PE. This study had a number of limitations. We do not know how the patients presented, so it is not clear to whom the results apply, although suspected PE is probably adequate.

Also, the work-up other than of d-dimer levels was not specified, so patients with a normal test were much less intensively investigated. The authors stated that they followed up all 547 patients with a negative test at six months. This is an impressive achievement, although it is hard to believe that all of these patients had an equally thorough follow-up. The physicians making the final diagnosis of PE were not blinded to the d-dimer testing and may have been influenced by the results. Bottom Line: This flawed study provides further support for a negative d-dimer test. Given the flaws in the study design, I would only feel comfortable excluding PE in a patient with a negative d-dimer level if he or she also had a low probability of PE based on the clinical examination. See InfoRetriever for a validated algorithm that combines the clinical examination, d-dimer test, and other tests.

### Embolus location affects the sensitivity of a rapid quantitative D-dimer assay in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^a406300a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

D-dimer blood tests have been suggested to rule out pulmonary embolism. Despite evidence of the safety of withholding anticoagulant treatment in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and a normal D-dimer assay result, clinicians remain reluctant to use a D-dimer assay as a sole diagnostic test. This prospective study in 314 consecutive inpatients and outpatients investigates the relation between the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer plasma concentration and pulmonary embolus location. Plasma D-dimer levels were measured using a quantitative immunoturbidimetric method. A strict protocol of ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, pulmonary angiography, and spiral computed tomography was used to arrive at a final diagnosis and to assess the largest pulmonary artery in which embolus was visible. The influence of embolus location on the diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. There was a strong correlation between plasma D-dimer concentration and embolus location (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.001). Thus, the assay showed greater accuracy in excluding segmental or larger emboli (sensitivity = 93%) than subsegmental emboli (sensitivity = 50%). D-dimer concentration and the accuracy of D-dimer assays are clearly dependent on embolus location and smaller, subsegmental emboli may be missed when D-dimer assays are used as a sole test to exclude pulmonary embolism.

In part 1 of this two-part review, we discussed which risk factors, historical features, and physical findings increase risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) in symptomatic emergency department (ED) patients.

Objectives

Use published evidence to describe criteria that a reasonable and prudent clinician can use to initiate and guide the process of excluding and diagnosing PE.

Discussion

The careful and diligent emergency physician can use clinical criteria to safely obviate a formal evaluation of PE, including the use of gestalt reasoning and the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC rule, Table 2, part 1). We present published clinical and radiographic features of patients with PE who eluded diagnosis in the ED. D-dimer can be used to exclude PE in many patients, and employing age-based adjustments to the threshold to define an abnormal value can further reduce patient exposure to pulmonary vascular imaging. Moreover, we discuss benefits, limitations, and potential harms of computed tomographic pulmonary vascular imaging relevant to patients and the practice of emergency care. We present algorithms to guide exclusion and diagnosis of PE in patients with suspected PE, including those who are pregnant.

Conclusions

Reasonable and prudent emergency clinicians can exclude PE in symptomatic ED patients on clinical grounds alone in many patients, and many more can have PE ruled out by use of the D-dimer.

### Diagnostic strategies for excluding pulmonary embolism in clinical outcome studies. A systematic review [^609ac05b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism is a common clinical disorder that is associated with high morbidity and mortality if untreated. It is important to confirm or rule out the diagnosis in patients with clinical suspicion of the disease.

Purpose

To evaluate various diagnostic strategies for excluding pulmonary embolism.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003), EMBASE, and DARE; study investigators; and reference lists.

Study Selection

Prospective clinical outcome studies.

Data Extraction

The researchers recorded the frequency of symptomatic venous thromboembolism over 3 months of follow-up in patients in whom pulmonary embolism had been excluded according to various strategies. Strategies were divided into three categories according to the number of rounds of diagnostic tests needed to exclude pulmonary embolism.

Data Synthesis

25 studies involving more than 7000 patients were included. In all referred patients, two strategies-normal results on pulmonary angiography or lung scintigraphy and normal d -dimer levels combined with low clinical probability-safely excluded pulmonary embolism (failure rates ≤ 3%). In the second round of diagnostic tests, in patients who had had a nondiagnostic lung scan, both pulmonary angiography and serial leg testing for venous thrombosis were accurate and safe. When d -dimer testing combined with clinical probability was inconclusive, a normal perfusion lung scan safely excluded pulmonary embolism. Accumulating evidence shows that normal results on spiral computed tomography may also safely exclude the disease.

Conclusions

Many diagnostic strategies to exclude pulmonary embolism have been evaluated in consecutive patients. Interest is likely to increase in a simple, fast strategy, starting with a normal perfusion lung scan or a combination of normal d -dimer levels and low clinical probability. After the initial round of testing, a reliable diagnostic method, such as angiography or lung scintigraphy, is warranted.

### Diagnostic value of D-dimer in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism: results from a multicentre outcome study [^0bb19545]. Thrombosis Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

D-dimer tests are used in various diagnostic strategies to exclude pulmonary embolism (PE). However, their role as an exclusionary first-line test is still uncertain, mainly because accuracy of the test varies according to the assay and the studied population.

Methods

The aim of this multicentre study was to evaluate the accuracy of D-dimer testing in patients with suspected PE. Diagnosis of PE was based on pre-test clinical probability (PCP) evaluation and both single-detector spiral CT (CT) and lower limbs compression ultrasonography (CUS). Lung scanning and/or pulmonary angiography was mandatory when CT or CUS was inconclusive and when both CT and CUS were normal in a patient with a high PCP. All patients were followed-up for 3 months, looking for VTE recurrence. D-dimers were collected within 24 h of inclusion and stored in each local hematology unit, to be analyzed at the end of all inclusions; physicians in charge of the patient were blinded to D-dimer results.

Results

Three hundred and fifty two patients were included in 4 centres. Prevalence of PE was 38.6%. PCP was low in 82 (23.3%), intermediate in 176 (50%) and high in 94 (26.7%) patients. Sensitivity of D-dimer was 96.3% (95% CI: 93–99) and negative predictive value reached 94.4% (95% CI: 90–99). Five patients with a confirmed PE had a D-dimer level below 500 ng/ml (two patients with a high PCP). Among 258 patients with low or intermediate PCP, 80 (31%) had a negative D-dimer test result; three of them had a false negative result and the number needed to test was 3.3. Among 94 patients with a high PCP, 9 had a negative D-dimer test result; two of them had a false negative result and the number needed to test was 13.5.

Conclusion

These results confirm that rapid assays used in this study can safely exclude PE in first-line testing only in non-high CP patients.

### Can plasma D-dimer predict the result of a ventilation-perfusion scan? [^48b55c01]. Clinical Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

The use of plasma D-dimer assay has been advocated for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism. We retrospectively looked at 840 patients in whom both ventilation-perfusion scan and D-dimer assay were performed within 48 h. The negative predictive value of a negative D-dimer assay was 96% for emergency admissions and 98% for inpatients. We present the cases of two patients with negative D-dimer assay results who had a high-probability lung scan, and we have found a further three patients with negative D-dimer assay results who had an intermediate-probability lung scan.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^81d5cb90]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Others have argued for increasing the D-dimer cut-off value in older patients to improve the specificity and thereby increase the number of patients in whom — based on a D-dimer level below the cut-off value — imaging could be avoided. An age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value that increases gradually with age especially showed a promising increase in specificity without substantial loss of safety. This age adjusted cut-off value was defined as age (years)×10 μg/L for patients aged over 50 years (for example, for a patient aged 78 years, the D-dimer concentration would be considered normal below 780 μg/L). The age adjusted cut-off value was derived from a cohort of secondary care patients with a non-high probability of pulmonary embolism. This cohort was subdivided into 10 year age groups and the optimal cut-off value was selected for each age group — that is, the cut-off value with a sensitivity of 100% and the highest accompanying specificity. This revealed an increase of the optimal cut-off value of approximately 100 μg/L per decade (10 μg/L per year). This age adjusted cut-off value was subsequently validated in secondary care patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, and in both primary and secondary care cohorts of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis. However, higher cut-off values may also lead to an increased percentage of false negative cases (that is, missed cases of venous thromboembolism), which might make this strategy less safe. Since venous thromboembolism has a high short term mortality rate in older patients, doctors do not always get the chance to reconsider a missed diagnosis.

Controversy therefore remains on the utility of D-dimer testing (either using the conventional or higher cut-off values) to safely exclude venous thromboembolism in a substantial proportion of older patients. A formal systematic review increases the evidence base on this topic; a meta-analysis can provide more precise estimates of the accuracy of D-dimer testing among clinically relevant subgroups, whereby sources for interstudy heterogeneity can be considered. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic value of D-dimer testing for excluding suspected venous thromboembolism in older patients, with a particular interest in whether increasing the threshold for test positivity using the proposed age adjusted manner is a safe and more efficient strategy than using the conventional cut-off value.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^a09ac913]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism — diagnostic test performance and thresholds: CT angiography has a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 95% to 100% in patients with low or intermediate pretest probability and a sensitivity of 85% to 95% in patients with high pretest probability. The sensitivity of V/Q scan for PE is 50% to 98%, and specificity is 20% to 60%. Pulmonary angiography is an invasive test that should only be reserved in patients where the diagnosis is still uncertain after CT angiography or V/Q scan. Age-adjusted (age × 10 ng/mL) d-dimer cutoffs can be used to exclude PE in non–high clinical probability patients who are > 50 years of age, with a sensitivity of > 97% and higher specificities than the conventional cutoff of 500 ng/mL.

Acute pulmonary embolism — talking points for clinicians to use with patients during PE evaluation: Imaging has risks. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria exclude PE in patients with low pretest probability. D-dimer testing excludes PE in patients at low pretest probability who do not meet the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria or patients at intermediate pretest probability. Alternative diagnostic strategies exist for patients who cannot have CT.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^1d23f3fe]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism — intermediate pretest probability (~20%) — the ASH guideline panel suggests using a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding PE in a population with intermediate prevalence/PTP (~20%), followed by VQ scan or CTPA for patients requiring additional testing; if D-dimer or VQ scan are not available or testing would delay treatment in high suspicion, proceeding directly to VQ scan or CTPA alone is acceptable, and patients likely to have a nondiagnostic VQ scan should undergo CTPA. The panel also recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose PE, and against additional testing following negative CTPA or normal VQ scan in a population with intermediate prevalence/PTP (~20%). Remarks note that a negative D-dimer rules out PE and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required; D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized and certain patient populations (postsurgical, pregnant) due to frequent positive results; in outpatients older than 50 years an age-adjusted D-dimer can be used (age [years] × 10 μg/L with assays having a cutoff of 500 μg/L); VQ scan is preferred over CTPA as the subsequent test to limit radiation exposure when expertise and timely interpretation are available, with CTPA preferred when VQ is not feasible; results should be obtained under optimal conditions, with suboptimal D-dimer or CTPA possibly requiring repeat testing, and nondiagnostic VQ scans followed by CTPA.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism [^73ddd2a6]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is complicated by its heterogeneous clinical presentation. Current diagnostic algorithms, combining clinical probability estimation with D-dimer testing and imaging tests, are very safe to exclude PE, although at costs of high numbers of CT-examinations. In view of cost- and time-saving as well as safety issues, several attempts have recently been undertaken to reduce the number of required imaging tests. Especially the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold has greatly improved the potential for non-invasive exclusion of PE. Once the diagnosis of PE is established, immediate initiation of anticoagulant therapy is of vital importance. A new generation of direct oral anticoagulants, which overcomes the main disadvantages of conventional vitamin-K antagonists, has recently emerged. Risk stratification of hemodynamically stable PE patients with use of clinical decision rules, cardiac biomarkers or imaging tests, aids physicians in determining the most appropriate treatment approach for the individual patient. This is essential to differentiate patients at low risk of adverse outcome, who may be safely treated at home, from intermediate-risk patients, who require closer monitoring and for whom recent studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of systemic thrombolytic therapy. This article reviews recent advances and challenges that remain in the diagnostic work-up and initial management of acute, clinically stable PE.

### Novel insights into pulmonary embolism with negative D-dimer results [^bed90ff4]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A patient in his mid-40s presented with exertional dyspnoea and pleuritic chest pain persisting for 6weeks. Despite repeated normal investigations, including D-dimer tests, chest X-rays, serial troponins and ECGs, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) or other pulmonary abnormalities, revealing a left main pulmonary artery thrombus with no evidence of right ventricular strain. The patient was managed with oral rivaroxaban 15mg two times per day for 21 days followed by 20mg once daily for 6 months. The patient showed full recovery at the 6-month follow-up. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges in patients with persistent symptoms, low risk of venous thromboembolisms (VTEs) and normal initial investigations. It is novel because previous case reports of PE with negative D-dimer results have predominantly involved patients with identifiable risk factors, such as prior VTEs, malignancy or other conditions that increase the likelihood of PE. In contrast, this case demonstrates that PE can occur even in the absence of these risk factors, emphasising the importance of clinical diligence and the use of advanced imaging in diagnosing PE in atypical presentations.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — PERC performance and D-dimer cutoffs: The PERC are not a screening tool for all patients and should be applied only to very low–risk patients in whom PE is genuinely suspected, and when used in this manner the PERC should decrease the use of d-dimer testing only in patients who would have otherwise been tested. A meta-analysis of 12 studies found the overall proportion of missed PEs by using PERC was 0.3% (46 of 14 844 total cases), the pooled sensitivity was 97% (95% CI, 96% to 98%), and the pooled specificity was 22%, indicating that 22% of d-dimer tests could have been safely avoided had the PERC been universally applied. To date, most recommendations have considered any value above 499 ng/mL as elevated, and a meta-analysis of 13 studies and 12 497 patients without high pretest probability found that using age-adjusted D-dimer cutoffs for patients older than 50 years (age × 10 ng/mL) maintained a sensitivity for PE above 97% while significantly increasing specificity.

### D-dimer testing in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and impaired renal function [^78321f67]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Determination of pretest probability and D-dimer tests are the first diagnostic steps in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, which can be ruled out when clinical probability is unlikely and D-dimer level is normal. We evaluated the utility of D-dimer testing in patients with impaired renal function.

Methods

D-dimer tests were performed in consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and an unlikely clinical probability. Creatinine levels were assessed as clinical routine. Glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Correlation between D-dimer level and renal function and proportions of patients with normal D-dimer in different categories of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were assessed. Different categories of decreasing eGFR were defined as: normal renal function (eGFR > 89 mL/min), mild decrease in eGFR (eGFR 60–89 mL/min), and moderate decrease in eGFR (eGFR 30–59 mL/min).

Results

Creatinine levels were assessed in 351 of 385 patients (91%). D-dimer levels significantly increased in 3 categories of decreasing eGFR (P = 0.027 and P = 0.021 for moderate renal impairment compared with mild renal impairment and normal renal function, respectively). Normal D-dimer levels were found in 58% of patients with eGFR > 89 mL/min, in 54% with eGFR 60–89 mL/min, and in 28% with eGFR 30–59 mL/min.

Conclusions

The specificity of D-dimer testing in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and decreased GFR is significantly decreased. Nonetheless, performing D-dimer tests is still useful because computed tomography scanning can be withheld in a significant proportion of these patients.

Therefore, if the D-dimer assays and dead-space measurements were both normal in a population with a pretest probability of PE equal to that of subjects enrolled in REPE. the REPE study, we investigated the utility of a rapid D-dimer assay, together with a bedside measurement of alveolar dead space to evaluate patients with suspected acute PE in 6 urban EDs. We used a commercially available whole blood agglutination D-dimer assay, which is supported by published diagnostic performance data and with characteristics.

93. 8% to 98. 4% and the posterior probability of PE decreases to

This posttest probability is similar to the frequency that PE is discovered on a long-term follow-up basis in patients with suspected PE and a normal / scan, or. a pulmonary angiogram that is negative for PE. 21–23 Second, assuming that PE could be excluded when both results are normal and that definitive pulmonary vascular imaging is required when both results are positive, the D-dimer assay plus the dead-space test could clarify the short-term clinical plan for 60% of all ED patients with suspected PE. Moreover, in 13.

out of 27 subjects who were subjected to pulmonary arteriography to rule out PE, both tests results were normal. The use of the D-dimer–dead-space combination might therefore lead to a net reduction in ED length of stay for patients who are evaluated for PE and possibly reduce the number of pulmonary.

### D-dimer for the exclusion of acute venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: a systematic review [^83f12dce]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Despite extensive literature, the diagnostic role of d-dimer for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) remains unclear, reflecting multiple d-dimer assays and concerns about differing sensitivities and variability.

Purpose

To systematically review trials that assessed sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and variability among d-dimer assays.

Data Sources

Studies in all languages were identified by searching PubMed from 1983 to January 2003 and EMBASE from 1988 to January 2003.

Study Selection

The researchers selected prospective studies that compared d-dimer with a reference standard. Studies of high methodologic quality were included in the primary analyses; sensitivity analysis included additional weaker studies.

Data Extraction

Two authors collected data on study-level factors: d-dimer assay used, cutoff value, and whether patients had suspected DVT or PE.

Data Synthesis

For DVT, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative rapid ELISA dominate the rank order for these values: sensitivity, 0.96 (95% confidence limit [CL], 0.91 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.12 (CL, 0.04 to 0.33); and sensitivity, 0.96 (CL, 0.90 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.09 (CL, 0.02 to 0.41), respectively. For PE, the ELISA and quantitative rapid ELISA also dominate the rank order for these values: sensitivity, 0.95 (CL, 0.85 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.13 (CL, 0.03 to 0.58); and sensitivity, 0.95 (CL, 0.83 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.13 (CL, 0.02 to 0.84), respectively. The ELISA and quantitative rapid ELISA have negative likelihood ratios that yield a high certainty for excluding DVT or PE. The positive likelihood values, which are in the general range of 1.5 to 2.5, do not greatly increase the certainty of diagnosis. Sensitivity analyses do not affect these findings.

Limitations

Although many studies evaluated multiple d-dimer assays, findings are based largely on indirect comparisons of test performance characteristics across studies.

Conclusion

The ELISAs in general dominate the comparative ranking among the d-dimer assays for sensitivity and negative likelihood ratio. For excluding PE or DVT, a negative result on quantitative rapid ELISA is as diagnostically useful as a normal lung scan or negative duplex ultrasonography finding.

### Potential impact of adjusting the threshold of the quantitative D-dimer based on pretest probability of acute pulmonary embolism [^99722b3d]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The utility of D-dimer testing for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) can be limited by test specificity. The authors tested if the threshold of the quantitative D-dimer can be varied according to pretest probability (PTP) of PE to increase specificity while maintaining a negative predictive value (NPV) of > 99%.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational multicenter study of emergency department (ED) patients in the United States. Eligible patients had a diagnostic study ordered to evaluate possible PE. PTP was determined by the clinician's unstructured estimate and the Wells score. Five different D-dimer assays were used. D-dimer test performance was measured using 1) standard thresholds and 2) variable threshold values: twice (for low PTP patients), equal (intermediate PTP patients), or half (high PTP patients) of standard threshold. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) within 45 days required positive imaging plus decision to treat.

Results

The authors enrolled 7,940 patients tested for PE, and clinicians ordered a quantitative D-dimer for 4,357 (55%) patients who had PTPs distributed as follows: low (74%), moderate (21%), or high (4%). At standard cutoffs, across all PTP strata, quantitative D-dimer testing had a test sensitivity of 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 91% to 97%), specificity of 58% (95% CI = 56% to 60%), and NPV of 99.5% (95% CI = 99.1% to 99.7%). If variable cutoffs had been used the overall sensitivity would have been 88% (95% CI = 83% to 92%), specificity 75% (95% CI = 74% to 76%), and NPV 99.1% (95% CI = 98.7% to 99.4%).

Conclusions

This large multicenter observational sample demonstrates that emergency medicine clinicians currently order a D-dimer in the majority of patients tested for PE, including a large proportion with intermediate PTP and high PTP. Varying the D-dimer's cutoff according to PTP can increase specificity with no measurable decrease in NPV.

Immediate CT applies to patients who are "Hemodynamically unstable, with suspected PE" or have "High pretest probability of PE," with the basis that "Risks of inaction outweigh risks of CT" and that there is an "Incidence of PE 19%-28% even with a d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL."

No CT or d-dimer test is suggested for "Low pretest probability and PERC = 0," given an "Incidence of PE < 1%." For patients with symptoms of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE, "Begin with lower-extremity venous ultrasonography," because "Similar treatment will be pursued without exposing the patient to the risks of radiation or intravenous contrast." A safety note states, "Hemodynamic instability may make transport for imaging problematic. Supportive measures or empirical anticoagulation until imaging can be obtained may be required."

### Age-adjusted versus clinical probability-adjusted D-dimer to exclude pulmonary embolism [^8b048099]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

A low D-dimer can exclude suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in cases with low or intermediate clinical probability of disease. Yet D-dimer is nonspecific, so many cases without PE require imaging. D-dimer's specificity is improved by increasing the threshold for a positive test with age (age × 10 ng/mL; age-adjusted D-dimer; AADD) or clinical probability of PE (1000 ng/mL if low and 500 ng/mL if intermediate clinical probability; clinical probability-adjusted D-dimer; CPADD). It is unclear which approach is preferable.

Objectives

We report the sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) of AADD compared to CPADD in suspected PE.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective cohort of 3500 consecutive cases imaged for suspected PE at two U.S. emergency departments was assembled. We analyzed cases with low or intermediate clinical probability of PE (Revised Geneva Score) who had a D-dimer. The outcome was acute PE on imaging at presentation.

Results

Of the 3500 cases, 1745 were eligible. 37% were low, and 63% were intermediate clinical probability of PE. PE was present in 145 (8.3%) cases. Sensitivity of CPADD was 87.5% vs. 96.6% for AADD (difference 9.1%; 95% CI 4.3% to 14.0%). NPV of CPADD was 97.1% vs. 99.0% for AADD (difference 1.9%; 95% CI, 0.7% to 3.1%). Specificity of CPADD was 37.5% vs. 30.2% for AADD (difference -7.3%; 95% CI -9.4% to -5.1%). D-dimer was negative in 35.4% of cases using CPADD vs. 28.0% using AADD.

Conclusions

CPADD modestly improved the specificity of D-dimer, but had a lower NPV than AADD. AADD appears preferable in this analysis.

### Rapid quantitative D-dimer to exclude pulmonary embolism: a prospective cohort management study [^f8215030]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

ESSENTIALS: It is not known if D-dimer testing alone can safely exclude pulmonary embolism (PE). We studied the safety of using a quantitative latex agglutination D-dimer to exclude PE in 808 patients. 52% of patients with suspected PE had a negative D-dimer test and were followed for 3 months. The negative predictive value of D-dimer testing alone was 99.8%, suggesting it may safely exclude PE.

Background

Strategies are needed to exclude pulmonary embolism (PE) efficiently without the need for imaging tests. Although validated rules for clinical probability assessment can be combined with D-dimer testing to safely exclude PE, the rules can be complicated or partially subjective, which limits their use.

Objectives

To determine if PE can be safely excluded in patients with a negative D-dimer without incorporating clinical probability assessment.

Patients/Methods

We enrolled consecutive outpatients and inpatients with suspected PE from four tertiary care hospitals. All patients underwent D-dimer testing using the MDA D-dimer test, a quantitative latex agglutination assay. PE was excluded in patients with a D-dimer less than 750 μg FEU L(-1) without further testing.

Patients

with D-dimer levels of 750 μg FEU L(-1) or higher underwent standardized imaging tests for PE. All patients in whom PE was excluded had anticoagulant therapy withheld and were followed for 3 months for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Suspected events during follow-up were adjudicated centrally.

Results

Eight hundred and eight patients were enrolled, of whom 99 (12%) were diagnosed with VTE at presentation. Four hundred and twenty (52%) patients had a negative D-dimer level at presentation and were not treated with anticoagulants; of these, one had VTE during follow-up. The negative predictive value of D-dimer testing for PE was 99.8% (95% confidence interval, 98.7–99.9%).

Conclusions

A negative latex agglutination D-dimer assay is seen in about one-half of patients with suspected PE and reliably excludes PE as a stand-alone test.

### Diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism [^ee871428]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Advances in the management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) have improved diagnostic accuracy and made management algorithms safer, easier to use, and well standardized. These diagnostic algorithms are mainly based on the assessment of clinical pretest probability, D-dimer measurement, and imaging tests-predominantly computed tomography pulmonary angiography. These diagnostic algorithms allow safe and cost-effective diagnosis for most patients with suspected PE. In this review, we summarize signs and symptoms of PE, current existing evidence for PE diagnosis, and focus on the challenge of diagnosing PE in special patient populations, such as pregnant women, or patients with a prior VTE. We also discuss novel imaging tests for PE diagnosis and highlight some of the additional challenges that might require adjustments to current diagnostic strategies, such as the reduced clinical suspicion threshold, resulting in a lower proportion of PE among suspected patients as well as the overdiagnosis of subsegmental PE.

### Critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected pulmonary embolism [^e16ffa00]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is the revision of a 2003 clinical policy on the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).(1) A writing subcommittee reviewed the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help clinicians answer the following critical questions: (1) Do objective criteria provide improved risk stratification over gestalt clinical assessment in the evaluation of patients with possible PE? (2) What is the utility of the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) in the evaluation of patients with suspected PE? (3)What is the role of quantitative D-dimer testing in the exclusion of PE? (4) What is the role of computed tomography pulmonary angiogram of the chest as the sole diagnostic test in the exclusion of PE? (5) What is the role of venous imaging in the evaluation of patients with suspected PE? (6) What are the indications for thrombolytic therapy in patients with PE? Evidence was graded and recommendations were given based on the strength of the available data in the medical literature.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^1f588214]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Table 3
Proportion of patients in validation set 1 with an unlikely clinical probability of pulmonary embolism* in whom pulmonary embolism could be excluded based on a D-dimer test result below the cut-off value: comparison of different cut-off values stratified by age group

IQR = interquartile range

*Based on Wells clinical decision rule.

†Conventional cut-off value for D-dimer test = 500 μg/l, age adjusted cut-off value = (age×10) μg/l (if age > 50).

‡Number needed to test to find one normal D-dimer test result

The age adjusted cut-off value resulted in an 11.2% (9.3% to 13.3%) increase in the number of patients with a negative D-dimer test result. The increase in the proportion of patients in whom pulmonary embolism could be ruled out (that is, unlikely clinical probability with a D-dimer level below the cut-off) from using the age adjusted cut-off value was most prominent among patients in the age groups > 70 years, with an absolute increase of 16% (table 3).

The data for validation set 1 came from a study in which two different D-dimer tests were used. We therefore performed separate analyses for the two D-dimer tests. There was no difference between the two tests in the false negative rate for the age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value (table 4).

### D-dimer testing to determine the duration of anticoagulation therapy [^3004a611]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral anticoagulation in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism is uncertain. Testing of D-dimer levels may play a role in the assessment of the need for prolonged anticoagulation.

Methods

We performed D-dimer testing 1 month after the discontinuation of anticoagulation in patients with a first unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who had received a vitamin K antagonist for at least 3 months. Patients with a normal D-dimer level did not resume anticoagulation, whereas those with an abnormal D-dimer level were randomly assigned either to resume or to discontinue treatment. The study outcome was the composite of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding during an average follow-up of 1.4 years.

Results

The D-dimer assay was abnormal in 223 of 608 patients (36.7%). A total of 18 events occurred among the 120 patients who stopped anticoagulation (15.0%), as compared with 3 events among the 103 patients who resumed anticoagulation (2.9%), for an adjusted hazard ratio of 4.26 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23 to 14.6; P = 0.02). Thromboembolism recurred in 24 of 385 patients with a normal D-dimer level (6.2%). Among patients who stopped anticoagulation, the adjusted hazard ratio for recurrent thromboembolism among those with an abnormal D-dimer level, as compared with those with a normal D-dimer level, was 2.27 (95% CI, 1.15 to 4.46; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Patients with an abnormal D-dimer level 1 month after the discontinuation of anticoagulation have a significant incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism, which is reduced by the resumption of anticoagulation. The optimal course of anticoagulation in patients with a normal D-dimer level has not been clearly established. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00264277 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

### Age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff levels to rule out pulmonary embolism: the ADJUST-PE study [^b6aa8722]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

D-dimer measurement is an important step in the diagnostic strategy of clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE), but its clinical usefulness is limited in elderly patients.

Objective

To prospectively validate whether an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff, defined as age×10 in patients 50 years or older, is associated with an increased diagnostic yield of D-dimer in elderly patients with suspected PE.

Design, Settings, and Patients

A multicenter, multinational, prospective management outcome study in 19 centers in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland between January 1, 2010, and February 28, 2013.

Interventions

All consecutive outpatients who presented to the emergency department with clinically suspected PE were assessed by a sequential diagnostic strategy based on the clinical probability assessed using either the simplified, revised Geneva score or the 2-level Wells score for PE; highly sensitive D-dimer measurement; and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Patients with a D-dimer value between the conventional cutoff of 500 µg/L and their age-adjusted cutoff did not undergo CTPA and were left untreated and formally followed-up for a 3-month period.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the failure rate of the diagnostic strategy, defined as adjudicated thromboembolic events during the 3-month follow-up period among patients not treated with anticoagulants on the basis of a negative age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff result.

Results

Of the 3346 patients with suspected PE included, the prevalence of PE was 19%. Among the 2898 patients with a nonhigh or an unlikely clinical probability, 817 patients (28.2%) had a D-dimer level lower than 500 µg/L (95% CI, 26.6%-29.9%) and 337 patients (11.6%) had a D-dimer between 500 µg/L and their age-adjusted cutoff (95% CI, 10.5%-12.9%). The 3-month failure rate in patients with a D-dimer level higher than 500 µg/L but below the age-adjusted cutoff was 1 of 331 patients (0.3% [95% CI, 0.1%-1.7%]). Among the 766 patients 75 years or older, of whom 673 had a nonhigh clinical probability, using the age-adjusted cutoff instead of the 500 µg/L cutoff increased the proportion of patients in whom PE could be excluded on the basis of D-dimer from 43 of 673 patients (6.4% [95% CI, 4.8%-8.5%) to 200 of 673 patients (29.7% [95% CI, 26.4%-33.3%), without any additional false-negative findings.

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with a fixed D-dimer cutoff of 500 µg/L, the combination of pretest clinical probability assessment with age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff was associated with a larger number of patients in whom PE could be considered ruled out with a low likelihood of subsequent clinical venous thromboembolism.

### Effect of a diagnostic strategy using an elevated and age-adjusted D-dimer threshold on thromboembolic events in emergency department patients with suspected pulmonary embolism: a randomized clinical trial [^f5f3feca]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Uncontrolled studies suggest that pulmonary embolism (PE) can be safely ruled out using the YEARS rule, a diagnostic strategy that uses varying D-dimer thresholds.

Objective

To prospectively validate the safety of a strategy that combines the YEARS rule with the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) rule and an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold.

Design, Settings, and Participants

A cluster-randomized, crossover, noninferiority trial in 18 emergency departments (EDs) in France and Spain. Patients (N = 1414) who had a low clinical risk of PE not excluded by the PERC rule or a subjective clinical intermediate risk of PE were included from October 2019 to June 2020, and followed up until October 2020.

Interventions

Each center was randomized for the sequence of intervention periods. In the intervention period (726 patients), PE was excluded without chest imaging in patients with no YEARS criteria and a D-dimer level less than 1000 ng/mL and in patients with 1 or more YEARS criteria and a D-dimer level less than the age-adjusted threshold (500 ng/mL if age < 50 years or age in years × 10 in patients ≥ 50 years). In the control period (688 patients), PE was excluded without chest imaging if the D-dimer level was less than the age-adjusted threshold.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was venous thromboembolism (VTE) at 3 months. The noninferiority margin was set at 1.35%. There were 8 secondary end points, including chest imaging, ED length of stay, hospital admission, nonindicated anticoagulation treatment, all-cause death, and all-cause readmission at 3 months.

Results

Of the 1414 included patients (mean age, 55 years; 58% female), 1217 (86%) were analyzed in the per-protocol analysis. PE was diagnosed in the ED in 100 patients (7.1%). At 3 months, VTE was diagnosed in 1 patient in the intervention group (0.15% [95% CI, 0.0% to 0.86%]) vs 5 patients in the control group (0.80% [95% CI, 0.26% to 1.86%]) (adjusted difference, -0.64% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 0.21%], within the noninferiority margin). Of the 6 analyzed secondary end points, only 2 showed a statistically significant difference in the intervention group compared with the control group: chest imaging (30.4% vs 40.0%; adjusted difference, -8.7% [95% CI, -13.8% to -3.5%]) and ED median length of stay (6 hours [IQR, 4 to 8 hours] vs 6 hours [IQR, 5 to 9 hours]; adjusted difference, -1.6 hours [95% CI, -2.3 to -0.9]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among ED patients with suspected PE, the use of the YEARS rule combined with the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold in PERC-positive patients, compared with a conventional diagnostic strategy, did not result in an inferior rate of thromboembolic events.

### Magnitude of D-dimer matters for diagnosing pulmonary embolus [^1d2e89ea]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to determine whether the magnitude of the D-dimer correlates with a higher likelihood of pulmonary embolus (PE).

Methods

We performed an electronic chart review at our academic, tertiary care center, annual emergency department (ED) census greater than 100000. All patients with a chest computed tomographic (CT) scan with intravenous contrast and an elevated D-dimer level obtained in the ED between January 2001 and July 2008 were identified. Specific, predetermined, predefined data elements including sex, age, D-dimer level, and final ED diagnosis were recorded by a hypothesis-blinded extractor using a preformatted data form. D-dimer level less than 0.58 μg/mL constitutes the normal laboratory reference range for our turbidometric D-dimer assay. Data were analyzed using standard statistical methods, and a linear regression analysis was performed for correlation analysis of D-dimer and diagnosis of PE.

Results

We identified 544 subjects who had both a chest CT scan performed and an elevated D-dimer level obtained in the ED. Fifty-eight subjects (10.7%; mean D-dimer, 4.9 μg/mL) were diagnosed with PE, and 486 (89.3%; mean D-dimer, 2.0) did not have a PE. The percentages of PE diagnoses for D-dimers in the ranges 0.58 to 1.0, 1.0 to 2.0, 2.0 to 5.0, 5.0 to 20.0, and greater than 20.0 (n = 11) were 3.6%, 8.0%, 16.2%, 35.3%, and 45.5%, respectively. The positive predictive value of PE for D-dimer level cutoffs of greater than 0.58, greater than 1.0, greater than 2.0, greater than 5.0, and greater than 20.0 was 10.7%, 14.6%, 22.2%, 37.8%, and 45.5%, respectively. Increasing D-dimer values were strongly correlated with the presence of PE (odds ratio, 1.1685 per stratum; P < .001).

Conclusion

Increasing magnitude of D-dimer correlates with increasing likelihood of PE diagnosed by CT angiography.

### D-dimer testing for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^5f3ad7df]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

For more than 2 decades, the plasma D-dimer assay has been used in conjunction with clinical prediction scores to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) among patients with a low pretest probability of having this condition without the need for more costly and invasive methods. The increased thrombotic risk among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (ie, those with high pretest probability of PE) and increased D-dimer levels in the absence of thrombosis diverge considerably from the study population used to originally validate this assay. However, the availability of D-dimer samples routinely collected from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and the heterogeneity of early, smaller studies generated uncertainty regarding the clinical utility of the assay in this setting. Therefore, we conducted a diagnostic accuracy study to characterize the performance of D-dimer using various threshold values to exclude PE among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

### D-dimer specificity and clinical context: an old unlearned story [^804210d1]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

D-dimer, a degradation product of activated fibrin, is considered a sensitive biomarker for thromboembolic events. Unfortunately, the D-dimer does not show as much specificity. Other conditions than venous thrombosis can also raise D-dimer level, such as pregnancy, renal failure, sepsis. An elevated D-dimer value is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism. Plasma D-dimers levels could be determined by the lysis of extra-vascular rather than intra-vascular fibrin. In the ADJUST-PE study, approximately 10% of patients with an age-adjusted D-dimer above the significant cut-off showed no angiographic evidence of pulmonary embolism. In a cohort of 98 patients, Kutinsky et al. found 12 with D-dimer > 500 ng/mL who had no angiographic evidence of pulmonary embolism and 8 with D-dimer < 250 ng/mL who did have pulmonary embolism.

D-dimer has a negative prognostic role in the COVID-19 patient's population. Numerous studies confirm this value, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. A component responsible for high D-dimer levels could be a peculiar form of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Up to 40% of patients with COVID-19 have some form of thromboembolism (i.e. DVT or PE). However, as many as 76% of patients have an elevated D-dimer.

We read the review by Susen et al. which identifies D-dimer as a reliable guide for the dosage of anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19 patients. Due to the previously mentioned limitations, this strategy has never been validated, even for non-COVID-19 patients. Some authors proposed a low molecular weight heparin prophylactic regimen adjusted-doses based on D-dimer levels in some specific non-COVID-19 populations. However, these populations are not comparable to the COVID-19 patients.

### A simple decision rule including D-dimer to reduce the need for computed tomography scanning in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism [^b7249de1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

An 'unlikely' clinical decision rule with a negative D-dimer result safely excludes pulmonary embolism (PE) in 30% of presenting patients. We aimed to simplify this diagnostic approach and to increase its efficiency.

Methods

Data for 723 consecutive patients with suspected PE were analyzed (prevalence of PE, 22%). After constructing a logistic regression model with the D-dimer test result and items from the Wells' score, we identified the most prevalent combinations of influential items and selected new D-dimer positivity thresholds. The performance was separately validated with data from 2785 consecutive patients with suspected PE.

Results

Three Wells items significantly added incremental value to the D-dimer test: hemoptysis, signs of deep vein thrombosis and 'PE most likely'. Based on the most frequent combinations of these three items, we identified two groups: (i) none of these three items positive (41%); (ii) one or more of these items positive (59%). When applying a 1000 μg/L D-dimer threshold in group 1 and 500 μg/L in group 2, PE could be excluded without CT scanning in 36%, at a false-negative rate of 1.2% (95%, 0.04–3.3%). In the validation set, these proportions were 46% and 1.9% (95% CI, 1.2–2.7%), respectively. Using the conventional Wells score with a normal D-dimer result, these rates were, respectively, 22% and 0.6% (95% CI, 0.10–2.4%).

Conclusion

Combining Wells items with the D-dimer test resulted in a simplified decision rule, which reduces the need for CT scanning in patients with suspected PE. A prospective validation is required before it can be implemented in clinical practice.

†Conventional cut-off value for D-dimer test = 500 μg/l, age adjusted cut-off value = (age×10) μg/l (if age > 50).

‡Number needed to test to find one normal D-dimer test result

External validation

The concept of using an increasing cut-off value for the D-dimer test according to age was validated in two independent cohorts of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. The clinical characteristics of the patients in these cohorts were similar to those of the patients in the derivation set (table 1).

Validation set 1

Of the 3306 patients included in validation set 1, 674 (20.4%) had pulmonary embolism. In 41 of the 2206 patients with an unlikely clinical probability of pulmonary embolism, D-dimer test results were recorded only qualitatively and were therefore missing for this analysis. In another seven patients age was not documented, leaving 2158 patients. Among these, 983 patients had a negative D-dimer test result with the conventional cut-off value, of whom two (0.2%, 95% CI 0.1% to 0.7%) had pulmonary embolism during the diagnostic investigation or three month follow-up. With the age adjusted cut-off value, 1093 patients had a negative D-dimer test result, of whom seven (0.6%, 0.3% to 1.3%) had pulmonary embolism. Table 3shows the proportion of patients in whom pulmonary embolism could be excluded based on the old and the new cut-off values.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^d72d989a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — high pretest probability: For patients with high pretest probability of PE according to either clinician gestalt or a clinical prediction tool, imaging studies should be performed. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred method of diagnosis when it is available and there is no contraindication to radiographic contrast dye. Ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning should be used when CTPA is unavailable or contraindicated. Of note, a D-dimer assay should not be obtained in patients with a high pretest probability of PE because a negative value will not obviate the need for imaging.

### The diagnostic value of D-dimer with simplified Geneva score (SGS) pre-test in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) [^68cd9018]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, D-dimer test in combination with SGS pre-test could improve the accuracy of PE diagnosis. Patients with D-dimer levels over 1.96 mg/L (4 times of the normal level) have a significant risk for PE. In addition, in patients with SGS ≥ 3, the D-dimer cutoff point concentration for PE risk moves to the level of 2.2 mg/L. CTPA should be a compulsive measure for PE confirmation in patients with a high level of D-dimer.

Problem

Admitting doctors are often criticised for the inappropriate use of investigations in the early stages of diagnosis. This not only wastes resources, but it delays correct diagnosis and can in some cases be harmful to the patient.

The unnecessary measurement of d-dimer in cases of pulmonary embolism (PE) is particularly high.

### The diagnostic value of D-dimer with simplified Geneva score (SGS) pre-test in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) [^b20102b3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In our study, when using the D-dimer commonly used cutoff point (0.5 mg/L) to rule-out PE, 11.6% patients with normal D-dimer levels and confirmed PE would not be excluded by D-dimer testing effectively. Meanwhile, in the patients with PE, 10.9% (32 of 294) had normal levels of D-dimer, which was slightly higher than those reported in most studies, 5.2% (7 of 134) (11), 3.6% (2 of 55), 4% (29 of 725), and 27% (8 of 30). In present study, we desire to establish optimized test process for PE confirmation through combination SGS pre-test and D-dimer detection in large sample size. CTPA should be our final measure for PE confirmation in patients with high PE risk in our ideal testing process.

There were some limitations in our study. This was a retrospective analysis, and most of the study individuals were hospitalized patient with complex conditions. Plasma D-dimer concentration could be promoted in patients with cancer, during pregnancy, and in hospitalized patients. Moreover, due to limited sample size of patients with lung cancer, we cannot analyze the D-dimer cut-off point levels for PE diagnosis in this separated population.

### Sex-related differences in D-dimer levels for venous thromboembolism screening [^8660c017]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

D-dimer is generally considered positive above 0.5 mg/L irrespective of sex. However, women have been shown to be more likely to have a positive D-dimer after controlling for other factors. Thus, differences may exist between males and females for using D-dimer as a marker of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease. We hypothesized that the accuracy of D-dimer tests may be enhanced by using appropriate cutoff values that reflect sex-related differences in D-dimer levels.

Methods

This research is a secondary analysis of a multicenter, international, prospective, observational study of adult (18+ years) patients suspected of VTE, with low-to-intermediate pretest probability based on Wells criteria ≤ 6 for pulmonary embolism (PE) and ≤ 2 for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). VTE diagnoses were based on computed tomography, ventilation perfusion scanning, or venous ultrasound. D-dimer levels were tested for statistical difference across groups stratified by sex and diagnosis. Multivariable regression was used to investigate sex as a predictor of diagnosis. Sex-specific optimal D-dimer thresholds for PE and DVT were calculated from receiver operating characteristic analyses. A Youden threshold (D-dimer level coinciding with the maximum of sensitivity plus specificity) and a cutoff corresponding to 95% sensitivity were calculated. Statistical difference for cutoffs was tested via 95% confidence intervals from 2,000 bootstrapped samples.

Results

We included 3,586 subjects for analysis, of whom 61% were female. Race demographics were 63% White, 27% Black/African American, and 6% Hispanic. In the suspected PE cohort, 6% were diagnosed with PE, while in the suspected DVT cohort, 11% were diagnosed with DVT. D-dimer levels were significantly higher in males than females for the PE-positive group and the DVT-negative group, but males had significantly lower D-dimer levels than females in the PE-negative group. Regression models showed male sex as a significant positive predictor of DVT diagnosis, controlling for D-dimer levels. The Youden thresholds for PE patients were 0.97 (95% CI = 0.64 to 1.79) mg/L and 1.45 (95% CI = 1.36 to 1.95) mg/L for females and males, respectively; 95% sensitivity cutoffs for this group were 0.64 (95% CI = 0.20 to 0.89) and 0.55 (95% CI = 0.29 to 1.61). For DVT, the Youden thresholds were 0.98 (95% CI = 0.84 to 1.56) mg/L for females and 1.25 (95% CI = 0.65 to 3.33) mg/L for males with 95% sensitivity cutoffs of 0.33 (95% CI = 0.2 to 0.61) and 0.32 (95% CI = 0.18 to 0.7), respectively.

Conclusion

Differences in D-dimer levels between males and females are diagnosis specific; however, there was no significant difference in optimal cutoff values for excluding PE and DVT between the sexes.

### Recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism [^4fcb69c0]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Due to the nonspecific symptoms of the condition, a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequently considered. However, PE will only be confirmed in 10–20% of patients. Because the imaging test of choice, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), is costly and associated with radiation exposure and other complications, a validated diagnostic algorithm consisting of a clinical decision rule and D-dimer test should be used to safely exclude PE in 20–30% of patients without the need for CTPA. Recently, the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold has been validated, and this has increased the proportion of patients at older age in whom PE can be excluded without CTPA. Initial therapeutic management of PE depends on the risk of short-term PE-related mortality. Haemodynamically unstable patients should be closely monitored and receive thrombolytic therapy unless contraindicated because of an unacceptably high bleeding risk, whereas patients with low-risk PE may be safely discharged early from hospital or receive only outpatient treatment. The PESI score and Hestia decision rule are available to select patients in whom early discharge or outpatient treatment will be safe, although the safety of these strategies should be confirmed in additional studies. Standard PE therapy consists of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Recently, several nonvitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants have been shown to be as effective as LMWH/VKAs, and maybe safer. Determining the optimal duration of treatment for a first unprovoked PE remains a challenge, although clinical prediction rules for estimating the risk of recurrence of venous thromboembolism and anticoagulation-associated haemorrhage are under investigation. Using these prediction rules may lead to both more standardized and more individualized long-term treatment of PE.

Recommendation 1b — suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) with low prevalence/pretest probability (PTP): The guideline panel recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose PE, and against additional testing after a negative computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or normal ventilation–perfusion (VQ) scan in populations with low prevalence/PTP (≤ 5%).

### What level of D-dimers can safely exclude pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department? [^d8f2499a]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify which level of D-dimer would allow the safe exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE) in COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective study was conducted on the COVID database of Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP). COVID-19 patients who presented at the ED of AP-HP hospitals between March 1 and May 15, 2020, and had CTPA following D-dimer dosage within 48h of presentation were included. The D-dimer sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for different D-dimer thresholds, as well as the false-negative and failure rates, and the number of CTPAs potentially avoided.

Results

A total of 781 patients (mean age 62.0 years, 53.8% men) with positive RT-PCR for SARS-Cov-2 were included and 60 of them (7.7%) had CTPA-confirmed PE. Their median D-dimer level was significantly higher than that of patients without PE (4,013 vs 1,198 ng·mL -1, p < 0.001). Using 500 ng·mL -1, or an age-adjusted cut-off for patients > 50 years, the sensitivity and the NPV were above 90%. With these thresholds, 17.1% and 31.5% of CTPAs could have been avoided, respectively. Four of the 178 patients who had a D-dimer below the age-adjusted cutoff had PE, leading to an acceptable failure rate of 2.2%. Using higher D-dimer cut-offs could have avoided more CTPAs, but would have lowered the sensitivity and increased the failure rate.

Conclusion

The same D-Dimer thresholds as those validated in non-COVID outpatients should be used to safely rule out PE.

Key Points

- The median D-dimer level was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with PE as compared to those without PE (4,013 ng·mL -1 vs 1,198 ng·mL -1 respectively, p < 0.001).
- Using 500 ng·mL -1, or an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off to exclude pulmonary embolism, the sensitivity and negative predictive value were above 90%.
- Higher cut-offs would lead to a reduction in the sensitivity below 85% and an increase in the failure rate, especially for patients under 50 years.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^5f1f62f9]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Derivation set outcome

With the conventional cut-off value, the VIDAS D-dimer test was normal (< 500 μg/l) in 512/1712 patients (29.9%), and none had pulmonary embolism during the initial investigation or the three month follow-up (0%, 95% CI 0% to 0.7%). The number of patients needed to test to find one normal D-dimer test result was 3.3. The Wells score could not be computed in 54 of the patients, mainly because information on the likelihood of an alternative diagnosis to that of pulmonary embolism was missing (n = 42).

Using the age adjusted cut-off value ((age (years)×10) μg/l), we found that D-dimer test results were negative in 615/1712 patients (46.2%, number needed to test 2.2). This resulted in a 20.1% (95% CI 16.9% to 23.8%) relative increase in the number of patients in whom D-dimer levels were considered normal. Of these 615 patients, five had pulmonary embolism during investigation or three month follow-up (0.8%, 0.4% to 1.9%).

Table 2shows the proportion of the 1331 patients with an unlikely clinical probability in whom pulmonary embolism could be excluded based on the conventional and the age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values. There was a 17.4% (95% CI 14.3% to 21.1%) increase in the number of patients with a negative D-dimer test result when the age adjusted cut-off value was used. The false negative rate was 0 (0%, 0% to 0.8%) for the conventional cut-off value compared with 1 (0.2%, 0% to 1.0%) for the age adjusted cut-off value. Table 2 also shows the increase in the proportion of patients with an unlikely clinical probability in whom D-dimer levels would be considered normal for specific age groups by using the age adjusted cut-off value: this increase was highest among the oldest patient groups (> 70 years), with an absolute increase of 14% compared with the conventional cut-off point.

### Age-adjusted cutoff D-dimer level to rule out acute pulmonary embolism: a validation cohort study [^6bd71865]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the Emergency Room setting is challenging. Multiple patients have to undergo radiologic assessment with its inherent shortcomings. The D-dimer test with accepted cutoff level of 500 μg/L is associated with a high proportion of false-positive results. The present study aimed to validate the advantages of using an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff level, compared with 500-μg/L value in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.

Methods

This study evaluated patients admitted to the Rambam Emergency Room between 2011 and 2014 with a suspected diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Patient data, D-dimer plasma levels, and imaging results were collected. The study cohort was subdivided according to the D-dimer levels below and above 500 μg/L. The group with levels above 500 μg/L was further assessed using the newly suggested age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff level, defined as age multiplied by 10.

Results

Files of 1241 patients were reviewed; 654 patients with low or intermediate risk for pulmonary embolism had a D-dimer level above 500 μg/L. Two hundred eight (208) patients had a D-dimer level above 500 μg/L but below the age-adjusted cutoff value; one of them was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (0.48% [95% confidence interval 0%-2.6%]). Four hundred forty-six (446) patients had a D-dimer level above the age-adjusted cutoff value, and 28 of them were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (6.28% [95% confidence interval 4.2%-8.9%]), representing a negative predictive value of 99.5% for the age-adjusted cutoff level.

Conclusions

An age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff level may be safely used to exclude pulmonary embolism in patients with a low or intermediate probability for acute pulmonary embolism, alleviating the need to perform unnecessary imaging evaluations.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^fd1ffb39]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

The calculation of the age adjusted cut-off value was facilitated by the large size of the study population, which is a major strength of this analysis. However, some aspects of our study warrant comment. Firstly, two different D-dimer assays were used in the validation cohorts. Although there was no significant difference between the two tests, and the new cut-off value performed equally well with both assays, the study may not have been sufficiently powered to detect a difference between the two. It is unknown how the new cut-off value will perform in other D-dimer assays. Secondly, although D-dimer tests and the (variables for the) clinical decision rule were collected prospectively, this study was a retrospective analysis. After derivation and independent validation in a completely distinct cohort of patients, the next step would be to validate this cut-off value prospectively in a formal outcome study with patient follow-up.

Conclusions

In conclusion, a cut-off value adjusted to age combined with clinical probability greatly increased the utility of the D-dimer test for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism among older patients without reducing safety. This new cut-off is therefore clinically relevant and has sustained external validation. The next step would be to validate this new D-dimer cut-off value prospectively before implementation in daily practice.

### Latex-enhanced immunoassay D-dimer and blood gases can exclude pulmonary embolism in low-risk patients presenting to an acute care setting [^59d7f117]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is common, and diagnosis is often difficult. Investigation has traditionally required expensive imaging procedures that are frequently nondiagnostic. Consequently, current practice favors noninvasive diagnosis of PE using algorithms combining risk assessment and d-dimer. Despite the proven safety of this approach, concern persists about such strategies to exclude PE, largely due to variable d-dimer sensitivity. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the safety of a new algorithm combining a novel, rapid d-dimer test (IL Test; Instrumentation Laboratory; Lexington, MA), Pa(O2) measurement, and risk factor assessment in excluding PE in subjects presenting to an acute care setting.

Methods

All patients aged 18 to 60 years presenting to the emergency department of Christchurch Hospital with suspected PE underwent measurement of d-dimer (IL Test latex-enhanced immunoassay) and Pa(O2), and were assessed for the presence of major clinical risk factors. Those with no risk factors, normal d-dimer findings, and Pa(O2) ≥ 80 mm Hg (study arm A) were discharged and followed up by telephone questionnaires over 12 months. Those with elevated d-dimer levels, Pa(O2) < 80 mm Hg, or one or more risk factors (study arm B) were managed as per hospital guidelines. Outcome data were collected on these patients. Our primary outcome was incidence of PE in group A during the first 3-month follow-up period.

Results

Three hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled, of whom 149 were assigned to group A and 179 were assigned to group B. In none of the group A patients was PE diagnosed over the subsequent 3-month period (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0 to 2.1%). PE was diagnosed in 37 group A patients (21%).

Conclusions

The latex-enhanced immunoassay d-dimer and normal arterial oxygen pressure levels can safely exclude PE in a low-risk population presenting to an acute care setting. While these results cannot be extrapolated to all patients with suspected PE, they do confirm the safety of this approach in a population with a low underlying risk of PE.

### D-dimer for venous thromboembolism diagnosis: 20 years later [^50c931a8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Twenty years after its first use in the diagnostic workup of suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE), fibrin D-dimer (DD) testing has gained wide acceptance for ruling out this disease. The test is particularly useful in the outpatient population referred to the emergency department because of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), in which the ruling out capacity concerns every third patient clinically suspected of having the disease. This usefulness is based on the high sensitivity of the test to the presence of VTE, at least for some assays. Due to its poor specificity precluding its use for ruling in VTE, DD testing must be integrated in comprehensive, sequential diagnostic strategies that include clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques such as lower limb venous compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or multi-slice helical computed tomography for suspected PE. The present narrative review updates the data available on the use of the various commercially available DD assays in the diagnostic approach of clinically suspected VTE in distinct patient populations or situations, including outpatients and inpatients, patients with cancer, older age, pregnancy, a suspected recurrent event, limited thrombus burden, and patients already on anticoagulant treatment.

### Diagnosis of venous thromboembolism-clinical practice guideline… [^4ee4740e]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The guideline on Diagnosis of Venous Thromboembolism was developed by the American Society of Hematology and was endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians. Pulmonary Embolism For individuals with a low or intermediate pretest probability or prevalence, clinicians should use a D-dimer strategy to rule out PE followed by VQ scan or CTPA in patients requiring additional testing. D-dimer testing alone should. not be used to rule in a PE. For individuals with a high pretest probability or prevalence, clinicians should start with CTPA to diagnose PE. If CTPA is not available, a VQ scan be used with appropriate follow up testing. D-dimer testing alone should not be used to diagnose PE and should not be used as a subsequent test after CT scan in individuals with a high pretest probability/prevalence. For individuals who have a positive D-dimer or likely pretest probability, a CTPA should be performed.

D-dimer testing can be used to exclude recurrent PE in individuals with unlikely pretest probability. Use of an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in outpatients older than 50 years is safe and improves diagnostic yield. Age-adjusted cutoff = Age x 10 µg/L. Lower Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis For individuals with a low pretest probability or prevalence, clinicians should use a D-dimer strategy to rule out DVT followed by proximal lower extremity ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound in patients requiring additional testing. For individuals with low pretest probability or prevalence, positive D-dimer alone should. Upper Extremity DVT For individuals with low prevalence/unlikely pretest probability, D-dimer testing should be used to exclude upper extremity DVT, followed by duplex ultrasound if positive.

For individuals with high prevalence/likely pretest probability, either D-dimer testing followed by duplex ultrasound/serial duplex ultrasound, or duplex ultrasound/serial duplex ultrasound alone can be used for assessing patients suspected of having upper extremity DVT. A positive D-dimer alone should not be used to diagnose upper extremity DVT. See the full recommendation for more information.

### Diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism: a prediction model based on a patient data meta-analysis [^f940cd3c]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The diagnostic management of pulmonary embolism (PE) is a challenge faced by physicians in emergency rooms, outpatient clinics, and hospital wards, because signs and symptoms of PE are non-specific. The threshold to refer patients for (further) testing is usually low, since the consequences of a missed PE diagnosis can be serious and potentially fatal. PE can be confirmed or ruled out with sensitive and specific imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scanning.

The use of a diagnostic algorithm based on a clinical decision rule, consisting of medical history and physical examination findings, combined with D-dimer testing is recommended in patients with clinically suspected PE to exclude the disease and thereby reduce the need for CT scans. This is important since imaging results in radiation exposure, risk of contrast reactions or nephropathy, increased healthcare utilization and costs, overdiagnosis of small clots with uncertain relevance, and potential shortage of iodinated contrast material. In patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability and a D-dimer below a fixed or variable threshold, PE is considered excluded and imaging can be safely withheld. Nonetheless, up to 50% to 70% of patients with suspected PE with non-low clinical probability and elevated D-dimer levels are referred for imaging, and PE is not diagnosed in about 70% of those. Moreover, there are concerns about the generalizability of these algorithms given the differences in case-mix and PE prevalence across healthcare settings.

Thus far, the development of PE diagnostic scores has focused on simplicity, allowing the scores to be calculated at the bedside to rapidly decide which patients should be referred for D-dimer testing or directly for imaging. These scores are based on simple multivariable logistic regression models in which continuous variables were often categorized and potential interaction was ignored. Derivation of most PE diagnostic models also did not follow state-of-the-art methodological principles currently recommended including use of multiple imputation and internal-external validation. Finally, several diagnostic PE models include a subjective 'Gestalt' variable to indicate whether 'PE is the most likely diagnosis', which is difficult to standardize as it may vary depending on physician experience.

An alternative approach to the diagnostic management of suspected acute PE is to use a model which calculates an absolute PE probability for each patient, allowing the physician to make individualized management decisions, i.e. deciding whether imaging is required. Using a large individual patient dataset (IPD), we sought to derive and validate such a diagnostic model including objective clinical items and quantitative D-dimer testing.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and Management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute venous thromboembolic disease [^36a4dd30]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds — nonhigh-risk adult patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) — are commonly based on the patient's age in years (age×10 μg/L) for patients older than 50 years, with most studies using high-sensitivity assays that generally use a conventional cutoff of FEU at 500 μg/L; one study using the HemosIL assay reported results in DDU and used age×5 μg/L. Nonhigh risk refers to a low or intermediate pretest probability or "PE unlikely" using a validated clinical prediction rule, and age-dependent increases in D-dimer reduce specificity with a fixed cutoff in the elderly, leading to unnecessary imaging.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^031b38e7]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (adult), low pretest probability — For low PTP/prevalence (≤ 5%), the American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline panel recommends using a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding PE in a population with low prevalence/PTP (≤ 5%), followed by ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan or computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for patients requiring additional testing. If D-dimer is not readily available, alternate acceptable strategies include performing VQ scan or CTPA alone. The document specifies a strong recommendation for D-dimer and a conditional recommendation for VQ scan or CTPA alone. Remarks state that for patients presenting to an emergency department with a low probability of PE, the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) may be used to determine whether D-dimer testing is warranted, that validated clinical decision rules were used and the Geneva score has been validated on an outpatient population, that if a 2-level clinical decision rule is used this corresponds to the "unlikely PE" category, that a decision to start with D-dimer assumes timely results and cost offset by avoiding unnecessary VQ or CTPA, and that if the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required.
