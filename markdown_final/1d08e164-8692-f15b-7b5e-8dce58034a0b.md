## Question

Interstitial cystitis diagnostic criteria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic criteria for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical definition and symptom duration thresholds. Then, I should verify the principle of exclusion and the minimum diagnostic workup. Next, I will examine when cystoscopy and urodynamics are indicated and what findings matter. After that, I need to check the role and limitations of the NIDDK research criteria. Finally, I will consider phenotyping, special populations, and how to monitor and reassess if treatment fails, making sure I anchor each step to current guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical definition so I don't jump to conclusions. IC/BPS is defined as an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the bladder, accompanied by lower urinary tract symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and nocturia, persisting beyond a minimum duration and in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes, which aligns with the AUA 2022 guideline and the SUFU definition adopted by the panel [^455b8276] [^a3297e5d].

> Wait, let me verify the duration threshold because different sources cite different windows. The AUA 2022 guideline uses a minimum of 6 weeks of symptoms to allow timely treatment, whereas ESSIC historically used 6 months; a recent pragmatic consensus proposes 3 months to balance sensitivity and timeliness, so I should note this range and specify which guideline I'm applying in a given context [^455b8276] [^c2eebc95] [^3f6203b1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis without emphasizing exclusion. IC/BPS remains a diagnosis of exclusion; I need to ensure we actively rule out mimics such as UTI, STIs, stones, malignancy, radiation cystitis, neurogenic bladder, and gynecologic pathology, and this principle is consistently emphasized across AUA, EAU, and RCOG guidance as well as contemporary reviews [^a3297e5d] [^26a12122] [^83aa4d4e] [^3f6203b1].

> I should double-check the minimum diagnostic workup so I don't overtest. The basic assessment includes a careful history characterizing pain, voiding symptoms, and associated features; a focused physical exam including abdominal, pelvic, and pelvic floor assessment; and urinalysis with culture when indicated to exclude infection, with hematuria workup as appropriate; this is a Clinical Principle in AUA 2022 and echoed in RCOG guidance [^a3297e5d] [^aabc4339] [^16528968].

> Next, I should review when invasive testing is actually indicated, because overuse of cystoscopy can mislead. Cystoscopy and/or urodynamics are not necessary for uncomplicated presentations; they should be considered when the diagnosis is uncertain, when malignancy or other pathology must be excluded, or when findings will change management, with cystoscopy particularly indicated when Hunner lesions are suspected; this is Expert Opinion in AUA 2022 and aligns with EAU emphasis on cystoscopy to exclude other diseases and classify subtypes when needed [^ad8624e5] [^abff2583] [^43eb9b9b].

> Let me think about what cystoscopy can and cannot tell us, so I don't overinterpret findings. Glomerulations are common but nonspecific and can be seen in asymptomatic individuals or other bladder conditions, so they are not diagnostic for IC/BPS; the only consistent pathognomonic finding is Hunner lesions, which are inflammatory ulcerations that, when present, support an ulcerative subtype and may guide therapy; this distinction is repeatedly emphasized in AUA 2022 and supported by reviews questioning glomerulations as a marker [^ad8624e5] [^c1ff69bc].

> I need to check the role of urodynamics and avoid overcalling sensory findings. Urodynamics may reveal sensory urgency at low volumes or detrusor overactivity in a minority, but these are not specific for IC/BPS; urodynamics is reasonable when outlet obstruction, poor detrusor function, or refractory symptoms are suspected, recognizing that DO can coexist with IC/BPS and should be managed accordingly [^1cd19a97] [^c25aa30a].

> But wait, what about the NIDDK criteria that some clinicians still reference. I should confirm that the NIDDK inclusion/exclusion criteria were designed for research and are too restrictive for clinical diagnosis; indeed, strict application would miss a large proportion of true cases, so they should not be used as clinical diagnostic criteria, though they remain useful for research comparability [^f9f0d871] [^98d24f97].

> Next, I should review phenotyping because it influences prognosis and treatment selection. Contemporary frameworks describe bladder-centric phenotypes such as Hunner lesions or small capacity, pelvic floor phenotypes with myofascial pain, and systemic phenotypes with widespread pain and central sensitization features; recognizing these phenotypes can guide targeted therapies and set expectations, and this is supported by AUA 2022 and MAPP-era literature [^6b94943b] [^3e5f1583].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In men, IC/BPS overlaps with CP/CPPS; the key differentiator is bladder-focused pain and symptoms of painful filling or painful urgency, and men who fail standard CP/CPPS therapy should be reassessed for IC/BPS; in adolescents, diagnosis relies on history, voiding diaries, and exclusion of other causes, with invasive tests reserved for select cases due to feasibility and limited evidence [^5336c7f6] [^36c040df] [^e6fac25e].

> I should confirm how to monitor and when to reconsider the diagnosis. Baseline symptom scores such as O'Leary-Sant or PUF can track response, and ineffective treatments should be discontinued; if multiple appropriate therapies fail, the diagnosis should be revisited and alternative etiologies pursued, ideally using a multidisciplinary approach and validated instruments for follow-up [^8c92295a] [^97dfe383] [^7023acf7] [^6e015f40].

> Putting this together, my diagnostic algorithm is as follows: establish a symptom-based diagnosis with bladder-related pain/pressure/discomfort plus LUTS for at least 6 weeks (AUA) or 3 months (pragmatic consensus), exclude confusable diseases with history, exam, and urinalysis/culture, avoid routine cystoscopy or urodynamics in straightforward cases, reserve cystoscopy for diagnostic uncertainty or suspected Hunner lesions, and phenotype when it will guide therapy; I should explicitly document the exclusion process and counsel that IC/BPS is a chronic pain syndrome with heterogeneous phenotypes and no single curative therapy, aligning with current guideline-based care [^455b8276] [^3f6203b1] [^ad8624e5] [^6b94943b].

---

Interstitial cystitis (IC), also called bladder pain syndrome (BPS), is diagnosed clinically as **chronic bladder pain with urinary frequency/urgency** [^455b8276] for ≥ 6 weeks [^a3297e5d], after excluding infection and other identifiable causes [^a3297e5d]. No single test confirms IC/BPS; diagnosis relies on **history, exam, and urinalysis** [^a3297e5d], with cystoscopy reserved for atypical or refractory cases to exclude mimics or identify Hunner lesions [^ad8624e5] [^b3b8b75c]. The NIDDK research criteria are not for routine clinical use [^f9f0d871] [^98d24f97]. Validated symptom scales (e.g. O'Leary-Sant) help track severity and response [^70611f6d] [^6e015f40].

---

## Core diagnostic criteria

The **AUA 2022 guideline** defines IC/BPS as an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the bladder, with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than 6 weeks' duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes [^455b8276] [^a3297e5d]. This definition emphasizes:

- **Chronicity**: Symptoms persisting for at least 6 weeks [^a3297e5d].
- **Bladder-related pain**: Pain worsens with bladder filling and improves with emptying [^b2853cc6].
- **Exclusion of other causes**: No infection, malignancy, or other identifiable pathology [^a3297e5d].

---

## Essential diagnostic steps

### Clinical history and physical examination

A thorough history and physical examination are foundational [^a3297e5d]. Key elements include:

- **Pain characteristics**: Location, intensity, triggers (e.g. foods, stress), relation to bladder filling/emptying [^b2853cc6].
- **Urinary symptoms**: Frequency, urgency, nocturia, dysuria, hesitancy, incomplete emptying [^b2ee1196].
- **Associated symptoms**: Dyspareunia, pelvic floor dysfunction, anxiety/depression [^aabc4339].
- **Physical exam**: Abdominal, pelvic, and focused neurologic exams; assess pelvic floor tone and tenderness [^aabc4339].

---

### Laboratory evaluation

Basic laboratory tests are essential to exclude other conditions:

- **Urinalysis and urine culture**: Rule out infection, hematuria, and other abnormalities [^aabc4339].
- **Cytology**: Consider if hematuria or malignancy is suspected [^notfound].
- **STI screening**: As indicated by history and risk factors [^notfound].

---

### Exclusion of confusable diseases

IC/BPS is a diagnosis of exclusion; clinicians must rule out:

- **Infectious**: Bacterial cystitis, urethritis, prostatitis, STIs [^26a12122].
- **Inflammatory**: Radiation cystitis, chemical cystitis, tuberculous cystitis [^7b6a3039].
- **Neoplastic**: Bladder carcinoma, carcinoma in situ [^26a12122].
- **Functional**: Outflow obstruction, neurogenic bladder, overactive bladder [^26a12122].
- **Gynecologic**: Endometriosis, vulvodynia, pelvic floor dysfunction [^3f6203b1].

---

## Role of cystoscopy and biopsy

Cystoscopy is not required for routine diagnosis but is indicated when:

- **Diagnosis is uncertain**: Atypical presentation or refractory symptoms [^ad8624e5].
- **Exclude mimics**: Suspected malignancy, stones, diverticula, or other pathology [^ad8624e5].
- **Identify Hunner lesions**: Inflammatory ulcers characteristic of a subset of IC/BPS [^ad8624e5].

Cystoscopic findings may include **Hunner lesions** (pathognomonic but uncommon) [^ad8624e5] or **glomerulations** (nonspecific and not diagnostic) [^c1ff69bc]. Biopsy can help exclude malignancy or other pathology but is not routinely required [^98d24f97].

---

## Limitations of current diagnostic criteria

- **Lack of objective markers**: No definitive biomarkers or tests confirm IC/BPS [^34c995d7].
- **Heterogeneity**: Patients present with diverse symptoms, complicating standardization [^f9f0d871].
- **Overlap with other conditions**: Symptoms overlap with overactive bladder, endometriosis, and chronic pelvic pain syndromes [^8185c5c7].
- **NIDDK criteria**: Designed for research, too restrictive for clinical use, excluding many true cases [^f9f0d871] [^98d24f97].

---

## Emerging diagnostic approaches

Research is exploring novel diagnostic tools, including **biomarkers** (e.g. antiproliferative factor, cytokines) [^notfound] and **advanced imaging** (e.g. functional MRI) [^6b94943b], but these remain investigational and are not yet validated for routine clinical use [^3477b03f].

---

## Summary of diagnostic criteria

| **Diagnostic step** | **Role in ic/bps diagnosis** |
|-|-|
| Clinical history and exam | Essential; document symptoms and exclude other causes |
| Urinalysis and culture | Essential; exclude infection and other abnormalities |
| Cystoscopy | Not routine; use when diagnosis is uncertain or to exclude mimics |
| Biopsy | Optional; exclude malignancy or other pathology |
| Symptom scales | Useful for tracking severity and treatment response |

## References

### AUA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^2ae63704]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE® database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Insufficient evidence-based data were retrieved regarding diagnosis and, therefore, this portion of the Guideline is based on Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion statements. The review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the majority of the treatment portion of the Guideline. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate) or C (low). Additional treatment information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion when insufficient evidence existed. See text and algorithm for definitions, and detailed diagnostic management, and treatment frameworks.

Results

The evidence-based guideline statements are provided for diagnosis and overall management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome as well as for various treatments. The panel identified first through sixth line treatments as well as developed guideline statements on treatments that should not be offered.

Conclusions

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is best identified and managed through use of a logical algorithm such as is presented in this Guideline. In the algorithm the panel identifies an overall management strategy for the interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patient. Diagnosis and treatment methodologies can be expected to change as the evidence base grows in the future.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: AUA guideline amendment [^664965e8]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this amendment is to provide an updated clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome based upon data received since the publication of original guideline in 2011.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature review using the MEDLINE(®) database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of IC/BPS. This initial review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. The AUA update literature review process, in which an additional systematic review is conducted periodically to maintain guideline currency with newly published relevant literature, was conducted in July 2013. This review identified an additional 31 articles, which were added to the evidence base of this Guideline.

Results

Newly incorporated literature describing the treatment of IC/BPS was integrated into the Guideline with additional treatment information provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence existed. The diagnostic portion of the Guideline remains unchanged from the original publication and is still based on Expert Opinions and Clinical Principles.

Conclusions

The management of IC/BPS continues to evolve as can be seen by an expanding literature on the topic. This document constitutes a clinical strategy and is not intended to be interpreted rigidly. The most effective approach for a particular patient is best determined by the individual clinician and patient. As the science relevant to IC/BPS evolves and improves, the strategies presented will require amendment to remain consistent with the highest standards of care.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (IC / BPS) diagnosis: current limitations and a pragmatic clinical diagnostic definition [^3f6203b1]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop a consensus on diagnostic criteria for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS).

Materials and Methods

A subcommittee was identified based on expertise in IC/BPS diagnostic criteria. An outline was generated and iteratively modified until it was found to be acceptable by subcommittee members as the basis for manuscript generation. The manuscript was presented and revised in two iterations according to feedback from international key opinion leaders at the Global Consensus on IC/BPS and the AUA Annual Meeting, respectively.

Results

The patient history and physical examination are necessary components in the diagnosis of IC/BPS. Urinalysis and urine culture are necessary laboratory tests to rule out exclusionary conditions including active infection. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) criteria, which were established in 1988 for research purposes, pose several limitations and result in the exclusion of a large proportion of IC/BPS patients when applied clinically. Thus, we put forth a pragmatic and streamlined definition that is aligned with existing clinical guidance and standard diagnostic workup.

Conclusions

The clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS is based on history, physical examination, and urine studies. IC/BPS is clinically defined as an unpleasant sensation (e.g. pain, discomfort, pressure, burning) that worsens with bladder filling and improves with bladder emptying, of 3 or more months duration, in the absence of exclusionary diagnoses that would likely account for the symptomatology. A substantial number of IC/BPS patients have comorbid pelvic disorders (e.g., pelvic floor dysfunction, vulvodynia, endometriosis) which require separate treatment.

Trial Registration

This study is not a clinical trial and thus does not warrant registration as such.

### Interstitial cystitis: current issues and controversies in diagnosis [^adfdbafb]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Current tests for the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (IC) are reviewed, including clinical assessment, urodynamic testing, cystoscopy, bladder biopsy, and urinary markers. A MEDLINE search was performed of all studies dealing with the diagnosis of IC. These studies were critically reviewed with the goal of arriving at a utilitarian approach to IC diagnosis. IC is being diagnosed with increasing frequency. However, the diagnostic criteria are nonuniform and there is significant overlap between chronic pelvic pain syndromes in men and women and IC. Diagnosis of IC can be made clinically and by cystoscopy and hydrodistention. The sensitivity and specificity of urinary markers have not been prospectively studied. Individual practitioners continue to use the various diagnostic tests. There is a clear need for uniform diagnostic criteria for clinical diagnosis as well as epidemiologic and research studies.

### Interstitial cystitis: an update [^3477b03f]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Interstitial cystitis is a chronically progressive, severely debilitating, heterogeneous syndrome affecting the urinary bladder, mainly associated with urgency, frequency and pain. Though known for over a century, its etiology is poorly understood and universally effective treatments are lacking. This review focuses on recently published literature on the disorder.

Recent Findings

Appropriate diagnostic tests for interstitial cystitis remain uncertain. The diagnostic criteria developed by the US National Institutes of Health represent research definitions which are subject to controversial debate for their overenthusiastic clinical application. The diagnosis is made clinically and by cystoscopy with hydrodistention and sometimes biopsy when other pathologies have been excluded. In symptomatic patients, glomerulations upon bladder distension are indicative but not pathognomonic for nonulcerative interstitial cystitis. Patients with ulcerative disease represent a separate subgroup with distinct characteristics and treatment implications. The role of bladder permeability tests remains controversial. Promising noninvasive markers for interstitial cystitis have been described but are not yet clinically available. Validated symptom scores are appropriate to assist in diagnostics and to monitor disease course and treatment efficacy. Lately investigated hypotheses for causative factors include occult or resistant microorganisms, urothelial hyperpermeability, neurogenic or hormonal pathomechanisms, and mast cell activation. Increasing evidence for a genetic susceptibility is emerging.

Summary

Among the multitude of oral, intravesical, interventional and complementary treatments suggested few studies have high levels of evidence. Newly proposed agents must await further controlled studies. Treatment remains empiric until radical surgical procedures should ultimately be considered for severe refractory cases.

### Diagnostic criteria, classification, and nomenclature for painful bladder syndrome / interstitial cystitis: an ESSIC proposal [^b875bd07]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Because the term "interstitial cystitis" (IC) has different meanings in different centers and different parts of the world, the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis (ESSIC) has worked to create a consensus on definitions, diagnosis, and classification in an attempt to overcome the lack of international agreement on various aspects of IC.

Methods

ESSIC has discussed definitions, diagnostic criteria, and disease classification in four meetings and extended e-mail correspondence.

Results

It was agreed to name the disease bladder pain syndrome (BPS). BPS would be diagnosed on the basis of chronic pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder accompanied by at least one other urinary symptom such as persistent urge to void or urinary frequency. Confusable diseases as the cause of the symptoms must be excluded. Classification of BPS types might be performed according to findings at cystoscopy with hydrodistention and morphologic findings in bladder biopsies. The presence of other organ symptoms as well as cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and sexual symptoms, should be addressed.

Conclusions

The name IC has become misleading and is replaced by BPS. This name is in line with recent nomenclature recommendations by the European Association of Urology and is based on the axial structure of the International Association for the Study of Pain classification. To facilitate the change of the name, ESSIC agreed to include IC in the overall term (BPS/IC) during this transition period.

### Diagnosis and management of interstitial cystitis [^dd73c8e3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis is a diagnosis of exclusion. The definition has expanded over the years to encompass painful bladder syndrome. It is disease state that is often delayed in its diagnosis and difficult to manage. Treatment options include oral and intravesical therapies as well as both minor and major surgical options. Also, a patient can improve symptoms by following self-management recommendations that focus on both diet and stress management. Treatment options should be periodically evaluated with validated questionnaires to insure they are improving the patient's symptoms, and a multidisciplinary approach is best to manage the patient.

### Current diagnosis of interstitial cystitis: an evolving paradigm [^390dfee8]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Our approaches to the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (IC) are evolving as a result of recent advances in our knowledge of the disease. With increasing awareness of IC prevalence and presentation, clinicians are identifying cases of IC earlier in the disease process. A diagnosis of IC can now be established without applying each step of the traditional diagnostic paradigm, which was designed to identify "classic" cases of IC. In this article, we present an updated paradigm for the diagnosis of IC based on recent clinical data and consensus discussions conducted at the International Consultation on Interstitial Cystitis in Japan (ICICJ) and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)/Interstitial Cystitis Association (ICA) research symposium in 2003. The diagnosis is established on the basis of a thorough physical examination and the patient's history of urgency/frequency and/or pain in the absence of bacterial infection or malignancy. Use of a symptom questionnaire to capture and record the presence of all IC symptoms is helpful in establishing the diagnosis. In this evolving paradigm, all other diagnostic measures are optional. Evidence-based medicine does not require the use of either cystoscopy or urodynamics in a workup for IC.

### Variations in bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis (IC) definitions, pathogenesis, diagnostics and treatment: a systematic review and evaluation of national and international guidelines [^8303b675]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Interstitial cystitis (IC) and bladder pain syndrome (BPS) are challenging and encompassing hypersensitivity disorders of the lower urinary tract. A variety of national and international guidelines have been published including guidance on nomenclature, definitions, etiopathology, diagnostics and treatment. A lack of universally established clinical guidance is apparent. The aim of this review is to evaluate key guidelines on this area of practice, identify variations, compare their recommendations and grade them using AGREE II.

Methods

Literature searches were performed using the PUBMED and CINAHL database from January 1, 1983, to December 1, 2018, referring to the search strategy of AUA. Ten national and international guidelines were included into the analysis. We assessed the guidelines with the updated AGREE II.

Results

Symptoms congruent in all guidelines are: pain, pressure, discomfort and frequency, urgency and nocturia. Urinalysis is a prerequisite for diagnostics, cystoscopy for most and urodynamics not part of the routine assessment. Treatment options are recommended stepwise. The highest level of evidence and consensus was identified for oral therapies. Nine guidelines had an overall quality score ≥ 50% and three scored ≥ 70% (AUA, GG, RCOG).

Conclusions

The guidelines are congruent in symptom reporting, quite congruent in diagnostics and vary to a high degree on treatment recommendations. The complexity of BPS and emerging evidence indicate the need for regular updating of the guidelines and a wider consensus.

### Current controversies that adversely affect interstitial cystitis patients [^c8c42e1e]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis (IC) remains a diagnosis of exclusion, based on the symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and pelvic pain in the absence of other definable causes. Certain areas of controversy in the field of IC research have a significant adverse affect on patients. Many physicians still do not believe that IC exists, or else believe that it is a rare postmenopausal condition. This can cause significant delays in diagnosis and treatment. It is particularly problematic in children, whose symptoms are often diagnosed as "voiding dysfunction" and are thought to be self-limiting. It can also be problematic for men, who are often unsuccessfully treated for prostatitis over the course of many years, and for whom the diagnosis of IC is never entertained. In some cases, when no diagnosis is made, patients are left to live with severe, debilitating symptoms and have nowhere to turn for help. Resistance to treating severe nonmalignant pain with opioid medication further compounds this problem and has led to suicide in this patient population. The "gold standard" of cystoscopy with hydrodistention is now being questioned, and an overreliance on the potassium test, which has a high false-negative rate, may lead to significant underdiagnosis of IC. New urinary markers hold promise for both diagnostic as well as therapeutic potential, but are not yet commercially available. IC may be an organ-specific disease in some patients and a systemic condition in others. Many patients have multiple disorders and have no physician to manage their overall health. The Interstitial Cystitis Association believes that the best way to address these unresolved areas of knowledge is to: (1) educate patients on all available diagnostic and therapeutic options so that patients, with the help of their physicians, can make the best informed decisions possible, and (2) aggressively pursue all avenues of research, particularly epidemiology.

### Diagnostic criteria, classification, and nomenclature for painful bladder syndrome / interstitial cystitis: an ESSIC proposal [^7b6a3039]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "ESSIC diagnostic criteria for bladder pain syndrome" for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and chronic pelvic pain in women.

The ESSIC diagnostic criteria for bladder pain syndrome, also known as the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis (ESSIC) criteria, is a clinical calculator used in the diagnosis of bladder pain syndrome (BPS), a chronic bladder condition. This calculator is applicable to patients presenting with persistent or recurrent chronic pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, accompanied by at least one other urinary symptom such as persistent urge to void or frequency.

The clinical utility of the ESSIC diagnostic criteria lies in its ability to standardize the diagnosis of BPS, which can be challenging due to the variability of symptoms and lack of definitive diagnostic tests. It helps clinicians to differentiate BPS from other conditions with similar symptoms, such as urinary tract infections or overactive bladder syndrome.

Exclusion criteria for the use of the ESSIC diagnostic criteria include the presence of any other identifiable causes of the symptoms, such as active urinary tract infection, bladder stones, tumors, tuberculosis of the urinary tract, radiation cystitis, and specific neurological diseases.

The ESSIC diagnostic criteria for bladder pain syndrome integrate information from clinical symptoms, cystoscopy, and biopsy findings to identify and categorize the condition into specific types.

The evaluation process starts with the clinical symptoms that must be present for further assessment:

- Chronic pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort in the bladder area
- At least one other urinary symptom, such as a persistent urge to void or increased frequency
- Exclusion of alternative causes for these bladder symptoms

If any of these clinical criteria are not met, a diagnosis cannot proceed.

Once these clinical symptoms are confirmed, the next step is to analyze findings from cystoscopy and biopsy:

- **Cystoscopy findings may include**:
- Not done
- Normal
- Glomerulations, grade II or III
- Hunner's lesions

- **Biopsy findings might be**:
- Not done
- Normal
- Inconclusive
- Inflammatory infiltrates, granulation tissue, detrusor mastocytosis, or intra-fascicular fibrosis

The possible diagnostic results, based on combinations of these findings, are:

- If neither cystoscopy nor biopsy is performed, the result is "Bladder pain syndrome type XX".
- If cystoscopy is not done, but the biopsy is normal, inconclusive, or has specific abnormal findings, it results in "Bladder pain syndrome type XA", "XB", or "XC", respectively.
- **With normal cystoscopy findings, the types align similarly**: "1X" for no biopsy, "1A" for normal biopsy, "1B" for inconclusive biopsy, and "1C" for specific abnormalities.
- For cystoscopic findings of glomerulations (grade II or III), the types "2X", "2A", "2B", or "2C" are assigned following similar logic.
- The presence of Hunner's lesions leads to results of "3X", "3A", "3B", or "3C", depending on corresponding biopsy results.

This method meticulously categorizes bladder pain syndrome by ensuring clinical criteria are met and then using specific findings from cystoscopy and biopsy to assign a diagnostic type.

Diagnosis — the diagnostic approach notes that the diagnosis of IC/BPS can be challenging because patients present with a wide spectrum of symptoms, physical exam findings, and clinical test responses, causing significant misdiagnosis, underdiagnosis, and delayed diagnosis. Insufficient literature was identified to constitute an evidence base for diagnosis of IC/BPS in clinical practice, and the NIDDK diagnostic criteria are not appropriate for use outside of clinical trials. Therefore, this Diagnosis section is based on Clinical Principles or Expert Opinion with consensus achieved using a modified Delphi technique when differences of opinion emerged.

This definition "was selected because it allows treatment to begin after a relatively short symptomatic period", avoiding withholding associated with longer durations "(i.e., six months)", and "Definitions used in research or clinical trials should be avoided in clinical practice; many patients may be misdiagnosed or have delays in diagnosis and treatment if these criteria are employed".

### Status of international consensus on interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome / painful bladder syndrome: 2008 snapshot [^025e3799]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2009). Low credibility.

Over the last 6 years there have been ongoing efforts around the world to standardize nomenclature, definition, and evaluation of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome/painful bladder syndrome. The convergence this year of several new projects stimulated an effort to bring together thought leaders from around the world to give a snapshot of current thinking with regard to this disorder. The Society for Urodynamics and Female Urology brought together thought leaders from Europe, Asia, and the United States to Miami, and a broad, structured discussion ensued which is the subject of this report. The most appropriate name of the disease remains an area of contention. A final "definition" of BPS/IC did garner substantial agreement among participants: An unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than 6 weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes. It seems that the world is moving to a presumptive diagnosis based on history and physical examination, and relying on invasive procedures for more complex cases, although this is by no means a universal opinion, being more prevalent in the United States and Asia than in Europe. It is hoped that the conference proceedings can serve as a basis for future efforts to develop formal definitions, guidelines, and best practice policies to further advancement of the field.

### Evidence-based criteria for pain of interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome in women [^b2853cc6]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

No diagnostic physical signs, urologic findings, or laboratory tests are available for interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS). Its diagnosis is determined by symptoms and the exclusion of mimicking diseases. We hypothesized that certain pain characteristics are sensitive criteria for diagnosing IC/PBS.

Methods

In women with recent-onset IC/PBS recruited in 2004 to 2006 for the case-control study, "Events Preceding Interstitial Cystitis", we identified the locations of each patient's pain and in a nonleading way asked about the effects of 17 different experiences (criteria) on the pain. We identified a set of criteria that described the largest number of patients in the Events Preceding Interstitial Cystitis study. In a secondary analysis of another cohort recruited by others in 1993 to 1997, the Interstitial Cystitis Database, we determined the proportion of patients captured by these same criteria.

Results

In the Events Preceding Interstitial Cystitis study, pain that worsened with a certain food or drink and/or worsened with bladder filling and/or improved with urination was reported by 151 (97%) of 156 patients. These were the only three criteria that applied directly to the bladder. The same three criteria described the pain of 262 (97%) of 270 women in the Interstitial Cystitis Database who "definitely" had IC/PBS.

Conclusions

An hypothesis generated in one IC/PBS patient group and tested in another — pain that worsened with certain food or drink and/or worsened with bladder filling and/or improved with urination — was described by 97% of the patients with IC/PBS in each cohort. This triad might describe the pain of IC/PBS and contribute to a sensitive case definition. Estimating specificity awaits comparison with other diseases with similar symptoms.

Among adult US females, prevalence estimates ranged "from 2.7% to 6.53% (approximately 3.3 to 7.9 million US women age 18 or older)", and "Only 9.7% of women who met the definitions reported having been given an IC/BPS diagnosis". Using a modified case definition in men, prevalence estimates were "from 2.9% to 4.2% for IC/BPS" with CP/CPPS at "1.8%", overlap "approximately 17%", and authors noted that prevalence in men "approaches its prevalence in women" and "may be greatly under-diagnosed".

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis in adolescents [^e6fac25e]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis (IC), or painful bladder syndrome, is characterized by irritative voiding symptoms and can be a challenging problem that affects children and adolescents. Diagnosis and management in children and adolescents is challenging because of strict diagnostic criteria and the paucity of investigations focusing on this age group, which often can lead to delayed or missed diagnosis. Clinical features suggestive of IC include bladder pain, urgency, frequency, nocturia, and pressure. Symptoms may wax and wane and often are exacerbated by menstruation, intercourse, dietary triggers, and stress. Diagnosis can be made by history, physical exam findings such as suprapubic tenderness, voiding diaries, and exclusion of other etiologies. Some diagnostic tests such as the potassium sensitivity test and cystoscopy are invasive and often impractical in younger patients. Treatment of IC consists of a multimodal approach that should be tailored to the individual needs of the patient. Therapies for younger patients include oral medication, intravesical therapy, cystoscopy with hydrodistention, and conservative measures such as dietary modification. This review of the literature focuses on diagnosing IC in younger patients and on what treatment modalities are appropriate and effective for this age group.

### Interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome: appropriate diagnosis and management [^62df5d0e]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain in the absence of any other identifiable pathology. Initial identification of IC/PBS is challenging, as patients may have a range of symptoms that overlap with other disorders, including urinary tract infection (UTI). These patients may be treated empirically with antibiotics; however, many patients with such symptoms are actually culture negative and are later diagnosed with IC/PBS. This review describes the importance of recognizing the symptom overlap between IC/PBS and UTI and focuses on approaches to the diagnosis and management of IC/PBS. Physicians can improve patient care by considering IC/PBS early in the differential diagnosis.

### Development, validation and testing of an epidemiological case definition of interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome [^b11aae8e]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

No standard case definition exists for interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome for patient screening or epidemiological studies. As part of the RAND Interstitial Cystitis Epidemiology study, we developed a case definition for interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome with known sensitivity and specificity. We compared this definition with others used in interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome epidemiological studies.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the literature and performed a structured, expert panel process to arrive at an interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome case definition. We developed a questionnaire to assess interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome symptoms using this case definition and others used in the literature. We administered the questionnaire to 599 women with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, overactive bladder, endometriosis or vulvodynia. The sensitivity and specificity of each definition was calculated using physician assigned diagnoses as the reference standard.

Results

No single epidemiological definition had high sensitivity and high specificity. Thus, 2 definitions were developed. One had high sensitivity (81%) and low specificity (54%), and the other had the converse (48% sensitivity and 83% specificity). These values were comparable or superior to those of other epidemiological definitions used in interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome prevalence studies.

Conclusions

No single case definition of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome provides high sensitivity and high specificity to identify the condition. For prevalence studies of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome the best approach may be to use 2 definitions that would yield a prevalence range. The RAND Interstitial Cystitis Epidemiology interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome case definitions, developed through structured consensus and validation, can be used for this purpose.

### Does cystoscopy method affect the investigation of bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis? [^c2eebc95]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bladder pain is defined as suprapubic or retropubic pain, pressure, or discomfort, related to the bladder. It often increases with bladder filling and may persist or be relieved after voiding. When bladder pain presents with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency or nocturia, in the absence of identifiable pathology or causes, the diagnosis of bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is given. This is a chronic condition with much to unravel about its aetiology and prognosis. Many international societies have developed guidelines to aid clinicians in the management of this complex condition; however, international consensus for all aspects has not yet been reached. Symptoms of BPS must be present for a minimum of 6 weeks (American Urological Association) to 6 months (European Society for the Study of Bladder Pain Syndrome (ESSIC)) before a clinical diagnosis is made.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome patient phenotyping [^3e5f1583]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

In April of 2025, the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine hosted a Global Consensus meeting on IC/BPS in Winston-Salem, NC. The goal of this meeting was to establish global consensus regarding diagnostic criteria, phenotyping, treatment outcome assessment, and etiopathology in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Our sub-committee was tasked with developing a consensus document on patient phenotyping in IC/BPS.

Methods

Narrative review.

Results

Patients with IC/BPS populate broad groups that have been characterized as having a bladder-focused disease phenotype (bladder-centric), a widespread pain and symptoms phenotype (systemic), or by other variable phenotypes including those with myofascial pelvic pain. In this review, we discuss the published evidence supporting each of these patient phenotypic groups.

Conclusions

Future clinical trials and treatment development in IC/BPS should include patient phenotyping efforts with, at minimum, a focus on stratification into bladder-centric vs systemic and efforts to refine discriminative thresholds (cut-off points) that may influence differential treatment outcomes. It is important to continue to investigate the importance of patient phenotypes on treatment strategy selection, outcomes, and our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology for this disease spectrum.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1cd19a97]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) — urodynamic evaluation is characterized by the absence of agreed-upon diagnostic criteria, with bladder sensations during cystometric filling that may be normal or markedly abnormal and pain with filling (hypersensitivity) consistent with IC/BPS; most patients will have normal filling pressure and compliance. Detrusor overactivity (DO) is seen in approximately 12–20% of IC/BPS patients, and if the patient also meets the clinical definition criteria for IC/BPS, then it is reasonable to diagnose both conditions. Urodynamic evaluation may provide information regarding concomitant voiding dysfunction, and specific indications that urodynamic evaluation may be useful include suspicion of outlet obstruction in either sex, possibility of poor detrusor contractility, or other conditions that could explain why patients are ultimately refractory to first-line therapy; in general, however, urodynamics are not recommended for routine clinical use to establish an IC/BPS diagnosis.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: why a global patient registry is critically needed [^a854d08f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this article is to establish expert consensus on the rationale for, and components of, a global patient registry for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Our goal is to highlight what a comprehensive international patient registry can add to the growing body of IC/BPS-focused research and summarize the committee's rationale for inclusion or exclusion of certain patient and diagnostic characteristics to identify sub-groups of patients who will benefit from targeted therapy.

Materials and Methods

An expert working group was formed from members of the Global Consensus on IC/BPS meeting. The working group consisted of four Urologists and a Urogynaecologist, and held a series of meetings in 2025 to achieve consensus on the benefits, hurdles and practical aspects of developing a global registry for IC/BPS. Literature search of the PubMed database was also performed where relevant, and all members agreed on the final proposals.

Results

The framework for an IC/BPS global registry was developed inclusive of male and female patients ages 18 years and older, who have symptoms of pain, pressure or discomfort related to the bladder, along with lower urinary tract symptoms, that have persisted for 3 or more months, in the absence of confusable disorders. A comprehensive list of patient data points including demographic, history-related, and comorbid conditions was developed. Additionally, validated questionnaires were identified for inclusion that assess domains of pain, urinary symptoms and quality of life. Consensus was reached regarding collecting data on prior treatment, cystoscopy findings and biopsy results where applicable. Lastly, importance was placed on patient-reported questionnaire data that can be input longitudinally by patients to lessen the burden of data collection by providers. Technical, legal and financial aspects were addressed as potential barriers.

Conclusions

A global registry for IC/BPS would overcome the limitations of current regional registries by including large numbers of patients from varied geographical locations, allowing for more efficient recruitment of patients for clinical trials. Understanding epidemiological trends and global variation in practice would enable optimization of care and quality improvement worldwide.

Introduction

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is an enduring inflammatory ailment of the urinary bladder, distinguished by the presence of discomfort or pelvic pain upon bladder fullness, in tandem with lower urinary tract symptoms, including heightened frequency and urgency. Given the dearth of definitive objective indicators for IC/BPS diagnosis, the recognition of this condition primarily relies on symptomatic evaluation. Unfortunately, the lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for IC/BPS has given rise to significant heterogeneity in the outcomes of epidemiological investigations surrounding this ailment.

IC/BPS encompasses distinct subtypes, including both ulcerative and non-ulcerative variations, each potentially underpinned by differing pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical attributes. The diagnosis of IC/BPS hinges upon the presence of persistent pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort deemed to be associated with the bladder, in conjunction with a minimum of one additional urinary symptom, such as heightened urinary frequency or urgency. The categorization of BPS is informed by observations from cystoscopy and the morphological characteristics elucidated through bladder biopsy. At present, the identification of IC/BPS is primarily contingent upon the symptomatic profile presented by the patient and necessitates subsequent validation through invasive and costly procedures, namely cystoscopy and bladder biopsy. Cystoscopic scrutiny has unveiled that the majority of IC/BPS cases exhibit glomerulations within the bladder, with only a modest 5%~15% exhibiting Hunner's ulcers. However, it is imperative to acknowledge that glomerulation can also manifest in other bladder disorders, thereby diminishing its specificity. Such manifestations may occur in patients afflicted with bacterial cystitis, radiation cystitis, and even in those with an otherwise healthy bladder. Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and overactive bladder (OAB) represent clinical syndromes primarily delineated by the symptomatic narratives presented by patients. It is generally presumed that IC/BPS and OAB can be differentiated on the basis of patient-reported symptoms. For instance, urge incontinence is regarded as a rarity in IC/BPS, while bladder pain is seldom attributed to OAB. However, the linkage of urgency and urgency incontinence exclusively to OAB, and the association of frequency/nocturia and bladder pain solely with IC/BPS, are not always founded on a rational basis. Clinical investigations have furnished compelling evidence suggesting the potential for overlap between these two conditions. Pain is conventionally acknowledged as a distinctive hallmark of IC/BPS, while urgency and urge incontinence are the defining characteristics of OAB. Nevertheless, studies have demonstrated that this differentiation is not an unequivocal demarcation but rather emblematic of a continuum within the sphere of bladder hypersensitivity syndrome. Recent research has accentuated the presence of inflammatory biomarkers in both biopsied bladder tissues and urine specimens from patients grappling with overactive bladder (OAB), even in the absence of urinary tract infections. The process of diagnosis and the selection of appropriate therapeutic interventions are often complicated by the overlapping symptomatology witnessed in patients grappling with IC/BPS and OAB. Furthermore, a persistent inflammatory disposition emerges as a prevailing shared attribute among patients afflicting with both IC/BPS and OAB. Hence, reliance solely on clinical symptoms is an unreliable means to differentiate IC/BPS from OAB, occasionally necessitating invasive procedures such as cystoscopy or bladder biopsy to procure ailment-specific data for the patient. To circumvent the burdens of cost and the associated perils linked to invasive examinations, the development of non-invasive markers for IC/BPS diagnosis is imperative. Typically, the diagnosis and treatment of maladies are intricate processes that may not be achieved at an early stage, thereby underscoring the pressing demand for an objective and pertinent IC/BPS screening biomarker.

### Excluding confusable diseases in patients with presumptive diagnosis of interstitial cystitis: a large patient cohort study [^e2671794]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic pelvic pain or discomfort associated with the urinary bladder that severely affects the quality of life of patients. It is often accompanied by lower urinary tract symptoms, such as daytime frequency, nocturia, and urgency. During the diagnostic process, confusable diseases must be excluded as the cause of symptoms. IC is diagnosed based on the exclusion criteria. Exclusion diagnoses included malignancies and infections, including urinary tuberculosis.

There is no single optimal test for diagnosing IC. The most important test in the diagnostic process of IC is cystoscopy, to identify Hunner lesions. The classic description of Hunner lesion is "a reddened area with blood vessels radiating toward a central scar". However, the extent, location, and appearance of Hunner lesions vary from person to person, leading to no objective, standardized criteria for Hunner lesions. Therefore, correct cystoscopic detection of lesions is challenging, especially in medical institutions where patients with IC are not commonly encountered. Additionally, there is currently no universally recognized biomarker for diagnosing IC. Therefore, it is challenging to diagnose IC accurately. As a result, IC is often misdiagnosed as other diseases, such as malignancy, or overactive bladder.

To our knowledge, observational studies over a long period regarding the exclusion of confusable conditions are scarce. Here, we aimed to analyze the results of excluding confusable diseases in a patient population with presumptive IC experience over the last 15 years in actual clinical settings.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^26a12122]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and differential diagnosis in suspected interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) should prioritize exclusion of overlapping conditions, as disorders such as bacterial cystitis, urinary calculi, vaginitis, carcinoma in situ of the bladder, and chronic bacterial prostatitis must be systematically excluded, and the role of other tests has poor specificity for IC/BPS. Clinicians should weigh test risks and benefits; urodynamic evaluation can identify bladder outlet obstruction or detrusor overactivity, but sensory urgency at low bladder volumes with or without detrusor overactivity is not specific for IC/BPS. In general, additional tests should be undertaken only if findings will alter the treatment approach.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) guideline — systematic review methods: Literature searches of English-language MEDLINE spanned January 1, 1983 to July 22, 2009, with an American Urological Association (AUA) update in July 2013 identifying an additional 31 articles, and a 2022 update (search dates: 06/2013–01/2021) identifying 63 studies, 53 of which were added to the evidence base. The review eliminated preclinical, pediatric, commentary, and editorial reports and excluded studies using treatments not available in the US, herbal or supplement treatments, or outcomes collapsed across multiple interventions; mixed patient groups were retained only when more than 50% were IC/BPS patients. Because individual study sample sizes were small, single studies were not deemed sufficient for a Standard, Recommendation, or Option, but were used to support Clinical Principles.

### Interstitial cystitis: urgency and frequency syndrome… [^98d24f97]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS Interstitial cystitis is often underdiagnosed or improperly diagnosed. A presumptive diagnosis may be made by looking for appropriate clinical criteria. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases developed inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients who are being considered for interstitial cystitis research. 18 While the NIDDK criteria are useful for research, they are too restrictive to be used by physicians in diagnosing interstitial cystitis. Inclusion criteria would involve bladder pain, urinary urgency and frequency, bladder capacity of less than 350 mL and cystoscopic evidence of Hunner's ulcers. Strict application of the NIDDK criteria would have misdiagnosed more that 60 percent of patients who were diagnosed by researchers as definitely having or likely to have interstitial cystitis.
6.

19 Conditions that must be excluded to diagnose interstitial cystitis include bacteriuria, Chlamydia trachomatis infection, prostatitis, herpes simplex virus infection, neoplasia, neuropathic bladder dysfunction and gynecologic diseases such as vaginitis, urethral diverticulum, vulvar vestibulitis and endometriosis. Urodynamic studies are not specifically diagnostic of interstitial cystitis. Radiographic studies, such as intravenous pyelography or voiding cystourethrography, are seldom indicated in the evaluation of patients with suspected interstitial cystitis.
6. After the above evaluations are completed, confirmation of the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis depends on cystoscopic findings. Hydrodistention of the bladder is often performed during cystoscopy under general anesthesia. Hydrodistention consists of filling the bladder with saline solution or sterile water beyond its normal capacity.

On distention, pinpoint hemorrhages or fissures with bleeding, called glomerulations, may appear. Biopsies are indicated in patients with suspected interstitial cystitis to exclude specific bladder pathology such as carcinoma, dysplasia or tuberculosis; to confirm bladder wall inflammation; and to identify subgroups of patients, such as those with excessive mast cells or eosinophils. 11 Generally, cystoscopy and bladder biopsy are performed in ambulatory surgery settings. 6 The hydrodistention performed at the time of cystoscopy may be therapeutic. 6 This relief may last from several weeks to months. Figure 5 depicts the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis.

The committee recognizes limitations related to individual committee members' personal bias, the inherent lack of outcome reliability studies and the lack of a gold standard comparison for the various outcomes. The methodology did not employ a systematic review and rating of the evidence as required by GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology, but rather a comprehensive review and discussion of the literature based on expertise, experience and expert group consensus feedback. The role of cystoscopy, urodynamics, and pain mapping (considered by some as possible non‐PRO outcomes) has been addressed by the Diagnosis and Phenotype IC/BPS consensus meeting committees and have not been addressed by this PRO committee. The impact of trial design (inclusion/exclusion criteria) on research outcomes are also beyond the scope of this committee.

### Phenotype variability in interstitial cystitis clinical trial recruitment [^efb8b790]. Urogynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

There is a need to understand phenotype-specific therapies for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) at the clinical trial level to move beyond trial-and-error treatment approaches.

Objective

The objective of this study was to characterize IC/BPS clinical trials that incorporate patient phenotype into the eligibility criteria in accordance with the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines.

Study Design

Registered IC/BPS clinical trials were identified from ClinicalTrials.gov. Trials were included if they enrolled patients with IC/BPS and addressed pain-related outcomes. Trials were assessed for phenotype recognition and categorized by intervention type, funding source, and registration date relative to the AUA's 2015 IC/BPS guidelines for initial phenotype recognition.

Results

Out of 170 trials, 37 (21.8%) included phenotype stratification. The majority focused on bladder-centric presentations. Men were underrepresented in IC/BPS clinical trials. Phenotypic stratification was more frequently reported in industry-funded trials compared with those without industry support (40.5% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0031). Trials registered after the 2015 AUA guideline update showed greater phenotype inclusion, though this was not statistically significant (26.6% vs 15.8%). Therapeutic trials comprised the majority of trials. Stratification appeared more often in physical therapy and psychosocial trials at 40% and in drug studies at 34.3%. Intravesical instillation and injection trials showed lower rates at 19.6% and 13.0%, respectively.

Conclusions

Failure to incorporate IC/BPS phenotypes into trial design limits the ability to evaluate treatments within the context of real-world symptom variability. Bridging this methodological gap is essential to ensure that clinical research supports the development of more targeted and effective therapies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome: a review [^8185c5c7]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a chronic bladder disorder characterized by pelvic pain and irritative voiding symptoms. The symptoms of IC/PBS can overlap with such conditions as endometriosis, recurrent urinary tract infection, chronic pelvic pain, overactive bladder, and vulvodynia. The etiology of IC/PBS is likely multifactorial and may involve a defective urothelium, neurogenic upregulation, and mast cell activation. A thorough patient history and physical examination are critical in the differential diagnosis of IC/PBS. Frequent follow-up and patient education are important components of treatment once a condition is diagnosed. A multimodal approach to therapy can provide optimal relief for patients with IC/PBS.

### Comparison of cystoscopic and histological findings in patients with suspected interstitial cystitis [^ddcea57f]. The Journal of Urology (2000). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although the exact etiology of interstitial cystitis remains elusive, bladder inflammation appears to be common in many patients. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have established diagnostic criteria for interstitial cystitis based on the presence of irritative voiding symptoms in the absence of other identifiable pathology. Cystoscopic examination with hydrodistention performed in patients under anesthesia is part of the NIH diagnostic criteria. We determine if the severity of cystoscopic findings correlated with histological evidence of inflammation in patients with suspected interstitial cystitis.

Materials and Methods

A total of 69 patients who met NIH symptom criteria for interstitial cystitis and underwent cystoscopy, hydrodistention and bladder biopsy under anesthesia were reviewed. There were 2 investigators blinded to the histological data who independently reviewed operative reports. A urological pathologist blinded to the clinical data reviewed biopsies for inflammation severity. Cystoscopic and histological findings were then converted to a numeric scale. Numeric data were analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Results

Cystoscopic examination revealed no evidence of interstitial cystitis in 6 patients (9%), mild changes in 27 (39%), moderate changes in 23 (33%) and severe changes in 13 (19%). Histological examination revealed no inflammation in 21 patients (30%), mild inflammation in 28 (41%), moderate inflammation in 11 (16%) and severe inflammation in 9 (13%). Histological scores correlated poorly with total and scaled cystoscopic severity scores (r = 0.295 and 0.349, respectively).

Conclusions

Severity of cystoscopic findings observed during hydrodistention with anesthesia does not appear to correlate with the degree of inflammation identified histologically in patients with suspected interstitial cystitis.

### Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as intravesical therapy for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: a review [^694f756d]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

The purpose of this review is to update the current understanding of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and its role in the treatment of interstitial cystitis (IC).

Methods

A systematic review was conducted using the PRIMSA checklist to identify published articles involving intravesical DMSO for the treatment of IC.

Results

Thirteen cohort studies and three randomized-controlled trials were identified. Response rates relying on subjective measurement scores range from 61 to 95%. No increased efficacy was found with "cocktail" DMSO therapy. Great variation existed in diagnostic criteria, DMSO instillation protocols and response measurements.

Conclusions

The current evidence backing DMSO is a constellation of cohort studies and a single randomized-controlled trial versus placebo. The optimal dose, dwell time, type of IC most likely to respond to DMSO, definitions of success/failure and the number of treatments are not universally agreed upon. Improvements in study design, phenotyping patients based on symptoms, as well as the emergence of reliable biomarkers of the disease may better guide the use of DMSO in the future.

### Research methodology in acupuncture for managing interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: a scoping review [^dda502e5]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Guidelines from the Canadian Urological Association (CUA, 2016), the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (ESSIC, 2021), the European Association of Urology (EAU, 2023), the Asian 2020 Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the American Urological Association guideline (AUA, 2022) all define interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) as a condition characterized by chronic pelvic pain (usually suprapubic) and bladder‐related pressure or discomfort, accompanied by other urinary symptoms such as urgency and increased frequency. Additional signs described in the literature include nocturia, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunction, emotional or behavioral issues, and a higher prevalence in women.

Despite this general consensus, definitions vary across regions: North America favors "IC" with a bladder‐centric focus, Europe prefers "BPS" emphasizing pain and broader symptom‐based criteria, and some Asian countries use both terms but apply stricter diagnostic thresholds. These discrepancies pose challenges for global research collaboration, clinical trials, and patient management. Furthermore, some authors consider IC/BPS as synonymous, while others define it as a syndrome, disorder, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, or a symptom.

The unclear pathophysiology of IC/BPS complicates diagnosis and treatment, especially since IC and BPS often overlap but differ: IC involves chronic inflammation, while BPS typically does not. Diagnostic practices vary globally, with North America emphasizing cystoscopy and biopsy for IC, while other regions favor symptom‐based diagnosis and highlight the need for biomarkers to improve early management.

Still, a comprehensive therapeutic solution is needed, so the current approach focuses primarily on symptom relief, starting with conservative treatments, followed by medication and more invasive treatments such as hydrodistension and surgery. Please see Supporting Material for more detailed treatment strategies (S1).

IC/BPS is a challenging condition to treat, with limited effective options, prompting many patients to explore complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Complementary medicine is used alongside conventional treatments to enhance their effects, while alternative medicine replaces conventional treatments. Acupuncture and moxibustion, both practiced for over 3000 years, are among the most well‐known CAM treatments. The method is commonly practiced as a routine treatment in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, but since the late 1970s, these therapies have gained popularity in the United States and other Western countries.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome in men [^6ba71efd]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

In April 2025, the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine hosted a Global Consensus meeting on interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) in Winston-Salem, NC. The goal of this meeting was to establish attainable targets in phenotyping, diagnosis, and biomarkers for IC/BPS. Our subcommittee focused on developing a consensus document addressing IC/BPS in men.

Methods

Narrative review.

Results

Within this document, we discuss prevalence, clinical characteristics, evaluation/investigation, and treatment of IC/BPS in men. The is limited literature specifically addressing IC/BPS within the male population, as IC/BPS has traditionally been considered a disease of women. Thus, prevalence data varies widely. Diagnosis of IC/BPS in men is fraught with difficulty, as there is much overlap with other chronic pelvic pain syndrome, specifically chronic prostatitis. Key clinical features specific to IC/BPS are pain with bladder filling and relief with voiding. Painful ejaculation may be indicative of pelvic floor dysfunction. Physical exam, including extensive pelvic exam with analysis of pelvic floor tenderness, is critical in correct diagnosis. Ultrasound ± urodynamics may be used to rule out obstructive disease, and urinalysis ± culture must be used to rule out infection. There are no treatments specific to men with IC/BPS.

Conclusions

We have described the prevalence, clinical characteristics, evaluation, and treatment of IC/BPS in men. There is a significant need for more sex-specific research of IC/BPS with consideration for hormonal and anatomical factors that may differentiate the disease in men.

Clinical Trial Registration

No new data were generated for this manuscript; no clinical trial was conducted.

### Joint terminology report: terminology standardization for female bladder pain syndrome [^4e7bdde7]. Urogynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Female bladder pain syndrome (FBPS), previously known as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, is a life-altering and morbid condition that occurs primarily in female patients and can be variable in presentation. Given the absence of pathognomonic symptoms and sensitive diagnostic tests, significant symptomatic overlap with numerous other pelvic conditions (such as pelvic floor tension myalgia or endometriosis) occurring in women makes diagnosis of FBPS challenging. The frequent co-occurrence of FBPS with other pain conditions and functional somatic syndromes further complicates diagnosis and management. The challenges have limited the progress made in understanding the pathophysiology of the condition and improving approaches to treatment and prevention. Improvement in standardization of the terminology used to describe this unique condition is needed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the clinical care for affected patients. Given the variability in presentation and the differing definitions for the condition world-wide, the American Urogynecologic Society and the International Urogynecologic Association convened a joint writing group to standardize terminology around common signs and symptoms of the condition and to clarify the diagnosis as it pertains to female patients with the condition. After careful consideration of a broad range of available data and clinical experiences, consensus opinion recommended adopting the term "FBPS" instead of the misleading "interstitial cystitis" to describe a chronic, intermittent condition of at least 3 months' duration affecting women involving symptoms of pain or discomfort localized to the bladder, often with bladder filling, which are not attributed to other pathology. This term will allow clinicians, researchers, and learners alike to standardize their understanding of FBPS.

### Reinvestigation of patients with a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis: common things are sometimes common [^3f3aa785]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We tested the accuracy of the diagnosis and the value of each step of the diagnostic process in a group of patients undergoing reinvestigation of interstitial cystitis (IC).

Materials and Methods

A total of 61 patients with a provisional diagnosis of IC underwent systematic reinvestigation by a pathway involving a thorough history and physical examination, a rigorous search for urinary infection, frequency volume records, urodynamics and cystoscopy under general anesthesia. Abnormalities detected in the course of this pathway were treated before proceeding with further investigation.

Results

The diagnosis of IC was confirmed or considered possible in only 34 cases (55%). Common alternative diagnoses included recurrent urinary tract infections, detrusor overactivity and vaginal candidiasis. Of 5 male patients only 1 was confirmed to have IC. The original diagnosis was overturned by history and physical examination (including urine cultures) in 11 cases, by urodynamic investigation in 11 and by cystoscopy in 5.

Conclusions

While IC remains a diagnosis of exclusion, active exclusion of all possible causes of similar symptoms using a thorough investigative algorithm is imperative. Urodynamic investigation, together with a thorough history and physical examination, remains an important component of the diagnostic pathway.

### Using the international continence society's definition of painful bladder syndrome [^7f6efe12]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine what proportion of patients with recent-onset interstitial cystitis (IC)/painful bladder syndrome (PBS) met the International Continence Society (ICS) definition and how those who met the definition differed from those who did not.

Methods

We recruited women who had recent-onset IC/PBS for an ongoing case-control study to identify its risk factors and studied our first 138 eligible patients to identify those who met the ICS definition. We then compared those who met the definition with those who did not by variables acquired from interviews and medical records.

Results

The 138 participants had intensities of pain, urgency, frequency, and nocturia, as well as O'Leary-Sant Symptom Index scores, similar to those of previously reported patients with IC/PBS. Six percent of cystoscopies demonstrated Hunner's ulcers, and 89% of hydrodistensions under anesthesia revealed glomerulations. The most liberal interpretation of the ICS definition did not include 47 (34%) of our patients. Comparing these with the 91 (66%) who did meet the ICS criteria, we found that 96 of 97 clinical variables, including many generally thought to be characteristic of IC/PBS, were not significantly different between the two groups.

Conclusions

The ICS definition identified only 91 (66%) of the 138 patients whom study investigators and caregivers diagnosed as having IC/PBS. Furthermore, those who met the ICS definition did not differ in important ways from those who did not. These observations taken together suggest that the ICS definition may not be sufficiently sensitive. Minor modifications of the definition appeared to increase its sensitivity. Validation of a case definition (ie, assessing its sensitivity and specificity) would require testing it in patients with IC/PBS, as well as in patients with other diseases with similar symptoms.

### Efficiency of questionnaires used to screen for interstitial cystitis [^70611f6d]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Questionnaires for the evaluation of interstitial cystitis are widely used, but their value in discriminating interstitial cystitis from other diagnoses among patients with urological symptoms has not been determined. We assessed the validity of 2 frequently used interstitial cystitis questionnaires-the O'Leary-Sant Symptom Index and Problem Index and the Pain, Urgency, Frequency Symptom Scale-for screening for interstitial cystitis.

Materials and Methods

The Pain, Urgency, Frequency Symptom Scale and the O'Leary-Sant Symptom Index and Problem Index were administered to the same 220 patients at a urology clinic before diagnosis. Questionnaire scores between patients with and without interstitial cystitis, as well as among diagnostic groups, were compared by parametric and nonparametric analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to determine the efficiency of each questionnaire in discriminating between patients with and without interstitial cystitis.

Results

Interstitial cystitis was distinguishable from the other diagnoses using both questionnaires (p < 0.001). Separate analyses of bother and symptom scores yielded similar results. Receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated the Pain, Urgency, Frequency Symptom Scale to be more efficient than the O'Leary-Sant Symptom Index and Problem Index in detecting interstitial cystitis in this population with an optimal cutoff value of 13 or greater.

Conclusions

While the Pain, Urgency, Frequency Symptom Scale and the O'Leary-Sant Symptom Index and Problem Index questionnaires distinguish interstitial cystitis from other urinary tract pathologies, neither questionnaire demonstrates sufficient specificity to serve as the sole diagnostic indicator. These questionnaires should not be used to define interstitial cystitis, but can be used to screen patients with urinary tract symptoms to identify those who should be further examined for interstitial cystitis or to follow those who have already been diagnosed.

### The role of glomerulations in bladder pain syndrome: a review [^c1ff69bc]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

As a diagnostic marker for bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis, glomerulations were first popularized by Messing and Stamey in 1978. Later this was included in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases criteria for research and consequently used by many urologists as a default diagnostic criterion. Today the connection between glomerulations and bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis is much debated as research has found glomerulations in asymptomatic populations. In this review we systematically examine the available research to see if there are valid data to support the use of glomerulations as a marker for bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature search of the PubMed® database in March 2014 using the search term "Cystitis, Interstitial/diagnosis" [MAJR] OR (glomerulations OR glomerulation OR bladder petechiae) was performed, yielding 463 hits. An Embase® search using the search term "glomerulations" yielded 110 references, of which 68 were duplicates. Relevant articles were reviewed and included in the study. Bibliographies of reviews, articles and status reports were examined to find studies not included in the search. A total of 29 publications were included in this review.

Results

There is no consistent relationship between glomerulations and the diagnosis of bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis. In the reviewed studies we found evidence of the grade of glomerulations changing with time. Furthermore, many studies showed no link between the severity of symptoms and the number of glomerulations. There were studies that found glomerulations in healthy asymptomatic populations as well as in symptomatic populations with another primary diagnosis. One study showed no glomerulations in an asymptomatic population.

Conclusions

We found no convincing evidence in the reviewed literature that glomerulations should be included in the diagnosis or phenotyping of bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis. Glomerulations do not correlate with symptoms and are found in patients without bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis.

### The MAPP research network: design, patient characterization and operations [^a9f9060c]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) are defined by the hallmark symptom of chronic pain in the region of the pelvis, urogenital floor, or external genitalia, often accompanied by urinary symptoms, such as urinary urgency or frequency. The bladder has historically been thought to be the origin of IC/BPS symptoms; whereas the prostate gland has traditionally been believed to be the source of CP/CPPS symptoms. However, this viewpoint has come under recent challenge, in large part from the observation that many IC/BPS and CP/CPPS patients exhibiting symptoms do not have identifiable pathology in these organs.

The impact and burden of IC/BPS and CP/CPPS are substantial. Patients suffer considerable morbidity resulting in a significant decrease in quality of life for both the patient and his/her partner due to the physical and psychological impact of the condition. In fact, the quality of life of IC patients has been characterized as being worse than that of patients undergoing dialysis. In the U.S. the prevalence of IC/BPS symptoms has been estimated to be 2.7% in women; whereas the prevalence for analogous symptoms is estimated to be 1.3% in men. Prevalence estimates for CP/CPPS in men vary between 1.8–6.4%, depending upon case definitions and screening methods.

Traditionally, the diagnosis of IC required cystoscopy and pathological findings, although more typically IC/BPS is defined from patient reported symptoms, due to the lack of consistent pathological findings, defined disease phenotypes or biological markers. Similarly, patient symptoms are used to define CP/CPPS. Each of these separate syndromes, however, may in fact represent a group of related conditions that manifest in a similar manner, but have differing etiologies. Based primarily on their somewhat similar symptom profiles, IC/BPS and CP/CPPS are here collectively termed urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS) (see Table 1 for research definitions used in the MAPP Research Network). As noted in the only published phenotyping system, referred to as UPOINT, UCPPS patients have significant symptoms across the urinary, psychosocial, organ specific, infection, neurological/systemic and tenderness domains, confirming the heterogenous nature of these syndromes.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy of intravesical therapy for bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis [^b6aca5b7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present meta-analysis on intravesical BPS/IC therapy clearly demonstrates the dilemma of the poor scientific evidence currently available for this disease. Owing to the different associations regarding the aetiology of the disease and its rather low prevalence, most published studies cohorts are heterogeneous. The lack of globally accepted instruments for the evaluation of treatment success resulted in the exclusion of some trials from this meta-analytical review because the reported outcomes were not comparable.

Even after a careful selection of 19 studies, we still found a heterogeneous population of 801 patients (mostly women) who were considered to have BPS/IC according to four different diagnostic criteria and typified as "treatment-refractory" (a concept that is not further defined) in 6 studies or as "treatment-naïve" patients in 1 study. Differences in design are also of particular relevance as only 5 studies (26%) compared the intravesical formulas against placebo or non-active controls, while the remainder corresponded to uncontrolled and observational trials.

Length of treatment and frequency of instillations also differed: weekly instillations were initially performed in 15 studies, biweekly or twice weekly instillations were reported for 2 studies each, while the duration of instillation therapy varied from 6 weeks to 12 months. Similarly, the time period of follow-up for final evaluation varied from 3 months to 5 years.

All the instruments/scales used for outcome evaluation (O'Leary–Sant Score, the PUF and VAS for pain) can potentially measure treatment effects, but they are not readily comparable with each other. There is also no globally accepted definition as to the percentage of symptom regression that is regarded as treatment response. In addition, relatively small differences in VAS scores before and after treatment may be statistically but probably not clinically significant. With the intention to improve the balance between investigational and clinical outcomes, and to extract the maximal information from the selected set of evaluable studies on intravesical BPS/IC therapy, refined statistical techniques such as Cohen's d along with confidence intervals have been used in this meta-analytical review to be able to compare the selected set of evaluable studies.

### Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a promising non-invasive biomarker for symptom assessment and diagnosis of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^9ac54767]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials & methods

This cross-sectional investigation retrospectively examined the medical records of 70 adult females diagnosed with interstitial cystitis and 20 adult females diagnosed with overactive bladder at Peking University People's Hospital, spanning from January 2012 to October 2022. Additionally, data were obtained from a randomly selected cohort of 150 healthy women who underwent physical examinations during the same timeframe. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of Peking University People's Hospital (approval number: 2022PHB400-001). Inclusion criteria for patients with interstitial cystitis mandated compliance with the diagnostic criteria established by the American Urological Association. These criteria necessitated the presence of unpleasant sensations such as pain, pressure, or discomfort in the urinary bladder, coupled with lower urinary tract symptoms enduring for more than 6 weeks, while ruling out any discernible infections or underlying causes. Similarly, inclusion criteria for patients with overactive bladder necessitated adherence to the established diagnostic criteria. These criteria encompassed the presence of urgency, with or without urge urinary incontinence, typically accompanied by heightened daytime frequency and nocturia. Furthermore, participants undergoing cancer treatment, those with potential bladder organ lesions affecting bladder function, individuals with other severe medical conditions, and those identified with acute urinary tract infections through urinalysis were excluded from the study. All participants underwent standard blood, biochemical, and urine examinations, with examinations avoiding the menstrual period.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^6b94943b]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) conceptualization and phenotypes are described as a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that can be conceptualized as a bladder pain disorder often associated with voiding symptomatology and other systemic chronic pain disorders, and specifically may be part of a more generalized systemic disorder in a subset of patients. More comprehensive studies from the NIH-funded MAPP Research Network found that 44% of IC/BPS patients had at least one additional COPC, and patients displaying widespread pain showed multiple indications of central neurobiological pain sensitization correlated with quantitative sensory testing, functional MRI, and inflammatory markers. Considering these data, it has been suggested that IC/BPS is a member of a family of hypersensitivity disorders, and an additional hypothesis is that IC/BPS might be part of the continuum of painful versus non-painful overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). Subgroups or phenotypes include bladder-centric phenotypes such as Hunner lesions, small bladder capacity, and pain improved with intravesical local anesthetics, and patients with Hunner lesions should be treated differently from those without these lesions. Others have a pelvic-floor phenotype (e.g., pelvic floor tenderness on exam), and women with this feature respond better to pelvic floor manual physical therapy. A third group have more systemic or widespread symptoms characterized by the presence of "widespread pain" defined as significant non-urologic pain outside the pelvis.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) — patient symptoms: Pain (including sensations of pressure and discomfort) is the hallmark symptom, and using "pelvic pain" as the key descriptor captured 100% of one population. Voiding frequency is almost universal (92% of one population) and urinary urgency is also extremely common (84% of the same population), though urgency is a characteristic symptom of overactive bladder (OAB) and can confound diagnosis. Pain can worsen with bladder filling ("painful bladder filling") or present as a strong urge to urinate due to pain, pressure, or discomfort ("painful urgency"), and the median time to develop the full symptom complex of frequency, urgency, and pain was reported to be two years in one study.

Evidence strength determination and study quality — grading and assessment approach: The categorization of evidence strength is conceptually distinct from the quality of individual studies; AUA categorizes body of evidence strength as Grade A (well-conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or exceptionally strong observational studies), Grade B (RCTs with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability or generally strong observational studies), or Grade C (observational studies that are inconsistent, have small sample sizes, or have other problems that potentially confound interpretation of data). Quality of individual RCTs or crossover trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and because placebo effects are common, procedural deviations that could compromise randomization or blinding resulted in a rating of increased risk of bias; the quality of individual observational studies was not assessed. Because treatment data are difficult to interpret without placebo control, bodies of evidence entirely lacking placebo controls were assigned a strength rating of Grade C.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) initial evaluation — history, examination, and labs should be documented as follows: The number of voids per day, urge to void, and pain characteristics "should be documented", and dyspareunia, dysuria, ejaculatory pain, and menstrual relation "should also be noted". The physical examination "should include an abdominal and pelvic examination", pelvic floor muscles "should be palpated", and pelvic support "should be documented", with a focused evaluation to rule out alternative sources of pain or infection. A brief neurologic exam and assessment for incomplete bladder emptying "should be done on all patients". Basic laboratory evaluation "includes a urinalysis and urine culture", a hematuria workup "should be performed" for unevaluated hematuria and "considered" with tobacco exposure, and urine culture "may be indicated even in patients with a negative urinalysis".

Guideline Statement 3 — Cystoscopy and/or urodynamics should be considered when the diagnosis is in doubt; these tests are not necessary in uncomplicated presentations (Expert Opinion). Cystoscopy and urodynamic testing are appropriate when IC/BPS diagnosis is in doubt or when cystoscopy information is needed to guide therapy; cystoscopy is valuable to exclude mimics and to identify a Hunner lesion, and suspicion for bladder cancer, bladder stones, urethral diverticula, or intravesical foreign bodies is an indication for diagnostic cystoscopy. There are no agreed-upon cystoscopic findings diagnostic for IC/BPS; the only consistent finding leading to diagnosis is one or several inflammatory appearing lesions or ulcerations described by Hunner, and Hunner lesions are more common in patients of age over 50 years. When Hunner lesions are suspected, it is appropriate to proceed to cystoscopy to assess for their presence; glomerulations may be detected but are non-diagnostic and non-specific for IC/BPS, and lesion appearance can be acute or chronic.

Male IC/BPS versus chronic prostatitis — In men, clinical findings of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) mirror those of females, with suprapubic tenderness common along with external (perineal) and internal (levator muscle) tenderness/spasticity. Cystoscopy with hydraulic distention commonly demonstrates diffuse glomerulations, but the presence of glomerulations on endoscopy is too non-specific to make the diagnosis of IC/BPS, and Hunner lesions can be identified on cystoscopy in men with IC/BPS. For CP/CPPS (NIH Type III prostatitis), pain in the perineum, suprapubic region, testicles or tip of the penis is characteristic, the pain is often exacerbated by urination or ejaculation, and voiding symptoms such as incomplete emptying and urinary frequency are common, but pain is the primary defining characteristic. The Panel believes that the diagnosis of IC/BPS should be strongly considered in men with bladder-related pain or symptoms of "painful bladder filling" and/or "painful urgency", while recognizing that some men meet criteria for both IC/BPS and CP/CPPS.

### Does cystoscopy method affect the investigation of bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis? [^d7d25cbe]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The aetiology of BPS/IC is complex and heterogeneous, with mast cells (MCs) thought to play a role in the development and persistence of pain associated through a self-perpetuating cycle of MC activation and recruitment. The ESSIC recommends three bladder biopsies to be taken during cystoscopy and assessed for increased mast cell counts (MCCs) or MCs in the detrusor muscle. At present, only the ESSIC identifies MC infiltrates within the detrusor muscle as a diagnostic criterion for BPS/IC. There are otherwise no internationally recommended diagnostic histopathological findings for BPS/IC. A MCC > 28 MCs/mm² is considered to indicate significant mastocytosis. Other associated histological findings include: chronic inflammatory infiltrate, denuded epithelium, submucosal inflammation, granulation tissue, intrafascicular fibrosis and MC infiltration.

Mast cells play a role in both innate immunity and neuroinflammatory conditions. Urothelial damage or dysfunction causes release of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters that recruit and activate MCs. Increased permeability of the urothelium also allows an influx of potassium ions that in turn leads to sensory afferent nerve upregulation, tissue damage and MC activation. Activation of MCs through these stimuli leads to degranulation and release of vasoactive and inflammatory mediators that further promote inflammation, MC activation and fibrosis.

The finding of a raised MC may play a role in clinical phenotyping, as well as providing prognostic value, which can aid counselling of patients diagnosed with BPS/IC. A retrospective Danish study of BPS/IC patients by Richter et al. found that 53% of the study group had detrusor mastocytosis. Detrusor mastocytosis correlated with more frequent and advanced treatment, including pain clinic referral, high-dose steroids and surgery with cystoplasty or urinary diversion. Globally, there is varying emphasis placed on the role of cystoscopy and bladder biopsy in the diagnosis of BPS/IC, with Asia and Europe prioritising this investigation compared with North America.

The aim of this study was to identify if the cystoscopy approach has an impact on biopsy quality. We compared bladder biopsy results taken using closed-cup forceps using either a flexible cystoscope (FC) or rigid cystoscope (RC). A null hypothesis of no differences between the two biopsy types is proposed.

### Prevalence and incidence of interstitial cystitis in a managed care population [^1e3ebd48]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We calculated the prevalence and incidence of physician diagnosed interstitial cystitis (IC) in men and women in a managed care population in the Pacific Northwest.

Materials and Methods

A computer search of the Kaiser Permanente Northwest (Portland, Oregon) database was performed for January 1998 to May 2002. The prevalence of IC in patients 25 to 80 years old was calculated using the 4 definitions of 1) patients assigned a diagnosis of IC, 2) patients assigned a diagnosis of IC without any of the consensus IC exclusion criteria, 3) patients who had also had undergone cystoscopy and 4) patients who had specifically undergone cystoscopy with hydrodistention for IC. A second database search was performed 1 year later (May 2003) to identify incident cases of IC.

Results

The prevalence of IC was 197 per 100,000 women and 41 per 100,000 men for definition 1, 158 per 100,000 women and 28 per 100,000 men for definition 2, 99 per 100,000 women and 19 per 100,000 men for definition 3, and 45 per 100,000 women and 8 per 100,000 men for definition 4. Using definition 2 the 1-year incidence of IC was 21 per 100,000 women and 4 per 100,000 men. The female-to-male ratio for each estimate was 5:1.

Conclusions

The prevalence and incidence of interstitial cystitis is significantly higher for women and men than previously published estimates. Men account for a higher proportion of patients with IC than has previously been recognized.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^b0c51549]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Future research — Patients with IC/BPS constitute a previously under-recognized and underserved population in need of adequate medical management, and treating IC/BPS patients presents a significant challenge in clinical practice. Treatment approaches may be local (directed to the bladder) or systemic, range from behavioral to pharmacological, and may include many types of adjunctive therapy approaches intended to optimize quality of life. IC/BPS has been recognized as a chronic pain syndrome, the NIDDK has funded the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network, and a wide range of scientific discovery projects are being conducted at six Discovery Sites.

### Demographic differences and disparities in the misdiagnosis of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome in a national cohort of VA patients [^4ae2561e]. Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore association between misdiagnosis of IC/BPS and demographics. Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is associated with significant diagnostic uncertainty, resulting in frequent misdiagnosis as there is little known about the potential impact of key demographic factors.

Methods

All patients in the VA system between 1999–2016 were identified by ICD-9/10 codes for IC/BPS (595.1/N30.10) (n = 9,503). ICD code accuracy for true IC/BPS (by strict criteria) was assessed by in-depth chart abstraction (n = 2,400). Associations were explored between rates of misdiagnosis and demographics.

Results

IC/BPS criteria were met in only 651 (48.8%) of the 1,334 charts with an ICD code for IC/BPS reviewed in depth. There were no differences in the misdiagnosis rate by race (P = 0.27) or by ethnicity (P = 0.97), after adjusting for differences in age and gender. In IC/BPS-confirmed cases, female patients were diagnosed at a younger age than males (41.9 vs. 58.2 years, P < .001). Black and Hispanic patients were diagnosed at a younger age compared to White (41.9 vs. 50.2 years, P < .001) and non-Hispanic patients, respectively (41.1 vs. 49.1 years, P = 0.002).

Conclusion

There was a high rate of misdiagnosis of IC/BPS overall, with only 48.8% of patients with an ICD code for IC/BPS meeting diagnostic criteria. There were no significant associations between diagnostic accuracy and race/ethnicity. Black and Hispanic patients were more likely to receive a diagnosis of IC/BPS at a younger age, suggesting there may be differing natural histories or presentation patterns of IC/BPS between racial/ethnic groups.

### Current updates relating to treatment for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^a9727efc]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A constellation of incapacitating systems, which encompass discomfort in the suprapubic region, nocturia and micturition frequency and urgency, are characteristic of interstitial cystitis (IC), a condition also referred to as bladder pain syndrome (BPS). Typically, such symptoms occur when the bladder is full, and dissipate once urine has been passed. In addition to these symptoms, a major complaint of patients suffering from IC is pelvic pain, which originates from the urethra, vagina or rectum, amongst other viscera. There is at present no standard definition for this condition, nor consensus regarding its management, recommended therapy or the treatment period required.

A range of drugs directed towards the treatment of IC have been the topic of recent debate, although the largest percentage of patients cured of the condition remains in the region of 60%. It has been demonstrated that numerous factors are involved in the pathogenesis of IC. These include autoimmune phenomena, injury to the urothelial glycosaminoglycan layer, neurological discomfort and inflammatory processes.

Despite the publication of several meta-analyses as well as a network meta-analysis (NMA), these have not provided a comprehensive review of therapeutic strategies. The lack of clarity regarding the efficacy of certain therapies in helping individuals with IC, owing to the low or very low degrees of supportive evidence, was expressed in a recent Cochrane review. Although the results of numerous studies can be accessed, the majority only included small populations and so the outcomes of therapy could not be accurately evaluated. The same issue applied to a further NMA, and so the results were not apposite for the current work. Thus, studies with higher sample numbers and which are specifically targeted towards this condition are required to enhance the present quality of evidence. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been added by the current authors to the literature, and they have concurrently carried out a traditional pairwise meta-analysis and an NMA to offer more evidence-based conclusions.

There are numerous types of therapy available for IC, some of which are extremely complicated, and so as well as carrying out an NMA, a general meta-analysis by effect variables has also been performed. Additionally, meta-regression analysis was applied to ascertain the moderator effect. The study is underpinned by the hypothesis that a high level of therapeutic success can be achieved in patients with IC using a combination of approaches; this theory could subsequently be tested in RCTs.
