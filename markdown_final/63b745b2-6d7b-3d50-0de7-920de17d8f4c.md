## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about levofloxacin, including its identity, indications, dosing, safety, stewardship, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the drug identity and pharmacologic class. Then, I should verify labeled indications across formulations. Next, I will review dosing by indication and renal function, followed by a careful safety analysis with boxed warnings. After that, I need to check stewardship guidance and resistance considerations. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize a practical, risk–benefit framework for use.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and class so I don't misstate anything. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, the L-isomer of ofloxacin, with broad-spectrum activity and excellent oral bioavailability; it is available as oral tablets, IV solution, and ophthalmic drops, which I should keep in mind as I discuss indications and dosing by route [^5b4f45b3] [^080e9357] [^b52cfcb2].

> I will now examine labeled indications across formulations, and I need to ensure I separate oral/IV from ophthalmic uses. For systemic therapy, labeled indications include community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, uncomplicated and complicated skin and soft tissue infections, chronic bacterial prostatitis, complicated and uncomplicated UTIs including pyelonephritis, acute bacterial exacerbation of COPD, inhalational anthrax post-exposure prophylaxis, and plague; ophthalmic levofloxacin is indicated for corneal ulcer, which is distinct from systemic therapy and should not be conflated with ocular surface infections treated topically [^5b4f45b3] [^080e9357] [^b52cfcb2].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing by indication and be precise about durations and strengths. For CAP, HAP, and COPD exacerbations, typical adult dosing is 500–750 mg IV or PO once daily, with duration individualized; for SSTI, 500 mg daily for 7–10 days if uncomplicated and 750 mg daily for 7–14 days if complicated; for complicated UTI/pyelonephritis, 750 mg daily for 5 days; for uncomplicated cystitis, 250 mg daily for 3 days; for chronic bacterial prostatitis, 500 mg daily for 28 days; for anthrax PEP, 500 mg daily for 60 days; for plague, 500 mg daily for 10–14 days; for corneal ulcer, ophthalmic drops are administered frequently with a taper per ophthalmic protocol, which is not interchangeable with systemic dosing [^7c3de12e] [^ad6cee21] [^ef02b5b0].

> Wait, let me verify renal dosing because this is easy to misstate. For eGFR 20–50 mL/min, reduce to 250–500 mg then 125–250 mg every 12–24 hours; for eGFR 10–20 mL/min, reduce to 250–500 mg then 125 mg every 24–48 hours; for eGFR < 10 mL/min or intermittent hemodialysis, reduce to 250–500 mg then 125 mg every 24–48 hours; for peritoneal dialysis, the same reduced regimen applies, and I should double-check that these adjustments align with both oral and IV labeling, which they do [^18da65cc] [^dad56297] [^bceab782] [^0c425efd] [^79ee12f9] [^28940227] [^aad24be2] [^d0ff1821] [^0ca9270e] [^ad476398].

> I need to ensure I capture the boxed warnings and major safety signals accurately. The FDA boxed warning highlights tendon rupture and tendinitis, peripheral neuropathy, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis; risk is higher in older adults, those on corticosteroids, and transplant recipients; tendon rupture can occur during therapy or months after completion, so patients should stop immediately with tendon pain or swelling and avoid exercise on the affected limb; additional warnings include CNS effects such as seizures, psychosis, and suicidality, prolonged QT interval, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, C. difficile–associated diarrhea, and photosensitivity; I should confirm that these are consistent across oral and IV labeling, which they are [^60dc67db] [^b875b144] [^7ebb0e70] [^df59774f] [^a4811ce0].

> Let me consider pediatric use carefully, because I recall restrictions. Systemic fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, are generally avoided in children due to class toxicity, but pediatric guidelines allow levofloxacin as an alternative for specific respiratory infections in children with severe penicillin allergy or suspected multidrug-resistant pneumococcus, with PK defined in children 6 months and older; ophthalmic levofloxacin is acceptable in children for corneal ulcer without dose adjustment, which I should note distinctly from systemic use [^1ea82548] [^a294fd82] [^93588eab].

> Next, I should review stewardship and resistance so I don't overgeneralize. Levofloxacin is a Watch-group antibiotic per WHO AWaRe; it should be reserved for appropriate indications, guided by culture and susceptibility when possible, and avoided for mild infections where benefits do not outweigh risks; rapid resistance emergence, particularly in Pseudomonas, is a concern, and inappropriate use drives resistance and adverse events without benefit, reinforcing judicious selection and narrow-spectrum alternatives when feasible [^578aafbe] [^07b7b3ab] [^ac6dc22a].

> I will now examine special populations and drug–drug interactions, and I need to check QT liability and CNS effects. In older adults, those with renal impairment, or on corticosteroids, the risk of tendon injury is higher; patients with known QT prolongation, hypokalemia, or on other QT-prolonging agents should avoid levofloxacin; diabetics on insulin or sulfonylureas have increased hypoglycemia risk; CNS disorders may be exacerbated; in pregnancy, fluoroquinolones are generally avoided unless no safer alternative exists, balancing maternal infection risk against fetal safety; for lactation, limited data suggest cautious use when necessary, with infant monitoring for GI effects [^60dc67db] [^7ebb0e70] [^df59774f] [^a4811ce0].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is about off-label uses or comparative effectiveness in TB or endocarditis; I should be careful. For rifampin-resistant TB, contemporary guidelines prioritize bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid regimens, with moxifloxacin rather than levofloxacin in the preferred 6-month BPaLM regimen; levofloxacin remains an option in susceptibility-guided MDR-TB therapy but is not first-line in current BPaLM/BPaL recommendations; for infective endocarditis, evidence for adding levofloxacin to standard therapy is limited and low quality, so it is not routinely recommended [^7741d0b1] [^c21cd355] [^6055e463] [^aa08f544].

> Let me reconsider the practical, risk–benefit framework to ensure the synthesis is actionable. Levofloxacin is appropriate when first-line agents are contraindicated or ineffective, when the pathogen is susceptible and the infection is moderate to severe, or when the clinical scenario matches labeled indications such as complicated UTI, CAP/HAP in appropriate hosts, SSTI requiring broad coverage, or biothreat scenarios; it should be avoided for mild viral infections, uncomplicated cystitis when nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX are suitable, and in patients with high-risk profiles for tendon, CNS, or QT effects; always reassess at 48–72 hours and de-escalate or stop if not indicated or if adverse effects emerge [^5b4f45b3] [^080e9357] [^07b7b3ab].

---

- **Tendon rupture and tendinitis**: Particularly in older adults, patients with renal impairment, or those on corticosteroids [^60dc67db] [^a4811ce0].
- **QT interval prolongation**: Risk of torsades de pointes, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions or those on other QT-prolonging drugs [^7ebb0e70] [^df59774f].
- **Central nervous system effects**: Seizures, psychosis, depression, and anxiety [^7ebb0e70] [^df59774f].
- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Risk of severe diarrhea and colitis [^7ebb0e70] [^df59774f].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Particularly in diabetic patients [^7ebb0e70] [^df59774f].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Levofloxacin is **contraindicated** in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones. Caution is advised in patients with:

- **Seizure disorders**: Due to potential CNS stimulation [^7ebb0e70] [^df59774f].
- **Renal impairment**: Requires dose adjustment [^18da65cc] [^dad56297].
- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Generally avoided unless no alternatives exist due to potential fetal and infant risks [^notfound].

---

## Drug interactions

Levofloxacin interacts with several **medications**, including:

- **Antacids, sucralfate, iron, and calcium supplements**: Reduce absorption of levofloxacin.
- **Corticosteroids**: Increase risk of tendon rupture [^60dc67db].
- **QT-prolonging drugs**: Increase risk of arrhythmias [^7ebb0e70] [^df59774f].

---

## Resistance considerations

Resistance to levofloxacin is a growing concern, particularly among **Gram-negative organisms** such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Appropriate use, adherence to dosing regimens, and susceptibility testing are essential to minimize resistance development [^07b7b3ab] [^ac6dc22a].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **reserving levofloxacin** for specific indications where first-line agents are unsuitable or ineffective. It is not recommended for empiric treatment of uncomplicated infections due to safety concerns and resistance potential [^578aafbe] [^f0d7ec76].

---

Levofloxacin is a **broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic** effective against a wide range of bacterial infections. Its use is limited by significant adverse effects, including tendon rupture, QT prolongation, and CNS effects. It should be reserved for appropriate indications, with careful consideration of patient-specific factors and close monitoring for adverse effects.

### Revisiting the potential of natural products in antimycobacterial therapy: advances in drug discovery and semisynthetic solutions [^6abe22f9]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Natural products have been pivotal in treating mycobacterial infections with early antibiotics such as streptomycin, forming the foundation of tuberculosis therapy. However, the emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium species has intensified the need for novel antimycobacterial agents. In this review, we revisit the historical contributions of natural products to antimycobacterial drug discovery and highlight recent advances in the field. We assess the application of molecular networking and the exploration of unculturable bacteria in identifying new antimycobacterial compounds such as amycobactin and levesquamides. We also highlight the role of semisynthesis in optimizing natural products, exemplified by sequanamycins and spectinomycin analogs that evade M. tuberculosis' intrinsic resistance. Finally, we discuss emerging technologies that are promising to accelerate the discovery and development of next-generation antimycobacterial therapies. Despite ongoing challenges, these innovative approaches offer renewed hope in addressing the growing crisis of drug-resistant mycobacterial infections.

### Association of fluoroquinolone prescribing rates with black box warnings from the US food and drug administration [^e62b9853]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Primary Outcome

The primary outcome was a dichotomous indicator for fluoroquinolone prescriptions that were filled within 7 days after the index visit, specifically for levofloxacin (Levaquin), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), moxifloxacin hydrochloride (Avelox), ofloxacin (Ocuflox; Floxin), gemifloxacin mesylate (Factive), and delafloxacin meglumine (Baxdela). We identified these antibiotic prescriptions from the Medicare Part D Event file using National Drug Codes and drug names. The changes in prescribing associated with these FDA warnings were expressed as percentage points, which were absolute changes in percentages.

Physician and Patient Characteristics

We identified the rendering physicians who were associated with eligible index visits using the National Provider Identifier number. We linked the physician and organizational information from the OneKey database to the Medicare claims data using the physicians’ National Provider Identifier numbers.

Using annual OneKey data, we included in the regression model an indicator for PCPs according to their specialty: family medicine, internal medicine, general practice, and geriatric medicine. We also constructed 4 indicator variables for organizational characteristics according to physician affiliations with at least 1 IDN, at least 1 teaching hospital, at least 1 for-profit hospital, or at least 1 hospital with a top 10th percentile CMI for treating patients with conditions that have higher levels of complexity.

Using the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File, we set patient age, sex, race and ethnicity (which were based on the administrative enrollment data of Medicare beneficiaries from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), indicators for all months of the study (to control for any seasonality), and the 4 US Census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) as the control variables. We also included the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (the weighted score) to control for any severity of illnesses that could potentially alter prescribing.

### Ocular penetration of levofloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in eyes with functioning filtering blebs: investigator masked, randomised clinical trial [^6e372f27]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To compare the penetration of levofloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the aqueous humour of eyes with functioning filtering blebs.

Methods

In this investigator-masked study, 48 patients with functioning filtering blebs requiring cataract surgery were randomised into six groups of eight patients. Groups 1, 2 and 3 received topical ofloxacin 0.3% (Ocuflox), ciprofloxacin 0.3% (Ciloxan) and levofloxacin (Quixin) respectively; Groups 4, 5 and 6 received the same treatment with the corresponding oral dose of ofloxacin 400 mg (Floxin), ciprofloxacin 400 mg (Cipro) and levofloxacin 250 mg (Levaquin). Aqueous antibiotic levels were determined by mass spectrometry of aqueous samples from each patient.

Results

The mean aqueous level for topical levofloxacin was significantly higher than those achieved by topical ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin (p value = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). The combination of topical and oral levofloxacin was significantly higher than topical levofloxacin alone (p = 0.05) and the ciprofloxacin combination (p = 0.003) but not significantly higher than the ofloxacin combination therapy.

Conclusions

Topical levofloxacin penetrates better than ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin into the aqueous of eyes with functioning filtering blebs. The combination of topical and oral levofloxacin may be preferable in the treatment of bleb-associated infections (NCT 00392275; Clinical trials.gov).

General

Alteration of the dosage regimen is recommended for patients with impairment of renal function (ClCr< 40 mL/min/1.73 m2). (See Dosage and Administration.)

Prescribing Maxaquin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Executive summary: 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^faca2851]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. Infectious Diseases Society of America considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances.Coccidioidomycosis, also known as San Joaquin Valley fever, is a systemic infection endemic to parts of the southwestern United States and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. Residence in and recent travel to these areas are critical elements for the accurate recognition of patients who develop this infection. In this practice guideline, we have organized our recommendations to address actionable questions concerning the entire spectrum of clinical syndromes. These can range from initial pulmonary infection, which eventually resolves whether or not antifungal therapy is administered, to a variety of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Additional recommendations address management of coccidioidomycosis occurring for special at-risk populations. Finally, preemptive management strategies are outlined in certain at-risk populations and after unintentional laboratory exposure.

### Maintaining fluoroquinolone class efficacy: review of influencing factors [^ac6dc22a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical Consequences of Inappropriate Fluoroquinolone Use

Inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents has been associated with adverse consequences, including therapeutic failure, development of resistance, and increased health-care costs. One example of a mismatch between pharmacodynamics and clinical infection was in the use of ciprofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia. The pharmacodynamics of the dose typically prescribed in these cases (ciprofloxacin 250 mg b.i.d.) are inappropriate for treating pneumococcal pneumonia, especially in seriously ill patients. By 1994, approximately 15 cases of S. pneumoniae infections that did not respond to ciprofloxacin had been reported, primarily in seriously ill patients and associated with contraindicated medications and other important medical issues. These events prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to modify the package insert to warn against empiric use of ciprofloxacin for respiratory infections in which S. pneumoniae would be a primary pathogen. Consequently, ciprofloxacin has been used less frequently in these types of infections.

By contrast, >50% of levofloxacin use has been for the treatment of respiratory infections. Since 1999, at least 20 case reports of pulmonary infections that did not respond to levofloxacin therapy have been published (, –). Three of the patients died due to fulminant pneumococcal infections that were unresponsive to levofloxacin therapy at approved dosage. Very few of these cases were in immunosuppressed patients. Reports of pneumococcal failures on the standard dosage of levofloxacin, 500 mg every 24 h, have also been described in two clinical trials, one in a patient with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and the other in a patient with community-acquired pneumonia (Table 4). In some of the 21 case reports, the treatment failed, and the pathogen developed levofloxacin resistance during therapy.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^578aafbe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2017, the WHO Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines established the AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification of antibiotics to aid antibiotic stewardship efforts globally at all levels of care. This classification system groups antibiotics into the aforementioned three categories, based on treatment of common bacterial infections and their impact on AMR, focusing on the need for appropriate use. The AWaRe classification was updated in 2021 to include an additional 78 antibiotics that were not previously classified, bringing the total number of classified antibiotics to 258 (Fig. 13).

Fig. 13 
AWaRe classification

The “Access” category refers to the antibiotic of choice for each of the 25 most common infections. These antibiotics should be available at all times and places and should be acceptable and affordable. The “Watch” category includes most of the “highest-priority critically important antibiotics”, which are recommended only for specific indications. The “Reserve” category includes antibiotics that should only be used as a last resort (i.e. to treat MDR bacteria) and only when all other antibiotics have failed. WHO recommends reducing the use of antibiotics in the “Watch” and in the “Reserve” groups, and increasing the access and use of antibiotics in the “Access” group, expecting 60% of all antibiotic use in hospitals should come from this group. As a practical matter, this would reduce the global utilization of piperacillin-tazobactam, an antipseudomonal ureidopenicillin that is overused to treat community-acquired infections.

### WITHDRAWN. antibiotics for treating leptospirosis [^eb169296]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Leptospirosis is a parasitic disease transmitted by animals. Severe leptospirosis may result in hospitalisation and about five per cent of the patients die. In clinical practice, penicillin is widely used for treating leptospirosis.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics versus placebo or other antibiotic regimens in treating leptospirosis. We addressed the following clinical questions: a) Are treatment regimens with antibiotics more efficient than placebo for leptospirosis? b) Are treatment regimens with antibiotics safe when compared to placebo for leptospirosis? c) Which antibiotic regimen is the most efficient and safest in treating leptospirosis?

Search Strategy

Electronic searches and searches of the identified articles were combined.

Studies

Randomised clinical trials in which antibiotics were used as treatment for leptospirosis. Language, date, or other restrictions were not applied.

Participants

Patients with clinical manifestations of leptospirosis.

Interventions

Any antibiotic regimen compared with a control group (placebo or another antibiotic regimen).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data and methodological quality of each trial were independently extracted and assessed by two reviewers. The random effects model was used irrespective of significant statistical heterogeneity.

Main Results

Three trials met inclusion criteria. Allocation concealment and double blind methods were not clearly described in two. Of the patients enrolled, 75 were treated with placebo and 75 with antibiotics: 61 (81.3%) penicillin and 14 (18.6%) doxycycline. The patients assigned to antibiotics compared to placebo showed: a) Mortality: 1% (1/75) versus 4% (3/75); risk difference -2%, 95% confidence interval -8% to 4%. b) Duration of hospital stay (days): weighted mean difference 0.30, 95% confidence interval -1.26 to 1.86. c) Prolonged hospital stay (> seven days): 30% (7/23) versus 74% (14/19); risk difference -43%, 95% confidence interval -70% to -16%. Number needed-to-treat 3, 95% confidence interval 2 to 7. d) Period of disappearance of fever (days): weighted mean difference -4.04, 95% confidence interval -8.65 to 0.58. e) Leptospiruria: 5% (4/75) versus 40% (30/75); risk difference -46%, 95% confidence interval -88% to -3%. Number needed-to-treat 2, 95% confidence interval 1 to 33.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic regimens for treatment of leptospirosis is a form of care for which the evidence is insufficient to provide clear guidelines for practice. The randomised trials suggest that antibiotics could be a useful treatment for leptospirosis. Because of the questionable quality of two of the three trials, the indication for general use of antibiotics is uncertain. However, the evidence suggest that penicillin may cause more good than harm.

### Updates on the treatment of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis: an official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^c21cd355]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of rifampin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-susceptible TB with a 6-month bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin (BPaLM) regimen versus 15-month or longer regimens in adolescents aged 14 and older and adults with rifampin-resistant pulmonary TB

Question: In adolescents aged 14 and older and adults with rifampin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-susceptible pulmonary TB, is a 6-month BPaLM regimen as effective and safe as the 15-month or longer drug-resistant TB regimens composed according to current ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA DR-TB treatment guidelines?

Recommendation: In adolescents aged 14 and older and adults with rifampin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-susceptible pulmonary TB, we recommend the use of a 6-month BPaLM treatment regimen, rather than the 15-month or longer regimens in patients with MDR/RR-TB (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). See Table 1 for dosing details.

### Guidelines for treatment of malaria in the United States [^9a8b5b25]. CDC (2013). Medium credibility.

Treatment guidance notes for chloroquine-resistant or unknown resistance P. falciparum include the following. There are 4 options (A, B, C, or D) for treatment; options A, B, and C are equally recommended, and we do not recommend option D (mefloquine) if other treatment options are available; for option C, quinine combined with doxycycline or tetracycline is generally preferred to quinine with clindamycin. If malaria develops despite chemoprophylaxis, that particular medicine should not be used as part of the treatment regimen. For infections acquired in Southeast Asia, quinine treatment should continue for 7 days, and for infections acquired elsewhere, quinine treatment should continue for 3 days. With atovaquone‑proguanil, take with food or whole milk and repeat the dose if vomiting occurs within 30 minutes.

### Women's views about management and cause of urinary tract infection: qualitative interview study [^5074d335]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute urinary tract infection is one of the commonest acute bacterial infections among women.Most women presenting in primary care are prescribed an antibiotic. Conventional courses of antibiotics probably help to resolve symptoms but are also likely to have side effects,including skin rash,vaginal symptoms,and other side effects.The strategy of universal use of antibiotics in these women is being questioned,in part because the condition is often self limiting and non-pharmacological alternatives—such as the use of cranberry juice, teas, or herbal remedies and potassium citrate or sodium biocarbonate—exist, although the evidence for effectiveness is weak.The potential effectiveness of antibiotics must also be balanced against wider issues for the National Health Service (NHS), particularly the mounting concerns about increasing workload for self limiting illnessand the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.The use of diagnostic techniques and antibiotics might encourage belief in antibiotics and in the necessity of seeing a general practitioner for the problem, thus “medicalising” a condition that is often self limiting.This leads to greater antibiotic use and increased antibiotic resistance.

Given these concerns and the limited evidence base for alternative management options, there was a need for trials to allow estimation of the advantages and disadvantages of antibiotics,antibiotic strategies, and non-antibiotic alternatives. We conducted a pragmatic randomised controlled trial to test several management strategies, including antibiotic delay.Qualitative interviews nested in the trial explored interviewees’ attitudes towards antibiotics, their experience of a delayed antibiotic prescription, and their views on the cause of urinary tract infection.

MEDICATION GUIDE

Levofloxacin (lee'' voe flox' a sin) Tablets USP

What is the most important information I should know about levofloxacin tablets? Levofloxacin tablets, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, can cause serious side effects. Some of these serious side effects can happen at the same time and could result in death. 

If you have any of the following serious side effects while you take levofloxacin tablets, you should stop taking levofloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away. 1. Tendon rupture or swelling of the tendon (tendinitis).

Tendon problems can happen in people of all ages who take levofloxacin tablets. Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Some tendon problems include :
pain
swelling
tears and swelling of tendons including the back of the ankle (Achilles), shoulder, hand, or other tendon sites
The risk of getting tendon problems while you take levofloxacin tablets are  higher if you:
are over 60 years of age
are taking steroids (corticosteroids)
have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant
Tendon problems can happen in people who do not have the above risk factors when they take levofloxacin tablets.
Other reasons that can increase your risk of tendon problems can include:
physical activity or exercise
kidney failure
tendon problems in the past, such as in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
Stop taking levofloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling or inflammation. Avoid exercise and using the affected area.
The most common area of pain and swelling is the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. This can also happen with other tendons. You may need a different antibiotic that is not a fluoroquinolone to treat your infection.
Tendon rupture can happen while you are taking or after you have finished taking levofloxacin tablets. Tendon ruptures can happen within hours or days of taking levofloxacin tablets and have happened up to several months after people have finished taking their fluoroquinolone.
Stop taking levofloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of a tendon rupture:
hear or feel a snap or pop in a tendon area
bruising right after an injury in a tendon area
unable to move the affected area or bear weight

### Antibiotics for the treatment of COVID-19 [^bcc0bc1e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of antibiotics with potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties are being investigated in clinical trials as treatment for COVID-19. The use of antibiotics follows the intention-to-treat the viral disease and not primarily to treat bacterial co-infections of individuals with COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding effectiveness and safety of antibiotics as anti-viral treatments for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics compared to each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or any other active intervention with proven efficacy for treatment of COVID-19 outpatients and inpatients.  SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (including MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, medRxiv, CENTRAL), Web of Science and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 14 June 2021.

Selection Criteria

RCTs were included that compared antibiotics with each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or another proven intervention, for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, treated in the in- or outpatient settings. Co-interventions had to be the same in both study arms. We excluded studies comparing antibiotics to other pharmacological interventions with unproven efficacy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed risk of bias of primary outcomes using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for the following primary outcomes: 1. to treat inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening defined as new need for intubation or death, clinical improvement defined as being discharged alive, quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias; 2. to treat outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening defined as hospital admission or death, clinical improvement defined as symptom resolution, quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with 11,281 participants with an average age of 54 years investigating antibiotics compared to placebo, standard of care alone or another antibiotic. No study was found comparing antibiotics to an intervention with proven efficacy. All studies investigated azithromycin, two studies investigated other antibiotics compared to azithromycin. Seven studies investigated inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and four investigated mild COVID-19 cases in outpatient settings. Eight studies had an open-label design, two were blinded with a placebo control, and one did not report on blinding. We identified 19 ongoing and 15 studies awaiting classification pending publication of results or clarification of inconsistencies. Of the 30 study results contributing to primary outcomes by included studies, 17 were assessed as overall low risk and 13 as some concerns of bias. Only studies investigating azithromycin reported data eligible for the prioritised primary outcomes. Azithromycin doses and treatment duration varied among included studies.  Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to placebo or standard of care alone in inpatients We are very certain that azithromycin has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28 compared to standard of care alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.06; 8600 participants; 4 studies; high-certainty evidence). Azithromycin probably has little or no effect on clinical worsening or death at day 28 (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; 7311 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), on clinical improvement at day 28 (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; 8172 participants; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), on serious adverse events during the study period (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 794 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), and cardiac arrhythmias during the study period (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.15; 7865 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard of care alone. Azithromycin may increase any adverse events slightly during the study period (RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.57; 355 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence) compared to standard of care alone. No study reported quality of life up to 28 days. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to placebo or standard of care alone in outpatients Azithromycin may have little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care alone on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 1.00 ; 95% CI 0.06 to 15.69; 876 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.94 ; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.56; 876 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), and on symptom resolution at day 14 (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.12; 138 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether azithromycin increases or reduces serious adverse events compared to placebo or standard of care alone (0 participants experienced serious adverse events; 454 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on adverse events, cardiac arrhythmias during the study period or quality of life up to 28 days. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to any other antibiotics in inpatients and outpatients One study compared azithromycin to lincomycin in inpatients, but did not report any primary outcome. Another study compared azithromycin to clarithromycin in outpatients, but did not report any relevant outcome for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We are certain that risk of death in hospitalised COVID-19 patients is not reduced by treatment with azithromycin after 28 days. Further, based on moderate-certainty evidence, patients in the inpatient setting with moderate and severe disease probably do not benefit from azithromycin used as potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19 regarding clinical worsening or improvement. For the outpatient setting, there is currently low-certainty evidence that azithromycin may have no beneficial effect for COVID-19 individuals. There is no evidence from RCTs available for other antibiotics as antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment of COVID-19. With accordance to the living approach of this review, we will continually update our search and include eligible trials to fill this evidence gap. However, in relation to the evidence for azithromycin and in the context of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics should not be used for treatment of COVID-19 outside well-designed RCTs.

### Hydroxychloroquine use in COVID-19: is the risk of cardiovascular toxicity justified? [^c03f2984]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China and its declaration as a worldwide pandemic, there have been significant efforts to rapidly identify effective therapeutic and preventative strategies.Several treatments have been proposed and are currently under investigation.Most recently, dexamethasone has been reported to reduce mortality in patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation.There are, however, inherent concerns with regards to the application of drugs for which efficacy and safety has yet to be established. The antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been shown to have antiviral actions against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.Based on anecdotal experiences and a small number of clinical studies,these drugs have received widespread media attention.These early results led to a number of healthcare systems trialling them as treatment for patients with COVID-19 with varying reports of success.The addition of azithromycin (AZT), a macrolide antibiotic, has also been advocated despite limited evidence for its efficacy.Although HCQ and CQ appear to be safe in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases and malaria,it is unclear if this safety profile can be extrapolated to patients with COVID-19 and specific concerns have been raised over potential cardiovascular toxicity.

Results

Study population

These groups were compared regarding demographic and clinical characteristics, as described in Table 1. There was no significant age or gender difference between both groups. The same can be said for smoking habits and alcohol consumption (defined as more than 10 cigars/day and >20 g alcohol each day). The main indication for prescribing eradication therapy was non-ulcer dyspepsia in both groups. First-generation and full-dose PPI were preferred in both the SST and the LST regimens. There were significant differences in the choice of the nitroimidazole antibiotics: Tinidazole was prescribed more often in both groups, but especially in group B (p = 0.001). The most used dosage for Metronidazole was 500 mg three times a day in both groups. The majority of the prescribing physicians were Gastroenterologists, especially in group B (p = 0.002).

### Real life management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in the gulf region and comparison with practice guidelines: a prospective study [^7d4efc9c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study was a multicentre, multinational, observational study which aimed to describe treatment practices in CAP patients admitted to hospitals in five countries in the Gulf region (United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar) and to compare the findings to the 2007 IDSA/ATS treatment guidelines. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to assess treatment standards, which has included a large sample of patients to be conducted in the Gulf region.

Overall, our study shows that the management of CAP in Gulf Arab countries participating in the study is in line with the IDSA/ATS guidelines. For example, information on cough and fever as one of the clinical criteria for CAP was collected systematically and chest radiography showed new infiltrative changes in the majority of patients (70.6 %).

However, for the rest of the population, a radiogram was not performed or did not show new infiltrative changes.

The type, route of administration and duration of antimicrobial therapy was also generally consistent with the IDSA/ATS guidelines for hospital ward treatment. Antimicrobial therapy used in the Gulf region was in general consistent with the recommendation of starting initial therapy empirically with fluoroquinolones until laboratory results could be obtained to guide more specific therapy. All patients received therapy initiated immediately on the day of hospitalisation, with fluoroquinolones being the most widely used treatment. However, ten percent of the study population received a combination of a fluoroquinolone and a β-lactam during hospital admission, which is not the treatment recommended by the IDSA/ATS expert panel for patients not admitted to an ICU.

The pathogens responsible were not isolated and characterised in the majority of patients and thus represent the major divergence between current practice in the Gulf region and the IDSA/ATS guidelines. Characterisation of CAP pathogens was only achieved in 12 % of patients, principally by analysis of sputum samples. In addition, information about use of Gram’s staining method or any other methods used to identify pathogens, was not collected in our study. The most frequently identified pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is consistent with findings from other countries, as noted in the IDSA/ATS guidelines.

### ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guidelines for treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis: a two-edged sword? [^a38a1a84]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor :

On the basis of individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of observational studies, the World Health Organization released the consolidated guidelines on drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) treatment in 2019. Shortly afterward, using a data set modified from the aforementioned IPD, the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/CDC/European Respiratory Society (ERS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published their official clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of drug-resistant TB. The ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA have recommended the use of linezolid and bedaquiline to treat all patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), regardless of the drug-susceptibility testing results. Although the present guidelines have substantiated the role of linezolid and bedaquiline in the treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant MDR-TB, the IPD meta-analysis findings might have been overextrapolated, with findings regarding the use of linezolid and bedaquiline for the management of fluoroquinolone-resistant MDR-TB applied to fluoroquinolone-susceptible MDR-TB. Retrospective analysis of linezolid in better-defined cohorts with MDR-TB have suggested that linezolid would be useful largely in the treatment of more complicated MDR-TB. Whether adding bedaquiline to fluoroquinolone would improve treatment outcomes of fluoroquinolone-susceptible MDR-TB is still being evaluated in stage 2 of the STREAM (Evaluation of a Standardised Treatment Regimen of Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs for Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis) trial. Furthermore, selection bias and inadequate control of confounding in the IPD meta-analysis might have yielded some findings that cannot be readily explained on a biologically plausible basis. Although the ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA have explicitly stated that their guidelines were based on evidence of very low certainty, their categorical recommendation regarding use of linezolid and bedaquiline may pose a two-edged sword for TB control programs worldwide.

### From repurposing to refinement: optimizing levofloxacin for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^953c8295]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

After the development of rifampicin in 1963, nearly 50 years passed before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new antituberculosis drug, bedaquiline, in 2012. During this five-decade drought, antibiotics originally developed for other bacterial infections but later found to be effective against tuberculosis (TB) were repurposed to treat drug-resistant TB. Representative examples include fluoroquinolones, linezolid, and clofazimine.

Among the repurposed drugs, fluoroquinolones were the first to be widely adopted and became the most extensively used in TB treatment. Their anti-TB activity was potent enough that patients with TB who initially received incorrect diagnoses of bacterial pneumonia experienced temporary but noticeable clinical improvement when prescribed these drugs. With multiple studies confirming their positive impact on microbiological and clinical outcomes, fluoroquinolones have consistently been recognized as key components in multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB treatment. A meta-analysis incorporating individual data from more than 12,000 patients with MDR TB further reinforced these findings, demonstrating that the use of levofloxacin or moxifloxacin was associated not only with treatment success but also with reduced mortality. On the other hand, the presence of fluoroquinolone resistance significantly worsens MDR TB treatment outcomes (–). Because of the significant clinical impact of fluoroquinolone resistance and their crucial role in MDR TB treatment, these drugs are not only considered defining criteria of extensive drug-resistant TB and pre–extensive drug-resistant TB, but they are also classified as group A essential anti-TB drugs, alongside linezolid and bedaquiline.

Among the newer generation fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin have been used in TB treatment. Gatifloxacin, another fluoroquinolone, was previously evaluated in experimental 4-month regimens for drug-susceptible TB. However, because of its association with dysglycemia, particularly in elderly patients, it was subsequently withdrawn from the market.

Choosing between levofloxacin and moxifloxacin for TB treatment requires careful consideration. Experimental and animal studies have shown that moxifloxacin has a lower minimum inhibitory concentration than levofloxacin and exhibits greater bactericidal activity. However, moxifloxacin is also more likely to cause QT interval prolongation compared with levofloxacin. Previously, we conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin in patients with MDR TB. The negative sputum culture conversion rates at 3 months and overall treatment outcomes were not different between the two groups. Adverse events were more frequent in the levofloxacin group, particularly musculoskeletal pain.

### 'In Texas, everybody wants antibiotics': reducing inappropriate antibiotic expectations and use with a provider-patient communication tool in primary care [^d46589e4]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Reframing expectations about antibiotic use

Providers used the tool to support conversations when antibiotics were not indicated. Providers described the brochure as a tangible tool to clarify when antibiotics are unnecessary and to serve as a go-between in conversations that were often disappointing or uncomfortable. Providers felt that the tool legitimised their message and helped to shift misconceptions into opportunities for education and shared understanding.

It would be very helpful because the need for or no need for antibiotics is very often a topic of discussion with our patients. They come to us thinking they need antibiotics, and when we say no, you don't need an antibiotic, it’s a big problem. That’s an immediate source of concern because they think they're not going to get the treatment they need. So, it’s concern, it’s disappointment. (Continuity Provider)

Patients and providers noted that expectations around antibiotic use were shaped by cultural norms and prior healthcare experiences. Countries or healthcare systems where antibiotics are more readily available or frequently prescribed influenced patients’ perceptions of antibiotic prescriptions. For some patients, learning that antibiotics are not always needed represented a significant shift in understanding.

I'm from Mexico, and over there they really do give you antibiotics for everything… Here, they just say it needs to go away on its own. It’s very different. (Same-Day Patient)

Providers recognised these patterns and explained how cultural habits contributed to persistent expectations for antibiotics, even when not medically indicated.

In Texas, everyone wants antibiotics. Sometimes they go to Mexico and get antibiotics… They love antibiotics even if it’s a common cold. (Continuity Provider)

### Real life management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in the gulf region and comparison with practice guidelines: a prospective study [^8a5db66c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The third relates to the fact that only one quarter of patients attended a second follow-up visit 3 weeks after discharge. It would be important to encourage physicians to collect information from their patients, either during a formal hospital visit, and particularly if residual clinical or radiological signs of infection were detected at the previous follow-up visit, or by telephone, 3 weeks after discharge to ensure that the patient is effectively cured.

Finally, 10 % of the study population received a combination of a fluoroquinolone and a β-lactam during hospital admission, which is the treatment recommended by the IDSA/ATS expert panel for patients directly admitted to an ICU and not for patients included in our study (ie patients not directly admitted to ICU). Consequently, in those patients the choice of CAP antimicrobial therapy was not consistent with the guidelines. Neverthless, at hospital admission, seventeen percent of patients (N = 117) were classified as moderate to high risk for mortality according to the Fine criteria and consequently could be considered by the physician to be eligible for an ICU regimen without necessarily being directed to one. Because the overall efficacy of many classes of antimicrobial regimens is considered to be good, over-treatment use is expected to produce the same clinical outcome but with an increased risk of antiobiotic resistance and side effects. For this reason, the selection of antimicrobial regimens for empirical therapy should be based on prediction of the most likely pathogen and knowledge of local susceptibility patterns with a preference given to the more potent drugs because of their benefit in drecreasing the risk of selection for antiobiotic resistance.

We compared treatment practices in CAP patients in the Gulf region to the IDSA/ATS guidelines since they are the most used guidelines worldwide, are well known and used by doctors of the region and are one of the recommended standard of care in the Gulf region.

The adherence to regional guidelines (ie GCC CAP guidelines) has already been evaluated in Oman. This analysis showed that there was very poor adherence to the guidelines with respect to CAP severity assessment and provision of preventive measures upon hospital discharge and highlighted the necessity to improve the implementation of such guidelines in the region. Several studies have evaluated the level of adherence to the IDSA/ATS guidelines. For instance, a recent study from Italy performed in 191 patients with CAP revealed that the adherence to antibiotic treatment guidelines was poor, since only 47 % of patients received an empirical antibiotic regimen that was adherent to guidelines.

Hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine are frequently used to treat rheumatic diseases. Ocular toxicity, although infrequent, is one of the potential side effects of antimalarial therapies. Current recommendations are unifocal in being developed by only ophthalmologists who do not treat patients for their rheumatic diseases. The data used to create the recommendations are meager and retrospective. Comanagement of patients with rheumatic disease who are exposed to antimalarial therapies requires a greater interaction between ophthalmologists and rheumatologists.

### Updates on the treatment of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis: an official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^6055e463]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: In children and adolescents between 3 months and 16 years of age with nonsevere TB (without suspicion or evidence of multidrug-resistant [MDR]/rifampin-resistant [RR]-TB), we recommend the use of a 4-month treatment regimen of 2HRZ(E)/2HR rather than the 6-month drug-susceptible TB regimen of 2HRZ(E)/4HR (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).

Remarks: Nonsevere TB is defined as peripheral lymph node TB; intrathoracic lymph node TB without airway obstruction; uncomplicated TB pleural effusion; or paucibacillary and noncavitary disease confined to one lobe of the lungs or without a miliary pattern. Children and adolescents who do not meet the criteria for nonsevere TB should receive the standard 6-month treatment regimen (2HRZE/4HR) or recommended treatment regimens for severe forms of extrapulmonary TB. Some children may be eligible for the 4-month rifapentine-moxifloxacin regimen. Dosing is found in Table 1.

Treatment of rifampin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-resistant TB with a 6-month bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid (BPaL) regimen versus 15-month or longer regimens in adolescents aged 14 and older and adults with rifampin-resistant pulmonary TB

Question: In adolescents aged 14 and older and adults with rifampin-resistant pulmonary TB, is a 6-month BPaL regimen as efficacious and safe as the current 15-month or longer drug-resistant TB regimens composed according to current ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA drug-resistant (DR)-TB treatment guidelines?

Recommendation: In adolescents aged 14 and older and adults with rifampin-resistant pulmonary TB with resistance or patient intolerance to fluoroquinolones, who either have had no previous exposure to bedaquiline and linezolid or have been exposed for less than 1 month, we recommend the use of the 6-month treatment BPaL regimen, rather than more than 15-month regimens (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). See Table 1 for dosing details.

### Nystatin [^4159c41d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Pharmacokinetics

Nystatin Cream USP is not absorbed from intact skin or mucous membrane.

Microbiology

Nystatin is an antibiotic which is both fungistatic and fungicidal in vitro against a wide variety of yeasts and yeast-like fungi, including Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. guilliermondi, C. pseudotropicalis, C. krusei, Torulopsis glabrata, Tricophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes .

Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of susceptible species resulting in a change in membrane permeability and the subsequent leakage of intracellular components. On repeated subculturing with increasing levels of nystatin, Candida albicans does not develop resistance to nystatin. Generally, resistance to nystatin does not develop during therapy. However, other species of Candida (C. tropicalis, C. guilliermondi, C. krusei, and C. stellatoides) become quite resistant on treatment with nystatin and simultaneously become cross resistant to amphotericin as well. This resistance is lost when the antibiotic is removed.

Nystatin exhibits no appreciable activity against bacteria, protozoa, or viruses.

Read this Medication Guide before you start taking levofloxacin and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

 What is the most important information I should know about levofloxacin? Levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, can cause serious side effects. Some of these serious side effects can happen at the same time and could result in death . 

If you have any of the following serious side effects while you take levofloxacin, you should stop taking levofloxacin immediately and get medical help right away.

 1. Tendon rupture or swelling of the tendon (tendinitis).

Tendon problems can happen in people of all ages who take levofloxacin. Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones.

Some tendon problems include pain, swelling, tears, and swelling of tendons including the back of the ankle (Achilles), shoulder, hand, or other tendon sites.

The risk of getting tendon problems while you take levofloxacin is higher if you:
are over 60 years of age
are taking steroids (corticosteroids)
have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant.
Tendon problems can happen in people who do not have the above risk factors when they take levofloxacin.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) [^92ee63fc]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

During treatment, adequate fluid intake and urinary output should be ensured to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are “slow acetylators” may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold).

When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Patients should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting

treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as

### A comparison of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of infective endocarditis [^aa08f544]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of treatment, but due to the differences in presentation, populations affected, and the wide variety of micro-organisms that can be responsible, their use is not standardised. This is an update of a review previously published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the existing evidence about the clinical benefits and harms of different antibiotics regimens used to treat people with infective endocarditis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase Classic and Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science on 6 January 2020. We also searched three trials registers and handsearched the reference lists of included papers. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of antibiotic regimens for treating definitive infective endocarditis diagnosed according to modified Duke's criteria. We considered all-cause mortality, cure rates, and adverse events as the primary outcomes. We excluded people with possible infective endocarditis and pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction in duplicate. We constructed 'Summary of findings' tables and used GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence. We described the included studies narratively.

Main Results

Six small RCTs involving 1143 allocated/632 analysed participants met the inclusion criteria of this first update. The included trials had a high risk of bias. Three trials were sponsored by drug companies. Due to heterogeneity in outcome definitions and different antibiotics used data could not be pooled. The included trials compared miscellaneous antibiotic schedules having uncertain effects for all of the prespecified outcomes in this review. Evidence was either low or very low quality due to high risk of bias and very low number of events and small sample size. The results for all-cause mortality were as follows: one trial compared quinolone (levofloxacin) plus standard treatment (antistaphylococcal penicillin (cloxacillin or dicloxacillin), aminoglycoside (tobramycin or netilmicin), and rifampicin) versus standard treatment alone and reported 8/31 (26%) with levofloxacin plus standard treatment versus 9/39 (23%) with standard treatment alone; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 2.56. One trial compared fosfomycin plus imipenem 3/4 (75%) versus vancomycin 0/4 (0%) (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.47 to 103.27), and one trial compared partial oral treatment 7/201 (3.5%) versus conventional intravenous treatment 13/199 (6.53%) (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.31). The results for rates of cure with or without surgery were as follows: one trial compared daptomycin versus low-dose gentamicin plus an antistaphylococcal penicillin (nafcillin, oxacillin, or flucloxacillin) or vancomycin and reported 9/28 (32.1%) with daptomycin versus 9/25 (36%) with low-dose gentamicin plus antistaphylococcal penicillin or vancomycin; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.89. One trial compared glycopeptide (vancomycin or teicoplanin) plus gentamicin with cloxacillin plus gentamicin (13/23 (56%) versus 11/11 (100%); RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.85). One trial compared ceftriaxone plus gentamicin versus ceftriaxone alone (15/34 (44%) versus 21/33 (64%); RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.10), and one trial compared fosfomycin plus imipenem versus vancomycin (1/4 (25%) versus 2/4 (50%); RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.55). The included trials reported adverse events, the need for cardiac surgical interventions, and rates of uncontrolled infection, congestive heart failure, relapse of endocarditis, and septic emboli, and found no conclusive differences between groups (very low-quality evidence). No trials assessed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

This first update confirms the findings of the original version of the review. Limited and low to very low-quality evidence suggests that the comparative effects of different antibiotic regimens in terms of cure rates or other relevant clinical outcomes are uncertain. The conclusions of this updated Cochrane Review were based on few RCTs with a high risk of bias. Accordingly, current evidence does not support or reject any regimen of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of infective endocarditis.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of COVID-19 infection [^3ae34c20]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are quinoline derivatives used to treat malaria. To date, these medications are not approved for the treatment of viral infections, and there are no well-controlled, prospective, randomized clinical studies or evidence to support their use in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are being studied alone or in combination with other agents to assess their effectiveness in the treatment or prophylaxis for COVID-19. The effective use of any medication involves an understanding of its pharmacokinetics, safety, and mechanism of action. This work provides basic clinical pharmacology information relevant for planning and initiating COVID-19 clinical studies with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, summarizes safety data from healthy volunteer studies, and summarizes safety data from phase II and phase II/III clinical studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria, including a phase II/III study in pediatric patients following administration of azithromycin and chloroquine in combination. In addition, this work presents data describing the proposed mechanisms of action against the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 and summarizes clinical efficacy to date.

### Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19: is cardiotoxicity a concern? [^d2be38aa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral pandemic causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) begs for rapid and innovative treatments. While most patients have mild symptoms, some will become critically ill and are straining existing clinical resources in many places around the world. In addition to flu like symptoms, acute cardiac manifestations in hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, included cardiac injury (7.2%), shock (8.7%), and arrhythmia (16.7%). 1

Several pharmacological therapies have been suggested including repurposing of existing drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which were first developed in the World War II era for treatment and prophylaxis of malaria. These drugs were developed before modern drug safety surveillance programs, including the recognition that some drugs can cause long QT syndrome and the ventricular arrhythmia torsades de pointes. The concept that chloroquine might be effective in treating COVID‐19 viremia stems from in vitro work done during the severe acute respiratory syndrome era nearly 20 years ago. In February of this year, Chinese virologists reported that chloroquine and its less toxic derivative hydroxychloroquine could stop infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in vitro. 2 Emerging clinical trials from China and France suggest potential benefit using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, sometimes combined with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, to treat acute COVID‐19 patients resulting in more rapid reduction in viral shedding and possible improved clinical outcomes. 3, 4 However, the available data are scant and far from conclusive at this point. There is growing interest in using these agents for treatment of acute COVID‐19 as well as for prophylaxis, with clinical trials underway around the world including the United States (see ClincialTrials.gov). Given limited treatment options for COVID‐19, off‐label use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, sometimes with azithromycin, is currently widespread. Besides drug shortages and limiting the availability of the drugs for patients relying on them for treatment of some rheumatological disorders, is there the potential for other unanticipated adverse consequences?

Is there still a role for therapies containing clarithromycin, levofloxacin, or metronidazole?

Worldwide, resistance to these antimicrobials has resulted in low overall cure rates such that they should no longer be used empirically. It an attempt to salvage clarithromycin-containing therapies, the Maastricht Guidelines suggested the use of an arbitrary level of resistance (e.g. 15%) as a cutoff for use. The evidence was graded as very low and importantly few, if any, clinicians had a method for determining the percent of local resistance other than whether the therapy was successful. Clinically 65 and 90% cure rates are likely difficult to distinguish in any clinical practice.Experience has shown that clarithromycin resistance has continued to increase and the rare regions where clarithromycin was previously effective (e.g. Thailand and Southeast Asia) are generally experiencing unacceptably high rates of resistance. However, while these three antimicrobials should no longer be prescribed empirically, they can still be used for susceptibility-based therapy provided that one uses locally optimized regimens and confirms treatment all results using test-of-cure.

Comparison 1: HCQ versus standard care without HCQ or placebo

Ten trials of treatment of people with COVID‐19 compared HCQ to standard care or placebo (8270 participants; Abd‐Elsalam 2020 ; Cavalcanti 2020 ; Chen 2020a ; Chen 2020b ; Chen 2020c ; Horby 2020 ; Mitjà 2020a ; Pan 2020 ; Skipper 2020 ; Tang 2020). The arm randomizing participants to a combination of HCQ with azithromycin in Cavalcanti 2020 was not included in this comparison, but is included in Comparison 3 below.

Nine of the 10 trials reported death due to any cause (Abd‐Elsalam 2020 ; Cavalcanti 2020 ; Chen 2020a ; Chen 2020c ; Horby 2020 ; Mitjà 2020a ; Pan 2020 ; Skipper 2020 ; Tang 2020). Meta‐analysis using ITT results for each trial found little or no difference between HCQ and standard care without HCQ or placebo in all‐cause death (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.19; 8208 participants; 9 RCTs; Analysis 1.1). Sensitivity analysis performed using modified ITT results as reported by three trials revealed no difference in the pooled effect estimate (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.19; 8043 participants; 9 RCTs; Analysis 1.2) (Cavalcanti 2020 ; Mitjà 2020a ; Skipper 2020).

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines—post-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): The panel made an explicit decision that the primary outcome driving the decision for any post-exposure prophylaxis is the ability to prevent infection; when the evidence demonstrates a very low likelihood of effective post-exposure prophylaxis, other outcomes become secondary; and when healthy persons are considered for preventive medications (such as would occur in post-exposure settings), a higher threshold for benefits is required and (even putative) harms become more important. The panel agreed that the overall certainty of the evidence against prophylaxis treatment with HCQ was moderate (failure to prevent infection) due to concerns with imprecision, and the panel balanced the lack of clear benefit with the increased risk of harms from the body of evidence reported in the treatment section, in addition to the side effects reported in the trials to make a strong recommendation. The guideline panel recommended against the use of HCQ as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for persons exposed to COVID-19.

### Ampicillin sodium [^49266aab]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ampicillin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests

As with any potent drug, periodic assessment of organ system function, including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, should be made during prolonged therapy.

Transient elevation of serum transaminase has been observed following administration of ampicillin. The significance of this finding is not known.

Drug Interactions

The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of skin rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

With high urine concentrations of ampicillin, false-positive glucose reactions may occur if Clinitest, Benedict's Solution, or Fehling's Solution are used. Therefore, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix or Tes-Tape) be used.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility

No long-term animal studies have been conducted with this drug.

Pregnancy - Category B

Reproduction studies have been performed in laboratory animals at doses several times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of adverse effects due to ampicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Black Box warnings, what are they?

Black Box warnings are the strongest warning the FDA issues, and they are ‘designed to call attention to serious or life‐threatening risks’ 3. These warnings must be issued with all prescriptions of the drug in question. The FDA's only escalation after a Black Box warning is to force a drug to be recalled or withdrawn from the market. Black Box warnings indicate either when there is a serious adverse reaction with ‘some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event’ or to ‘highlight important information for prescribers’ 3.

1.15 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of levofloxacin and other antibacterial drugs, levofloxacin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Culture and Susceptibility Testing

Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing the infection and to determine their susceptibility to levofloxacin [see Microbiology (12.4)] . Therapy with levofloxacin may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available, appropriate therapy should be selected.

As with other drugs in this class, some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with levofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information about the continued susceptibility of the pathogens to the antimicrobial agent and also the possible emergence of bacterial resistance.

SAFETY AND PHARMACOLOGY

Fluoroquinolones have a long history of adverse effects with several of them being considered as class-related such as tendinitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system effects, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. As a result, all fluoroquinolones approved in the United States (including delafloxacin) carry a general boxed warning about these effects (significant decreases in blood sugar and certain mental health side effects have been added recently or will be soon). Both the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are also concerned with rare but severe and permanent or long-lasting serious side effects (see, which led to the FDA statement that risks of fluoroquinolones may outweigh benefits for patients with mild infections such as acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. Likewise, the EMA may reduce the indications of fluoroquinolones to “severe infections when other antibiotics cannot be used”. Most of these class-related adverse effects and/or permanent effects were uncommon in the safety data bases of registration and post-marketing studies undertaken by or under the control of Industry (see, for example, the safety profile of moxifloxacin as compiled from such studies involving about 15 000 patients). The observation period in these studies is limited and they usually exclude patients with known risk factors. In this context, although the FDA label mentions that peripheral neuropathy and central nervous system effects have been observed with delafloxacin (also hypersensitivity, and Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea), these were not specifically observed or reported more frequently in the delafloxacin arm than in the comparator arm in the clinical trials published to date. The current developer of delafloxacin undertook a series of studies aimed at examining specific fluoroquinolone-related side effects. In this context, cardiac safety was examined in clinical models that showed that neither a therapeutic (300 mg administered by IV) nor a supratherapeutic (900 mg IV) dose of delafloxacin was associated with clinically meaningful disturbances in cardiac repolarization (as measured by the corrected QT [QTc] interval) under conditions in which moxifloxacin, used as comparator, gave an unambiguous signal demonstrwating that the study was adequately sensitive to assess QTc prolongation. Also, no relationship was reported between plasma concentrations and the placebo-corrected change from pre-dose baseline in the QTc (ΔΔQTcF). Because of concern about photosensitivity, commonly associated with a halogen substituent in position C8 (see for review), a study of the photosensitizing potential of delafloxacin to ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) and visible radiation was conducted in 52 healthy volunteers. Neither delafloxacin given for 7 days at 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day (0.22 and 0.44 times the approved recommended daily oral dosage, respectively, nor placebo demonstrated clinically significant phototoxic potential at any wavelengths tested (295 to 430 nm), including solar simulation. The active comparator (lomefloxacin, which possesses a fluorine substituent in C8) demonstrated a moderate degree of phototoxicity at UVA 335 nm and 365 nm and solar simulation wavelengths. Finally, significant drug-drug interactions are unlikely, which is a consideration when choosing non-fluoroquinolone alternatives such as macrolides.

### Urinary tract infections and antibiotic use in pregnancy-qualitative analysis of online forum content [^9184ee28]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Safety of antibiotics

A few women expressed reluctance and questioned the use of antibiotics in pregnancy for the treatment of UTIs. The reasons varied from concerns about teratogenicity, effects on long term immunity or personally experiencing antibiotic side effects. For example, Liza was fearful about the effects on the foetus, “I’m petrified that taking amoxicillin will harm baby!” while another website user was concerned about longer term effects such as the development of allergies in the child.

Personally I would be wary of it [antibiotic] because there is a link between taking antibiotics in late stage pregnancy and the baby having eczema and allergies. I took antibiotics in late pregnancy and my daughter has multiple food allergies and eczema (Tania).

In spite of these concerns, which were expressed by only a small proportion of women, most considered antibiotics to be generally safe.

Antibiotics are one of the few things they are really sure about giving to pregnant women, precisely because we get infections. (Tula).

The majority of women compared the risks of a UTI with the risks of using antibiotics and viewed antibiotics as the safest option for normal progression of their pregnancy. They drew on their personal experiences of using antibiotics or viewed a prescription as proof that antibiotics were not dangerous. As Carey suggested, “ Doc wouldn’t prescribe if dangerous. It’s more dangerous to leave a UTI, as at its worst it can cause kidney issues and miscarriage”. This view also meant that some women thought that it was better to take antibiotics “just in case”.

The doc said it wouldn’t do me any harm and better than not taking them just in case I had needed them (if that makes sense). I don’t think you should feel guilty as the doc will have given you antibiotics that wouldn’t affect your baby. (Usha).

Thus when discussing the safety of using antibiotics to treat UTIs, whether or not they viewed them as safe in pregnancy, women’s primary motivation was to protect the foetus owing to pre-natal attachment. For a small proportion of women it was the uncertainty of how the antibiotic might affect the foetus or their child’s immunity in the long term that led them to be wary but for the remaining majority, antibiotics were perceived as the safest and most effective management option.
