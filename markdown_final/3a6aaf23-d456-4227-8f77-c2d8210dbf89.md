## Question

Screen time's effects on mental health

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how screen time affects mental health, including questions about causality, mechanisms, dose–response, content/context, age/gender differences, and practical recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of causal evidence from randomized trials. Then, I should verify dose–response thresholds and whether there is a safe lower bound. Next, I will examine mechanisms that plausibly link screen time to mental health outcomes. After that, I need to check how content and context modify risk. I will then review age and gender differences, followed by the role of physical activity and sleep. Finally, I should appraise limitations and translate this into clinical guidance and public health implications, making sure I double-check any claims that might overstate certainty or generalizability.

> Let me first confirm the causal signal. The most compelling evidence comes from randomized controlled trials showing that reducing screen time improves mental health outcomes. In healthy university students, a 3-week smartphone reduction to ≤ 2 hours/day produced small-to-moderate improvements in depressive symptoms, stress, sleep quality, and well-being versus controls, with effect sizes around η2 ≈ 0.05–0.11, which is clinically meaningful at the population level [^1123Dkjg]. Similarly, a family-based 2-week leisure screen reduction in children and adolescents yielded a moderate improvement in behavioral difficulties (SDQ total difficulties −1.67 points, Cohen d ≈ 0.53), with the largest gains in internalizing symptoms and prosocial behavior, supporting a causal interpretation beyond mere correlation [^113mRDKk] [^114eREwa]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these are short-term interventions, but they triangulate with longitudinal observational data and meta-analyses to strengthen causal inference, even as we acknowledge residual confounding in non-experimental designs [^115xThEp] [^115xtTdb].

> I need to check dose–response thresholds next. Multiple large-scale observational datasets suggest mental health risks rise with increasing screen time, with adverse associations emerging around 1–2 hours/day and strengthening beyond 2–4 hours/day depending on modality and context. In adolescents, higher discretionary screen time correlates with more psychosomatic complaints in a dose-dependent fashion, with risk rising notably beyond 2 hours/day and accelerating beyond 4 hours/day for both passive and active screen use [^114ZNxPb]. A Lancet analysis of 577,475 adolescents found detrimental associations begin around 1 hour/day and intensify with higher exposure, while physical activity shows monotonic benefits, indicating independent and synergistic effects within the 24-hour day [^115xtTdb]. Wait, let me verify the lower bound — some studies detect signal even below 2 hours/day, so I should avoid asserting a universally "safe" minimum; rather, less is generally better, and the slope of harm appears steeper beyond about 2–4 hours/day depending on content and individual vulnerability [^115xtTdb] [^114ZNxPb].

> Now, mechanisms. I will now examine plausible pathways linking screen time to mental health. Displacement of protective activities (sleep, physical activity, in-person social interaction) is a leading explanation, and sleep disruption via evening screen exposure and blue light effects on melatonin is well supported, with consistent links to shortened sleep duration and delayed timing in youth [^117KBvPo] [^1143pC5k]. Social comparison, cyberbullying, and passive social media use can amplify internalizing symptoms, particularly in girls, while FOMO and problematic use patterns may engage reward/addiction circuitry, worsening mood and self-regulation [^115zcAaQ] [^111K21ZD]. But wait, what if genetics confound this? Shared genetic liability explains a substantial portion of the association between screen time and child psychiatric problems, especially attention and internalizing symptoms, so I should be cautious not to over-attribute causality in observational designs [^117QTFuU] [^1146APsz].

> Content and context matter, so I should double-check how different screen activities map to mental health. Educational content appears less harmful and may be protective at a given total screen time, whereas non–child-directed content and passive social media browsing are consistently associated with more internalizing and externalizing symptoms in young children and adolescents [^111385gq] [^115zcAaQ]. Active versus passive use shows differential effects: active social media use (posting, messaging) can be neutral or slightly positive, whereas passive scrolling correlates with worse well-being, and time-use diary studies link social media time to higher depression and self-harm risk in adolescent girls even after adjustment [^115zcAaQ] [^114dJrnM]. Hold on, I should verify modality effects — replacing 60 minutes of television or social media with team sports yields larger reductions in later emotional distress than replacing other screen uses, underscoring content-specific benefits of substitution strategies [^116AGXLy].

> Next, I should review age and gender differences. Adolescents appear more sensitive to screen-related harms, especially internalizing symptoms, with some studies suggesting peak vulnerability windows around early adolescence for girls and mid-adolescence for boys, though findings are heterogeneous and not always statistically significant in subgroup analyses [^111XLBVX] [^112iUuSq]. Girls seem more adversely affected by social media and appearance-related comparison, whereas boys may be more affected by gaming and attentional impacts; nonetheless, both high and low screen use can reflect underlying vulnerabilities, and genetic confounding varies by phenotype, complicating simple sex-specific prescriptions [^115zcAaQ] [^1147RCu5]. Let me reconsider — given heterogeneity, individualized assessment of content, context, and baseline mental health is prudent rather than blanket thresholds by sex alone [^112iUuSq].

> I will now examine the roles of physical activity and sleep as protective factors. Higher physical activity is independently associated with better mental health and can buffer screen-related harms; in adolescents, even 1–2 days/week of moderate activity confers benefits, and team sports may offer additional psychosocial gains, while WHO guidance supports at least 60 minutes/day of MVPA for youth [^116VNX5M] [^1165Couh]. Sleep duration and timing are tightly linked to mental health; short sleep (< 7 hours) and excessive screen time (> 4 hours/day) independently predict worse outcomes, and optimizing both yields additive benefits within a 24-hour behavior framework [^114qVxTt]. Hmm, wait a minute — does evening screen use directly impair sleep quality beyond displacement? Yes, evidence supports blue light–mediated melatonin suppression and circadian misalignment, reinforcing bedtime screen limits as a clinical target [^1143pC5k] [^117KBvPo].

> But wait, what about limitations and study quality? I should confirm key caveats. Many studies rely on self-report, risking misclassification and social desirability bias; objective measures (device logs, screenshots) are preferable but still rarely capture content or multitasking, and genetic confounding can inflate environmental associations in youth, necessitating caution in causal inference [^116FHuXq] [^117QTFuU]. Interventions are typically short (1–3 weeks), with rapid rebound of screen time post-intervention, limiting durability claims, and most trials enroll relatively healthy, high-socioeconomic samples, raising generalizability concerns and potential floor effects on mental health scales [^1123Dkjg] [^1122SNoz]. Hold on, I should verify — despite these limitations, convergent RCTs, longitudinal cohorts, and meta-analyses yield a coherent signal that reducing screen time improves mental health, albeit with small-to-moderate effects and context dependence [^113mRDKk].

> Translating to clinical guidance, I need to ensure recommendations are feasible and evidence-aligned. For children and adolescents, aim for ≤ 2 hours/day of recreational screen time when possible, prioritize educational and prosocial content, minimize passive social media and non–child-directed content, and implement bedtime screen curfews to protect sleep. Family-based interventions that reduce leisure screen use for all members can improve adherence and magnify mental health gains [^114ZNxPb] [^113mRDKk] [^116xj7e2]. For adults, encourage mindful, time-limited use, substitution with in-person social interaction and physical activity, and periodic "digital detox" days, recognizing that strict thresholds are less established but moderation remains sensible [^116Yzyi2]. I should double-check that I am not overgeneralizing — individualized plans based on baseline use, mental health status, and context are essential, and motivational strategies may improve sustained behavior change where simple limits fail [^115nPJ2R].

> Finally, public health implications. Given pervasive excess screen exposure and low adherence to guidelines, especially post-pandemic, population-level strategies should couple screen reduction with sleep and physical activity promotion within a 24-hour behavior framework, address socioeconomic disparities in access to active alternatives, and incorporate content regulation and digital literacy education to mitigate harmful exposures like cyberbullying and appearance-based social comparison [^116LEoj2] [^115xtTdb] [^111K21ZD]. Hold on, I should verify the regulatory angle — growing advocacy for stricter social media policies for youth reflects the observed harms and the difficulty of voluntary self-regulation, but evidence-based, equitable implementation remains critical to avoid unintended consequences [^1122SNoz].

Screen time is linked to **higher risks of depression, anxiety, and sleep problems**, with the strongest evidence for adolescents and for passive social media use [^115xThEp] [^117KBvPo] [^115zcAaQ] [^114dJrnM]. Experimental reductions in screen time **improve mental health** in youth and young adults, supporting a causal relationship [^113mRDKk] [^1123Dkjg]. Effects are **dose-dependent** and modified by content, context, and individual factors; active, social, and educational use are less harmful than passive scrolling or violent content [^115xtTdb] [^115zcAaQ]. Limiting daily screen time, especially social media, and increasing physical activity and sleep are key strategies to reduce harm [^1165Couh] [^116LEoj2].

---

## Associations between screen time and mental health outcomes

### Depression and anxiety

- **Adolescents**: Higher daily screen time, especially > 2–3 hours, is consistently associated with increased depression and anxiety symptoms [^113u8VGR] [^1143Rqi6].
- **Social media**: Passive social media use is particularly linked to higher depression and anxiety, especially in girls [^114dJrnM] [^115zcAaQ].
- **Dose-response**: Risk rises with more screen time, indicating a dose-dependent relationship [^113HkBtD] [^115xtTdb].

---

### Sleep disturbances

- **Sleep quality**: Higher screen time, particularly before bedtime, is associated with poorer sleep quality, shorter duration, and delayed sleep onset [^117KBvPo] [^1143pC5k].
- **Mechanism**: Blue light and stimulating content disrupt circadian rhythms and increase arousal, impairing sleep [^1143pC5k].
- **Adolescents**: Sleep problems are especially pronounced in adolescents with high screen use [^115G2bze].

---

### Attention and cognitive functioning

Attention problems are positively associated with increased screen time, particularly in children and adolescents [^1157zZNL]. Excessive screen use can impair executive function, including impulse control and working memory [^notfound].

---

## Experimental evidence: causal relationships

Randomized and quasi-experimental studies provide evidence for **causality**:

- **Family-based reduction**: A 2-week family screen reduction improved children's internalizing symptoms and prosocial behavior [^113mRDKk] [^114eREwa].
- **Smartphone reduction**: A 3-week reduction to ≤ 2 hours/day improved depression, stress, sleep, and well-being in university students [^1123Dkjg].
- **Social media abstinence**: Brief abstinence from social media improves mood and reduces anxiety and depression symptoms [^111XLBVX].

---

## Mechanisms underlying screen time's mental health effects

Several mechanisms explain these associations:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Displacement | Screen time displaces sleep, physical activity, and in-person social interaction, worsening mental health [^1115Sm3F] [^117KBvPo] [^111XLBVX] |
| Content effects | Harmful content (violence, cyberbullying, social comparison) increases anxiety, depression, and body dissatisfaction [^111K21ZD] [^115zcAaQ] |
| Neurobiological effects | Excessive screen use can alter reward pathways, stress responses, and sleep regulation, affecting mood and cognition [^1143pC5k] |
| Genetic predisposition | Shared genetic risk may partly explain screen time–mental health links, especially for attention and internalizing problems [^117QTFuU] |

---

## Moderating factors

The impact of screen time varies by **individual and contextual factors**:

- **Age**: Adolescents are more vulnerable than younger children or adults.
- **Gender**: Girls are more affected by social media and appearance-related content.
- **Content type**: Educational or active use is less harmful than passive entertainment or social media.
- **Individual differences**: Baseline mental health, personality, and coping style moderate effects [^112iUuSq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinicians and public health experts recommend:

- **Limit screen time**: Aim for < 2 hours/day of recreational screen time, especially social media [^114dJrnM] [^113u8VGR].
- **Prioritize sleep and activity**: Ensure adequate sleep and daily physical activity to offset screen-related harms [^111jcZAX] [^115xtTdb].
- **Content and context**: Encourage educational, active, and social use; avoid passive scrolling and harmful content [^115zcAaQ] [^111385gq].
- **Family involvement**: Use family-based interventions to reduce screen time and improve adherence [^113mRDKk] [^116xj7e2].

---

## Gaps and future research

- **Long-term effects**: More longitudinal studies are needed to assess durability and trajectories.
- **Causality**: Further experimental work should clarify mechanisms and identify high-risk subgroups.
- **Interventions**: Develop scalable, effective interventions targeting content, context, and behavior change [^111385gq].

Screen time is **linked to worse mental health**, especially depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, with stronger effects in adolescents and with passive social media use. Reducing screen time — particularly social media — and increasing physical activity and sleep yield measurable mental health benefits, and effects are shaped by content, context, and individual factors [^1123Dkjg] [^1165Couh].

### The health effects of video games in children and adolescents [^116JUq3B]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Play has always been an essential part of childhood, but it looks different for modern children, who increasingly engage in virtual play. More than 90% of children older than 2 years play video games, and three-quarters of American households own a video game console. Children 8 to 17 years of age spend an average of 1.5 to 2 hours daily playing video games. Recent developments framed by decades of research have provided insight into how games influence children's physical health, mental health, social behaviors, and cognitive development. Anticipatory guidance surrounding media use is often centered on screen time, but pediatricians should have some knowledge of the unique benefits and risks associated with this nearly ubiquitous activity. In light of the recent addition of gaming disorder to the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision, this review includes a discussion of the epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of gaming disorder, including the use of existing screening tools. As games become more popular while ever-increasing in scope and complexity, this review aims to educate the modern pediatric provider about what is known, what is uncertain, and how to use this knowledge in the management of both healthy and unhealthy video gaming in children.

### Chronotype and mental health: are late sleepers more vulnerable? [^116yFusY]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Many epidemiological studies have also associated outdoor artificial light at night (ALAN) with negative mental health outcomes. From a human physiology perspective, ALAN levels in residential areas are typically low, and the use of curtains, blinds, or other forms of indoor light shielding further reduces actual exposure to ALAN. As a result, most individuals encounter only minimal levels of outdoor light at night, making the direct physiological impact on mental health likely negligible. In addition, ALAN is highly confounded by urbanization: areas with higher outdoor light levels also tend to exhibit other features, such as noise pollution, higher population density, reduced green space, socioeconomic inequality, and increased nighttime activity, all of which can independently contribute to poor mental health outcomes.

(5) Other considerations. It is essential to consider both economic and social factors in relation to the relationship between behavioral timing and mental health. Early bedtimes are associated with contextual and socioeconomic factors that may impact health. For instance, adolescents with earlier bedtimes often come from lower-resource environments and have reduced access to digital devices, the internet, and extracurricular activities. Conversely, later bedtimes in youth are often associated with greater access to screens and more autonomy over evening routines. In adults, shift work, crowded living conditions, or caregiving responsibilities may also delay sleep timing, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. These contextual influences can confound the relationship between sleep timing and mental health and may partially explain why late timing is more prevalent in certain demographic groups. Therefore, interpretations of behavioral timing must be situated within a social determinants of health framework, especially when assessing psychiatric risk in youth, underserved communities, or marginalized populations. Future research should actively examine how structural inequities, such as housing instability and occupational demands, intersect with sleep behaviors to shape health outcomes.

### Active behaviors and screen time in offspring of parents with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia [^111QeW3g]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Activities may be modifiable factors that moderate the risk and resilience in the development of mental health and illness. Youth who spend more time using screens are more likely to have poor mental health. Conversely, time spent engaged in active behaviors (i.e., physical activity, socializing and reading) is associated with better mental health. The choice of activities may be important in offspring of parents with mental illness, who are at increased risk for developing mental disorders. Among 357 youth of the FORBOW (Families Overcoming Risks and Building Opportunities for Well-being) cohort aged 6–21, we examined whether parental diagnosis of mental illness (i.e., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) and current levels of depression influenced the amount of time their offspring spent using screens and engaging in active behaviors. Parental history of mental illness and higher levels of current depression in mothers were associated with less time spent engaged in active behaviors and more time spent using screens. Creating opportunities and incentives for active behaviors may redress the balance between youth with and without a familial history of mental illness.

### Shared genetic risk in the association of screen time with psychiatric problems in children [^1146APsz]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The potential adverse association between screen time and child mental health are widely discussed. A recent meta-analysis of 87 studies found that longer duration of screen time was associated with small increases in child internalizing problems (r = 0.07). Another study suggested that screen time was associated with more childhood attention problems. Similarly, a large-scale population-based study in the US reported that screen time of more than 4 hours per day was associated with increased mood and attention problems among children and adolescents. Although some inconsistent results have emerged, excessive screen time is widely recognized to be associated with child psychiatric problems.

Although phenotypic associations between screen time and psychiatric problems have been widely studied, the potential role of genetics in these associations remains largely unknown. Child psychiatric problems, including attention and internalizing problems, are affected by genetics. Scientists have begun to investigate how genes play a role in behavioral traits, suggesting that genetic variants could affect screen time through neurodevelopmental pathways by altering central nervous system genetic expression. Shared genetic risk factors (pleiotropy) are common and of relevance to many genetic variants identified in behavioral genetic research. Ignoring genetic associations with behavioral traits may bias research examining environmental outcomes. As both screen time and psychiatric problems could be directly affected by genetic factors, an individual genotype as a common cause (ie, genetic confounding) may generate noncausal associations between child screen time and psychiatric problems. Given the interest in improving child well-being by reducing screen time, evaluating potential genetic confounding to better identify the causal association between screen time and child psychiatric problems has public health implications.

### Association of children's physical activity and screen time with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116VNX5M]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Children's physical activity and screen time are likely suboptimal during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may influence their current and future mental health.

Objective

To describe the association of physical activity and screen time with mental health among US children during the pandemic.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional survey was conducted from October 22 to November 2, 2020, among 547 parents of children aged 6 to 10 years and 535 parent-child dyads with children and adolescents (hereinafter referred to as children) aged 11 to 17 years and matched down to 500 children per cohort using US Census-based sampling frames. Children aged 11 to 17 years self-reported physical activity, screen time, and mental health, and their parents reported other measures. Parents of children aged 6 to 10 years reported all measures. All 1000 cases were further weighted to a sampling frame corresponding to US parents with children aged 6 to 17 years using propensity scores.

Exposures

Child physical activity, screen time, COVID-19 stressors, and demographics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mental health using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for total difficulties and externalizing and internalizing symptoms.

Results

Among the 1000 children included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 10.8 [3.5] years; 517 [52.6%] boys; 293 [31.6%] American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, or Black individuals or individuals of other race; and 233 [27.8%] Hispanic/Latino individuals), 195 (20.9%) reported at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day. Children reported a mean (SD) of 3.9 (2.2) d/wk with at least 60 minutes of physical activity and 4.4 (2.5) h/d of recreational screen time. COVID-19 stressors were significantly associated with higher total difficulties for both younger (β coefficient,0.6; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9) and older (β coefficient, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.0–0.7) groups. After accounting for COVID-19 stressors, engaging in 7 d/wk (vs 0) of physical activity was associated with fewer externalizing symptoms in younger children (β coefficient,-2.0; 95% CI, -3.4 to -0.6). For older children, engaging in 1 to 6 and 7 d/wk (vs 0) of physical activity was associated with lower total difficulties (βcoefficients, -3.5 [95% CI, -5.3 to -1.8] and -3.6 [95% CI, -5.8 to -1.4], respectively), fewer externalizing symptoms (βcoefficients, -1.5 [95% CI, -2.5 to -0.4] and -1.3 [95% CI, -2.6 to 0], respectively), and fewer internalizing symptoms (βcoefficients,-2.1 [95% CI, -3.0 to -1.1] and -2.3 [95% CI, -3.5 to -1.1], respectively). More screen time was correlated with higher total difficulties among younger (βcoefficient,0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.5) and older (βcoefficient,0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–0.6) children. There were no significant differences by sex.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional survey study, more physical activity and less screen time were associated with better mental health for children, accounting for pandemic stressors. Children engaged in suboptimal amounts of physical activity and screen time, making this a potentially important target for intervention.

### Association of children's physical activity and screen time with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic [^111q28CD]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Although much of the immediate health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on infection and its sequelae, this cross-sectional study highlights the critical need to also address the short- and long-term consequences of the pandemic on the mental health of children. Although there is notable concern regarding pandemic-related increases in weight gain and obesity rates, this study underscores that the same behaviors of screen time and physical inactivity are also associated with poorer mental health outcomes in children. Before the pandemic, three-quarters of school-aged children in the US failed to meet physical activity guidelines; this situation has been exacerbated by pandemic-related circumstances and is particularly worse for middle and high school students. There is thus a critical need to reimagine multisector approaches to providing equitable opportunities for physical activity, including sports and outdoor recreation, for all children.

### Prevalence and correlates of screen time in youth: an international perspective [^115J3mxj]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Screen time (including TV viewing/computer use) may be adversely associated with metabolic and mental health in children.

Purpose

To describe the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of screen time in an international sample of children aged 4–17 years.

Methods

Data from the International Children's Accelerometry Database were collected between 1997–2009 and analyzed in 2013. Participants were 11,434 children (48.9% boys; mean [SD] age at first assessment, 11.7 [3.2] years). Exposures were sex, age, weight status, maternal education, and ethnicity. The outcome was self- or proxy-reported screen time < 2 or > 2 hours/day. Analyses were conducted initially at study level and then combined using random-effects meta-analysis.

Results

Within each contributing study, at least two thirds of participants exceeded 2 hours/day of screen time. In meta-analytic models, overweight or obese children were more likely to exceed 2 hours/day of screen time than those who were non-overweight (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.33,1.88). Girls (vs boys: 0.65; 0.54, 0.78) and participants with more highly educated mothers (vs < university level: 0.53; 0.42, 0.68) were less likely to exceed 2 hours/day of screen time. Associations of age and ethnicity with screen time were inconsistent at study level and non-significant in pooled analyses.

Conclusions

Screen time in excess of public health guidelines was highly prevalent, particularly among boys, those who were overweight or obese, and those with mothers of lower educational attainment. The population-attributable risk associated with this exposure is potentially high; further efforts to understand the determinants of within- and between-country variation in these behaviors and inform the development of effective behavior change intervention programs is warranted.

### Screen time and sleep among school-aged children and adolescents: a systematic literature review [^117KBvPo]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

We systematically examined and updated the scientific literature on the association between screen time (e.g., television, computers, video games, and mobile devices) and sleep outcomes among school-aged children and adolescents. We reviewed 67 studies published from 1999 to early 2014. We found that screen time is adversely associated with sleep outcomes (primarily shortened duration and delayed timing) in 90% of studies. Some of the results varied by type of screen exposure, age of participant, gender, and day of the week. While the evidence regarding the association between screen time and sleep is consistent, we discuss limitations of the current studies: 1) causal association not confirmed; 2) measurement error (of both screen time exposure and sleep measures); 3) limited data on simultaneous use of multiple screens, characteristics and content of screens used. Youth should be advised to limit or reduce screen time exposure, especially before or during bedtime hours to minimize any harmful effects of screen time on sleep and well-being. Future research should better account for the methodological limitations of the extant studies, and seek to better understand the magnitude and mechanisms of the association. These steps will help the development and implementation of policies or interventions related to screen time among youth.

### Intervention to reduce recreational screen-time in adolescents: outcomes and mediators from the 'switch-off 4 healthy minds' (S4HM) cluster randomized controlled trial [^115nPJ2R]. Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The primary objective was to evaluate the impact of the 'Switch-off 4 Healthy Minds' (S4HM) intervention on recreational screen-time in adolescents.

Methods

Cluster randomized controlled trial with study measures at baseline and 6-months (post-intervention). Eligible participants reported exceeding recreational screen-time recommendations (i.e., > 2h/day). In total, 322 adolescents (mean age = 14.4 ± 0.6years) from eight secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia were recruited. The S4HM intervention was guided by Self-Determination Theory and included: an interactive seminar, eHealth messaging, a behavioral contract and parental newsletters. The primary outcome was recreational screen-time. Secondary outcomes included mental health (i.e., well-being, psychological distress, self-perceptions), objectively measured physical activity, and body mass index (BMI). Outcome analyses were conducted using linear mixed models and mediation was examined using a product-of-coefficients test.

Results

At post-intervention, significant reductions in screen-time were observed in both groups, with a greater reduction observed in the intervention group (-50min/day versus -29min, p < 0.05 for both). However, the adjusted difference in change between groups was not statistically significant (mean = -21.3min/day, p = 0.255). There were no significant intervention effects for mental health outcomes, physical activity or BMI. Significant mediation effects for autonomous motivation were found.

Conclusions

Participants in both the S4HM intervention and control groups significantly reduced their screen-time, with no group-by-time effects. Enhancing autonomous motivation might be a useful intervention target for trials aimed at reducing adolescents' recreational screen-time.

### A scoping review of physical activity and screen time guidelines for use in outside school hours care [^111jcZAX]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Rationale

Physical activity (PA) is associated with an array of health benefits across the lifespan, such as improved cardiovascular health, reduced rates of obesity, cancer and other non-communicable diseases. In children aged 5–17 years, specifically, it has been linked with improved body composition, cardiovascular and metabolic health, cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness, academic achievement and cognition, improved mental health and quality of life, emotional regulation and social behaviour. In addition, excessive recreational screen time has been associated with a wide range of physical and mental health deficits. Since around the 2000s, PA and sedentary behaviour (including recreational screen time) have been viewed as being "independent" health behaviours, with independent health impacts. However, more recently, the field has recognised that daily activities are constrained within the 24-h day, and that more time on one activity must necessarily mean less time for something else, leading to a "whole-of-day" or integrated approach. In keeping with this paradigm shift, the latest iterations of children's PA guidelines published by the World Health Organization, and various countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Finland and Croatia recommend that each day children aged 5–17 years should get at least 60 min of moderate- to- vigorous physical activity (MVPA), no more than 2 h of recreational screen time and between 9 and 11 h of sleep for children aged 5–13 years, or 8–10 h of sleep for those aged 14–17 years.

Despite these clear and achievable guidelines, the most recent PA global matrix conducted in 2018 identified that that only 40 to 46% of children between the ages of 5 and 17 years in high income countries (such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Spain) were achieving the recommended levels of PA. Low- to middle- income countries and high income countries had similar low PA prevalence of 40–46% and 34–39% respectively. Results are similar for screen time use. The same global matrix identified that in children from high and very high income countries only 27–39% were adhering to the guideline of no more than 2 h recreational screen time use. This was consistent with earlier findings from Atkin in 2014 which found approximately two thirds of children exceeded the screen time guidelines. Given this low prevalence of sufficient PA, and high prevalence of excessive recreational screen time, further efforts are required to identify ways to help children achieve healthy daily MVPA and screen time.

### Childhood lifestyle behaviors and mental health symptoms in adolescence [^112dMGwn]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Mental health problems, particularly depression and anxiety, are among the leading causes of disability globally, affecting 25% to 30% of adolescents and young adults. Mental health problems often arise during adolescence and early adulthood. They are the primary cause of sickness allowance in Finnish adolescents and young adults. Therefore, identifying protective and risk factors for these disorders and targeting preventive actions among those at increased risk is crucial.

Healthy lifestyle behaviors, including high physical activity (PA) and low sedentary behavior (SB) levels, as well as sufficient sleep, have been recognized as potentially modifiable factors alleviating mental health symptoms. Regular PA is associated with a decreased risk of depression in adults, with even relatively low PA doses offering benefits. Most previous studies in children and adolescents have been cross-sectional with mixed results. PA interventions in youth have shown modest improvements inor no effectson mental health symptoms. These mixed findings suggest that contextual factors may act as moderators. Although sports participation may have the greatest favorable associations with mental health outcomes, unsupervised PA can also benefit mental health. However, characteristics of PA that may contribute to mental health, such as type, intensity, volume, contexts, and delivery, remain unclear.

Although the evidence regarding the associations of SB with mental health remains unclear, high levels of screen time (ST) have been associated with mental health problems in youth, with internet and social media use having the greatest adverse associations. Most previous studies have been cross-sectional, and only a few have used device-assessed SB. Frequent social media use may predict higher psychological distress among youth across 2 years, while device-assessed SB was inversely associated with hyperactivity in youth over 4 years.

Sleep duration has been positively associated with mental health in children and adolescents, while sleep problems have been associated with depressive symptoms in adolescents. Moreover, the recommended levels of sleep and screen time show greater associations with mental health in youth than achieving the recommended daily 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA.

### Association of children's physical activity and screen time with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114bT6Fb]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Participants

A market research company (YouGov) conducted an online, opt-in, cross-sectional survey from October 22 to November 2, 2020, and generated a US nationally representative sample of 500 parent-child dyads with children and adolescents (hereinafter referred to as children) aged 11 to 17 years and 500 parents of children aged 6 to 10 years. YouGov surveyed 547 parents of children aged 6 to 10 years and 535 parent-child dyads with children aged 11 to 17 years. Respondents were then matched down to samples of 500 in each cohort according to US Census–based sampling frames by age, race, and educational level for children aged 6 to 10 years and by sex, age, race, and educational level for children aged 11 to 17 years. Both frames were constructed by stratified probability sampling from the full 2017 American Community Survey 1-year sample, with selection within strata by weighted sampling with replacements (using the person weights on the public use file). All parents of children aged 11 to 17 years also recruited one of their children aged 11 to 17 years for a survey. All 1000 cases were further weighted to a sampling frame corresponding to US parents with children aged 6 to 17 years. Weighting was performed using propensity scores. The matched cases and the frame were combined, and a logistic regression model was estimated to construct propensity of inclusion in the frame vs the matched cases. The logistic regression included age, sex, race and ethnicity, years of education, and region. Sampling weights, which were inversely proportional to the propensity of being in the matched cases, were used in statistical analysis to reduce bias. Details for YouGov's sampling matching procedure can be found in Rivers.

This study followed the American Association for Public Opinion Research best practices for survey research and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies. Research procedures were approved by the institutional review board of Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington, which granted a waiver of written documentation of consent. All participants received information describing the research and indicated their consent/parental permission online.

### Screen media use and mental health of children and adolescents: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1169YMs9]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Participants

We recruited families from a population-based survey concerning family screen media habits. A survey invitation was sent to parents with at least 1 child aged 6 to 10 years in 10 municipalities in the region of Southern Denmark. Recipients of the survey were randomly selected by the Danish Health Data Authority using data from the Danish Civil Registration system. At the end of the survey, responders were asked to answer (yes or no) whether they were interested in receiving more information about another study: a family-based screen media reduction trial. We assessed families' eligibility among respondents who answered yes. Initial eligibility criteria were that the respondent parent had to have leisure-time screen media use above the 40th percentile (based on the first 1000 responses) and have a full-time job or study full time. We excluded families with children younger than 4 years of age living in the household. A research team member telephoned the family if these criteria were fulfilled, to confirm that at least 1 child and 1 adult in the household wanted to participate and were able to hand over smartphones and tablets to the researchers. The study also included a measurement of physical activity using accelerometers. Therefore, participants were not eligible if they could not engage in regular physical activities of daily life, had a sleep disorder, or had any neuropsychiatric or developmental disorders.

Randomization Procedure

The randomization was performed on day 8 of the trial after completion of baseline assessments in the families' homes. A web-based randomization platform operated by a third party (Odense Patient Data Explorative Network) was used to perform the randomization. The Odense Patient Data Explorative Network generated the random sequence in blocks of 2 to 4 families and ensured allocation concealment until a family was assigned to a group. We chose to randomize and intervene on a family level rather than based on individuals to increase compliance with the intervention and decrease potential contamination between experimental conditions.

### The phenotypic and genetic relationship between adolescent mental health and time spent on social media, gaming, and TV [^1147RCu5]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Screen use is linked to adverse mental health outcomes in adolescents, but how associations vary across psychiatric diagnoses, mental symptoms, and types of screen-based activities remain unclear. The contribution of genetic factors to these associations is also largely unknown. We analysed data from 23,790 adolescents (aged 14–16) in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), linking questionnaire responses on screen use to registry-based psychiatric diagnoses and self-reported symptoms. Using regression models, we assessed associations between mental health outcomes and gaming, social media use, and TV watching. We also evaluated whether genetic liability to psychiatric disorders, as indexed by polygenic scores (PGSs), was associated with screen use, and estimated the degree of genetic confounding. Spending 3–4 h/day or more on any screen-based activity was associated with increased odds of a lifetime diagnosis of depressive, anxiety/stress-related, and hyperkinetic disorders. Similarly, minimal social media engagement was associated with increased odds of psychiatric diagnoses, particularly pervasive developmental disorders. Associations with self-reported symptoms closely followed those observed for clinical diagnoses. PGSs for major depression, anorexia nervosa, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder were associated with screen use, suggesting shared genetic liability. Moreover, a substantial proportion of the phenotypic associations appeared to be attributable to genetic confounding. Our findings suggest a complex, bidirectional relationship between screen use and adolescent mental health. Both high and low screen use may reflect underlying mental health vulnerabilities, with shared genetic susceptibility playing an important role. These results support the need for individualized, context-sensitive screen use guidelines.

### Associations between screen time and emotional and behavioral problems among children and adolescents in US, national health interview survey (NHIS), 2022 [^1143Rqi6]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive screen time is associated with physical health, behavior, and cognitive development. Recognizing childhood and adolescence as crucial periods for mental health development, we examine the association of screen time with mental health in children and adolescents.

Method

This cross-sectional study included 4932 children and adolescents aged 6–17 years. Information on screen time and mental health was obtained through questionnaires reported by a parent or guardian. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to evaluate children's mental health, followed by categorization into normal and abnormal groups.

Results

3742 participants(weighted prevalence was 70.05% CI 68.44%-71.67%) had more than two hours of screen time. After adjusting for confounders, excessive screen time was significantly associated with emotional symptoms, conduct problems, peer relationship issues, and higher total difficulties in children and adolescents. The odds ratios were 1.75 (95% CI, 1.29–2.37; P < 0.001) for emotional symptoms, 1.73 (95% CI, 1.19–2.52; P = 0.004) for conduct problems, 1.46 (95% CI, 1.11–1.93; P = 0.009) for peer relationships, and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.17–2.52; P = 0.006) for total difficulties score.

Limitations

Cross-sectional analyses cannot establish causality of the associations.

Conclusions

Significant association were found between excessive screen time and emotional problems, conduct problems, peer relationships, and total difficulties. Children and adolescents need wise guidance in using electronic devices, and timely attention should be given to the potential challenges associated with excessive screen time. Further investigation is deemed necessary to assess causality and elucidate potential mechanisms.

### Screen media use and mental health of children and adolescents: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112iUuSq]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

There were some indications that boys, compared with girls, and that children aged 8 to 10 years, compared with those aged 4 to 7 years and 11 to 17 years might respond better to the screen reduction intervention. This difference in response might be caused by different types of engagement with screen media devices and use of different screen media content across sex and age groups, which could affect mental health differently. Also, the results suggest that the intervention may have a greater effect among children and adolescents with higher levels of screen media use and higher total difficulties scores at baseline. However, these subgroup differences were not statistically significant. Given that our study sample was drawn from a general population of children and adolescents, rather than from a high-risk group, a large portion of the participants reported minimal behavioral difficulties. This left limited room for improvement but stresses the need for further trials in high-risk groups. In the analysis stratified by baseline level of the total difficulties score, a more pronounced favorable effect of the intervention was observed among individuals scoring above the median for total difficulties. In contrast, we observed no significant intervention effect among those scoring below the median for total difficulties score at baseline. However, future studies are needed to investigate whether reducing screen media use has a greater effect among groups with higher total difficulties scores.

### When is the best time to screen for perinatal anxiety? A longitudinal cohort study [^113wuFnC]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

For screening for anxiety during pregnancy and after birth to be efficient and effective it is important to know the optimal time to screen in order to identify women who might benefit from treatment.

Aims

To determine the optimal time to screen for perinatal anxiety to identify women with anxiety disorders and those who want treatment. A secondary aim was to examine the stability and course of perinatal anxiety over time.

Methods

Prospective longitudinal cohort study of 2243 women who completed five screening questionnaires of anxiety and mental health symptoms in early pregnancy (11 weeks), mid-pregnancy (23 weeks), late pregnancy (32 weeks) and postnatally (8 weeks). Anxiety and mental health questionnaires were the GAD7, GAD2, SAAS, CORE-10 and Whooley questions. To establish presence of anxiety disorders diagnostic interviews were conducted with a subsample of 403 participants.

Results

Early pregnancy was the optimal time to screen for anxiety to identify women with anxiety disorders and women wanting treatment at any time during pregnancy or postnatally. These findings were consistent across all five questionnaires of anxiety and mental health. Receiving treatment for perinatal mental health problems was most strongly associated with late pregnancy and/or postnatal assessments. Anxiety symptoms were highest in early pregnancy and decreased over time.

Conclusion

Findings show that screening in early pregnancy is optimal for identifying women who have, or develop, anxiety disorders and who want treatment. This has clear implications for practice and policy for anxiety screening during the perinatal period.

### Screen media use and mental health of children and adolescents: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114eREwa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Results from this cluster randomized clinical trial showed that reducing leisure-time screen media use in families for a period of 2 weeks had a significant positive effect on children's and adolescents' mental health. Considering the different mental subdomains, a reduction in screen media use resulted in improvements in internalizing symptoms (emotional symptoms and peer problems) and prosocial behavior. This finding suggests that while limiting screen media use had a broad positive effect on behavioral difficulties, the most pronounced benefits associated with limiting screen media use may be in mitigating internalizing behavioral issues and enhancing positive social interactions among children and adolescents.

To our knowledge, this is the first family-based randomized clinical trial examining the effect of reducing leisure-time screen media use on children's and adolescents' mental health. Our study confirms that reducing leisure-time screen media use improves several aspects of mental health among children and adolescents in the short term, which is in line with results of several observational studies showing that higher levels of screen media use are associated with poorer mental health among children and adolescents. In contrast to previous studies reporting that effect sizes on the association between screen media use and mental health were negligible, the results of our trial suggest that the effect size is moderate (Cohen d = 0.53). The observed mean difference of 1.67 points in the SDQ total difficulties score mirrors effects seen in multifocus treatments for mental health conditions among youths. When extrapolated to the Danish population of children, a downward shift in total difficulties score corresponding to the effect sizes seen among boys and girls would notably alter the distribution within the SDQ's diagnostic categories, particularly decreasing the proportion classified as abnormal for both boys and girls (eAppendix and eTable 3 in Supplement 2). However, the intervention is not designed to be implemented among families in the long term, which, in combination with the short-term follow-up of 2 weeks, limits the generalizability of the results to families' everyday lives. However, the results highlight that positive mental health effects can be achieved by taking a short break from screen media use as a family.

### Screen media use and mental health of children and adolescents: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111XLBVX]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

We can only speculate about the mechanisms underlying the positive effects of limiting screen media use on children's and adolescents' mental health. When children and adolescents spend much of their leisure time using screen media devices, a putative effect may be diminishing face-to-face social engagement with friends, peers, and family members. A possible explanation of the positive effects found among both children and adolescents could be that parents participating in the SCREENS trial also reported improved mental well-being (WHO-5 Well-being Index score), as reported previously. The positive effects may also be explained by increases in shared leisure time among family members without use of screen media devices during the intervention, potentially making room for more social interactions. Reduced interpersonal engagement could heighten emotional symptoms, manifesting as amplified feelings of isolation, loneliness, and social anxiety. Beyond the sheer volume of screen time and the potential displacement of face-to-face interactions, the specific type and content of digital engagements, especially on platforms such as social media, might play a critical role in influencing mental well-being. Randomized experiments with young or middle-aged adults indicate that limiting social media use yields positive psychological outcomes across various age groups. For instance, among college-aged individuals, short daily limits or brief breaks from social media have been associated with decreased feelings of loneliness and depression symptoms. Similarly, among adults, either taking a short break from social media or setting strict daily limits has been associated with improved well-being and reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. Also, prospective observational studies suggest that reduced and intentional social media use is associated with better mood and mental well-being among young individuals. Results from a recent observational study indicate that children and adolescents may be more sensitive to negative effects of social media during specific periods (ie, males aged 14–15 years and 19 years and females aged 11–13 years and 19 years). We did not observe any consistent age-dependent effects of reducing general leisure screen media use; however, further studies are needed to investigate this.

### Types of on-screen content and mental health in kindergarten children [^111385gq]. JAMA Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Excessive screen time has been associated with a higher risk for mental health problems, but whether the associations differ by screen content types is unclear.

Objective

To examine the allocation of and longitudinal changes in screen exposure across different content types and to explore their associations with mental health in children aged 3 to 6 years.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used 3-wave, lagged generalized estimating equation models to analyze data from the Shanghai Children's Health, Education and Lifestyle Evaluation-Preschool (SCHEDULE-P) study in Shanghai, China. The cohort was a representative sample of kindergarten children. Data were collected between November 2016 and May 2019 when children were aged 3 to 4 years (wave 1), 4 to 5 years (wave 2), and 5 to 6 years (wave 3). Data analysis was performed between June 2022 and May 2023.

Exposure

Screen exposure (total daily time and time with each type of content, including educational programs, entertainment programs, non-child-directed programs, electronic games, and social media) was collected when children were aged 3, 5, and 6 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mental health of children at age 3, 5, and 6 years was reported by parents using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.

Results

Of the 15 965 children included in the representative sample, 8270 were males (51.7%) and the mean (SD) age at wave 1 was 3.73 (0.30) years. As children developed from ages 3 to 6 years, the proportion of screen exposure to educational programs (≤ 1 hour per day: 45.0% [95% CI, 43.5%-46.5%] to 26.8% [95% CI, 25.3%-28.3%]) and entertainment programs (≤ 1 hour per day: 44.4% [95% CI, 42.8%-45.9%] to 32.1% [95% CI, 30.4%-33.9%]) decreased, whereas exposure to social media increased (≤ 1 hour per day: 1.5% [95% CI, 1.2%-1.9%] to 27.1% [95% CI, 25.5%-28.7%]). The associations between on-screen content and mental health varied. For a given total screen time, a higher proportion of screen exposure to educational programs was associated with a lower risk for mental health problems (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60–0.90), whereas non-child-directed programs were associated with a higher risk for such problems (AOR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.91–4.18). Regardless of the content, total screen time was consistently associated with mental health problems.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this study indicated that both total screen time and different types of content were associated with mental health problems in children aged 3 to 6 years. Limiting children's screen time, prioritizing educational programs, and avoiding non-child-directed programs are recommended.

### Dose-response association of screen time-based sedentary behaviour in children and adolescents and depression: a meta-analysis of observational studies [^113HkBtD]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In our meta-analysis, we quantified systematically the does–response association between ST and depression risk in preadolescent children and adolescents for the first time. The combined sample size was large. Our study supported that screen type, age, study population and reference group were potential sources of heterogeneity. The dose–response analysis showed a curvilinear association of ST with depression risk, which helped clarify the pattern of association.

Youth today are exposed to screen experience on a level never observed before. Greater efforts to disseminate information about the negative effects of too much ST in relation to risk of depression are needed to prevent negative public health outcomes of excessive ST. Such information can be distributed to parents directly or by way of educators and paediatricians. For countries or regions where screen use is not yet highly prevalent (eg, some developing countries), findings from this meta-analysis may provide a theoretical basis for development of policies or recommendations regarding appropriate ST for youth.

This study had several potential limitations. Owing to the nature of observational studies, it is difficult to exclude potential biases induced by other lifestyle factors. Although the data were adjusted for potential confounding variables in most of the included studies, such adjustments were variable across studies. Notably, most of the studies did not adjust for physical activity, even though physical activity has been shown to be a protective factor for mental health including depression. Although we performed several sensitivity analyses of excluding studies without adjustment for some important covariates, there may be other potential covariates that influenced the results, such as family history of mental illness including depression. Additionally, the measures of depression were not uniform across the studies, and not all of the included studies reported estimated effects of multiple differentiated ST, limiting a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, some other new screen types were not included in our study, such as tablets and smartphones. Further studies are needed to answer this research question. Finally, the findings in this study should be interpreted with caution; however, since 1 h/day of ST may be associated with a lower risk of depression, ST may be still associated with other risks. Dose–response association analyses between ST and other physical and mental health outcomes, such as obesity, heart disease and cancer, are needed to clarify this issue.

### Smartphone screen time reduction improves mental health: a randomized controlled trial [^1142vLpU]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Study sample

From 125, 111 students (70 females; 22.7 (± 2.6) yrs) were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 58) or control group (n = 53) (Fig. 1). Two participants were excluded (1 above the age limit, 1 in ongoing treatment) and 12 withdrew after the eligibility screening without giving reasons.

Fig. 1
Study flow chart

At baseline, screen time, physical activity (self-reported number of days per week with ≥ 60 min. of physical activity), age, gender, and mental health indicators (except disordered eating) did not differ between the intervention and control group (see Table 1). On average, participants spent 276.37 (± 115.1) minutes per day on smartphone use and reported exercising on 2.87 (± 1.8) days per week.

Screen time reduction

Control (268.22 ± 88.90) and intervention group (284.71 ± 133,64) did not differ in screen time at baseline (t = −0.771 (99.89), p = 0.443). During intervention (weeks 3–5), screen time differed significantly between the control and intervention group (see Additional file 2: Figure A1) with an average screen time of 129.46 ± 46.32 min./day (intervention group) and 264.19 ± 84.83 min./day (control group) (all p -values ≤ 0.001). The intervention group reduced their screen time by 155.25 ± 132.14 min/day. Significant screen time differences between intervention group (225.73 ± 89.06 min/day) and control group (270.42 ± 100.31 min./d (t = 0.351 (109); p = 0.014) only persisted to the first post-intervention week (week 6). From week 7 onwards no differences in screen time were observed.

Although all participants significantly reduced screen time during intervention phase (weeks 3–5), not all participants managed to reduce their screen time to the predetermined time limit. Therefore, an additional subgroup analysis was carried out with those who strictly adhered to the limits (≤ 2 h/d). There was no baseline difference between this subgroup compared to control group as well as to the other part of the intervention group, which did not strictly adhered to the time limit (see Additional file 3: Table 1).

### Smartphone screen time reduction improves mental health: a randomized controlled trial [^112cywTZ]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of smartphone screen time reduction on mental health indicators. The primary a priori hypothesis was that mental health would improve after the intervention compared to the control group as well as compared to baseline.

Registration

The 'Digital Detox Study' (10.17605/OSF. IO/A9K76) followed the CONSORT guidelines for randomized trials. The protocol was registered on November 8, 2023, at Open Science Framework (OSF) prior to enrollment and aligned with the required data set of the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. In addition, the study was retrospectively registered to ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 March 2024 to comply with the criteria of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editor.

Hypothesis

The primary hypothesis was that mental health indicators, particularly stress, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality; would improve throughout the intervention compared to the control group as well as to baseline. No hypothesis was stated regarding follow-up effects.

### Association of children's physical activity and screen time with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114h4Lcp]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Mental Health

Child mental health was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), with the parent-reported version for children aged 6 to 10 years and the self-reported version for those aged 11 to 17 years. The SDQ total difficulties score (range, 0–20, with higher scores indicating greater psychopathology), which is the sum of the emotional, peer, behavioral, and hyperactivity subscales, has been found to be a psychometrically sound measure of overall child mental health problems. Per recommendation for use in general population samples, we also calculated scores for internalizing problems (emotional plus peer subscales [10 items; higher scores indicate more internalizing symptoms]) and externalizing problems (behavioral plus hyperactivity subscales [10 items; higher scores indicate more externalizing symptoms]). We did not analyze data from the peer subscale given lack of typical peer contact for many participants during the pandemic. Parents were also asked to report whether their child had ever been diagnosed or evaluated for mental or behavioral health conditions, including anxiety, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or behavioral problems. For analyses, we combined anxiety and depression as internalizing conditions and ADHD and behavioral problems as externalizing conditions. Parent mental health was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety, a validated screening measure for adult anxiety and depression.

COVID-19 Exposure and Impact

A shortened version of the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey was used to assess the effect of COVID-19 on the family. The COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey was developed using a rapid iterative process for ongoing and new studies in which COVID-19 may influence study outcomes. It conceptualizes exposure to potentially traumatic aspects of COVID-19 and assesses the effect of the pandemic on the family through the caregiver report. Three dimensions of this scale were used analytically: total impact (9 items), which consists of 6 items related to COVID-19 exposure (items related to family members being essential and/or health care workers or actual family exposure or illness/death related to COVID-19) and 3 items related to COVID-19 economic impact (items related to food insecurity, loss of income, and loss of health insurance).

### Workplace mental health screening: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116rb5sa]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The evidence included in this review has several limitations. First, the level of confidentiality for workers screening responses in the trials identified in this review was difficult to determine. Many of the included trials used screening administered by occupational health services of participating organisations, which may be interpreted by employees as an employer-administered survey. Therefore, included data may be prone to a self-censoring bias and potentially attenuated reporting because of employees' perception that their employers will be able to access their responses. Indeed, one included study found that only 5% of participants reported not knowing (or not having met previously) the occupational physician conducting screening related consultations, yet around 50% had known them for 5 years or more. Second, the type of feedback and advice provided to participants was not clear. Whether this feedback was generic or tailored to participants' screening responses may have important implications on their propensity to action the feedback received. Further research examining how best to provide feedback to create behaviour change conducive to improving mental health is warranted. Additionally, only included two trials included underwent cost-effectiveness analysis, one indicating favourable resultsand another indicating no cost–benefit. Future work in both research and industry should examine if the negligible benefits of screening are worth the costs of implementation.

The included trials also evaluated screening as a one-off intervention with relatively short-term follow-up measurement points ranging between 6 months and 12 months. It may be that study measurement time points informing this result may not have been long enough for changes in mental health symptoms to be observable. For example, mental healthcare shortages may delay engagement with professional care referred during screening. It is important to note here, however, that two trials did provide 5-year follow-up sickness absence data, indicating negligible benefits of both screening followed by advice and by treatment. User satisfaction with the screening programmes yielded mixed results, which somewhat opposed the wider literature reporting confidentiality issues when screening for mental health at work. Finally, the overall body of research identified is very diverse, with screening approaches, intervention delivery and assessed outcomes varying between trials.

### Association of screen time with internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in children 12 years or younger: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xThEp]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Currently, there is a lack of consensus in the literature on the association between screen time (eg, television, video games) and children's behavior problems.

Objective

To assess the association between the duration of screen time and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems among children 12 years or younger.

Data Sources

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched for articles published from January 1960 to May 2021. Reference lists were manually searched for additional studies.

Study Selection

Included studies measured screen time (ie, duration) and externalizing or internalizing behavior problems in children 12 years or younger, were observational or experimental (with baseline data), were available in English, and had data that could be transformed into an effect size. Studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded. Of 25 196 nonduplicate articles identified and screened for inclusion, 595 met the selection criteria.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Extracted variables were child age, sex, and socioeconomic status; informants and measurement type for screen time and behavior problems; study publication year; and study design and quality. Data were extracted by 2 independent coders and were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the association of screen time duration with externalizing (eg, aggression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms) and internalizing (eg, depression, anxiety) behaviors or diagnoses.

Results

Of the 595 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 87 studies met all inclusion criteria, comprising 98 independent samples and 159 425 participants (mean [SD] age, 6.07 [2.89] years; 83 246 [51.30%] male). Increased duration of screen time had a small but significant correlation with more externalizing problems (90 samples; r, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.10–0.12) and internalizing problems (43 samples; r, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05–0.08) in children. Several methodological moderators explained between-study heterogeneity. There was evidence of significant between study heterogeneity (I2 = 87.80).

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review and meta-analysis found small but significant correlations between screen time and children's behavior problems. Methodological differences across studies likely contributed to the mixed findings in the literature.

### Effect of routine mental health screening in a low-resource pediatric primary care population [^114bfgWL]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite evidence for its feasibility, the usage of mental health screening in primary care practices with overburdened providers and few referral options remains unclear. This study explores the effects of routine screening on mental health problem identification and management in a low-resource setting.

Methods

Medical records of 5 to 12 year-old children presenting for well visits before and after screening was implemented were reviewed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore associations between study period and identification/management practices. Changes in the number of visits and wait times for a co-located referral service were assessed post hoc.

Results

Parents disclosed more mental health problems, and providers initiated more workups but referred fewer patients after screening was implemented. The proportion of new visits and wait times for the referral service did not change.

Conclusions

Even in low-resource settings, screening may facilitate parental disclosure and increase clinical attention to mental health problems without overburdening referral services.

### Screen exposure, mental health and emotional well-being in the adolescent population: is it time for governments to take action [^116TbKH8]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

During the last decade, a multitude of epidemiological studies with different designs have been published assessing the association between the use of digital media and psychological well-being, including the incidence of mental disorders and suicidal behaviours. Particularly, available research has very often focused on smartphone use in teenagers, with highly addictive potential, coining the term 'problematic smartphone use' and developing specific scales to measure the addictive or problematic use of smartphones. Available studies, despite some methodological limitations and gaps in knowledge, suggest that higher screen time is associated with impaired psychological well-being, lower self-esteem, higher levels of body dissatisfaction, higher incidence of eating disorders, poorer sleeping outcomes and higher odds of depressive symptoms in adolescents. Moreover, a significant association has also been found between screen time and higher suicide risk. Finally, problematic pornography has been shown to be highly prevalent and it is a strong cause of concern to many public health departments and national governments because it might be eventually associated with aggressive sexual behaviours.

### The course of children's mental health symptoms during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic [^114ej4UX]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increases in child mental health problems, but the persistence of these changes in the post-pandemic era remains uncertain. Additionally, it is unclear whether changes in mental health problems during the pandemic exceed the anticipated increases as children age. This study controls for the linear effect of age in 1399 children, investigating the course of child-reported anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, and inattention symptoms during and after the pandemic, and identifies risk and protective factors that predict these mental health trajectories.

Methods

Children (51% male; ages 9–11 at the first timepoint) provided mental health ratings at three pandemic timepoints (July-August 2020; March-April 2021; November 2021-January 2022) and one post-pandemic timepoint (January-July 2023). Mothers reported pre-pandemic mental health (2017–2019) and socio-demographic factors. Children reported socio-demographic factors, risk (e.g. screen time, sleep), and resilience (e.g. optimism) factors during the first timepoint.

Results

Average mental health symptoms increased over time, with more children exceeding clinical cut-offs for poor mental health at each subsequent pandemic timepoint. Growth curve modeling, adjusting for age-related effects, revealed a curvilinear course of mental health symptoms across all domains. Examination of risk and protective factors revealed that pre-existing mental health symptoms and optimism were associated with the course of symptoms.

Conclusions

After considering age effects, children's mental health follows a curvilinear pattern over time, suggesting an initial decline followed by a rising trend in symptoms post-COVID. These findings underscore the continued need for additional resources and timely, evidence-based mental health prevention and intervention for children.

### Smartphone screen time and suicide risk in daily life captured through high-resolution screenshot data [^1149v4W5]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite increased attention and prevention efforts, suicide rates in the U.S. continue to rise, with an approximate 2.6% increase from 2021 to 2022, resulting in over 49,000 deaths. Such increases have been met with concern regarding cultural or societal phenomena that may be contributing. Across popular press, and scientific literature, smartphones have become a prominent focus of interest. Smartphones have become pervasive in our daily lives, with over 310 million smartphone users in the U.S. representing approximately 96% of the population. While smartphones may be viewed as a near necessity, with many adults relying on them for internet access, their impact on mental and social health is complex and not well understood. However, a key feature of smartphone use – screen time – has shown promise in understanding the potential link with suicidality.

Many individuals report feeling like they spend too much time on their smartphones and that screen time harms their mental health and social relationships; notably, over one-third of individuals report using their smartphones "almost constantly". This lived experience perspective parallels a rise in scientific literature outlining the concerns of too much screen time. Research has linked the amount of screen time to mental health difficulties, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors. For example, researchers have consistently found a positive association between the amount of screen time and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in both cross-sectionaland longitudinalstudy designs.

Yet, the limitations of this prior research leave many questions unanswered, including the specific impact of smartphone screen time on suicide risk. Indeed, prior research has often examined the cumulative effect of screen time across types of screen exposure (i.e. smartphone, video games, television). However, given the increasing presence of smartphones in individuals' daily lives, combined with the fact that smartphones were the most used device in prior screen time research, there is a need to study the unique impact of smartphone screen time on suicide risk. It is also notable that research to date has heavily relied on self-reported screen time. While a product of technological limitations, this approach likely underestimated actual screen time, potentially attenuating the strength of known relationships. Thus, an objective assessment of smartphone screen time would provide a more accurate portrayal of the potential impact of smartphone screen time in relation to suicide risk.

### Is social media screen time really associated with poor adolescent mental health? A time use diary study [^114dJrnM]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is increasing concern regarding the potential impact of social media use on the mental health of young people. Previous research has relied heavily on retrospective accounts of social media screen-time. Yet recent evidence suggests that such self-report measures are unreliable, correlating poorly with more objective measures of social media use. In principle, time use diaries provide a less biased measure of social media use.

Methods

We analysed cross-sectional data from the Millennium Cohort Study to explore associations between social media screen-time as recorded in time use diaries (TUD) and key mental health outcomes - self-harm in the past year, depressive symptoms (Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire), self-esteem (shortened Rosenberg scale) - in adolescence. Social media TUD data were available for 4,032 participants (25.4% aged 13; 73.5% aged 14; 1.1% aged 15).

Results

Following adjustment for confounders, a greater amount of time spent on social media was associated with an increased risk of self-harm (adjusted OR per 30-minute increase in weekday use: 1.13, 95%CI 1.06 to 1.21) and depression (adjusted B = = 0.36, 95%CI 0.22 to 0.50) and lower levels of self-esteem (adjusted B = -0.12, 95%CI -0.20 to -0.04) in females. Findings were similar for weekday and weekend use.

Limitations

The cross-sectional nature of the data limits inference in relation to the causal direction of these associations.

Conclusions

Future research should examine the direction of the associations with self-harm and other mental health outcomes and explore gender differences in how adolescents engage with social media as well as how much time they spend online.

### Effects of limiting digital screen use on well-being, mood, and biomarkers of stress in adults [^116Yzyi2]. Npj Mental Health Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The proportion of adults with indicators of poor mental health (i.e. anxiety disorders, depression, and general mental well-being) has increased during the last decade in many countries –. During this same period, notable changes have occurred in digital technology and how to screen devices are used. Digital screen use has become a major part of people's lives. Screen media devices provide endless opportunities such as checking the latest news, e-mails, scrolling through social media sites, streaming movies and series, or video calling friends, and much more. Although, each of these activities are not necessarily beneficial or harmful, the ubiquitous availability of digital devices and the high levels of engagement and social expectation to always be available may impact both physical and mental health. The worries about the potential harm continue to be debated heavily among health professionals, educators, and researchers –.

Digital screen use has been linked to lower self-reported mental health (e.g. increased levels of depression, perceived stress, and negative mood) in adults. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that high screen media use was associated with a 28% increase in the odds of depression based on data from seven longitudinal and 12 cross-sectional studies. Also, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 37 cross-sectional studies reported a significant positive association between smartphone use and stress and anxiety. While the findings based on observational studies may be affected by uncontrolled confounding or information bias caused by use of self-reported screen use, another major limitation is the possibility of reverse causation — that is, that recreational screen use is increased as a consequence of mental health issues. Recently, a few experimental studies have investigated the short-term effects of reducing social media use (not overall recreational screen use) on mental health –. However, evidence is still inconclusive primarily due to methodological limitations such as lack of objective assessment of intervention compliance or non-compliance to the intervention.

### Smartphone screen time reduction improves mental health: a randomized controlled trial [^1123Dkjg]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Smartphone screen time has risen sharply in recent years. Even though an association between smartphone use and mental health is well documented, it is still unclear whether this is simply a correlation or causality. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of smartphone screen time reduction on mental health indicators.

Methods

This non-blinded, parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed to investigate the impact of a 3-week screen time reduction to ≤ 2 h/d in healthy students on stress (PSQ), well-being (WHO-5), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and sleep quality (ISI) at baseline (t0), post-intervention (t1), and at follow-up (t2 = 6 weeks after t1). For the intention to treat analysis, repeated measures ANOVAs and post-hoc tests (for time as well as group differences) were performed and effect sizes were presented as partial eta squared (η 2 = time × group) and group-mean differences.

Results

In total, 111 out of 125 healthy students (70 females; mean age = 22.68 ± 2.6 years; mean screen time = 276 ± 115.1 min/day) were randomly assigned to intervention — (n = 58; 3 weeks of screen time reduction to ≤ 2 h/day) or control group (n = 53). Although no differences were observed at baseline (t0), significant post-intervention (t1) effects of small to medium size were observed on well-being (η 2 = .053), depressive symptoms (η 2 = .109), sleep quality (η 2 = .048), and stress (η 2 = .085). Significant group differences (p ≤ .05) were found post-intervention (t1) for depressive symptoms (Mean Difference (MD) = 2.11, Standard Error (SE) = 0.63, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [0.87, 3.36]), sleep quality (MD = 2.59, SE = 0.97, 95% CI [0.66, 4.51]), well-being (MD = -1.54, SE = 0.68, 95% CI [.-2.89, -0.18]), and stress (MD = 6.91, SE = 3.48, 95% CI [0.01, 13.81]). Screen time increased rapidly after the intervention and at follow-up the values were once again approaching the initial level.

Conclusions

The study highlights mental health improvements through smartphone screen time reduction. Three weeks of screen time reduction showed small to medium effect sizes on depressive symptoms, stress, sleep quality, and well-being. The results suggest a causal relationship, rather than a merely correlative one, between daily smartphone screen time and mental health.

Trial registration

The study was preregistered on Open Science Framework (trial registration number: A9K76) on November 8, 2023.

### Smartphone screen time reduction improves mental health: a randomized controlled trial [^111qGUpk]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection and randomization

After signing an informed consent form, participants joined the study in the ESMira app via QR code. All data collection procedures, including randomization, communication, questionnaire completion, and screenshot uploads were conducted with the app. Randomization of ESMira works autonomously and is impervious to external influences.

Smartphone screen time

Smartphone screen time was assessed weekly in both groups using the smartphones' built-in screen time measurements. Each Monday, participants were prompted to upload a screenshot of their screen time from the previous week (Monday to Sunday).

Mental health indicators

Mental health indicators were evaluated in both groups at baseline (t0), post-intervention (t1), and follow-up (t2). Participants were reminded to complete the questionnaires via push notifications every Sunday.

In addition to the a priori-defined main outcomes (depression, well-being, stress, sleep), additional measures were collected to determine baseline differences between the groups and to detect possible further effects of screen time reduction on mental health.

### Children's screen time and psychosocial symptoms at 5 years of age-the role of parental factors [^111nvaWo]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Among young children, a high amount of screen time is independently related to multiple psychosocial symptoms even when various factors related to parents' mental health and parenting style dimensions have been taken into account. In addition, the risk seems to be especially pronounced when a mother is stressed or depressed. Various psychosocial environmental risk factors in childhood (interacting with genetic dispositions) play a cumulative role relative to children's well-being making it important to study multiple factors simultaneously. It is also important to keep in mind that the relationship between these factors may be bidirectional. In clinical practice, the length of children's screen time should be inquired already at a young age. Furthermore, parents should be offered guidance to reduce the possible ill effects of excessive screen time and help with their own mental health problems. Recognizing the risk factors related to excessive screen time and parents' mental health is crucial when children are young to prevent psychosocial symptoms from developing further. Moreover, monitoring these issues when children grow older, is equally important. As screen use is increasingly a universal part of children's daily lives, intervention studies are needed that aim to reduce children's psychosocial symptoms related to higher levels of screen time. Enhancing parents' active mediation and discussion of children's e-media habits in families can potentially prove to be promising avenues for these efforts.

### Editorial: did goldilocks have It right? How Do we define too little, too much, or just right? [^111XRs8P]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinicians, teachers, and parents alike have long lamented screen time and its developmental and psychological implications, particularly as access to digital devices, games, and online platforms has become ubiquitous. In 2018, 95% of US teens reported having access to a smartphone, and 45% reported being online "almost constantly". 1 Parental and expert concerns include displacement of important activities such as sleep and exercise, Internet or video game addiction, negative social experiences such as cyberbullying, and worry that excessive use may cause or worsen mental health symptoms such as depression. 2 3 Research on the subject is challenging, as associations between device use and psychological functioning are likely multifactorial and nonlinear and therefore difficult to elucidate from small samples or samples that are lacking in rich covariate data. In addition, the rapid pace of technological change makes studying and reporting on these phenomena challenging as studies may be out of date before they are even published.

### Influences on physical activity and screen time amongst postpartum women with heightened depressive symptoms: a qualitative study [^112vgK5b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum women are at higher risk of depression compared to the general population. Despite the mental health benefits an active lifestyle can provide, postpartum women engage in low physical activity and high screen time. Very little research has investigated the social ecological (i.e. individual, social and physical environmental) influences on physical activity and screen time amongst postpartum women, particularly amongst those with depressive symptoms. Therefore, this study sought to examine the influences on physical activity and screen time amongst postpartum women with heightened depressive symptoms.

Methods

20 mothers (3–9 months postpartum) participating in the Mums on the Move pilot randomised controlled trial who reported being insufficiently active and experiencing heightened depressive symptoms participated in semi-structured telephone interviews exploring their perceptions of the key influences on their physical activity and screen time across various levels of the social ecological model. Strategies for promoting physical activity and reducing screen time were explored with participants. Thematic analyses were undertaken to construct key themes from the qualitative data.

Results

Findings showed that postpartum women with depressive symptoms reported individual (i.e. sleep quality, being housebound, single income), social (i.e. childcare, social support from partner and friends) and physical environmental (i.e. weather, safety in the local neighbourhood) influences on physical activity. Postpartum women reported individual (i.e. screen use out of habit and addiction, enjoyment) and social (i.e. positive role modelling, social isolation) influences on screen-time, but no key themes targeting the physical environmental influences were identified for screen time. Strategies suggested by women to increase physical activity included mother's physical activity groups, home-based physical activity programs and awareness-raising. Strategies to reduce screen time included the use of screen time tracker apps, increasing social connections and awareness-raising.

Conclusions

Amongst postpartum women with heightened depressive symptoms, influences on physical activity encompassed all constructs of the social ecological model. However, screen time was only perceived to be influenced by individual and social factors. Intervention strategies targeting predominantly individual and social factors may be particularly important for this high-risk group. These findings could assist in developing targeted physical activity and screen time interventions for this cohort.

### Association of children's physical activity and screen time with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic [^111UJh2a]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to serious disruptions in the lives of children, including restrictions on school and other activities, and numerous other stressors that may continue to pose challenges to their health and well-being. Emerging evidence raises concern that such stressors may have negative short- and long-term mental health consequences, including psychological distress and behavioral problems. Identifying potentially modifiable factors that are positively associated with youth mental health can provide the foundation for approaches to support children as they continue to experience pandemic-related stressors. Physical activity and screen time are 2 key health behaviors that are likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and may influence differential mental health outcomes.

Physical activity is associated with numerous physical and mental health benefits across the lifespan. Current evidence supports the notion that physical activity in children is associated with protection against internalizing(eg, depression, anxiety) and externalizing(eg, impulse control, aggressiveness) symptoms and can improve positive psychosocial functioning. The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the importance of research focusing on the mental health benefits of physical activity. Two studies from China found that children who engaged in more physical activity during the pandemic reported better behavioral and mental health. Experts are calling for more active promotion of physical activity to be a key recommendation to support population health during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Screen time and extracurricular activities as risk and protective factors for mental health in adolescence: a population-level study [^113u8VGR]. Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

This study examines adolescents' (N = 28,712; 49% female; M age = 12.25, SD age = 0.51) recreational screen time and participation in extracurricular activities during after-school hours in association to indicators of positive (optimism, satisfaction with life) and negative (anxiety, depressive symptoms) mental health and wellbeing. Data were drawn from a population-level study with the Middle Years Development Instrument (MDI) with grade 7 students in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The research was implemented in public school districts between 2014 and 2018. We found that adolescents who participated in extracurricular activities (e.g., sports, arts programs, community programs) were significantly less likely to engage in recreational screen-based activities (e.g., watching programs, browsing the internet, playing computer games) for 2 or more hours after school. Findings from Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling analyses showed that extracurricular participation was associated with higher levels of satisfaction with life and optimism, and lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. In contrast, longer screen time (≥ 2 h/day) was associated with lower levels of satisfaction with life and optimism, and higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms; shorter screen time (< 2 h/day) was associated with favorable mental health and wellbeing. For screen time, the effect was moderated by gender; the association between longer screen time and poorer mental health and wellbeing was significantly more pronounced for girls than boys. For both boys and girls, mental health and wellbeing were most favorable if they participated in extracurricular activities and reported less than 2 h of recreational screen time per day.

### Screen media use and mental health of children and adolescents: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112xQGJ2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The proportion of children and adolescents with poor mental health has increased over the past years in many countries. In the US, the number of adolescents reporting poor mental health during the past month was 29% in the 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Based on data from 45 European countries, 25% of 11- to 15-year-old adolescents reported symptoms related to psychological health (such as nervousness, irritability, and difficulties falling asleep). Individuals are particularly vulnerable to negative or stressful environmental experiences during adolescence. Furthermore, research shows that self-reported life satisfaction has the steepest decrease during adolescence compared with other stages of the lifespan.

The past decades have brought substantial advancements in digital technology, and more children and adolescents have their own personal screen media devices. Use of screen media devices has become a central aspect in children's and adolescents' daily lives, offering endless options for entertainment including watching videos, gaming, social media interaction, and communicating with family and friends. Screen media use is a complex and broad construct that includes active and passive engagement with different types of devices and content. Although the use of screen media devices, particularly smartphones, can facilitate many daily activities and some social interactions, concerns have been raised over the past years about the potential negative effect of digital screen media use on children's and adolescents' mental health, yet the research is still sparse and remains inconclusive. Some observational studies find moderate-sized associations between high levels of screen media use and poor mental health, while some researchers claim that observed associations are too weak to have any societal relevance. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 87 studies on the association between children's screen media use and internalizing and externalizing symptoms found small but significant positive associations, suggesting that higher levels of screen media use might be associated with more behavioral problems. However, all the included studies were observational and based mainly on self-reported measures of screen media use. Thus, carefully designed randomized clinical trials are warranted to investigate the potential short-term and long-term effects of reducing screen media use on children's and adolescents' mental health. The present study focuses on the short term and investigates the effect of a family-based, 2-week break from leisure-time screen media use on children's and adolescents' mental health.

### Screen use and mental health symptoms in Canadian children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114chXyM]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, different types of screen use were associated with distinct mental health symptoms in children and youth during COVID-19, suggesting that not all screen use is equal. Our findings may help inform public health guidelines that consider different forms of screen use in prevention of mental health disorders in children and youth during the pandemic. With supports from policy makers, schools and teachers, families, and health care professionals, children and youth will be better positioned to reduce screen use and promote mental health during the pandemic and beyond.

### Global burden of mental disorders in children and adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^113Hiet6]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has prompted numerous new questions regarding its impact on the mental health of children and adolescents, both through its direct psychological effects and its long-term economic and social consequences (Kola et al.). Beyond the direct health implications of the COVID-19 infection, the pandemic has altered many determinants of the mental health of young people. Increased screen time, school closures and disruptions, reduced physical activity, and limited access to school-based mental health support have all likely exerted significant influence on the mental health of children and adolescents (Xie et al.). Although some studies have explored the global epidemiology of mental disorders associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 Mental Disorders Collaborators; Kola et al; Pirkis et al.), the study based on the children and adolescent population is insufficient. A study conducted among children and adolescents in the United States showed that the prevalence of anxiety problems, depression, learning disability, developmental delay, and speech or other language problems increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (Leeb et al.). The meta-analysis based on 23 population studies also revealed the high prevalence of mental health problems among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among females and adolescents (Ma et al.). However, a proportion of these data also show that some children with prior and/or ongoing mental health disorders have had reduced symptoms during some period of the pandemic (Cost et al; Raw et al.). Due to the lack of comparable data support, it remains unclear whether the differences in these findings are attributable to the varying impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents, national and individual differences, or the influence of social determinants of health-related issues. Moreover, any changes in the risk of mental disorders related to COVID-19 are likely to be dynamic. It is partial to estimate the effect of the pandemic on mental disorders before the end of the pandemic. However, in the post-pandemic era, with sufficient global disease survey data, it is time to conduct a retrospective assessment of the epidemiology of mental health during COVID-19 among children and adolescents.

### Global prevalence of meeting screen time guidelines among children 5 years and younger: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jwQZ8]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Pediatric guidelines suggest that infants younger than 2 years avoid screen time altogether, while children aged 2 to 5 years receive no more than 1 hour per day. Although these guidelines have been adopted around the world, substantial variability exists in adherence to the guidelines, and precise estimates are needed to inform public health and policy initiatives.

Objective

To derive the pooled prevalence via meta-analytic methods of children younger than 2 years and children aged 2 to 5 years who are meeting guidelines about screen time.

Data Sources

Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase up to March 2020.

Study Selection

Studies were included if participants were 5 years and younger and the prevalence of meeting (or exceeding) screen time guidelines was reported.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Two independent reviewers extracted all relevant data. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to derive the mean prevalence rates.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalence of meeting screen time guidelines.

Results

From 63 studies, 95 nonoverlapping samples with a total of 89 163 participants were included. For children younger than 2 years, the pooled prevalence of meeting the screen time guideline (0 h/d) was 24.7% (95% CI, 19.0%-31.5%). Moderator analyses revealed that prevalence of meeting screen time guidelines varied as a function of year of data collection (increased over time), measurement method (higher when questionnaires compared with interview), and type of device use (higher when a combination of screen use activities compared with television/movies only). For children aged 2 to 5 years, the mean prevalence of meeting the screen time guideline (1 h/d) was 35.6% (95% CI, 30.6%-40.9%). Moderator analyses revealed that the prevalence of meeting screen time guidelines varied as a function of type of device use (higher when screen time was television/movies only compared with a combination of screen use activities).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that only a minority of children 5 years and younger are meeting screen time guidelines. This highlights the need to provide support and resources to families to best fit evidence-based recommendations into their lives.

### Trends in screen time use among children during the COVID-19 pandemic, July 2019 through August 2021 [^112vZZtX]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

We lacked information on the effects of screen time on health outcomes such as obesity and mental health in this study; however, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Studyof 12 000 children found each additional hour of total screen time per day was prospectively associated with a 0.22 higher body mass index percentile (95% CI, 0.10–0.34 percentile) at 1-year follow-up, after adjusting for covariates. In addition, a recent cross-sectional studyfound that more physical activity and less screen time were associated with better mental health for children. This suggests a potential strategy for mitigating the adverse effects of the increased screen time during the pandemic. In addition, we found that 11.2% of children had a social media account in the latter pandemic period compared with 4.4% before the pandemic. This is concerning, because all children in our study were younger than 13 years, which is the minimum age required for social media accounts (eg, Instagram and TikTok). Recent studies show that social media may be harmful, especially for girls, and, in a nationally representative study, the use of social media was associated with clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms and self-harm, whereas other type of media use showed no associations. It will be important to understand the long-term health impacts of the increased screen time and whether they vary by type of screen time.

### Do television and electronic games predict children's psychosocial adjustment? Longitudinal research using the UK millennium cohort study [^115W1qEh]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Television and electronic games are prominent features of children's home environments in many high-income countries. However, children's heavy screen time has been linked with obesity, sleep problems, lower cognitive skills and poor academic adjustment. High screen time may also predict behavioural and emotional problems in children, including aggression, anxiety and depression, victimisation, social isolation, reduced prosocial behaviourand attentional problems.

Heavy screen time might impair children's mental health in various ways, particularly if it involves viewing material not primarily designed for children and/or with less adult supervision. Screen entertainment's rapid pace, frequent changes of image and capacity to excite may shorten concentration spanand reduce time spent on other key developmental activities, including interpersonal interactions. Violent content may 'prime' children for aggression and prompt them to imitate aggressive behaviour they have just seen. Longer term effects may include desensitisation to violence, and development of attitudes supporting the use of aggression. Violent content may also increase children's perceptions that the world is a 'scary place', resulting in trauma symptoms including depression and anxiety.

It is thought that many psychological processes associated with exposure to TV and electronic games are similar, particularly those regarding the development of attentional problems and aggressive behaviour. However, games may have more powerful effects due to active user engagement, identification with characters and repeated rehearsal and reinforcement. Gaming's interactive and absorbing qualities may substitute for interpersonal relationships and increase social isolation. Such isolation may provoke anxiety and depression, or, if coupled with reduced empathy (from exposure to violent games) may depress prosocial behaviour. Few studies have examined young children's use of electronic games, although a recent study found negative effects of television and video game exposure on attentional problems in middle childhood.

There are, however, a number of alternative explanations for associations observed between screen time and psychosocial adjustment. Family circumstances and functioning may underpin variation in children's screen time and poor adjustment. Links between screen time and mental health may be indirect, rather than direct, for example, via increased sedentary behaviour, sleeping difficulties and language development. Lastly, the child's own temperament may predict screen time. Longitudinal studies of early screen exposure on children's mental health must take account of these alternative possibilities, in order to demonstrate direct associations between screen time and children's mental health.

Background

This study aimed to examine the specific relationships between screen time and various mental health problems among community-dwelling adults in China.

Methods

Self-reports of weekday and weekend screen time (TV, computer use and cell phone/tablet use), symptoms of PTSD, depression, and ADHD, and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) were completed by 7121 Chinese adults. Logistic regression was used to examine specific relationships between screen time and mental health problems with demographics, physical activity, drinking, smoking, and sleep duration as covariates.

Results

On weekdays, the participants spending at least 3 h on watching TV, computer use and cell phone/tablet use respectively accounted for 6.8%, 15.9% and 45.9%. On weekends, the proportions were 15.5%, 12.1% and 50.0%. Computer use on weekends was associated with higher risk of PTSD (OR = 1.81); cell phone/tablet use on weekdays and weekends was related to increased depression (OR = 1.38, OR = 1.28, respectively), while only computer use on weekends was related to depression (OR = 1.33); cell phone/tablet use both on weekdays and weekends was also connected to ADHD (OR = 1.56, OR = 1.48, respectively); on weekdays and weekends, more time TV viewing (OR = 1.76–1.79, OR = 1.46–1.71, respectively) and less cell phone/tablet use (OR = 0.66, OR = 0.65, respectively) were associated with higher numbers of PLEs.

Conclusions

The relationships between different types of screen time and mental health problems are variant. Future longitudinal studies should subdivide screen time on the basis of content and explore the specific causal relationship between screen time and mental health problems.

### Digital transformation of mental health services [^113S1AcP]. Npj Mental Health Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Ethics in digital mental health

Figure 5 provides an overview of some of the ethical challenges and ethical benefits. A key ethical challenge is that digital interventions could be perceived as a replacement for human facing services (akin to AI anxiety) and as another digital service that promotes even more screen-time. It is clear from both the patient and clinician perspective that digital interventions should not be used to replace high quality face-to-face services with a computer. While the relationship between screen-time and mental health is complicated, there is stronger agreement that the most effective use of digital interventions is when they are augmented and supported by people.

### Cost-effectiveness of universal routine depression screening for adolescents in primary care [^116aQurc]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

One simulation study evaluated the comparative effectiveness, but not cost-effectiveness, of universal routine depression screening in adolescent primary care and concluded that screening achieved relatively small effects (< 5% of achievable effect) on population mental health. Our study found that universal annual screening added 44 depression-free days (< 2% improvement) per child over 10 years compared with usual care. While these study outcomes are not directly comparable, these modest health effects may result in multiple systems failures along the pediatric-mental delivery care continuum (eg, low access to care). Our findings suggest that sustaining participation in annual well-child visits may not substantially change the cost-effectiveness, perhaps due to the low depression prevalence among symptom-free patients. We demonstrated that universal routine screening could be more cost-effective if coupled with increased treatment access to care or effectiveness. For example, treatment effectiveness can be improved by integrating primary and mental care services delivery or implementing collaborative care models. As telemedicine use trends upwards for behavioral health care, universal routine screening combined with treatment may be increasingly cost-effective if adolescents do not require caregiver time costs in psychotherapy (via telemedicine). By conducting a cost-effectiveness model and robust uncertainty analyses, we can pinpoint opportunities for future value of information analysis or evidence collection to inform screening effectiveness. In our study, we found that collecting additional data on treatment effectiveness by disaggregated age, sex, and racial or ethnic groups and clarifying the adolescent-specific depression utilities across varying severities may offer insights into screening cost-effectiveness.

Previous cost-effectiveness analyses compared adolescent depression treatment options, but to our knowledge none examined screening specifically. Two cost-effectiveness studies evaluated universal depression screening in adults but not adolescents. Valenstein et alfound that universal annual depression screening in adult primary care yielded $352 891 per QALY gained over the lifetime from the societal perspective. Jiao et alfound that universal single-time, 2-staged screening (using PHQ-2 and PHQ-9) with collaborative care treatment yielded $2225 per QALY gained among urban adults. Both ICERs are adjusted for inflation. Our analysis found that universal annual screening in adolescents yielded $57 795 per QALY gained compared with usual care and $66 822 per QALY gained compared with single-time screening over 10 years from the societal perspective. We expected that universal annual screening in adolescents would be more cost-effective than in adults because of their higher depression prevalence and if they underwent screening routinely for longer periods.

### Screen use and mental health symptoms in Canadian children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1157zZNL]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Longitudinal research on specific forms of electronic screen use and mental health symptoms in children and youth during COVID-19 is minimal. Understanding the association may help develop policies and interventions targeting specific screen activities to promote healthful screen use and mental health in children and youth.

Objective

To determine whether specific forms of screen use (television [TV] or digital media, video games, electronic learning, and video-chatting time) were associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, conduct problems, irritability, hyperactivity, and inattention in children and youth during COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A longitudinal cohort study with repeated measures of exposures and outcomes was conducted in children and youth aged 2 to 18 years in Ontario, Canada, between May 2020 and April 2021 across 4 cohorts of children or youth: 2 community cohorts and 2 clinically referred cohorts. Parents were asked to complete repeated questionnaires about their children's health behaviors and mental health symptoms during COVID-19.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The exposure variables were children's daily TV or digital media time, video game time, electronic-learning time, and video-chatting time. The mental health outcomes were parent-reported symptoms of child depression, anxiety, conduct problems and irritability, and hyperactivity/inattention using validated standardized tools.

Results

This study included 2026 children with 6648 observations. In younger children (mean [SD] age, 5.9 [2.5] years; 275 male participants [51.7%]), higher TV or digital media time was associated with higher levels of conduct problems (age 2–4 years: β, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.10–0.35]; P < .001; age ≥ 4 years: β, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.02–0.11]; p = 0.007) and hyperactivity/inattention (β, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.006–0.14]; p = 0.04). In older children and youth (mean [SD] age, 11.3 [3.3] years; 844 male participants [56.5%]), higher levels of TV or digital media time were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and inattention; higher levels of video game time were associated with higher levels of depression, irritability, inattention, and hyperactivity. Higher levels of electronic learning time were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, higher levels of screen use were associated poor mental health of children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that policy intervention as well as evidence-informed social supports are needed to promote healthful screen use and mental health in children and youth during the pandemic and beyond.

### Youth digital dilemmas: exploring the intersection between social media and anxiety [^116KRiW7]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The upsurge in youth screen time and social media usage parallels growing mental health concerns. While causality remains unproven, many studies associate screen and social media use as anxiety risk factors. Social media can benefit some youth in forming connections and shaping identity, but it may also trigger or exacerbate anxiety, emphasizing the need for balanced and mindful use. This article reviews existing literature on the potential risks and benefits of screen and social media use on youth anxiety, and proposes strategies for managing mental and digital health challenges attributed by the rapidly evolving landscape of youth engagement with technology.

### Screen media use and mental health of children and adolescents: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^11388j5a]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study SCREENS (secondary analysis) was published by Jesper Schmidt-Persson and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Internalizing disorder and Social anxiety disorder. In the SCREENS (secondary analysis) study, the trial question was: what is the role of screen media reduction intervention in healthy children and adolescents? In the SCREENS (secondary analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SCREENS (secondary analysis) study, the population was: 173 patients (93 female, 80 male). The inclusion criteria were healthy children and adolescents who were able to hand over their smartphones or tablets for 2 weeks. The key exclusion criteria were children aged < 4 years; unable to engage in regular physical activities of daily life; sleep disorder; any neuropsychiatric or developmental disorder. In the SCREENS (secondary analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 82 screen media reduction (hand over smartphones and tablets for 2 weeks and reduce leisure screen media use to < 3 hours/week) n = 91 usual screen media use (usual screen media use during leisure). In the SCREENS (secondary analysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in mean total behavioral difficulties score on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 2 weeks (1.74 points vs. 0.12 points; MD 1.67, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.68). In the SCREENS (secondary analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in mean internalizing symptoms score on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 2 weeks (1.01 points vs. -0.02 points; MD 1.03, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.76) Significant increase in reduction in mean peer problems score on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 2 weeks (0.23 points vs. -0.31 points; MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.85) Significant decrease in reduction in mean prosocial behavior score on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 2 weeks (-0.21 points vs. 0.64 points; MD -0.84, 95% CI -1.3 to -0.39). In the SCREENS (secondary analysis) study, the conclusion was: in healthy children and adolescents who were able to hand over their smartphones or tablets for 2 weeks, screen media reduction was superior to usual screen media use with respect to reduction in mean total behavioral difficulties score on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 2 weeks.

### Balancing the 24-hour lifestyle: a population-based study on reducing mental health problems, self-injurious thoughts and behaviors among adolescents [^114qVxTt]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Grounded in the 24-Hour Activity Cycle framework, this study aimed to quantify dose-response thresholds for seven daily behaviors-sleep, napping, low to high intensity physical activity, sedentary time, and screen time-and to evaluate their associations with mental health problems and self-injurious thoughts or behaviors in Chinese adolescents.

Methods

Between 2022 and 2023, data were collected from 33,397 Chinese students to examine lifestyle patterns and mental health. Adjusted logistic regression estimated associations between behavioral categories and four mental-health outcomes, and generalized additive models captured dose-response relationships.

Results

Compared with non-nappers, adolescents who napped 60–90 min daily had 16% lower odds of suicidal risk (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.73–0.97) and other outcomes, while moderate-intensity exercise on at least one to two days per week was associated with up to 31% reduction in odds across all mental health outcomes. Conversely, sleep under 7 h, daily sedentary time equal or over 7 h, and screen time exceeding 4 h were linked to higher risk of adverse outcomes. Generalized Additive Models revealed significant nonlinear dose-response relationships and identified a threshold lifestyle profile for all four mental health outcomes. This profile includes more than 40 minutes of napping per day, a sleep duration ranging from a minimum optimal value of 7.5 hours to a maximum of 10.5 hours per day, at least two days per week of moderate exercise, and no more than 4.4 hours of screen time per day.

Conclusions

These results provide evidence for school-based programs aimed at fostering healthier daily routines, ultimately promoting the mental health and resilience of children and adolescents.

### Children's screen time and psychosocial symptoms at 5 years of age-the role of parental factors [^115CDtSR]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and objectives

Electronic media (e-media) has become a universal part of young children's daily lives. Previous studies have found an association between increased screen time and children's psychosocial symptoms. We investigated whether parents' psychological distress and parenting style dimensions explain the association between children's screen time and psychosocial symptoms. Moreover, we investigated whether parents' mental well-being and parenting style dimensions moderate this association.

Methods

We used data from the Finnish CHILD-SLEEP birth cohort study. Parents and the child were assessed when the child was 5 years old (N = 671). The measure of screen time included program viewing from TV and other devices. Child's psychosocial problems and parents' depression, stress and parenting style dimensions were assessed by self-reports.

Results

A high level of screen time in children was associated with attention and concentration difficulties, hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms as well as internalizing and externalizing symptoms among 5-year-olds. For the most part, the associations remained significant despite controlling for parents' mental health, parenting style dimensions and multiple background factors, especially associations relating to attention and concentration difficulties and hyperactivity symptoms were robust. Maternal stress and depression moderated the association between children's screen time and psychosocial symptoms, indicating a more pronounced association among stressed or depressed mothers.

Conclusion

There is an independent association between children's screen time and psychosocial symptoms which is especially pronounced among those children whose mothers had poorer mental well-being. In clinical practice, the length of screen time should be inquired already at a young age and parents should be offered guidance to reduce the possible ill effects of excessive screen time, as well as help with their own mental health problems.

### The impact of neighborhood environment on adolescent anxiety and depression: a moderated mediation model involving screen time and family function [^111LATnH]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

While the relationship between neighborhood environment and adolescent mental health is well-documented, few studies have examined the roles of screen time and family function in this association. This study aims to explore the "environment-behavior-health" pathway by investigating how neighborhood environment, screen time, and family function jointly influence adolescent anxiety and depression.

Method

Data were drawn from a large-scale, two-wave survey of 5th-12th grade Chinese adolescents. A moderated mediation model was constructed to examine whether screen time mediates the relationship between neighborhood environment and adolescent anxiety and depression, and whether this indirect effect is moderated by family function.

Results

The final sample included 8961 Chinese adolescents. Neighborhood environment was negatively associated with adolescents' screen time (b = -0.513, p < 0.001), anxiety (b = -0.984, p < 0.001) and depression (b = -1.357, p < 0.001). Screen time partially mediated the effects of neighborhood environment on anxiety (b = -0.048, 95% CI [-0.075, -0.025]) and depression (b = -0.068, 95% CI [-0.102, -0.039]). Moreover, family function significantly moderated the association of neighborhood environment with anxiety (b = -0.441, p < 0.01) and depression (b = -0.401, p < 0.05), as well as the association of screen time with anxiety (b = -0.055, p < 0.01) and depression (b = -0.051, p < 0.05).

Conclusion

These findings extend the "environment-behavior-health" framework and highlight the need for multi-level strategies to support adolescent mental health.

### The relationship between screen time and anxiety / depression symptoms in preschool children with autism spectrum disorder: the mediating role of cortical volume [^112YWBwm]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, excessive screen exposure in early childhood in children with ASD may be associated with alterations in brain development. Early studies suggest that prolonged ST may contribute to alterations in both intra- and inter-network functional connectivity in children with ASD. Given that the first few years of life are a critical period for rapid brain development, the developing brain is particularly sensitive to environmental stimuli, which can lead to significant alterations in brain structure and function. Children with ASD often exhibit abnormal volumetric changes in brain structures and demonstrate impaired connectivity and integration of brain functions, which can render them more susceptible to environmental stressors. Vaccarino et al. proposed that reductions in both white matter and gray matter volume might exhibit a correlative association with more severe ASD symptoms. Previous studies have also indicated that excessive ST is associated with alterations in the microstructure of gray and white matter, manifested as atrophy of the frontal lobe gray matter and weakened interhemispheric connections, which is likely to further exacerbate the effects of ST on children with ASD during the crucial stage of brain development.

Furthermore, studies have shown that mental health issues in children and adolescents are closely linked to changes in brain structure. For instance, a 2018 longitudinal study found that incipient depression in adolescence is associated with thinning of the frontal cortex. In contrast, a study comparing anxious children and adolescents with healthy controls observed increased cortical thickness in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) among those with anxiety. A large-sample study targeting children aged 9 to 10 demonstrated that the symptoms of ADHD and behavioral problems are inversely associated with global gray volume. Moreover, research from the National Institutes of Health in the US indicated that thicknesses of the left orbitofrontal, right retrosplenial cingulate, and medial temporal cortex show a negative correlation with externalizing mental problems in children.

To date, no studies have explored the relationship between mental health issues, ST, and cortical development in preschool children with ASD, nor have the underlying mechanisms been explored. Given the complex interplay among these factors, we conducted this study. We proposed the following hypotheses: First, compared to the low-dose screen exposure group, children with ASD in the high-dose screen exposure group would show more significant developmental delays, more severe behavioral and mental health problems, and smaller cortical volumes. Second, screen time in children with ASD may serve as a predictor of anxiety/depression symptoms, with cortical volume changes potentially mediating this relationship. We conducted this study in order to investigate our hypothesis and enhance a comprehensive understanding of ASD in children.

### Effect of screen time on recovery from concussion: a randomized clinical trial [^115mz5aA]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

The study Effect of Screen Time on Recovery From Concussion was published by Theodore Macnow and colleagues in 2021 in the journal JAMA Pediatr. This study is related to the following diseases: Concussion. In the Effect of Screen Time on Recovery From Concussion study, the trial question was: what is the effect of screen time on patients who sustain a concussion? In the Effect of Screen Time on Recovery From Concussion study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Effect of Screen Time on Recovery From Concussion study, the population was: 125 patients (61 female, 64 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 12 to 25 years presenting to the emergency department within 24 hours of sustaining a concussion. The key exclusion criteria were intoxication, GCS score < 15 points, intracranial abnormalities identified on imaging, preexisting intellectual disability, severe psychiatric illness, severe neurological conditions, substantial previous neurological surgery. In the Effect of Screen Time on Recovery From Concussion study, the interventions were: n = 66 screen time permitted (screen time permission for 48 hours after injury) n = 59 screen time abstinent (abstinence of screen time for 48 hours after injury). In the Effect of Screen Time on Recovery From Concussion study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median time until concussion recovery (8 days vs. 3.5 days; AD 4.5 days, 95% CI 0.43 to 8.57). In the Effect of Screen Time on Recovery From Concussion study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in sleep duration on first 3 days (29 hours vs. 29 hours; RR 1, 95% CI 0 to 2). In the Effect of Screen Time on Recovery From Concussion study, the conclusion was: in patients aged 12 to 25 years presenting to the emergency department within 24 hours of sustaining a concussion, screen time permitted was inferior to screen time abstinent with respect to median time until concussion recovery.

### Physical activity and mental health in children and adolescents: a review of reviews [^115HHvL5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To synthesise reviews investigating physical activity and depression, anxiety, self-esteem and cognitive functioning in children and adolescents and to assess the association between sedentary behaviour and mental health by performing a brief review.

Methods

Searches were performed in 2010. Inclusion criteria specified review articles reporting chronic physical activity and at least one mental health outcome that included depression, anxiety/stress, self-esteem and cognitive functioning in children or adolescents.

Results

Four review articles reported evidence concerning depression, four for anxiety, three for self-esteem and seven for cognitive functioning. Nine primary studies assessed associations between sedentary behaviour and mental health. Physical activity has potentially beneficial effects for reduced depression, but the evidence base is limited. Intervention designs are low in quality, and many reviews include cross-sectional studies. Physical activity interventions have been shown to have a small beneficial effect for reduced anxiety, but the evidence base is limited. Physical activity can lead to improvements in self-esteem, at least in the short term. However, there is a paucity of good quality research. Reviews on physical activity and cognitive functioning have provided evidence that routine physical activity can be associated with improved cognitive performance and academic achievement, but these associations are usually small and inconsistent. Primary studies showed consistent negative associations between mental health and sedentary behaviour.

Conclusions

Association between physical activity and mental health in young people is evident, but research designs are often weak and effects are small to moderate. Evidence shows small but consistent associations between sedentary screen time and poorer mental health.

### Impact on adolescent mental health of replacing screen-use with exercise: a prospective cohort study [^116AGXLy]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Screen-based device use could increase the risk of adolescent depression. Distinct modalities of screen-use may have differential effects on mental health. We used compositional data analysis to examine how theoretically replacing different screen-uses with exercise might influence future adolescent emotional distress.

Methods

In 4,599 adolescents (55% female) from a nationally-representative, prospective cohort, we used time-use diary data at age 14 to estimate daily screen use (television, social media, video game, general computer use) and exercise (team sport and individual exercise). The outcome was emotional distress at age 17, assessed using the emotional symptoms subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.

Results

Theoretically replacing 60 min of total screen time with exercise at age 14 was associated with a 0.05 (95%CI -0.08, -0.02) score reduction on the emotional symptoms' subscale at 17 in fully-adjusted models. Replacing 60 min of television or social media use with team sports was associated with a reduction of 0.17 (95%CI, -0.31, -0.04) and 0.15 (95%CI, -0.29, -0.01) in emotional symptom scores, respectively. We found no change in emotional symptom scores when replacing video game or general computer use with team sport, or when replacing any screen time with individual exercise.

Limitations

No direct measure of depressive symptoms at follow-up.

Conclusions

Replacing any screen time with exercise could reduce emotional distress, but the largest effect sizes were associated with replacing time in television watching and social media with team sports. Recommendations to limit screen-use in adolescents may require a nuanced approach for protecting mental health.

### Association of children's physical activity and screen time with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116HzJbB]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Despite the potential benefits of physical activity on child well-being, emergent data suggest that during this pandemic, access to health-promoting physical activity has been largely disrupted, whereas use of screen-based media for education and recreation has increased. Studies from before the pandemic indicate that only 24% of US children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years met recommendations for 60 minutes per day of physical activity. Data from the 2017 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey showed that 26.1% of high school students had been physically active for a total of at least 60 min/d on all 7 days before the survey. Further, physical activity levels have been shown to be negatively associated with age (lower for older children), positively associated with parental educational attainment, and lower among girls (vs boys) and racial and ethnic minority groups. Before the pandemic, school-aged children in the US also engaged in excessive amounts of screen time, with estimates ranging from 4 to more than 7 h/d. With most schools in the US opting for remote schooling at some point during the pandemic, children are likely spending more time sedentary and in front of screens than ever before. While recognizing the benefits of some types of screen use, excessive screen time has been associated with lower psychological well-being.

Several studies in adults during the pandemic have found consistent associations between lower physical activity and poorer mental health and between higher daily screen time and poorer mental health, but association this has not been well studied in US children. Researchers have drawn on prepandemic studies, to emphasize the potential mental health consequences of the pandemic and called for research and augmented mental health services. However, few studies have reported on the mental health of children during the pandemic and none, to our knowledge, have specifically examined the association of physical activity and screen time with mental health in nationally representative US samples. The aims of this study are to describe the association of physical activity and screen time with the mental health of school-aged children in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also sought to understand how these health behaviors were affected by children's exposure to pandemic-related stressors.

### Risk factors and discrimination model for screen exposure among children under 3 years: findings from fujian province in China [^1151xXJC]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The rise of digital technology has significantly increased the usage of electronic and interactive media in our daily lives. As smartphones and tablets become more prevalent, younger generations are growing up in a screen-saturated environment, resulting in substantial increases in screen time for both parents and children. This trend is especially pronounced among children under 5, whose screen time has nearly doubled over the past two decades and is now affecting even younger age groups. A meta-analysis of 63 studies, encompassing 95 non-overlapping samples and 89,163 participants, found that compliance with screen time guidelines was 24.7% among children under 2 years old. For children aged 2 to 5 years, the mean prevalence of adherence to screen time guidelines was 35.6%. The issue of screen exposure has become increasingly prominent in the lives of children and youth worldwide.

Previous research has extensively documented the negative impacts of screen exposure on the health of children and teenagers. These negative effects are especially pronounced among younger children, particularly those aged 0–3 years, who are at a crucial stage of brain development that profoundly impacts their long-term physical and mental well-being. Infants and young children exposed to excessive screen time are at risk of experiencing developmental setbacks, including obesity, sleep disturbances, visual impairment, delayed language development, poor concentration, and difficulties with emotional regulation. Moreover, screen exposure habits established during infancy and toddlerhood can persist into school age and adulthood, potentially impacting lifestyle choices and long-term health.

Due to the critical stage of physical and mental development characterized by heightened curiosity and adaptability, infants and toddlers benefit from limited screen exposure to support optimal cognitive and intellectual growth. In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) established screen time guidelines, recommending that pediatricians advise parents to avoid TV viewing for children younger than 2 years. In 2001, the AAP expanded its recommendations to include a limit of no more than 1 to 2 h per day of screen time for children aged 2 to 5 years. In 2016, the guidelines were revised to advise avoiding screen time for children younger than 2 years and limiting screen use to 1 h per day for children aged 2 to 5 years. Pediatric societies worldwide, such as the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines and the Australian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines, as well as the World Health Organization, have adopted similar recommendations urging parents to limit their children's screen time.

### Screen time and autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122HQa3]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Contemporary studies raise concerns regarding the implications of excessive screen time on the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the existing literature consists of mixed and unquantified findings.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analyis of the association between screen time and ASD.

Data Sources

A search was conducted in the PubMed, PsycNET, and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Global databases for studies published up to May 1, 2023.

Study Selection

The search was conducted independently by 2 authors. Included studies comprised empirical, peer-reviewed articles or dissertations published in English with statistics from which relevant effect sizes could be calculated. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Two authors independently coded all titles and abstracts, reviewed full-text articles against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and resolved all discrepancies by consensus. Effect sizes were transformed into log odds ratios (ORs) and analyzed using a random-effects meta-analysis and mixed-effects meta-regression. Study quality was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Publication bias was tested via the Egger z test for funnel plot asymmetry. Data analysis was performed in June 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The 2 main variables of interest in this study were screen time and ASD. Screen time was defined as hours of screen use per day or per week, and ASD was defined as an ASD clinical diagnosis (yes or no) or ASD symptoms. The meta-regression considered screen type (ie, general use of screens, television, video games, computers, smartphones, and social media), age group (children vs adults or heterogenous age groups), and type of ASD measure (clinical diagnosis vs ASD symptoms).

Results

Of the 4682 records identified, 46 studies with a total of 562 131 participants met the inclusion criteria. The studies were observational (5 were longitudinal and 41 were cross-sectional) and included 66 relevant effect sizes. The meta-analysis resulted in a positive summary effect size (log OR,0.54 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.74]). A trim-and-fill correction for a significant publication bias (Egger z = 2.15; p = 0.03) resulted in a substantially decreased and nonsignificant effect size (log OR,0.22 [95% CI, -0.004 to 0.44]). The meta-regression results suggested that the positive summary effect size was only significant in studies targeting general screen use (β [SE] = 0.73 [0.34]; t58 = 2.10; p = 0.03). This effect size was most dominant in studies of children (log OR,0.98 [95% CI, 0.66 to 1.29]). Interestingly, a negative summary effect size was observed in studies investigating associations between social media and ASD (log OR,-1.24 [95% CI, -1.51 to -0.96]).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that the proclaimed association between screen use and ASD is not sufficiently supported in the existing literature. Although excessive screen use may pose developmental risks, the mixed findings, the small effect sizes (especially when considering the observed publication bias), and the correlational nature of the available research require further scientific investigation. These findings also do not rule out the complementary hypothesis that children with ASD may prioritize screen activities to avoid social challenges.

### Screen use and mental health symptoms in Canadian children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114NzaMN]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Limitations

Because this study design is testing associations, causality and directionality of results cannot be concluded. Child mental health challenges could have reversely contributed to higher screen use during the pandemic. Children with mental health symptoms might tend to be socially isolated and spend more time on screen activities than their peers, and this might be further exacerbated during the pandemic, a stressful time when few other supports were available. Residual confounding may have also occurred because of the observational nature of this study (eg, unmeasured pre-COVID child screen use, time parents spent with children, school structure and attendance, content and context of screen use, and so forth). Although we have adjusted the α for analyses involving primary outcomes, type I error may have occurred in analyses of secondary outcomes and they should be considered exploratory. We also do not have measures of total screen exposure time across all the different forms of screen use within a day, which, when combined may have compounding effects on mental health outcomes. Although we aimed to align the mental health domains across all 4 cohorts, different tools were used according to child age, which made it difficult to make direct comparison across all groups. Parent-reported data may have introduced self-reporting bias. Selection bias may be introduced by incomplete exposure and outcome data, likely because of requirements for repeated completion of multiple questionnaires. Furthermore, this study might have limited generalizability since our study population was predominantly children of European ancestry in Ontario, Canada, under specific public health guidelines.

### Screen media use and mental health of children and adolescents: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115MWDzx]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does reducing leisure-time screen media use improve mental health among children and adolescents?

Findings

In this prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial including 89 families (181 children and adolescents), reducing screen media use had an overall positive effect on children's and adolescents' behavioral difficulties. The most noticeable benefits associated with reduced screen media use was a decrease in internalizing behavioral issues and enhanced positive social interactions.

Meaning

The findings provide evidence for a causal link between a short-term reduction in screen media use during leisure and improvements in children's and adolescents' psychological symptoms.

### Shared genetic risk in the association of screen time with psychiatric problems in children [^117QTFuU]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Children's exposure to screen time has been associated with poor mental health outcomes, yet the role of genetic factors remains largely unknown.

Objective

To assess the extent of genetic confounding in the associations between screen time and attention problems or internalizing problems in preadolescent children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study analyzed data obtained between 2016 and 2019 from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study at 21 sites in the US. The sample included children aged 9 to 11 years of genetically assigned European ancestry with self-reported screen time. Data were analyzed between November 2021 and September 2023.

Exposure

Child-reported daily screen time (in hours) was ascertained from questionnaires completed by the children at baseline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Child psychiatric problems, specifically attention and internalizing problems, were measured with the parent-completed Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist at the 1-year follow-up. Genetic sensitivity analyses model (Gsens) was used, which incorporated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of both exposure and outcomes as well as either single-nucleotide variant (SNV; formerly single-nucleotide polymorphism)-based heritability or twin-based heritability to estimate genetic confounding.

Results

The 4262 children in the sample included 2269 males (53.2%) with a mean (SD) age of 9.9 (0.6) years. Child screen time was associated with attention problems (β = 0.10 SD; 95% CI, 0.07–0.13 SD) and internalizing problems (β = 0.03 SD; 95% CI, 0.003–0.06 SD). The television time PRS was associated with child screen time (β = 0.18 SD; 95% CI, 0.14–0.23 SD), the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder PRS was associated with attention problems (β = 0.13 SD; 95% CI, 0.10–0.16 SD), and the depression PRS was associated with internalizing problems (β = 0.10 SD; 95% CI, 0.07–0.13 SD). These PRSs were associated with cross-traits, suggesting genetic confounding. Estimates using PRSs and SNV-based heritability showed that genetic confounding accounted for most of the association between child screen time and attention problems and for 42.7% of the association between child screen time and internalizing problems. When PRSs and twin-based heritability estimates were used, genetic confounding fully explained both associations.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this study suggest that genetic confounding may explain a substantial part of the associations between child screen time and psychiatric problems. Genetic confounding should be considered in sociobehavioral studies of modifiable factors for youth mental health.

### Associations between adolescent sleep difficulties and active versus passive screen time across 38 countries [^115G2bze]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

High screen use has been adversely linked with mental wellbeing; however, little is known about how active versus passive screen time are associated with sleep-onset difficulties among adolescents.

Methods

We analysed data from 38 European and North American countries that participated in the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey. Difficulties in falling sleep were assessed using a self-reported item with a 5-point Likert scale, and then dichotomised. Participants reported h/day of discretional time spent watching television, electronic gaming, and computer use.

Results

Of the 195,668 participants (M age 13.59 [1.62] years; 51% girls), about 25% of girls reported sleep-onset difficulties, while the rate was 18% in boys. Adolescents who played electronic games > 4 h/day (≤ 1 h/day as reference) had 30% higher odds in boys (OR 1.30; 95% CI: 1.23–1.38) and 38% higher odds in girls (OR 1.38; 95% CI: 1.31–1.45) of reporting sleep difficulties. High computer use (> 4 h/day) increased the odds of sleep difficulties by 41% in boys (OR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.33–1.49) and 61% in girls (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.53–1.69). Similarly, high television time (> 4 h/day) had increased the odds of sleep difficulties by 15% in boys (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.08–1.22) and 19% in girls (OR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.12–1.25).

Limitations

Cross-sectional analyses cannot establish causality of the associations.

Conclusions

Higher levels of recreational screen use of any type were associated with sleep-onset difficulties among adolescents with adverse effects being more prevalent in active than passive screen time. Prospective research with objective measures is warranted to understand causality of these relationships.

### Smartphone screen time reduction improves mental health: a randomized controlled trial [^116FHuXq]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The interactions of smartphone screen time, social media use, and mental health are not yet sufficiently clear. Undoubtedly, they are complex and potentially bi-directional. However, there are several potential explanations. The consumption of social media sites may lead to overstimulation of the brain's reward center and may trigger pathways akin to addiction. Similarly, a third of 11–15-year-old girls claim to be "addicted" to a social media platform. Inappropriate or harmful content is easily accessible, posing particular risks to young people with mental health problems.

To interpret the current results accurately, it is crucial to consider the study's limitations. First, only self-reported mental health indicators were used. Some of the questionnaires (e.g. PHQ-9, GAD-7, or ISI) are recognized screening instruments for mental illness, but social desirability biases cannot be ruled out. Although widely used in different settings and populations, the accuracy of measuring changes in the lower range remains uncertain. Secondly, only smartphone screen time was assessed. Many students possess multiple digital devices. Although the participants were instructed not to switch to other devices, we cannot completely rule out this option. Thirdly, the sample was relatively small and not representative of the general population, considering the participants' age, education level, relatively low baseline values in the mental illness indicators, and frequent physical activity. Fourthly, physical activity was objectively only measured in the intervention group. Furthermore, screen time was monitored through screenshot uploads, whereas direct import of smartphone data would be more accurate. In the uploaded screenshots only the duration of the smartphone use, not its content, had been specified, which represents a further limitation regarding the types of uses discussed above. Although the calculated sample size was met for the primary research interest, the follow-up analysis was limited due to high drop-outs. Moreover, since the sample was relatively healthy and most individuals scored at the lower end of the mental health questionnaires at baseline, a floor effect cannot be ruled out. This means that further improvements may not have been possible or could not be detected by the questionnaires. Accordingly, the positive health effects reported may be underestimated. Beyond the psychometrics, there is a risk of self-selection bias in studies on smartphone use reduction. Individuals who derive significant benefits from or are strongly attached to their smartphones may be less likely to participate. The extent to which the bias applies cannot be stated. With regard to the subgroup analysis, it should be noted that the adherent group is a relatively small sample for which no power analysis was initially carried out. Due to the small sample size, the risk of a type II error is increased, which means that relevant group differences may not have been recognized and thus may not have been included in subsequent analyses.

### Mental health issues and psychological factors in athletes: detection, management, effect on performance, and prevention: American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^116dNXMn]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Prevention — sleep hygiene and exercise timing in athletes emphasizes identifying and eliminating behaviors that reduce sleep quantity/quality, maintaining a regular routine, and ensuring adequate sleep duration by age and training hours; health care providers should discourage screens before bedtime due to potential impacts on performance. Although athletes are often advised not to exercise before bedtime, evening exercise (2–4 hours before bed) has not been associated with worse sleep. High exercise levels are related to improved sleep and psychological functioning, and adolescent athletes training almost 18 hours a week (vs 4.5 hours a week for the control group) report better sleep patterns and less daytime tiredness. Recognize that worry and anxiety related to training, competition, academics, or relationships may decrease sleep quality.

### Dose-dependent and joint associations between screen time, physical activity, and mental wellbeing in adolescents: an international observational study [^115xtTdb]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2021). High credibility.

Background

Mental wellbeing in adolescents has declined considerably during past decades, making the identification of modifiable risk factors important. Prolonged screen time and insufficient physical activity appear to operate independently and synergistically to increase the risk of poor mental wellbeing in school-aged children. We aimed to examine the gender-stratified dose-dependent and joint associations of screen time and physical activity with mental wellbeing in adolescents.

Methods

We used data from three rounds of Health Behaviour in School-aged Children cross-sectional surveys (2006, 2010, and 2014) from 42 European and North American countries. Survey participants, aged 11 years, 13 years, and 15 years, provided self-reported information by completing an anonymous questionnaire that included items on health indicators and related behaviours. We used the self-reported variables of life satisfaction and psychosomatic complaints as indicators of adolescents' mental wellbeing, combining these with the self-reported discretionary use of screens and engagement in physical activity. We used generalised additive models and multilevel regression modelling to examine the gender-stratified relationships between mental wellbeing and screen time and physical activity.

Findings

Our sample included 577475 adolescents (mean age 13·60 years, SD 1·64), with 296542 (51·35%) girls and 280933 (48·64%) boys. The mean reported life satisfaction score (on a scale of 0–10) was 7·70 (95% CI 7·69–7·71) in boys and 7·48 (7·46–7·50) in girls. Psychosomatic complaints were more common among girls (mean 9·26, 95% CI 9·23–9·28) than boys (6·89, 6·87–6·91). Generalised additive model analyses showed slightly non-linear associations of screen time and physical activity with life satisfaction and psychosomatic complaints for girls and boys. Detrimental associations between screen time and mental wellbeing started when screen time exceeded 1 h per day, whereas increases in physical activity levels were beneficially and monotonically associated with wellbeing. Multilevel modelling showed that screen time levels were negatively associated with life satisfaction and positively associated with psychosomatic complaints in a dose-dependent manner. Physical activity levels were positively associated with life satisfaction and negatively associated with psychosomatic complaints in a dose-dependent manner. Joint associations of screen time-physical activity with mental wellbeing showed that, compared with the least active participants with more than 8 h per day of screen time and no physical activity, most of the other screen time-physical activity groups had considerably higher life satisfaction and lower psychosomatic complaints.

Interpretation

Higher levels of screen time and lower levels of physical activity were associated with lower life satisfaction and higher psychosomatic complaints among adolescents from high-income countries. Public health strategies to promote adolescents' mental wellbeing should aim to decrease screen time and increase physical activity simultaneously.

Funding

None.

### Screen media use and mental health of children and adolescents: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113mRDKk]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Excessive screen media use has been associated with poorer mental health among children and adolescents in several observational studies. However, experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking.

Objective

To investigate the effects of a 2-week screen media reduction intervention on children's and adolescents' mental health.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prespecified secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial with a 2-week follow-up included 89 families (with 181 children and adolescents) from 10 Danish municipalities in the region of Southern Denmark. All study procedures were carried out in the home of the participants. Enrollment began on June 6, 2019, and ended on March 30, 2021. This analysis was conducted between January 1 and November 30, 2023.

Intervention

Families were randomly allocated to a screen media reduction group or a control group. The 2-week screen media reduction intervention was designed to ensure a high level of compliance to the reduction in leisure-time screen media use. Participants allocated to the intervention group had to reduce their leisure-time screen media use to 3 hours per week or less per person and hand over smartphones and tablets.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was the between-group mean difference in change in total behavioral difficulties, measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 2-week follow-up. Results were estimated using mixed-effects tobit regression models. Analyses were carried out as both intention to treat and complete case.

Results

In the sample of 89 families including 181 children and adolescents (intervention group [45 families]: 86 children; mean [SD] age, 8.6 [2.7] years; 42 girls [49%]; control group [44 families]: 95 children; mean [SD] age, 9.5 [2.5] years; 57 girls [60%]), there was a statistically significant between-group mean difference in the total difficulties score, favoring the screen media reduction intervention (-1.67; 95% CI, -2.68 to -0.67; Cohen d, 0.53). The greatest improvements were observed for internalizing symptoms (emotional symptoms and peer problems; between-group mean difference, -1.03; 95% CI, -1.76 to -0.29) and prosocial behavior (between-group mean difference, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.39–1.30).

Conclusions and Relevance

This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial found that a short-term reduction in leisure-time screen media use within families positively affected psychological symptoms of children and adolescents, particularly by mitigating internalizing behavioral issues and enhancing prosocial behavior. More research is needed to confirm whether these effects are sustainable in the long term.

### Digital screen time and suicidality during high school: how important is cyberbullying? A mediation analysis using the youth risk behavioral surveillance survey, 2011–2019 [^111K21ZD]. Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Elevated digital screen time (i.e., 2+ hours per day) is associated with suicidal ideations, planning, and attempts during adolescence. Recent studies suggest quality, rather than duration, of digital screen time is most impactful on adolescent mental health. We investigate the role of cyberbullying victimization on the relationship between elevated digital screen time and risk factors for completed suicide. We pooled five years of biennial Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance (YRBS) survey data (2011–2019). Participants were n = 73,011 high school students in the United States (US). Elevated digital screen time reflected spending 3 h (or more) per day on leisure, digital media. Outcome variables were: (1) feeling sad/hopeless; (2) suicidal ideation; (3) suicidal planning; and (4) suicide attempt. Structural equation models (SEMs) tested the mediating effects of self-reported online bullying victimization (i.e., cyberbullying) on the effect of elevated digital screen time on suicidality. We controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and survey year. Subsample analyses stratified by sex were also conducted. Overall, 40.5% of high school students reported elevated digital screen time and 15.4% reported cyberbullying. Cyberbullying mediated a substantial proportion of the relationship between digital screen time and feeling sad/hopeless (16%), suicidal ideation (18%), planned suicide attempt (18%), and past suicide attempt (26%), among high school students, controlling for covariates. Similar mediating effects were observed in models stratified by sex. Findings reinforce prior research demonstrating that the quality of leisure, digital media strongly influences the relationship between digital screen time and mental health during adolescence. Findings need replication via longitudinal designs.

### Smartphone screen time reduction improves mental health: a randomized controlled trial [^112xBSgX]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Smartphones have become an integral part of our everyday lives. Worldwide, 5.6 billion people own a smartphone and almost 5 billion use social media sites. This indicates an increase of over 200 million in the last year alone. Daily smartphone screen time has risen sharply in recent years with an average daily screen time of 3 h and 46 min. In Austria, 38% of adolescents use their phones five or more hours per day.

Intensive smartphone use reflects the high utility of smartphones in modern society. Evidence also suggests positive effects of smartphone use, such as increased social connectedness among social media users and providing a platform for exchange among minorized groups. Furthermore, individuals with mental health issues have reported finding distraction through positive smartphone content beneficial, and improvements in mood have been observed following increased use of entertainment apps. Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies report negative effects associated with intensive smartphone use. A large-scale study (> 1 million adolescents) found that more time on screens is associated with lower psychological well-being. Numerous cross-sectional studies discovered that smartphone use was significantly associated with mental health symptoms with a gradually higher prevalence of psychological symptoms with each hour of daily screen time (e.g.). However, these studies as well as the majority of research in this field are cross-sectional and causal interaction remains unclear. Longitudinal, naturalistic studies observed screen time, mental health, and possible mutual changes over time. A study found that frequent social media use predicted later poor mental health and well-being. Given the topic's relevance, well-founded interventional studies are only sparsely represented. A systematic review found an association between screen time in general and depressive symptoms. A large-scale longitudinal study from the UK on more than 12,000 young people found that frequent social media use predicted later poor mental health and well-being. Further, a review of 13 reviews found moderately strong evidence for an association between screen time and depressive symptoms. A review on the use of mobile phones or wireless devices found limited evidence that such usage may be associated with poorer mental health in children and adolescents. In addition, the importance of considering the purpose of use is indicated, since smartphone screentime appears to be detrimental to mental health from as little as two hours per day, depending on the purpose of use, and from four hours, regardless of the usage purpose.

### Association of children's physical activity and screen time with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112WgCkt]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

For elementary school–aged children, our findings highlight the potential benefits of engaging in the recommended 60 minutes or more of physical activity every day. Even after accounting for COVID-19 stressors and demographics, achieving that recommendation was associated with fewer externalizing symptoms. Given that fewer than one-quarter of children aged 6 to 10 years in our sample were meeting physical activity recommendations, universal efforts to increase child physical activity have substantial potential to improve population health and well-being. For this age group, particularly if they are not attending school in person, the responsibility of providing opportunities for physical activity falls on parents and caregivers, which may pose considerable challenges. Furthermore, there may be disparities in access to opportunities to engage in physical activity, whether indoors (space, online access, and equipment) or outdoors (space, safety concerns, and equipment). Equitably increasing opportunities for physical activity would require schools to play a central role so that access does not depend on family or neighborhood circumstances. Recess and physical education during the school day (in person or remotely) need to be prioritized and creative solutions considered.

For middle and high school–aged children, the results for physical activity were more striking. Only 13.5% of these children are engaging in the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity daily, which is considerably lower than prepandemic estimates of approximately 25%. Notably, even 1 d/wk of physical activity was associated with better mental health than 0 days for both externalizing and internalizing symptoms. This significant association remained even when accounting for prior mental health conditions, COVID-19 stressors, and demographics. Unfortunately, physical activity among US children tends to decline as they get older and often depends on participation in sports and organized physical activities, which were severely curtailed during the pandemic. As with younger children, school-based options should be supported, along with collaboration between schools and community-based organizations to increase opportunities for affordable and accessible after-school recreation and sports. For this age group, it will be important to monitor possible attrition from organized physical activities after the pandemic owing to the long periods of restrictions.

### Changes and correlates of screen time in adults and children during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115hJtYs]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Two studies, examined mood changes and screen time, with both studies yielding non-significant results.

Regarding other aspects of mental health, studies report conflicting results. TV time (β = 0·16; p = < 0·001), online shopping (β = 0·16; p = < 0·01), and online sexual activities (β = 0·13; p = < 0·05) were all correlated with the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on overall mental health, whereas total screen time, video gaming, social media use and instant messaging were non-significant. Positive affect was significantly negatively correlated with instant messaging (β = −0·1; p = < 0·01) and TV use (β = −0·09; p = < 0·05), but not significantly associated with online sexual activities, video games, social media use, or online shopping. Negative affect was significantly negatively associated with social media use (β = −0·08; p = < 0·05), and positively associated with online shopping (β = 0·15; p = < 0·05), but not with video games or instant messaging. Furthermore, increases in screen time were negatively associated with overall wellbeing in one study (ICC r = −0·31 p = < 0·001), but not in others'.truggling' versus 'flourishing' mental health was associated with increases and decreases in screen time (RR = 2·20; p = < 0·05 and RR = 23·85; p = < 0·05 respectively), indicating widely conflicting results. Headaches were reported to be negatively associated with less than 6 hrs/day of screen time (OR = 0·55; p = < 0.001), and boredom was consistently associated with increases in social media use (β of direct effect = 0·46; p = < 0·001; β of indirect effect = 0·03; p = < 0·05) and internet gaming (β of direct effect = 0·39; p = < 0·001; β of indirect effect = 0·04; p = < 0·05).

### Association between screen time and cumulating school, behavior, and mental health difficulties in early adolescents: a population-based study [^117WGar2]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Early adolescents may daily spend excessive screen-time (with television viewing, computer/console gaming, discussion forums/chatting online, internet surfing, doing homework, and electronic mails) while its association with cumulating several school-behavior-mental-health difficulties (SBMDs) (poor-academic-performance, being obese, alcohol/tobacco/cannabis/other-illicit-drugs use, suffered violence, sexual abuse, perpetrated violence, poor social support, depressive symptoms, and suicide attempt) is poorly addressed. We investigated this association among 1559 middle-school adolescents from north-eastern France (mean age 13.5 ± 1.3). They completed a questionnaire including socioeconomic features, daily screen-time for various screen-based activities (coded 1 = < 2/2 = 2–4/3 = ≥ 5 h; daily-total-screen-time level DSA total was defined as their sum and categorized into 4 levels: 6–7/8–9/10–12/ ≥ 13), various SBMDs and the time of their onset during the life course (their cumulated number SBMD score was categorized into 5 levels: 0/1/2/3–4/ ≥ 5). Logistic regression modeling showed that the DSA total was strongly associated with all SBMDs (gender-age-adjusted odds ratio reaching 8.28, p < 0.001) and SBMD score (gender-age-adjusted relative risk reaching 11.60, p < 0.001, pseudo R 2 = 0.039). These associations remained strongly significant when controlling for socioeconomic adversities (contributions 20–38%). The proportion of subjects without each SBMD steadily decreased with age according to DSA total levels. These findings help to understand the impacts of high DSA total on SBMDs in early adolescents and identify at-risk adolescents for prevention and care.

### Smartphone screen time reduction improves mental health: a randomized controlled trial [^1179ivXu]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given that social media sites are integral to intensive smartphone use, there is growing advocacy for stricter regulations, especially for children and young people. For example, Australia is already taking first steps by proposing a complete ban on social media use for adolescents under the age of 16.

As in the present study on screen time reduction, a positive effect on well-being was observed in a study that investigated the effect of one week of social media abstinence. Accordingly, another study found a positive effect on stress after one week of abstinence from social networking sites. These results fit with the results of a study, showing that a five-day abstinence from Facebook led to lower cortisol levels. No effect of social media abstinence on affective well-being, loneliness, and quality of day was shown in a daily diary study. In addition, a large-scale study of nearly 16,000 children aged 3–6 years has already found an increasing proportion of social media to screen time as they get older and has also shown that this non-child-directed content leads to a higher risk of mental health problems, while a higher proportion of educational programs lowers that risk. Around 5 million adults up to the age of 65 worldwide and 32.6% and 36.1% of adults in Germany and Austria have been affected by cyberbullying. Women and young people are particularly affected and the serious consequences for health in the form of suicide risk or alcohol, drug, and medication abuse cannot be underestimated. The association between cyberbullying and depression is also shown in a review of 36 studies.

### World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour [^1165Couh]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for children and adolescents (5–17 years)

The evidence affirmed that physical activity in children and adolescents is associated with improved physical, mental and cognitive health outcomes. Many of the benefits of physical activity are observed with an average of 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily, although physical activity beyond 60 min of MVPA daily provide additional health benefits. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether specific health benefits vary by type or domain of physical activity. The evidence showed clearly that increased time in aerobic MVPA increases cardiorespiratory fitness and that increased muscle-strengthening activities increases muscular fitness, with some evidence showing incremental benefits of doing both. One notable update from the 2010 guidelines was evidence to support changing from 'at least' 60 min to 'an average of' 60 min of MVPA per day as this was deemed to more closely reflect the body of evidence and the way MVPA has been measured. The physical activity recommendation was rated as strong based on overall moderate certainty evidence. The evidence indicated that greater time spent in sedentary behaviour is related to adverse health outcomes. The association between sedentary behaviour and adverse health outcomes is generally stronger for television viewing or recreational screen time as the specific exposure variable than for total sedentary time in youth. There was, however, insufficient evidence to set a precise threshold (or 'cut-off') for the amount of sedentary or recreational screen time. The sedentary behaviour recommendation was rated as strong based on low certainty evidence.

Recommendations for adults (18–64 years)

The evidence reaffirms that all adults should regularly undertake physical activity and that some physical activity is better than none. The adult guidelines include strong recommendations based on overall moderate-certainty evidence on weekly volumes of aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity. Many of the benefits of physical activity are observed within average weekly volumes of 150–300 min of moderate intensity or 75–150 min of vigorous intensity, or an equivalent combination of MVPA. The weekly range of recommended aerobic activity volume is a notable difference compared with the 2010 WHO recommendations that only specified minimum weekly thresholds. MVPA bouts of any duration now count towards these recommendations, reflecting new evidence to support the value of total physical activity volume, regardless of bout length. This recommendation differs from the requirement of bouts of at least 10 min in the previous WHO 2010 guidelines.

### When Do clinicians decide to screen children for mental health-behavioral-developmental delays / disorders: is it time to reconsider policy recommendations? [^111Cq2wK]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine at which ages providers choose to screen for mental, behavioral, and developmental disorder/delay (MBDD), and what they find; and which, if any, public and professional guidelines are most effective at identification.

Study Design

Naturalistic retrospective cohort study of 215 general pediatric and family practice clinics within 24 US states involving 160 634 encounters during which MBDD screening tests were administered.

Results

Almost all clinicians (96%) administered screens at ages targeted by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), that is, 9, 18, 24, and/or 30 months of age, but also at younger and older ages: 57% opted to screen at ≥ 5 years of age. Of the 8% of children at risk for probable MBDD, 27% were detected at American Academy of Pediatrics-targeted ages-71% across the birth to 5-year age range and an additional 29% at ≥ 5 years of age. Children > 30 months of age were 3 times more likely to have probable MBDD than were younger children, and those > 5 years of age were almost 4 times more likely to have probable MBDD. Older children were more likely to have psychosocial risk factors, but age itself was the most powerful predictor.

Conclusions

Most clinicians preferred to screen across the birth to 8-year age range and their findings revealed that most MBDDs cannot be detected in the earliest years of life. Policies regarding the timing of screening should be expanded to include all well visits and between visits if needed.

### Associations of passive and active screen time with psychosomatic complaints of adolescents [^114ZNxPb]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Increased screen time is a ubiquitous part of adolescent life and is adversely associated with their well-being. However, it remains unclear whether different types of screen time have equivalent associations, or if relationships are dose-dependent.

Methods

The data were from 2 nationally representative Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (2010, 2014) surveys across 44 European and North American countries. Psychosomatic health was assessed using 8 complaints and dichotomized as high or low. Discretionary time spent on passive (e.g. TV) and mentally active (e.g., electronic games, computer use) screen-based activities was categorized into 3 groups. Data were analyzed in 2021.

Results

The study included 414,489 adolescents (average age, 13.6 [SD = 1.63] years; 51.1% girls). Multilevel modeling showed that psychosomatic complaints increased monotonically once all forms of screen time exceeded 2 hours/day. Adolescents reporting high (> 4 hours/day) TV time, compared with those reporting low (≤ 2 hours/day), had higher odds of reporting psychosomatic complaints with 67% higher odds (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.62, 1.72) in boys and 71% (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.66, 1.75) in girls. High electronic game use was associated with psychosomatic complaints, with odds being 78% higher in boys (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.73, 1.84) and 88% higher in girls (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.82, 1.94). Similar associations were found between computer use and psychosomatic complaints.

Conclusions

Passive and mentally active screen time are adversely associated with psychosomatic complaints in a dose-dependent manner, with associations slightly stronger for active than passive screen time. This study supports limiting any type of screen time, either passive or active, to 2 hours/day to foster well-being.

### Smartphone screen time and suicide risk in daily life captured through high-resolution screenshot data [^115CHqKu]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The limitations of this study should be noted. First, we did not find any significant between-person effects. This may have been due to the small sample size; while the study design provided sufficient power for within-person analyses, it may have been underpowered to detect between-person effects. Additionally, participants were allowed to toggle the screenshot capture application on and off, potentially leading to an underestimation of actual smartphone use. However, the observed average of 4.5 hours of daily phone use aligns with large-scale studies on smartphone use in the United States, suggesting this limitation may not have substantially biased our findings. A further limitation is the reliance on smartphone screen time as a proxy for engagement in daily life, which leaves questions about what individuals are doing or experiencing during times when they are not using their phones. The observed positive association between smartphone screen time and EMA responsiveness highlights this gap and suggests the need for additional data sources to capture offline behaviors. Similarly, an analysis of the specific phone use activity was beyond the scope of the current study aims, but will be fruitful for future work to provide greater insights into the potential drivers of the smartphone screen time - suicide risk relationship. For example, active social media use (i.e. posting, one-on-one exchanges) has been hypothesized to yield positive outcomes, while passive use (i.e. scrolling) may increase the risk for social and mental health difficulties. These effects may also be amplified by specific social media platforms (i.e. applications, e.g. Snapchat, Instagram), which can encourage particular patterns of use or contribute to risks that extend across multiple platforms. It is also possible that the observed relationships are motivated by psychological variables not examined in the current study, such as emotional distress. Emotional distress may be directly influenced by phone use behaviors, and this effect may be exacerbated among individuals at heightened suicide risk. Further, emotional distress is one of the most significant short-term predictors of suicide risk, highlighting its potential role in the demonstrated associations.

### Changes and correlates of screen time in adults and children during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LEoj2]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Screen time has increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and several correlates have been associated with these increases. These changes, however, have not been aggregated. It was the aim of this review to (a) aggregate changes in screen time in adults and children, and (b) report on variables in relation to screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

A systematic review of major databases was undertaken for studies published from inception to 06/12/2021, using a pre-published protocol (PROSPERO ID: CRD42021261422). Studies reporting (a) screen time pre-versus-during the pandemic, (b) screen time percentage change, or (c) correlates of screen time during the pandemic were included. A random effects meta-analysis was undertaken with subgroup analysis by age group and type of screen time.

Findings

After review, 89 studies (n = 204,734; median age = 20·6; median female = 53·3%) were included. The majority of studies were cross-sectional. With regards to total screen time, primary aged children (6–10 years) reported largest increases (1·4 hrs/day; 95%CI 1·1–1·7), followed by adults (> 18 years; 1·0 hrs/day; 95%CI 0·7–1·2), adolescents (11–17 years; 0·9 hrs/day; 95%CI 0·3–1·5), and young children (0–5 years; 0·6 hrs/day 95%CI 0·3–0·9 hrs/day). For leisure screen time (non-work/non-academic), primary aged children reported largest increases (1·0 hrs/day 95%CI 0·8–1·3), followed by adults (0·7hr/day 95%CI 0·3–1·2), young children (0·6 hrs/day; 95%CI 0·4–0·8), with adolescents reporting the lowest increase (0·5 hrs/day 95%CI 0·3–0·7). Several correlates were associated with reported increases in screen time, including adverse dietary behaviours, sleep, mental health, parental health, and eye health.

Interpretation

Pooled evidence suggest that primary aged children reported the highest increase in both total and leisure screen time during COVID-19. It is recommended that screen time should be reduced in favour of non-sedentary activities. This study has the potential to inform public health policy and future guidance regarding screen time, and to inform future research in this area.

Funding

No funding was received for this study.

### Smartphone screen time and suicide risk in daily life captured through high-resolution screenshot data [^112FTdyQ]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Suicide rates are rising in the U.S., prompting interest in contributing factors like smartphone use. While screen time has been linked to mental health, its role in suicide risk is unclear. This study examined bidirectional associations between smartphone screen time and suicide risk in 79 adults with recent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Over 28 days, participants provided ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of suicide risk six times daily and contributed ~7.5 million screenshots, collected every 5seconds during phone use. Within-person increases in screen time were linked to elevated suicide risk in the following three hours, while screen time more than three hours prior predicted reduced planning and desire. Suicide risk also predicted subsequent screen time, and screen time was associated with greater EMA response rates. Findings suggest screen time may indicate both distress and coping, depending on context. These insights could inform real-time monitoring tools for suicide prevention and adaptive intervention strategies.

### Screen media use and mental health of children and adolescents: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1115Sm3F]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This study is a prespecified secondary analysis of the SCREENS (Short-term Efficacy of Reducing Screen-Based Media Use) trial, which is a parallel cluster randomized clinical trial (study protocol available in Supplement 1). Results for the primary outcome of the SCREENS trial and a secondary analysis have previously been reported. The primary outcome analysis revealed that children and adolescents allocated to the screen media reduction group increased their nonsedentary leisure time by 45 minutes per day compared with children and adolescents in the control group. In the present study, we report the results for children's and adolescents' behavioral strengths and difficulties based on data from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). The SDQ has been found to be a useful measure of young people's mental health. The trial design was developed on the basis of the results and experiences from the pilot trial. Family enrollment started on June 6, 2019, and the final follow-up assessments were completed on March 30, 2021. Ethical approval for the SCREENS trial was granted by the Ethical Committee of Southern Denmark. All families provided written informed consent before undergoing any assessments; parents provided consent verbally and in writing on behalf of their children, but children were present and could ask questions to their parents and the research staff. Signs of child dissent were considered contraindicatory to participation. This study is reported in compliance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline and statement for cluster randomized trials.

### Screen media use and mental health of children and adolescents: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116xj7e2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Intervention

The aim of the trial was to compare a reduction in leisure-time screen media use (intervention) with usual leisure-time screen media use (control) in families with children. The intervention lasted for 2 weeks and consisted of the following elements. All children and at least 1 adult (preferably all adults in the household) had to hand over smartphones or tablets during the 2 weeks of the intervention. They were also asked to reduce their leisure-time screen media use (all use of screen media devices outside self-reported work and school hours) on other devices, such as televisions and computers, to 3 hours per week or less. Participants who handed over their smartphone received a non-smartphone in return that could call and send text messages. Participants were asked to register all leisure-time screen media use during the intervention. Small intervention reminder posters were put up in the household, and each family received a small financial reimbursement of approximately €70 (US $76). Participants were allowed 30 minutes per day of necessary screen media use to enable coordination of appointments, completion of school assignments, and other necessary tasks. Necessary screen media use was not considered a part of their leisure-time screen media use. A more detailed description of the intervention and the theoretical framework underpinning the intervention is described in the study protocol. Families allocated to the control group were asked to carry on with their usual screen media habits until they completed the follow-up measurements, at which time they would be offered to try the intervention condition.

Intervention Compliance

As outlined in the previous study, we evaluated adherence to the screen media reduction intervention using objective measures, including research-based smartphone and tablet tracker applications, PC software, and television monitors. In the screen media use reduction group, 97% of the children and adolescents (83 of 86) were sufficiently compliant to the intervention, defined a priori as having less than or equal to 7 hours per week of leisure-time screen media use to ensure a distinct contrast with the control group, while allowing for a marginal deviation from the target.

### Smartphone screen time reduction improves mental health: a randomized controlled trial [^115zcAaQ]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to the duration of screen time, the content consumed, and the manner of usage appear to be particularly relevant for their association with well-being. Besides the benefits that social media offers, there are also harmful aspects. Social comparisons regarding physical appearance, alongside preoccupation with one's photos and feedback, are associated with poorer body image, disordered eating, and depressive symptoms, particularly in girls. Additionally, especially poorly self-regulated social media use can lead to goal conflicts, distraction from intended activities and, consequently, negative well-being.

Overall, it should be taken into account that the use of social media ranges from, for example, searching for information, passing the time, social interaction, entertainment, expressing opinions, sharing information, relaxing and even monitoring others or gaining knowledge about them. Reviews have shown that active social media use (i.e. posting) has a small positive effect and passive use (i.e. browsing) has a slightly negative effect on well-being. A further differentiation into active private use (sending messages), passive private use (reading messages), and passive public use (browsing) did not affect the well-being of young people on average, but inter-individual differences emerged. Therefore, the way individuals use their smartphones appears to be an important factor.

### Smartphone screen time reduction improves mental health: a randomized controlled trial [^115eJGno]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Numerous observational studies on the associations between general screen use and psychological well-being have documented small effect sizes (e.g.). This is in contrast to the present RCT that found larger effect sizes, especially when looking at the subgroup that strictly adhered to the 2-h time limit (per-protocol analysis). These different effect sizes cannot be conclusively explained but may be attributed to the differing study designs (observational cross-sectional study vs. longitudinal intervention study), varying sample sizes (large-scale analysis vs. small sample size in the current study), or different target groups (children and adolescents vs. young adults). In any case, the current results would have to be replicated in larger samples in order to draw generalizable conclusions.

The study design does not permit conclusions about the reasons for the rapid increase in screen time; however, this trend may be partially explained by the strong appeal of smartphones among young people and the pervasive fear of missing out (FOMO). Additionally, minor individual improvements detected by the mental health questionnaires may not have been perceived by the participants themselves. Accordingly, the subjective advantages of smartphones and social media, such as staying in touch with friends, emotional support, seeking mental health information, and community building, could outweigh the effects on mental health. Effective self-regulation of social media use can particularly improve psychological well-being by supporting mood management, emotion-focused coping, and the fulfillment of intrinsic needs.

### Smartphone screen time reduction improves mental health: a randomized controlled trial [^1122SNoz]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The study highlights mental health improvements through smartphone use reduction. The rapid return to high usage post-intervention underscores the challenges young people face in managing their smartphone use. With increasing global smartphone screen time and social media use, these findings hold particular significance. If larger studies confirm a causal link between screen time and mental health, a serious rethinking of our smartphone behavior would be called for. Consequently, factors that positively and sustainably influence screen time and social media usage (e.g. types of usage) must be considered.

The allure of social media makes self-regulation of screen time behavior challenging, supporting stricter regulations, especially for children and young people. Our study demonstrates both the substantial mental health benefits of reduced smartphone screen time and the challenges in maintaining it.

### Waking up to the health implications of poor sleep habits [^1143pC5k]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Late night electronic screen use looms as a major potential disruptor to high-quality sleeping patterns. These devices, producing intense blue light, affect melatonin production, release and subsequently sleep patterns. The links between screen time use, sleep deprivation, and depressive and mental health issues are complex, and current understanding is not conclusive. Findings from several population studies have shown a link between screen use and depressive symptoms for both children and adults. However, a causal relationship between the two is yet to be captured; therefore, guidelines on screen use for children vary. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health have declined to provide guidelines for screen time, whereas The American Academy of Paediatrics provides more specific suggestions for three age groups of children.

Sleep loss affects our susceptibility to infections, metabolism, and mental health. Poor sleep habits are also a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Sleep interruption modulates hormones such as cortisone and melatonin, subsequently affecting glucose metabolism. Meanwhile better sleep can aid fat versus muscle loss in individuals who are dieting. Men who sleep fewer than 4 h per night have a significant decrease in testosterone after just 1 week, potentially affecting libido and reproductive ability. Aside from the short-term effects on performance, memory consolidation, and mental wellbeing, studies are beginning to show links between β-amyloid presence and sleep deprivation in both the mouse and human brain. Accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Poor sleep habits look to compound the already sizeable effect of multimodal disorders.

### Screen media use and mental health of children and adolescents: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115gSrnK]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Taken together, the results of this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial show that when entire families — both parents, children, and adolescents — reduce their leisure-time screen media use for 2 weeks, it can positively affect children's and adolescents' behavioral strengths and difficulties. The intervention targeted an overall reduction in screen media use during leisure time, without pinpointing specific types of screen media activities. Future research should explore the potential differential effects of various types of screen media use and look deeper into whether collective family participation in such interventions is a pivotal component for observed benefits. Moreover, more research is needed to confirm whether these effects are sustainable in the long term.

### Physical activity behaviours in adolescence: current evidence and opportunities for intervention [^114ZXQBQ]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Young people aged 10–24 years constitute 24% of the world's population; investing in their health could yield a triple benefit-eg, today, into adulthood, and for the next generation. However, in physical activity research, this life stage is poorly understood, with the evidence dominated by research in younger adolescents (aged 10–14 years), school settings, and high-income countries. Globally, 80% of adolescents are insufficiently active, and many adolescents engage in 2 h or more daily recreational screen time. In this Series paper, we present the most up-to-date global evidence on adolescent physical activity and discuss directions for identifying potential solutions to enhance physical activity in the adolescent population. Adolescent physical inactivity probably contributes to key global health problems, including cardiometabolic and mental health disorders, but the evidence is methodologically weak. Evidence-based solutions focus on three key components of the adolescent physical activity system: supportive schools, the social and digital environment, and multipurpose urban environments. Despite an increasing volume of research focused on adolescents, there are still important knowledge gaps, and efforts to improve adolescent physical activity surveillance, research, intervention implementation, and policy development are urgently needed.

### Longitudinal associations between maternal and child screen use at 1 year of age and child behavior and development at 3 years of age [^1129RkEH]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The findings of our multivariable analysis suggest that there is likely a complex interplay of family factors, including maternal mental health and screen use, that contribute to child behavioural and developmental outcomes, thus implying that the focus may need to be shifted away from rigid time-based screen use recommendations in early childhood. The comparison of effect sizes of screen use and maternal mental health suggested attention could be better directed to optimising maternal mental health, maternal education, and equitable distribution of wealth. Previous research has also found an association between maternal mental health and both maternal and child screen use, further highlighting the complex interplay between these factors.

Strengths of our study include using device-specific data that separately examined TV and mobile/tablet use which are the two main screen exposures of young children. We also looked at maternal screen use as both TV and mobile/tablet, acknowledging that parental behaviours may also influence child development. Our multivariable analysis allowed potential confounding factors to be controlled which enabled the study to investigate the independent impact of screen use and, together with the spider plots, suggested other environmental factors that may have a stronger association.

A limitation of our study was that our evidence demonstrated an association but not causation, although it did take account of many known confounders. We had a lack of objective measurement of screen use and behavioural and developmental outcomes, and used single informant reporting for both screen use and behavioural and developmental outcomes, which risks recall bias. Maternal underreporting of screen time may reduce the association between screen time and behavioural and developmental outcomes. We did not investigate content or context of viewing (e.g. whether there was co-viewing with an adult). We did not investigate father's screen use and mental health, which could be important in future studies considering the context of modern family households. We also did not consider maternal chronic disease, parenting style, or other aspects of family such as genetics, which may contribute to residual confounding. There was missing data which reduced our sample size. Missing data may have resulted from difficulties in engaging a large cohort with many assessments resulting in questionnaire fatigue, and technical problems with the online delivery of questions during the data collection period. This may have resulted in selection bias and the inclusion of participants who may have had less behavioural and developmental problems. Whilst the COVID-19 restrictions in Western Australia were light and of very short duration compared to many other communities, it may have impacted the variables in this study including maternal and child screen use, maternal mental health and child outcomes.
