## Question

Paxlovid dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) dosing, including standard adult dosing, renal adjustments, timing, administration, special populations, and a concise synthesis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indication and standard adult regimen. Then, I should verify renal impairment dosing and reconcile any discrepancies between FDA and IDSA guidance. Next, I will review timing of initiation, administration instructions, and missed-dose handling. After that, I need to check pediatric, hepatic impairment, and pregnancy/lactation considerations. Finally, I will integrate drug–drug interaction principles and summarize a practical dosing algorithm with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the indication and standard adult dosing. Paxlovid is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults at high risk for progression to severe disease, initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis and within 5 days of symptom onset, with the standard regimen of 300 mg nirmatrelvir plus 100 mg ritonavir orally every 12 hours for 5 days, with all three tablets taken together and swallowed whole with or without food [^4ecbfc18] [^a2e10084] [^344d8faf].

> Wait, let me verify renal impairment dosing because I recall conflicting guidance. The FDA labeling provides dose-reduced regimens for moderate and severe renal impairment, specifically 150 mg nirmatrelvir/100 mg ritonavir every 12 hours for eGFR 30–59 mL/min, and for eGFR < 30 mL/min a regimen of 300 mg/100 mg on Day 1 followed by 150 mg/100 mg once daily on Days 2–5, with doses given after hemodialysis on dialysis days, which is supported by pharmacokinetic data showing markedly increased nirmatrelvir exposure as eGFR declines and modeling that informed these adjustments [^a2e10084] [^eff47748] [^e18637fb] [^cb72c40d].

> Hold on, I should verify how this aligns with IDSA guidance. IDSA recommends 150 mg/100 mg every 12 hours for eGFR 30–60 mL/min and advises against use if eGFR < 30 mL/min, which conflicts with FDA's severe impairment regimen; given that FDA's severe impairment dosing is based on PK modeling and limited clinical data, and IDSA's stance reflects caution due to insufficient evidence, I need to emphasize shared decision-making and close monitoring if the FDA severe impairment regimen is used off-guideline, and I should explicitly note this discrepancy to avoid overgeneralization [^409fd219] [^5a9f0f35] [^78b7be52].

> I need to ensure timing and administration details are precise. Treatment should start as soon as possible and within 5 days of symptom onset; tablets are swallowed whole and can be taken with or without food, at approximately the same times each day; if a dose is missed within 8 hours, take it as soon as possible and resume the normal schedule, but if more than 8 hours have passed, skip the missed dose and do not double up, which helps maintain consistent exposure and minimize adverse effects [^a2e10084] [^fe2fda26].

> Next, I should review special populations. For pediatrics, the FDA EUA covers patients aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg, using the adult regimen; for children under 12 or under 40 kg, pediatric dosing is not established, though some reports describe weight-based pediatric protocols in research settings, so I should caution that such pediatric dosing is investigational and not standard of care pending definitive pediatric data [^0ee6c4a0] [^cb619c76]. For hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is recommended for mild or moderate hepatic impairment, but use in severe hepatic impairment is not recommended due to lack of data, so I should confirm liver disease severity before prescribing [^e2e7012e]. For pregnancy and lactation, available data suggest low transfer into breast milk and no clear teratogenic signals in animal studies, and professional societies support offering Paxlovid to pregnant patients at high risk after reviewing interactions, with shared decision-making regarding lactation exposure [^e03c329b] [^10f678fe] [^07c116f3].

> I will now examine drug–drug interactions because ritonavir is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. I should confirm that concomitant use with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated levels are dangerous is contraindicated, and that potent CYP3A inducers can reduce Paxlovid levels and risk virologic failure; practical management includes holding or adjusting interacting medications when feasible, using interaction checklists, and considering alternatives if risks outweigh benefits, which is especially critical in polypharmacy and in patients on immunosuppressants or anticoagulants [^f8ddf6e7] [^bc29992b] [^711f75a7] [^86e204e4].

> Let me synthesize a practical dosing algorithm while keeping the renal discrepancy explicit. For adults with normal renal function, use 300 mg nirmatrelvir/100 mg ritonavir every 12 hours for 5 days, starting within 5 days of symptom onset; for eGFR 30–59 mL/min, use 150 mg/100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days; for eGFR < 30 mL/min, FDA allows 300 mg/100 mg on Day 1 then 150 mg/100 mg once daily on Days 2–5 with doses after dialysis, but IDSA advises against use, so I should document informed consent and monitor closely if using the FDA regimen; for pediatrics, use the adult regimen only if age is ≥ 12 years and weight is ≥ 40 kg, otherwise dosing is not established; always screen medications for interactions and counsel on adherence and missed-dose handling [^a2e10084] [^409fd219] [^5a9f0f35] [^0ee6c4a0].

> But wait, what about rebound and resistance concerns that might influence dosing decisions. Randomized data show viral RNA rebound occurs in a minority of patients and at similar rates with Paxlovid versus placebo, and rebound has not been linked to increased hospitalization or death; rare treatment-emergent Mpro substitutions have been observed, but cross-resistance with remdesivir is not expected, so rebound should not deter appropriate use in high-risk patients [^6b5e6839] [^253e8dd5] [^2813d4b9].

> Finally, I should double-check that I've addressed key caveats. The evidence base is strongest for unvaccinated, high-risk outpatients treated within 5 days, with lower certainty in vaccinated or standard-risk populations, and real-world data suggest benefit in high-risk groups while acknowledging heterogeneity; underuse remains a problem, so I need to ensure timely access, clear renal dosing instructions, and proactive interaction management to realize clinical benefit [^c641b5f0] [^5d74240b] [^398c2a0f].

Paxlovid dosing is **300 mg nirmatrelvir plus 100 mg ritonavir orally every 12 hours for 5 days** [^a2e10084], started within 5 days of symptom onset [^a2e10084]. For moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–59 mL/min), reduce nirmatrelvir to **150 mg every 12 hours** [^a2e10084]; for severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min), use **150 mg once daily on days 2–5 after a single 300 mg dose on day 1** [^eff47748]. No dose adjustment is needed for mild hepatic impairment [^e2e7012e]; use is not recommended in severe hepatic impairment [^e2e7012e]. Review all medications for CYP3A interactions before prescribing [^0a6cfcb6] [^bc29992b].

---

## Standard dosing regimen

- **Standard dose**: 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) plus 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) orally every 12 hours for 5 days [^a2e10084] [^fe2fda26].
- **Timing**: Initiate within 5 days of symptom onset [^a2e10084] [^344d8faf].
- **Administration**: Take with or without food; swallow tablets whole [^a2e10084] [^fe2fda26].

---

## Renal impairment dosing adjustments

Renal function guides dosing because nirmatrelvir is renally cleared [^e18637fb] [^cb72c40d]:

| **Renal function (egfr)** | **Nirmatrelvir dose** | **Ritonavir dose** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ≥ 60 mL/min | 300 mg | 100 mg | Every 12 hours |
| 30–59 mL/min | 150 mg | 100 mg | Every 12 hours |
| < 30 mL/min | 300 mg on day 1, then 150 mg on days 2–5 | 100 mg | Once daily |

---

On hemodialysis days, **administer after dialysis** [^a2e10084] [^eff47748].

---

## Hepatic impairment considerations

- **Mild to moderate impairment**: No dose adjustment required [^e2e7012e].
- **Severe impairment**: Not recommended due to limited data [^e2e7012e].

---

## Pediatric dosing

Pediatric use is **authorized for patients aged ≥ 12 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg** [^0ee6c4a0] [^acf279de]; the adult regimen applies [^fd610905]. For children < 12 years or < 40 kg, dosing is not established [^e03c329b].

---

## Drug interactions

Ritonavir is a strong CYP3A inhibitor [^0a6cfcb6]; **review all medications for interactions** before prescribing [^bc29992b]. Contraindicated drugs include those highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated levels are dangerous [^f8ddf6e7] [^bc29992b].

---

## Missed dose guidance

If a dose is missed within 8 hours, take it as soon as possible and resume the normal schedule; if more than 8 hours have passed, **skip the dose and take the next dose at the scheduled time** [^a2e10084].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing

The 5-day, twice-daily regimen was selected to maintain nirmatrelvir above the **EC90** [^4c75da18] and reduce viral load and progression risk [^cafad90d]. In the EPIC-HR trial, this regimen reduced hospitalization or death by 89% in high-risk, unvaccinated adults [^344d8faf] [^0c7d4f5c].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Discuss risks and benefits; limited data suggest low risk, but use caution [^e03c329b] [^df878c3d].
- **Lactation**: Small amounts transfer into milk; weigh benefits vs potential infant exposure [^e03c329b].
- **Rebound**: Viral rebound can occur but is generally mild and not associated with worse outcomes [^6b5e6839] [^398c2a0f].

---

Paxlovid is dosed at **300/100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days**, with renal adjustments and interaction screening to ensure safety and efficacy [^a2e10084] [^bc29992b].

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^0a210097]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) aims to avoid severe COVID-19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Due to its novelty, there are currently few published study results. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) plus standard of care compared to standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID-19 and for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses. To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in-between publication of review updates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Scopus, and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 11 July 2022. This is a LSR. We conduct monthly update searches that are being made publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events. We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially-disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from LICs and LMICs, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main Results

As of 11 July 2022, we included one RCT with 2246 participants in outpatient settings with mild symptomatic COVID-19 comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care plus placebo. Trial participants were unvaccinated, without previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, had a symptom onset of no more than five days before randomization, and were at high risk for progression to severe disease. Prohibited prior or concomitant therapies included medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance and CYP3A4 inducers. We identified eight ongoing studies. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID-19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease For the specific population of unvaccinated, high-risk patients nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 11 deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to 0 deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low-certainty evidence, and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 61 admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to eight admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on treatment-emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment-related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No study results were identified for improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance. Subgroup analyses for equity Most study participants were younger than 65 years (87.1% of the: modified intention to treat (mITT1) population with 2085 participants), of white ethnicity (71.5%), and were from UMICs or HICs (92.1% of study centres). Data on comorbidities were insufficient. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity: age (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years) and ethnicity (Asian versus Black versus White versus others). There was no difference between subgroups of age. The effects favoured treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the White ethnic group. Estimated effects in the other ethnic groups included the line of no effect (RR = 1). No subgroups were reported for comorbidity status and World Bank country classification by income level. No subgroups were reported for other outcomes. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID-19 in inpatient settings with moderate to severe disease No studies available. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (PrEP and PEP) No studies available.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and hospital admission or death based on one trial investigating unvaccinated COVID-19 participants without previous infection that were at high risk and with symptom onset of no more than five days. There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is safe in people without prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4. Regarding equity aspects, except for ethnicity, no differences in effect size and direction were identified. No evidence is available on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to treat hospitalized people with COVID-19 and to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will continually update our search and make search results available on OSF.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^c641b5f0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) aims to avoid severe COVID-19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID-19 or preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses. To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in-between publication of review updates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Scopus, and World Health Organization COVID-19 Research Database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 15 May 2023. This is a LSR. We conduct update searches every two months and make them publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in postexposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events. We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially-disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from low-income countries and low- to middle-income countries, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main Results

As of 15 May 2023, we included two RCTs with 2510 participants with mild and mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 in outpatient and inpatient settings comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo. All trial participants were without previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and at high risk for progression to severe disease. Randomization coincided with the Delta wave for outpatients and Omicron wave for inpatients. Outpatient trial participants and 73% of inpatients were unvaccinated. Symptom onset in outpatients was no more than five days before randomisation and prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 were not allowed. We excluded two studies due to concerns with research integrity. We identified 13 ongoing studies. Three studies are currently awaiting classification. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 in outpatient settings Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC compared to SoC plus placebo may reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence) and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC probably has little or no effect on treatment-emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment-related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies reported improvement of clinical status, quality of life, or viral clearance. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in inpatient settings We are uncertain whether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC compared to SoC reduces all-cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.86; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or increases viral clearance at seven days (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.58; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 14 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.20; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported improvement or worsening of clinical status and quality of life. We did not include data for safety outcomes due to insufficient and inconsistent information. Subgroup analyses for equity For outpatients, the outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity regarding age (less than 65 years versus 65 years or greater) and ethnicity. There were no subgroup differences for age or ethnicity. For inpatients, the outcome 'all-cause mortality' was investigated for equity regarding age (65 years or less versus greater than 65 years). There was no difference between subgroups of age. No further equity-related subgroups were reported, and no subgroups were reported for other outcomes. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (PrEP and PEP) No studies available.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and hospital admission or death in high-risk, unvaccinated COVID-19 outpatients infected with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence of the safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Very low-certainty evidence exists regarding the effects of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on all-cause mortality and viral clearance in mildly to moderately affected, mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 inpatients infected with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Insufficient and inconsistent information prevents the assessment of safety outcomes. No reliable differences in effect size and direction were found regarding equity aspects. There is no available evidence supporting the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are continually updating our search and making search results available on the OSF platform.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^8e0be5b0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

All doses and regimens of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were eligible for this systematic review. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is authorized and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (EUA for Paxlovid ®) at a dose of 300 mg (as two 150 mg tablets) of nirmatrelvir with one 100 mg tablet of ritonavir, given twice‐daily for five days.

We compared nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care with or without placebo, or to any other intervention for treating COVID‐19 and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Co‐interventions (standard of care) must have been comparable between the study arms.

Types of outcome measures

We evaluated core outcomes in accordance with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative for COVID‐19 patients (COMET 2020; Marshall 2020), and additional outcomes that have been prioritized by consumer representatives and the German guideline panel for treatment of people with COVID‐19 (German AWMF Guideline 2021).

We used different outcome sets for the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with COVID‐19 in the out‐ and inpatient setting, and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. If studies were eligible for inclusion regarding study design, population, intervention, and comparator, but no outcomes of interest have been reported, they were not included for meta‐analysis. However, we have summarized reported outcomes for all included studies in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. We did not exclude studies if they did not report outcomes of interest.

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^26a93cc4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1	Important Dosage and Administration Information

PAXLOVID is nirmatrelvir tablets co-packaged with ritonavir tablets. There are three different dose packs available:

PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) co-packaged for oral use 300 mg;100 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) co-packaged for oral use 150 mg;100 mg for patients with moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) co-packaged for oral use 300 mg;100 mg (Day 1) and 150 mg;100 mg (Days 2–5) for patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Nirmatrelvir must be co-administered with ritonavir. Failure to correctly co-administer nirmatrelvir with ritonavir may result in plasma levels of nirmatrelvir that are insufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.

Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Completion of the full 5-day treatment course and continued isolation in accordance with public health recommendations are important to maximize viral clearance and minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

---

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^a2e10084]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The 5-day treatment course of PAXLOVID should be initiated as soon as possible after a diagnosis of COVID-19 has been made, and within 5 days of symptom onset even if baseline COVID-19 symptoms are mild. Should a patient require hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19 after starting treatment with PAXLOVID, the patient should complete the full 5-day treatment course per the healthcare provider's discretion.

If the patient misses a dose of PAXLOVID within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take it as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If the patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

PAXLOVID (both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets) can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken, or crushed.

2.2	Recommended Dosage

The recommended dosage for PAXLOVID is 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) with all 3 tablets taken together orally twice daily in the morning and at bedtime for 5 days.

2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min].

In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min) or with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) including those requiring hemodialysis, the dosage of PAXLOVID should be reduced as shown in Table 1. PAXLOVID should be administered at approximately the same time each day for 5 days. On days patients with severe renal impairment undergo hemodialysis, the PAXLOVID dose should be administered after hemodialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^eff47748]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe Renal Impairment (Including Those Requiring Hemodialysis)

To ensure appropriate dosing in patients with severe renal impairment, including those requiring hemodialysis, instruct patients that they will be taking two 150 mg nirmatrelvir tablets with one 100 mg ritonavir tablet together once on Day 1, followed by one 150 mg nirmatrelvir tablet with one 100 mg ritonavir together once daily on Days 2–5. Instruct patients to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. On days when patients undergo hemodialysis, instruct them to take the PAXLOVID dose after hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Administration Instructions

Inform patients to take PAXLOVID with or without food at approximately the same time each day as instructed. Advise patients to swallow all tablets for PAXLOVID whole and not to chew, break, or crush the tablets. Alert the patient of the importance of completing the full 5-day treatment course and to continuing isolation in accordance with public health recommendations to maximize viral clearance and minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2. If the patient misses a dose of PAXLOVID within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take it as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If the patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double the dose to make up for a missed dose [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Patients with Renal Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir in subjects with renal impairment following administration of a single oral dose of nirmatrelvir 100 mg (0.33 times the approved recommended dose) co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg were determined. Compared to healthy controls with no renal impairment, the Cmaxand AUC of nirmatrelvir in subjects with mild renal impairment was 30% and 24% higher, in subjects with moderate renal impairment was 38% and 87% higher, and in subjects with severe renal impairment was 48% and 204% higher, respectively.

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir in subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) either requiring intermittent hemodialysis (n = 12) or not requiring hemodialysis (n = 2) were evaluated after administration of 300 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir once on Day 1 followed by 150 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir once daily on Days 2–5 for a total of 5 doses.

The administration of 300 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir once on Day 1 followed by 150 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir once daily on Days 2–5 in subjects with severe renal impairment, either requiring intermittent hemodialysis or not requiring hemodialysis resulted in comparable exposures on Day 1 and at steady-state (AUC0-24and Cmax) compared to those observed in subjects with normal renal function receiving 300 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice daily for 5 days. During a 4-hour hemodialysis session, approximately 6.9% of nirmatrelvir dose was cleared through dialysis. Hemodialysis clearance was 1.83 L/h.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir were similar in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects following administration of a single oral dose of nirmatrelvir 100 mg (0.33 times the approved recommended dose) co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg. The impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir has not been studied.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of PAXLOVID include subjects 65 years of age and older and their data contributes to the overall assessment of safety and efficacy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Of the total number of subjects in the integrated dataset consisting of EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR who were randomized to and received PAXLOVID (N = 1,578), 165 (10%) were 65 years of age and older and 39 (2%) were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Renal impairment increases nirmatrelvir exposure, which may increase the risk of PAXLOVID adverse reactions. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min). Reduce the PAXLOVID dosage in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min). Reduce the PAXLOVID dose and dose frequency in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min), including those requiring hemodialysis. On days when patients undergo hemodialysis, the PAXLOVID dose should be administered after hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment of PAXLOVID is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment, therefore, PAXLOVID is not recommended for use in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Recommendations for the management of drug-drug interactions between the COVID-19 antiviral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir (paxlovid) and comedications [^711f75a7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) has been granted authorization or approval in several countries for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression to severe disease and with no requirement for supplemental oxygen. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir will be primarily administered outside the hospital setting as a 5-day course oral treatment. The ritonavir component boosts plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir through the potent and rapid inhibition of the key drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Thus nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, even given as a short treatment course, has a high potential to cause harm from drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with other drugs metabolized through this pathway. Options for mitigating risk from DDIs with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are limited due to the clinical illness, the short window for intervention, and the related difficulty of implementing clinical monitoring or dosage adjustment of the comedication. Pragmatic options are largely confined to preemptive or symptom-driven pausing of the comedication or managing any additional risk through counseling. This review summarizes the effects of ritonavir on drug disposition (i.e., metabolizing enzymes and transporters) and discusses factors determining the likelihood of having a clinically significant DDI. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive list of comedications likely to be used in COVID-19 patients which are categorized according to their potential DDI risk with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. It also discusses recommendations for the management of DDIs which balance the risk of harm from DDIs with a short course of ritonavir, against unnecessary denial of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment.

### Nirmatrelvir / ritonavir regimen for mild / moderately severe COVID-19: a rapid review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^a04b1aac]. Annals of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of the approved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir regimen for treatment of laboratory-confirmed mild/moderately severe COVID-19 remains unclear.

Methods

We systematically identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world studies (RWS; observational studies) of the efficacy/effectiveness and/or safety of the approved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir regimen for COVID-19. We pooled appropriate data (adjusted estimates for RWS) using an inverse variance, random-effects model. We calculated statistical heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic. Results are presented as relative risk (RR) with associated 95% CI. We further assessed risk of bias/study quality and conducted trial sequential analysis of the evidence from RCTs.

Results

We included 4 RCTs (4,070 persons) and 16 RWS (1,925,047 persons) of adults (aged ≥ 18 years). One and 3 RCTs were of low and unclear risk of bias, respectively. The RWS were of good quality. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir significantly decreased COVID-19 hospitalization compared with placebo/no treatment (RR = 0.17; 95% CI, 0.10–0.31; I² = 77.2%; 2 RCTs, 3,542 persons), but there was no significant difference for decrease of worsening severity (RR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.01; I² = 47.5%; 3 RCTs, 1,824 persons), viral clearance (RR = 1.19; 95% CI, 0.93–1.51; I² = 82%; 2 RCTs, 528 persons), adverse events (RR = 1.41; 95% CI, 0.92–2.14; I² = 70.6%; 4 RCTs, 4,070 persons), serious adverse events (RR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.41–1.62; I² = 0%; 3 RCTs, 3,806 persons), and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.04–1.70; I² = 49.9%; 3 RCTs, 3,806 persons), although trial sequential analysis suggested that the current total sample sizes for these outcomes were not large enough for conclusions to be drawn. Real-world studies also showed significantly decreased COVID-19 hospitalization (RR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.37–0.60; I² = 95.0%; 11 RWS, 1,421,398 persons) and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.14–0.34; I² = 65%; 7 RWS, 286,131 persons) for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir compared with no treatment.

Conclusions

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir appears to be promising for preventing hospitalization and potentially decreasing all-cause mortality for persons with mild/moderately severe COVID-19, but the evidence is weak. More studies are needed.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Co-administration of PAXLOVID can alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the plasma concentrations of PAXLOVID. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PAXLOVID therapy and review concomitant medications during PAXLOVID therapy. (4, 5.1, 7, 12.3)

7.1	Potential for PAXLOVID to Affect Other Drugs

PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir co-packaged with ritonavir) is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, and an inhibitor of CYP2D6, P-gp and OATP1B1. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6 or are transported by P-gp or OATP1B1 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs and increase the risk of adverse events. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.3) Table 2]. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 2.

7.2	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect PAXLOVID

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP3A substrates; therefore, drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce PAXLOVID therapeutic effect [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.3) Table 2].

7.3	Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Table 2 provides a listing of clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Drugs listed in Table 2 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor such as ritonavir.

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^b39098c1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of PAXLOVID, which contains ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PAXLOVID, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Medications that induce CYP3A may decrease concentrations of PAXLOVID. These interactions may lead to:

Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
Loss of therapeutic effect of PAXLOVID and possible development of viral resistance.

Severe, life-threatening, and/or fatal adverse reactions due to drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with PAXLOVID. The most commonly reported concomitant medications resulting in serious adverse reactions were calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine), followed by calcium channel blockers.

Prior to prescribing PAXLOVID, review all medications taken by the patient to assess potential drug-drug interactions and determine if concomitant medications require a dose adjustment, interruption, and/or additional monitoring (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors) [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs. Drugs listed in Table 2 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID.

Consider the benefit of PAXLOVID treatment in reducing hospitalization and death, and whether the risk of potential drug-drug interactions for an individual patient can be appropriately managed [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Studies (14)].

5.2	Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome), and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with PAXLOVID [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

5.3	Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering PAXLOVID to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis.

Types of interventions

All doses and regimens of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were eligible for this systematic review. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is authorized and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at a dose of 300 mg (as two 150 mg tablets) of nirmatrelvir with one 100 mg tablet of ritonavir, given twice‐daily for five days (EUA for Paxlovid).

We compared nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo, or to any other intervention for treating COVID‐19 and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We planned to investigate different active comparators in separate comparisons. Co‐interventions (SoC) must have been comparable between the study arms.

Types of outcome measures

We evaluated core outcomes in accordance with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative for people with COVID‐19 (COMET 2020; Marshall 2020), and additional outcomes that have been prioritized by consumer representatives and the German guideline panel for treatment of people with COVID‐19 (German AWMF Guideline 2021).

We used different outcome sets for the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with COVID‐19 in the out‐ and inpatient setting, and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. If studies were eligible for inclusion regarding study design, population, intervention, and comparator, but no outcomes of interest were reported, they were not included for meta‐analysis. However, we summarized reported outcomes for all included studies in the Characteristics of included studies table. We did not exclude studies if they did not report outcomes of interest.

In adults, "ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% compared to placebo in non-hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years) with COVID-19 who were at high risk of progression to severe disease", and "It is unclear whether any participants had HIV". Pediatric data are emerging: "A case series of nine children who received ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir reported few adverse events and no hospitalizations after receiving treatment", and exposure is expected to be similar because "Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is expected to achieve similar drug exposure in adolescents aged ≥ 12 years and who weigh ≥ 40 kg as in adults, and there is extensive experience with the use of ritonavir in children". Based on these data, the guidance states the Panel "recommends that ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be considered in the outpatient setting for the treatment of laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected mild to moderate COVID-19 in children with HIV who are aged ≥ 12 years and weigh ≥ 40 kg who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 due to advanced or untreated HIV or another high-risk condition as defined by CDC (BII*)".

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are present in human breast milk in small amounts (less than 2%). In a clinical lactation study in 8 lactating women, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir were estimated to be present in human milk at a mean weight-normalized infant daily dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day (1.8% of maternal weight-adjusted daily dose) and 0.006 mg/kg/day (0.2% of maternal weight-adjusted daily dose), respectively (see Data).

There are no available data on the effects of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PAXLOVID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PAXLOVID or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.

Data

In a clinical pharmacokinetics study, 8 healthy lactating women who were at least 12 weeks postpartum were administered 3 oral doses every 12 hours (steady state dosing) of 300 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The mean daily amount of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir recovered in breast milk was 0.752 mg and 0.027 mg, respectively, representing 0.13% and 0.014% of the corresponding administered daily maternal doses (unadjusted for weight). The estimated daily infant dose (assuming average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day), was 0.16 mg/kg/day and 0.006 mg/kg/day, 1.8% and 0.2% of the maternal dose, respectively, for nirmatrelvir and ritonavir.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Contraception

Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^0885cb82]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Nirmatrelvir is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antiviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

Ritonavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor but is not active against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At 3 times the steady state peak plasma concentration (Cmax) at the recommended dose, nirmatrelvir does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were similar in healthy subjects and in subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Nirmatrelvir AUC increased in a less than dose proportional manner over a single dose range from 250 mg to 750 mg (0.83 to 2.5 times the approved recommended dose) and multiple dose range from 75 mg to 500 mg (0.25 to 1.67 times the approved recommended dose), when administered in combination with 100 mg ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir steady state was achieved on Day 2 following administration of the approved recommended dosage and the mean accumulation ratio was approximately 2-fold.

The pharmacokinetic properties of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are displayed in Table 3.

The predicted Day 5 nirmatrelvir exposure parameters in adult subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were treated with PAXLOVID in EPIC-HR are presented in Table 4.

Effect of Food

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir were observed following administration of a high fat meal (800–1,000 calories; 50% fat) to healthy subjects.

There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir based on age (18 to 86 years), sex, or race/ethnicity.

Pediatric Patients

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.

A total of 2,113 subjects were randomized to receive either PAXLOVID or placebo. At baseline, mean age was 45 years; 51% were male; 71% were White, 15% were Asian, 9% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 4% were Black or African American, and 1% was missing or unknown; 41% were Hispanic or Latino; 67% of subjects had onset of symptoms ≤ 3 days before initiation of study treatment; 49% of subjects were serological negative at baseline; the mean (SD) baseline viral RNA in nasopharyngeal samples was 4.71 log10copies/mL (2.89); 27% of subjects had a baseline viral RNA of ≥ 10^7 (log10copies/mL); 6% of subjects either received or were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic monoclonal antibody treatment at the time of randomization and were excluded from the mITT and mITT1 analyses.

The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the PAXLOVID and placebo groups.

The proportions of subjects who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event were 2.0% in the PAXLOVID group and 4.2% in the placebo group.

At a crucial time with rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant globally, the United States Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization for 2 oral antivirals, molnupiravir (in persons aged ≥ 18 years) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) (in persons aged ≥ 12 years weighing ≥ 40 kg), for the outpatient treatment of patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at risk for progression. Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue, whereas nirmatrelvir is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor, and ritonavir is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitor. Drug interactions are a major concern for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir demonstrated a greater risk reduction in hospitalization and death than molnupiravir compared to placebo. Both drugs need to be started within 5 days of symptoms onset and given for 5 days' duration. This article reviews the 2 oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs including the mechanisms of action, antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, clinical experience including trials, adverse events, recommended indications, and formulary considerations.

### Impact of extended-course oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in established long COVID: a case series [^686a183d]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior case series suggest that a 5-day course of oral Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) benefits some people with Long COVID, within and/or outside of the context of an acute reinfection. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no prior case series of people with Long COVID who have attempted longer courses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Methods

We documented a case series of 13 individuals with Long COVID who initiated extended courses (> 5 days; range: 7.5–30 days) of oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside (n = 11) of and within (n = 2) the context of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants reported on symptoms and health experiences before, during, and after their use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Results

Among those who take an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside of the context of an acute infection, some experience a meaningful reduction in symptoms, although not all benefits persist. Others experience no effect on symptoms. One participant stopped early due to intense stomach pain. For the two participants who took an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within the context of an acute reinfection, both report eventually returning to their pre-re-infection baseline.

Conclusions

Extended courses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may have meaningful benefits for some people with Long COVID but not others. We encourage researchers to study how and why nirmatrelvir/ritonavir benefits some and what course length is most effective, with the goal of informing clinical recommendations for using nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and/or other antivirals as a potential treatment for Long COVID.

### Efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir (paxlovid) for COVID-19: a rapid review and meta-analysis [^38af8171]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, medRxiv, and Google Scholar were searched to identify the relevant evidence up to November 10, 2022. The reference lists of key studies were also scanned to find additional records. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Cochrane tools for assessing the risk of bias. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 3.0 was employed for data analysis. Twenty-three studies involving 314353 patients were included in the analysis. The findings of the meta-analysis showed a significant difference between the Paxlovid and no-Paxlovid groups in terms of mortality rate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14–0.45), hospitalization rate (OR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.24–0.69), polymerase chain reaction negative conversion time (mean difference [MD] = -2.46; 95% CI: -4.31 to -0.61), and hospitalization or death rate (OR = 0.17; 95% CI: 0.06–0.46). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of COVID-19 rebound (OR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.67–1.04), emergency department visit (OR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.45–1.24), intensive care unit admission (OR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.13–1.01), and adverse events (OR = 2.20; 95% CI: 0.42–11.47). The results of the present study support the efficacy and safety of Paxlovid in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to investigate the COVID-19 rebound after Paxlovid treatment.

### Prevalence of contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at risk for progression to severe disease [^5ca0c3a2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The availability of outpatient treatment options for COVID-19, such as nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and monoclonal antibodies, raises hopes for reducing COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality. Among these options, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid)may be preferred for most high-risk patients because of the convenience of oral dosing and its high efficacy vs placebo in reducing hospitalization or death, as reported in a phase 2/3 trial.

However, there are circumstances in which nirmatrelvir-ritonavir should not be used, due to the effect of ritonavir. Ritonavir may elevate the concentrations of drugs highly dependent on hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) metabolism, potentially resulting in serious reactions. Conversely, coadministration with potent CYP3A inducers can significantly reduce nirmatrelvir concentrations, potentially leading to the loss of virologic response. Furthermore, patients with severe kidney impairment and severe liver impairment were excluded from the clinical trials. These medical contraindications may be prevalent in patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to severe disease, as suggested by a recent study.

We examined the prevalence of contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We hypothesized that the rate would be high in these patients.

COVID-19 treatment in children with HIV — ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir use, dosing, interactions, and safety: Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir may be administered with other ARVs, including those that contain ritonavir or cobicistat, without any interruption or modification to the child's usual antiretroviral therapy (AIII). Children taking an ARV regimen that includes ritonavir or cobicistat should be monitored for increased side effects, but doses of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and/or other ARVs do not need to be adjusted. Patients with untreated or poorly controlled HIV could theoretically develop PI resistance while taking ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. Renal and hepatic function should be evaluated prior to initiating ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and doses should be adjusted if needed. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be started within 5 days of symptom onset (BII*) and administered orally twice daily for 5 days. Patients should be advised that a small proportion experience rebound 2 to 8 days after taking ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and the potential for viral rebound should not dissuade providers from offering it to patients at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 who could potentially benefit (AIII). Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir has potential for drug–drug interactions due to being both a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor and a CYP3A substrate; providers should consult the FDA Paxlovid Emergency Use Authorization Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, the Infectious Diseases Society of America resource, and/or the University of Liverpool COVID-19 Drug–Drug Interaction website for guidance. Other potential side effects include gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), altered taste, and increased blood pressure.

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization among patients with vulnerability to COVID-19 complications [^5d74240b]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Postmarket analysis of individuals who receive nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid [Pfizer]) is essential because they differ substantially from individuals included in published clinical trials.

Objective

To examine the association of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir with prevention of death or admission to hospital in individuals with different risks of complications from COVID-19 infection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a cohort study of adult patients in British Columbia, Canada, between February 1, 2022, and February 3, 2023. Patients were eligible if they belonged to 1 of 4 higher-risk groups of individuals who received priority for COVID-19 vaccination. Two groups included clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) people who were severely (CEV1) or moderately immunocompromised (CEV2). CEV3 individuals were not immunocompromised but had medical conditions associated with a high risk for complications from COVID-19. A fourth expanded eligibility (EXEL) group was added to allow wider access to nirmatrelvir and ritonavir for certain other higher-risk individuals who were not in a CEV group, such as those older than 70 years who were unvaccinated.

Exposures

Patients with COVID-19 who received nirmatrelvir and ritonavir were matched to patients in the same vulnerability group; who were of the same sex, age, and propensity score for nirmatrelvir and ritonavir treatment; and who were also infected within 1 month of the individual treated with nirmatrelvir and ritonavir.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was death from any cause or emergency hospitalization with COVID-19 within 28 days.

Results

There were 6866 individuals included in the study, of whom 3888 (56.6%) were female and whose median (IQR) age was 70 (57–80) years. Compared with unexposed controls, treatment with nirmatrelvir and ritonavir was associated with statistically significant relative reductions in the primary outcome in the CEV1 group (560 patients; risk difference [RD], -2.5%, 95% CI, -4.8% to -0.2%) and the CEV2 group (2628 patients; RD, -1.7%; 95% CI, -2.9% to -0.5%). In the CEV3 group, the RD was -1.3%, but the findings were not statistically significant (2100 patients; 95% CI, -2.8% to 0.1%). In the EXEL group, treatment was associated with higher risk of the outcome (RD, 1.0%), but the findings were not statistically significant (1578 patients; 95% CI, -0.9% to 2.9%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of 6866 individuals in British Columbia, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir treatment was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death in CEV individuals, with the greatest benefit observed in severely immunocompromised individuals. No reduction in the primary outcome was observed in lower-risk individuals, including those aged 70 years or older without serious comorbidities.

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (paxlovid) for mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy and lactation [^df878c3d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) is recommended to reduce the risk of hospitalization from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy. Data on use in pregnancy, including prescribing patterns and patient experience (adverse effects, incidence of rebound), are limited. We performed a cross-sectional study in which we surveyed a cohort of vaccinated pregnant or lactating individuals with breakthrough COVID-19. Of 35 pregnant respondents, 51.4% were prescribed and 34.3% took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir; of these, 91.7% experienced dysgeusia and 50.0% had rebound (50.0% positive test result, 33.3% return of symptoms). Three of five lactating respondents were prescribed and two took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. There were no significant adverse outcomes. Unknown risk was the most common reason for declining nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. More research is needed to establish the safety of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in pregnancy and lactation, to improve public health messaging, and to increase uptake of this treatment.

Abstract

Rebound of SARS-CoV-2 shedding or COVID-19 signs and symptoms has been described after treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). The direct association of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to COVID-19 rebound remains unclear because most reports are based on individual cases or nonrandomized studies. Viral RNA shedding data from two phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients [EPIC-HR] and Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard-Risk Patients [EPIC-SR]) were analyzed to investigate the role of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment in COVID-19 rebound. Rates of rebound of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding, identified based on an increase in nasopharyngeal viral RNA levels from day 5 (end-of-treatment) to day 10 or day 14, were similar between nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and placebo recipients. Among subjects with a virologic response through day 5, viral RNA rebound occurred in 6.4%–8.4% of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir recipients and 5.9%–6.5% of placebo recipients across EPIC-HR and the 2021/pre-Omicron and 2022/Omicron enrollment periods of EPIC-SR. Viral RNA rebound after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was not associated with COVID-19–related hospitalization or death. Data from randomized trials demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 rebound can occur with or without antiviral treatment, supporting the Food and Drug Administration's determination of safety and efficacy of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in eligible patients at high risk for severe COVID-19.

Treatment regimens

The indications, dosage, and administration frequency for Paxlovid were determined by a team of pediatricians and pharmacologists on a case-by-case basis, considering pediatric pharmacokinetic characteristics. It is important to note that our study focused on observation and data collection rather than active intervention. The recommended treatment regimen is as follows for children under 12 years old who weigh less 40 kg, the prescribed dosage is 7.5 mg/kg of Nirmatrelvir and 2.5 mg/kg of Ritonavir, administered twice daily for five days. For children aged 12 to 18 who weigh more than 40 kg, the dosage is 300/100 mg of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir orally twice daily. In the control group, 60 patients received routine treatment. Further details regarding the Paxlovid dosing protocol can be found in the supplementary materials (Appendix S5). To distinguish between drug side effects and symptoms of the disease itself, adverse events were defined specifically as new clinical manifestations that arose after the administration of Paxlovid, as outlined in the Paxlovid package insert. Additionally, a qualified pharmacologist ensured that any potential adverse reactions from concurrent medications were excluded from the analysis.

Data collection and definitions

Data were collected from patient medical records, including information on age, sex, weight, height, underlying conditions and laboratory parameters. Additional data included clinical symptoms at admission, recovery times for symptoms (excluding fever), adverse events during treatment and other relevant clinical details. Follow-up data were also gathered six months post-treatment, covering a range of symptoms and restoring academic activities. Serum concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Supplementary Appendix S2). Blood samples were collected during treatment, whenever feasible.

COVID-19 outpatient treatment for children with HIV — ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) should be considered for laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected mild to moderate COVID-19 in children with HIV who are aged ≥ 12 years, weigh ≥ 40 kg, and are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 due to advanced or untreated HIV or another high-risk condition as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be started within 5 days of symptom onset; it may be administered with antiretrovirals, including those that contain ritonavir or cobicistat, without any interruption of or modification to the antiretroviral therapy. Remdesivir (Veklury) may be considered in the outpatient setting for children with HIV who are aged ≥ 28 days, weigh ≥ 3 kg, and are at high risk as defined by CDC, and remdesivir should be started within 7 days of symptom onset, but its use could be considered in children with HIV with severe immunosuppression who have had > 7 days of symptoms. For non-hospitalized children with HIV aged ≥ 12 years at high risk, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is the preferred treatment, but remdesivir may be considered if ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is unavailable or contraindicated.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^af63d767]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

Pfizer's drug combination nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) aims to avoid severe COVID‐19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is a combination of the SARS‐CoV‐2 protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir, and ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV to enhance HIV protease inhibitors. Nirmatrelvir blocks the activity of the SARS‐CoV‐2‐3CL pro protease, an enzyme needed for viral replication. In humans, nirmatrelvir is metabolized by the P450 cytochrome enzyme CYP3A4. In order to remain active in the body for longer periods of time, nirmatrelvir is co‐administered with low‐dose ritonavir, to slow down the breakdown of nirmatrelvir (Pfizer 2021). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is to be administered orally within five days of symptom onset and taken twice daily for five days. Given the inactivation of CYP3A4 by ritonavir, a common enzyme in drug metabolism, ritonavir interferes with the metabolism of many drugs, can alter their plasma concentrations, and increase drug‐related adverse effects. The applicability of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may thus be limited in some populations at high risk of severe COVID‐19, such as those with comorbidities requiring medications metabolized using the CYP3A4 enzyme. As 3CL pro, the substrate‐binding site is highly conserved among all coronaviruses and shares no homology with human proteases, a SARS‐CoV‐2‐3CL pro antagonist will be highly specific to SARS‐CoV‐2 and less affected by virus mutations (Dai 2020) compared to antivirals binding to other sites, more prone to mutation.

### Impact of extended-course oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in established long COVID: a case series [^a0af1348]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

If clinical trials do indeed detect a signal, there should be a clear regulatory pathway to ensure that these drugs can be made accessible to patients, especially since there are currently no FDA-approved treatments specifically for Long COVID. This might entail consideration of options like expanded access, fast-track designation, and breakthrough therapy designation to both encourage industry participation and increase access of pharmaceutical treatments to Long COVID patients.

In conclusion, while the case series findings are heterogeneous, we describe the use of long courses of Paxlovid as a potentially promising pharmaceutical treatment to support at least some people with Long COVID. These cases provide strong rationale for the ongoing study of antivirals for Long COVID to determine if, when, and how they should be used in this patient population.

TABLE 1
Characteristics of Outpatient COVID-19–Positive Patients: Treated With Paxlovid Within 0–5 Days Versus Not Treated for (Outpatient) Paxlovid Within 0–5 Days

Patients who received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescription ≤ 5 days of COVID-19 diagnosis ("treated") comprised 1.9% (408 of 20 959) of the analytic cohort (Table 1). The remainder included those not receiving a nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescription ≤ 5 days of diagnosis ("untreated"; n = 20 551). Supplemental Figure 3 illustrates quarterly nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescription counts. Within the analytic cohort, 18.3% (3837 of 20 959) patients were identified as having a chronic or complex chronic disease; of these patients, only 5.0% (190 of 3837) received a nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescription ≤ 5 days of COVID-19 infection. The percentage of patients in the treated group who were obese (32.6%) was more than double that in the untreated group (15.1%). We also identified extremely limited use of several alternative COVID-19 therapeutics,: Monoclonal antibodies ≤ 7 days of index COVID-19 date(0.5% [∼119 of 20 959]); remdesivir ≤ 10 days of index date(0.1% [∼31 of 20 959]), and molnupiravir ≤ 5 days of index date(0.0% [below reporting threshold]). Virtually all receipt of these medications occurred among patients untreated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

### Effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus azvudine for adult inpatients with severe or critical COVID-19 [^66be304a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Paxlovid has been authorised for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset. In our research, the percentage of patients whose course was within 5 days since symptom onset was only 20.21%. Therefore, a subgroup analysis was conducted according to the time since symptom onset, and the cut-off value was 5 days. However, in both subgroups, no significant difference was found in the risk of all-cause mortality in the hospitals.

There were some limitations in this study. First, we did not include every factor as a covariate, which had a slight effect on the selection of two drugs and all-cause mortality. Second, as this was a retrospective study, we did not explore 28-day or 90-day mortality between the two groups, which may have led to serious bias. Moreover, we did not evaluate the viral load after the initiation of the antiviral therapy. Finally, safety data on these two drugs were limited. Therefore, the results of our main outcomes may have a risk of being underpowered.

### Pharmacokinetics of oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir, a protease inhibitor for treatment of COVID-19, in subjects with renal impairment [^654dc617]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir (PF‐07321332)/ritonavir) is a novel, orally administered inhibitor of the 3‐chymotrypsin‐like cysteine protease (M pro) of SARS‐CoV‐2. In addition to exhibiting a high level of conservation across human coronaviruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2, M pro performs the essential role of processing viral polyproteins into functional units, and inhibition is not likely to exhibit off‐target activity due to the absence of known human analogs; thus, it is an ideal target for viral inhibition. Preclinical studies found that nirmatrelvir, given alone, is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); nirmatrelvir is therefore administered in combination with ritonavir (Norvir; AbbVie Inc. Chicago, IL, USA), a CYP3A4 inhibitor, in clinical studies to maintain effective nirmatrelvir plasma concentrations. Nirmatrelvir in combination with ritonavir exhibited overwhelming efficacy in a recent phase II/III study (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID‐19 in High‐Risk Patients (EPIC‐HR); NCT04960202) in nonhospitalized adults with mild to moderate COVID‐19 who were at increased risk of progression to severe disease due to demographic or underlying clinical characteristics, including renal impairment. Among patients who initiated treatment within 3 days following symptom onset, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was 89% efficacious at preventing COVID‐19–related hospitalization and all‐cause death within 28 days. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was recently granted EUA in the United States for treatment of mild to moderate COVID‐19 in patients who are ≥ 12 years of age (weighing ≥ 40 kg) with confirmed COVID‐19 and at high risk for progression to severe COVID‐19.

Initial pharmacokinetic (PK) studies suggested that when CYP3A metabolism is inhibited by ritonavir, the main route of elimination of nirmatrelvir is by renal excretion. Chronic kidney disease is a key risk factor for severe COVID‐19 (refs.); because nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is intended for use in patients at high risk for severe disease, including those with renal impairment, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of renal impairment on PK parameters of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Findings from this study will influence dosing recommendations for individuals with renal impairment.

### Comparing molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir / ritonavir efficacy and the effects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in animal models [^5d0829fa]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Prophylactic dosing of contact ferrets with 20 mg/kg paxlovid did not prevent transmission from infected animals, recapitulating the outcome of the failed EPIC-PEP trial, trial. Interestingly, 20 mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was also the ferret dose that mediated a similar viral RNA copy number reduction to that seen in humans receiving paxlovid. Since also prophylactic molnupiravir did not prevent infection in the MOVe-AHEAD trial, an equally negative outcome of prophylactic 1.25 mg/kg molnupiravir was likely, prompting us not to commit additional animals for an experimental confirmation. However, 5 mg/kg prophylactic molnupiravir fully, and 100 mg/kg prophylactic nirmatrelvir/ritonavir partially, suppressed infection, indicating that higher dose levels, as long as compatible with safety margins, provide prophylactic efficacy in ferrets.

Trials with appropriately selected endpoints will be required to determine whether molnupiravir over-proportionally reduces infectious SARS-CoV-2 titers, compared to viral RNA copy numbers, also in the human upper respiratory tract. Due to differences in the dynamics of viral host invasion and replication in humans versus animals, extrapolation of therapeutic time windows from animal models to human patients is challenging. Despite the potential of host species-specific effects, this study affirms retrospective clinical analyses that early treatment of older adult patients at elevated risk of progression to severe COVID-19 with either paxlovid or molnupiravir will provide significant therapeutic benefit. We demonstrate in two animal model species, one rodent and one non-rodent, that infectious particle titers, but not viral RNA copy numbers, should be assessed to determine efficacy of a viral mutagen such as molnupiravir. Infectious viral load in the upper respiratory tract emerged as a correlate for SARS-CoV-2 transmission success in ferrets. Therapeutic molnupiravir, administered at a dose not associated with a significant reduction of viral RNA copy numbers, completely suppressed transmission in ferrets.

EPIC-HR (NCT04960202) was a Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in non-hospitalized symptomatic adult subjects with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eligible subjects were 18 years of age and older with at least 1 of the following risk factors for progression to severe disease: diabetes, overweight (BMI > 25), chronic lung disease (including asthma), chronic kidney disease, current smoker, immunosuppressive disease or immunosuppressive treatment, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, sickle cell disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, active cancer, medically-related technological dependence, or were 60 years of age and older regardless of comorbidities. Subjects with COVID-19 symptom onset of ≤ 5 days were included in the study. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg) or placebo orally every 12 hours for 5 days. The trial excluded individuals with a history of prior COVID-19 infection or vaccination and excluded individuals taking any medications with clinically significant drug interactions with PAXLOVID. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with COVID-19 related hospitalization or death from any cause through Day 28. The analysis was conducted in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set [all treated subjects with onset of symptoms ≤ 3 days who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment], the mITT1 analysis set (all treated subjects with onset of symptoms ≤ 5 days who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment), and the mITT2 analysis set (all treated subjects with onset of symptoms ≤ 5 days).

Ritonavir

Ritonavir was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 0, 15, 35, and 75 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (at 0, 25, 50, and 110 mg/kg/day) during organogenesis (on GD 6 through 17 in rats and GD 6 through 19 in rabbits). No evidence of teratogenicity due to ritonavir was observed in rats and rabbits at systemic exposures (AUC) 5 (rats) or 8 (rabbits) times higher than exposure at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. Increased incidences of early resorptions, ossification delays, and developmental variations, as well as decreased fetal body weights were observed in rats in the presence of maternal toxicity, at systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 10 times higher than exposure at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. In rabbits, resorptions, decreased litter size, and decreased fetal weights were observed at maternally toxic doses, at systemic exposures greater than 8 times higher than exposure at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. In a PPND study in rats, administration of 0, 15, 35, and 60 mg/kg/day ritonavir from GD 6 through PND 20 resulted in no developmental toxicity, at ritonavir systemic exposures greater than 10 times the exposure at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID.

### SARS-CoV-2 rebound with and without use of COVID-19 oral antivirals [^398c2a0f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Early treatment with a first-line therapy (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir [Paxlovid] or remdesivir) or second-line therapy (molnupiravir) prevents hospitalization and death among patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for severe disease and is recommended by the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines. On May 25, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treatment of adults at high risk for severe disease. Although antiviral therapies are widely available, they are underutilized, possibly because of reports of SARS-CoV-2 rebound after treatment. To enhance current understanding of rebound, CDC reviewed SARS-CoV-2 rebound studies published during February 1, 2020- November 29, 2023. Overall, seven of 23 studies that met inclusion criteria, one randomized trial and six observational studies, compared rebound for persons who received antiviral treatment with that for persons who did not receive antiviral treatment. In four studies, including the randomized trial, no statistically significant difference in rebound rates was identified among persons receiving treatment and those not receiving treatment. Depending on the definition used, the prevalence of rebound varied. No hospitalizations or deaths were reported among outpatients who experienced rebound, because COVID-19 signs and symptoms were mild. Persons receiving antiviral treatment might be at higher risk for rebound compared with persons not receiving treatment because of host factors or treatment-induced viral suppression early in the course of illness. The potential for rebound should not deter clinicians from prescribing lifesaving antiviral treatments when indicated to prevent morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

Certainty of the evidence

The certainty of evidence for prioritized outcomes presented in the summary of findings table ranged from low to moderate (Table 1).

We downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table due to risk of bias arising from use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis only including participants randomly assigned to study intervention who took ≥ 1 dose of study intervention and had ≥ 1 post‐baseline visits through day 28. Additionally, the outcomes 'treatment‐related adverse events during the study period' and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' were not prospectively registered. All‐cause mortality at 28 days and serious adverse events during the study period were further downgraded for serious imprecision due to low number of events. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' was additionally downgraded for serious indirectness as the study only assessed COVID‐19 related hospitalizations.

We did not consider downgrading for publication bias because the intervention is new and most of the studies are still ongoing.

We identified no study results reporting on improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance.

Introduction

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) * is a COVID-19 oral antiviral treatment consisting of nirmatrelvir, a SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro or 3C-like protease [3CL pro]) inhibitor, and ritonavir, a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Several reports have described patients who have experienced a rebound in SARS-CoV-2 detection or COVID-19 signs and symptoms after treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, or without antiviral treatment. Identifying the direct contribution of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to the rebound phenomenon has been challenging. Other than limited analyses from the pharmaceutical sponsor of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir based on the Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients (EPIC-HR) trial, conducted before SARS-CoV-2 Omicron emergence, reports of COVID-19 rebound are primarily based on individual cases and nonrandomized cohort studies. The lack of clarity and persistent concerns about COVID-19 rebound have reportedly contributed to reduced nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use. This analysis used data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate the frequency of rebound in SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding among outpatients with COVID-19 treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or placebo in two randomized, double-blind clinical trials.

Populationsimulation for dosing recommendations

It is presumed that maintaining trough concentration (C trough) values above the 90% effective concentration for SARS‐CoV‐2 would be necessary for therapeutic activity and hence matching C trough values in renal impairment groups to reference group served as a basis for dosing recommendation. Considering the observed PK data, simulations were done using the preliminary population PK model (see Appendix S1) by reducing total body clearance by one‐third and one‐half in mild and moderate renal impairment groups, respectively. Since nirmatrelvir tablets are currently available in 150‐mg strength, the dosing regimens simulated were either 300/100 mg or 150/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice daily for 5 days. Once‐daily regimens were also explored but were deemed unsuitable because ritonavir needs to be administered twice daily, which complicates dosing and potentially increases the chance of noncompliance. Figure 3 shows the Day 5 predicted C trough of nirmatrelvir with reduced clearance and with doses that provided a close approximation of C trough concentrations to that of the control group with no reduction in clearance. There was significant overlap in the individual predicted nirmatrelvir C trough values with clearance reduced by one‐third (mild renal impairment) and dosing with 300/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice daily, and with clearance reduced by one‐half (moderate renal impairment) and dosing with 150/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice daily. In both scenarios, the median C trough values were slightly higher than the reference group, and the vast majority (> 95%) of individual predicted C trough values were above the in vitro 90% effective concentration (292 ng/mL) for SARS‐CoV‐2. Slightly higher C trough values are not expected to compromise therapeutic activity of nirmatrelvir. In contrast, significantly higher predicted C trough values were noted in the severe renal impairment group for 150/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir dose per currently available formulations (data not shown).

Remarks include that patients' medications need to be screened for serious drug interactions and that dosing is based on renal function: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 60 ml/min: 300 mg nirmatrelvir/100 ritonavir every 12 hours for five days; eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min and ≥ 30 mL/min: 150 mg nirmatrelvir/100 mg ritonavir every 12 hours for five days; and eGFR < 30 mL/min: not recommended. Patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression to severe disease admitted to the hospital may also receive nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Options for treatment and management of ambulatory patients include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir for a 3-day course, molnupiravir, and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir and molnupiravir for COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b126105a]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) with molnupiravir in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To end this, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, medRxiv, and Google Scholar were systematically searched to collect relevant evidence up to February 15, 2023. The risk of bias was evaluated using the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions tool. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Eighteen studies involving 57659 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed a significant difference between nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir in terms of all-cause mortality rate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44–0.67), all-cause hospitalization rate (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.54–0.69), death or hospitalization rate (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38–0.99), and negative polymerase chain reaction conversion time (mean difference = -1.55, 95% CI: -1.74 to -1.37). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of COVID-19 rebound (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.71–1.07). In terms of safety, although the incidence of any adverse events was higher in the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group (OR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.57–4.06), no significant difference was observed between the two treatments in terms of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.69–2.00). The present meta-analysis demonstrated the significant superiority of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir over molnupiravir in improving clinical efficacy in COVID-19 patients during the prevalence of Omicron variant. These findings, however, need to be further confirmed.

### Innovative randomized phase I study and dosing regimen selection to accelerate and inform pivotal COVID-19 trial of nirmatrelvir [^4c75da18]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a continued leading cause of hospitalization and death. Safe, efficacious COVID-19 antivirals are needed urgently. Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), the first orally bioavailable, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) M pro inhibitor against the coronaviridae family, has demonstrated potent preclinical antiviral activity and benign safety profile. We report safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data of nirmatrelvir with and without ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, from an accelerated randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I study. Two interleaving single-ascending dose (SAD) cohorts were evaluated in a three-period crossover. Multiple-ascending dose (MAD) with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice daily (b.i.d.) dosing was evaluated over 10 days in five parallel cohorts. Safety was assessed, including in a supratherapeutic exposure cohort. Dose and dosing regimen for clinical efficacy evaluation in phase II/III clinical trials were supported by integrating modeling and simulations of SAD/MAD data with nonclinical data and a quantitative systems pharmacology model (QSP). In SAD, MAD, and supratherapeutic exposure cohorts, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was safe and well-tolerated. Nirmatrelvir exposure and half-life were considerably increased by ritonavir, enabling selection of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir dose and regimen for phase II/III trials (300/100 mg b.i.d.), to achieve concentrations continuously above those required for 90% inhibition of viral replication in vitro. The QSP model suggested that a 5-day regimen would significantly decrease viral load in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients which may prevent development of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. In conclusion, an innovative and seamless trial design expedited establishment of phase I safety and pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, enabling high confidence in phase II/III dose selection and accelerated pivotal trials' initiation (NCT04756531).

### Pharmacokinetics of oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir, a protease inhibitor for treatment of COVID-19, in subjects with renal impairment [^cb72c40d]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir coadministered with ritonavir is highly efficacious in reducing the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) adverse outcomes among patients at increased risk of progression to severe disease, including patients with chronic kidney disease. Because nirmatrelvir is eliminated by the kidneys when given with ritonavir, this phase I study evaluated the effects of renal impairment on pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Participants with normal renal function (n = 10) or mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (n = 8 each) were administered a single 100-mg nirmatrelvir dose with 100mg ritonavir given 12hours before, together with and 12 and 24hours after the nirmatrelvir dose. Systemic nirmatrelvir exposure increased with increasing renal impairment, with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment groups having respective adjusted geometric mean ratio areas under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time of 124%, 187%, and 304% vs. the normal renal function group. Corresponding ratios for maximum plasma concentration were 130%, 138%, and 148%. Apparent clearance was positively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate, and geometric mean renal clearance values were particularly lower for the moderate (47% decrease) and severe (80% decrease) renal impairment groups vs. the normal renal function group. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir exhibited an acceptable safety profile; treatment-related adverse events were mild in severity, and there were no significant findings regarding laboratory measurements, vital signs, or electrocardiogram assessments. These findings led to a dose reduction recommendation for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients with moderate renal impairment (150/100mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir instead of 300/100mg twice daily for 5days).

Viral RNA Rebound and Treatment-Emergent Substitutions

EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR were not designed to evaluate COVID-19 rebound; exploratory analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between PAXLOVID use and rebound in viral RNA shedding levels.

Post-treatment increases in SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding levels in nasopharyngeal samples were observed on Day 10 and/or Day 14 in a subset of PAXLOVID and placebo recipients in EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR, irrespective of COVID-19 symptoms. The frequency of detection of post-treatment viral RNA rebound varied according to analysis parameters, but was generally similar among PAXLOVID and placebo recipients. A similar or smaller percentage of placebo recipients compared to PAXLOVID recipients had nasopharyngeal viral RNA results < lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) at all study timepoints in both the treatment and post-treatment periods.

In EPIC-HR, of 59 PAXLOVID-treated subjects identified with post-treatment viral RNA rebound and with available viral sequence data, treatment-emergent substitutions in Mpropotentially reducing nirmatrelvir activity were detected in 2 (3%) subjects, including E166V in 1 subject and T304I in 1 subject. Both subjects had viral RNA shedding levels < LLOQ by Day 14.

Post-treatment viral RNA rebound was not associated with the primary clinical outcome of COVID-19 related hospitalization or death from any cause through Day 28 following the single 5-day course of PAXLOVID treatment. The clinical relevance of post-treatment increases in viral RNA following PAXLOVID or placebo treatment is unknown.

Cross-resistance is not expected between nirmatrelvir and remdesivir or any other anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents with different mechanisms of action (i.e., agents that are not Mproinhibitors).

Nirmatrelvir

Embryo-fetal developmental (EFD) toxicity studies were conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits administered oral nirmatrelvir doses of up to 1,000 mg/kg/day during organogenesis [on Gestation Days (GD) 6 through 17 in rats and GD 7 through 19 in rabbits]. No biologically significant developmental effects were observed in the rat EFD study. At the highest dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day, the systemic nirmatrelvir exposure (AUC24) in rats was approximately 9 times higher than clinical exposures at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. In the rabbit EFD study, lower fetal body weights (9% decrease) were observed at 1,000 mg/kg/day in the absence of significant maternal toxicity findings. At 1,000 mg/kg/day, the systemic exposure (AUC24) in rabbits was approximately 11 times higher than clinical exposures at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. No other significant developmental toxicities (malformations and embryo-fetal lethality) were observed up to the highest dose tested, 1,000 mg/kg/day. No developmental effects were observed in rabbits at 300 mg/kg/day resulting in systemic exposure (AUC24) approximately 3 times higher than clinical exposures at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. A pre- and postnatal developmental (PPND) study in pregnant rats administered oral nirmatrelvir doses of up to 1,000 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through Lactation Day (LD) 20 showed no adverse findings. Although no difference in body weight was noted at birth when comparing offspring born to nirmatrelvir-treated versus control animals, a decrease in the body weight of offspring was observed on Postnatal Day (PND) 17 (8% decrease) and PND 21 (up to 7% decrease) in the absence of maternal toxicity. No significant differences in offspring body weight were observed from PND 28 to PND 56. The maternal systemic exposure (AUC24) at 1,000 mg/kg/day was approximately 9 times higher than clinical exposures at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. No body weight changes in the offspring were noted at 300 mg/kg/day, where maternal systemic exposure (AUC24) was approximately 6 times higher than clinical exposures at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID.

In December 2021/January 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, was authorized in the United States, Canada, and Europe. However, ritonavir has significant drug-drug interaction potential, and information resources were incomplete or provided conflicting advice for certain DDIs. Within the challenging pandemic setting, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was being prescribed largely by clinicians unfamiliar with ritonavir. COVID-19 affects people with comorbidities and polypharmacy who could benefit from therapy, but prescriber uncertainty surrounding the appropriate management of DDIs was a barrier to the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. To support clinicians, the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Guidelines Panel, the Ontario Science Table, and the University of Liverpool independently developed prescribing guidelines. Ultimately, the groups united to establish the LiON-PK (Liverpool-Ontario-NIH Pharmacokinetics) collaboration. Here we describe how the team developed pragmatic and harmonized guidance for managing DDIs with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. This framework may inform development of prescribing resources for other complex medications, or for future pandemic preparedness.

One notable therapeutic challenge is in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2)). In people with CF, viral respiratory tract infections can lead to acute pulmonary exacerbations with a negative impact on lung function.COVID‐19 infection triggers a cytokine storm which can lead to the life‐threatening respiratory distress syndrome, potentially putting the population with CF infected with COVID‐19 at high risk of serious illness. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently issued an emergency use authorization for the use of the nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir (Paxlovid) for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID‐19. Nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir treatment significantly reduces hospital admissions and deaths among people with COVID‐19 who are at high risk of severe illness. Nirmatrelvir is coadministered with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, to boost nirmatrelvir concentrations to achieve therapeutic levels. However, due to the potent inhibition effect of ritonavir, it may increase plasma concentrations of drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Therefore, coadministration of nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir is contraindicated with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life‐threatening reactions. Since all three components of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor are eliminated mainly through CYP3A, nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir is expected to exhibit a significant drug interaction with elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor. Thus, the use of nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir in people with CF would require an adjusted dosing regimen of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor to prevent increased plasma concentrations and potential adverse drug reactions. However, there are currently no clinical data available regarding the interactions of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor with nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir, and no specific dosing guidelines have been established. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the proper guidance regarding the use of nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir for people with CF to prevent progression of COVID‐19 to severe disease.

### Association of treatment with nirmatrelvir and the risk of post-COVID-19 condition [^0edf3289]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Post–COVID-19 condition (PCC), also known as long COVID, is the disease encompassing the post–acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it affects millions of people around the world. Despite PCC affecting a substantial portion of the patient population, there is no approved medication for the prevention or treatment of PCC. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the underlying mechanisms of PCC including persistence of the virus (or its fragments) or intensity of the inflammation during the acute phase of the disease. The antiviral nirmatrelvir (in combination with ritonavir, marketed under the name Paxlovid) that has been shown to reduce the risk of progression to severe acute COVID-19 has been suggested as a candidate drug that may reduce the risk of developing PCC. In December 2021, oral nirmatrelvir was approved in the US for the treatment of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (typically within 5 days of symptom onset) in nonhospitalized people at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 illness. Millions of people in the US have since received treatment with nirmatrelvir. Urgent calls have been made to evaluate whether treatment with nirmatrelvir in the acute phase of COVID-19 reduces the risk of PCC — but data have thus far been lacking. Addressing this question will guide treatment approaches of SARS-CoV-2 infections and will inform the effort to develop and optimize prevention and treatment strategies for PCC.

### Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling-guided dose management of oral anticoagulants when initiating nirmatrelvir / ritonavir (paxlovid) for COVID-19 treatment [^3832fd00]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with cardiovascular diseases who are at higher risk of progressing to critical illness should be treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). Ritonavir, the booster in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, modulates multiple drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, complicating its use in real-world clinics. We aimed to apply physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to simulate the complex drug-drug interactions (DDIs) of ritonavir with two anticoagulants, rivaroxaban and racemic warfarin, to address this important clinical conundrum. Simulations were implemented within Simcyp Simulator. Compound and population models were adopted from Simcyp and our previous studies. Upon verification and validation of the PBPK model of ritonavir, prospective DDI simulations with the anticoagulants were performed in both the general population (20-65years) and geriatric subjects (65-85years) with or without moderate renal impairment. Elevated rivaroxaban concentrations were simulated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment, where the impact was more profound among geriatric subjects with renal impairment. The overexposure of rivaroxaban was restored to normal range on day 4 post-discontinuation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, corroborating with the recovery of enzyme activity. A lower 10mg daily dose of rivaroxaban could effectively maintain acceptable systemic exposure of rivaroxaban during nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment. Treatment of ritonavir marginally declined simulated S-warfarin concentrations, but substantially elevated that of R-warfarin, resulting in a decrease in the international normalized ratio (INR). As INR only recovered 2weeks post-nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment, a longer surveillance INR for warfarin becomes important. Our PBPK-guided simulations evaluated clinically important yet untested DDIs and supports clinical studies to ensure proper anticoagulation management of patients with COVID-19 with chronic coagulative abnormalities when initiating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir therapy.

### Nirmatrelvir for vaccinated or unvaccinated adult outpatients with COVID-19 [^5fa32601]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Nirmatrelvir in combination with ritonavir is an antiviral treatment for mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The efficacy of this treatment in patients who are at standard risk for severe Covid-19 or who are fully vaccinated and have at least one risk factor for severe Covid-19 has not been established.

Methods

In this phase 2–3 trial, we randomly assigned adults who had confirmed Covid-19 with symptom onset within the past 5 days in a 1:1 ratio to receive nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or placebo every 12 hours for 5 days. Patients who were fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and who had at least one risk factor for severe disease, as well as patients without such risk factors who had never been vaccinated against Covid-19 or had not been vaccinated within the previous year, were eligible for participation. Participants logged the presence and severity of prespecified Covid-19 signs and symptoms daily from day 1 through day 28. The primary end point was the time to sustained alleviation of all targeted Covid-19 signs and symptoms. Covid-19-related hospitalization and death from any cause were also assessed through day 28.

Results

Among the 1296 participants who underwent randomization and were included in the full analysis population, 1288 received at least one dose of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (654 participants) or placebo (634 participants) and had at least one postbaseline visit. The median time to sustained alleviation of all targeted signs and symptoms of Covid-19 was 12 days in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and 13 days in the placebo group (P = 0.60). Five participants (0.8%) in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and 10 (1.6%) in the placebo group were hospitalized for Covid-19 or died from any cause (difference, -0.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -2.0 to 0.4). The percentages of participants with adverse events were similar in the two groups (25.8% with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 24.1% with placebo). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group, the most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were dysgeusia (in 5.8% of the participants) and diarrhea (in 2.1%).

Conclusions

The time to sustained alleviation of all signs and symptoms of Covid-19 did not differ significantly between participants who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and those who received placebo. (Supported by Pfizer; EPIC-SR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05011513.).

Table 1
Single dose pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in Roborovski dwarf hamster and human plasma

a Human doses are expressed as absolute amount, not mg/kg.

Matching the design of our previous molnupiravir dwarf hamster efficacy studies, we initiated oral treatment with paxlovid 12 h after intranasal infection of the dwarf hamsters with 1 × 10 4 pfu of VOC delta or omicron (lineage B.1.1.529), and continued treatment in a twice-daily (b.i.d.) regimen (Fig. 2b). In the VOC omicron infection group, we included molnupiravir, dosed at 250 mg/kg b.i.d. and low-dose paxlovid (125 mg/kg nirmatrelvir and 83.3 mg/kg ritonavir) arms for comparison of effect size and/or dose-dependency of potency. The 12-h time-to-treatment-onset was chosen due to rapid disease progression in the dwarf hamster model, which mimics human patients at transition stage to complicated COVID-19. As we have reported for molnupiravir treatment after VOC delta infection, all treated dwarf hamsters met the primary efficacy endpoint and survived infection independent of VOC used, meeting the primary efficacy endpoint (Fig. 2c, d). By contrast, 83% and 50% of vehicle-treated animals had succumbed to the disease 6 days after infection with VOC delta and omicron, respectively. Drug-treated animals displayed minimal, if any, clinical signs, whereas dwarf hamsters in vehicle groups experienced hypothermia and body weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We reported details of the intervention and population at baseline for the included studies in the footnotes of the forest plot.

The current review version included one study for inpatients and one study for outpatients, therefore investigation of heterogeneity between studies was not applicable. For future updates, we plan to investigate heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plot.

If statistical heterogeneity is present, we plan to investigate heterogeneity by subgroup analysis to calculate RR or MD in conjunction with the corresponding CIs for each subgroup, if sufficient studies are available.

The following characteristics will be used for subgroup analyses to explore statistical heterogeneity, if reported.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir used as treatment (in‐ and outpatients): studies including participants with different severities of condition at baseline (symptomatic versus asymptomatic); studies including participants with a history of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection/vaccination versus participants with no history of infection/vaccination; studies with different recruitment periods examining different dominant virus variants circulating at the time of the study (e.g. Alpha versus Beta versus Gamma versus Delta versus Omicron, etc.); studies that started nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment early (five days or fewer) versus late (more than five days after symptom onset); studies investigating different doses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (low versus recommended versus high). If necessary in future review updates, we will consider and categorize dosing schemes into recommended (nirmatrelvir 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg, twice‐daily for five days), low (less than recommended dose), and high doses (greater than recommended dose). We planned to analyze different doses in subgroup analysis, if sufficient studies are available. The one study considering treatment in the current review did not investigate different doses.
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir used for prevention: studies including participants with a history of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection/vaccination versus participants with no history of infection/vaccination; studies investigating different modes of exposure (e.g. working place, nursing home) and burden of exposure (e.g. living in a high‐risk area, high‐risk medical contact) in prevention studies; studies with different recruitment periods examining different dominant virus variants circulating at the time of the study (e.g. Alpha versus Beta versus Gamma versus Delta versus Omicron, etc.); studies investigating different doses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (low versus recommended versus high).

EU European Union, ROW rest of world, UK United Kingdom, US United States.

Real-time packaged product stability was on the critical path to support the maximum duration of shelf life at launch. Supportive bulk stability and modeling tools were important to supplement the limited real-time data available. Packaging configurations that could be quickly scaled but also maximized ease of administration and patient compliance-focused technical solutions to a few options.

Paxlovid was launched in a patient pack configuration containing 5 blister cards per carton. With a 5-day dosing duration, each treatment course contained 30 tablets within the patient pack. Because each blister card was configured with morning and evening doses, each with 2 nirmatrelvir 150-mg tablets and 1 ritonavir 100-mg tablet, each dose needed to be convenient and unambiguous. The limited time to have commercial-ready packaging also dictated the use of foil/foil blisters, which provide the most protective barrier material configuration. This meant that the primary pack would be opaque; it was therefore critical to ensure each cavity contained the correct tablet before lidding. The packaging equipment included a high-resolution camera inspection system, which utilizes an AI-driven algorithm to distinguish between the ritonavir and nirmatrelvir tablets and therefore, confirm that all tablets are in the correct position during high-speed packaging operations.

Before the US EUA for Paxlovid on December 22, 2021, the first shipments were delivered for immediate availability upon this authorization. This would be repeated across the globe as other countries granted EUAs. In mid-November 2021, within weeks after announcing positive interim results in the pivotal EPIC-HR study, Pfizer and the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), a United Nations-backed public health organization working to increase access to life-saving medicines for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), announced a licensing agreement. This agreement enabled the MPP to grant sublicenses to other companies for the manufacture and sale of their generic nirmatrelvir equivalent with technical support from Pfizer. Combined with ritonavir, this generic equivalent can be supplied to 95 LMICs comprising ~53% of the world's population.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Nirmatrelvir

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with nirmatrelvir.

Nirmatrelvir was negative for mutagenic or clastogenic activity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium and E. coli, the in vitro micronucleus assay using human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells, and the in vivo rat micronucleus assays.

In a fertility and early embryonic development study, nirmatrelvir was administered orally to male and female rats at doses of 60, 200, or 1,000 mg/kg/day once daily beginning 14 days prior to mating, throughout the mating phase, and continued through GD 6 for females and for a total of 32 doses for males. There were no effects on fertility, reproductive performance, or early embryonic development at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day, resulting in systemic exposure (AUC24) approximately 5 times higher than exposure at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID.

Ritonavir

Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been conducted on ritonavir. In male mice, at levels of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day, there was a dose dependent increase in the incidence of both adenomas and combined adenomas and carcinomas in the liver. Based on AUC measurements, the exposure at the high dose was approximately 25 times higher than the exposure in humans at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. No carcinogenic effects were observed in females at up to the highest dose tested, resulting in systemic exposure (AUC24) approximately 25 times higher than the exposure in humans at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. In rats dosed at levels of 7, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day, there were no carcinogenic effects. In this study, the exposure at the high dose was approximately 5 times higher than the exposure in humans at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID.

Ritonavir was found to be negative for mutagenic or clastogenic activity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium and E. coli, the mouse lymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes.

Ritonavir produced no effects on fertility in rats at drug exposures approximately 18 (male) and 27 (female) times higher than the exposure in humans at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID.

Certainty of the evidence

The certainty of evidence for prioritized outcomes presented in the summary of findings tables ranged from low to moderate for outpatients (Table 1), and was very low for inpatients (Table 2).

For outpatients, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table due to risk of bias arising from use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis only including participants randomly assigned to study intervention who received one or greater more doses of study intervention and had one or more postbaseline visits by day 28. Additionally, the outcomes 'treatment‐related adverse events during the study period; and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' were not prospectively registered. All‐cause mortality at 28 days and SAEs during the study period were further downgraded for serious imprecision due to low number of events. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' was additionally downgraded for serious indirectness as the study only assessed COVID‐19‐related hospitalizations.

For inpatients, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table for indirectness due to an atypical hospital population of mildly to moderately affected patients and twice for imprecision using the minimally contextualized approach.

We did not consider downgrading for publication bias because the intervention is new and most of the studies are still ongoing.

We identified no study results reporting on improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance.

### A novel PLpro inhibitor improves outcomes in a pre-clinical model of long COVID [^6f7d134a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We previously developed mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection to reproduce a spectrum of acute COVID-19 outcomes. Animals infected with our SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate (P2 strain), which naturally infects WT mice due to a N501Y spike mutation, develop mild disease. Serial passaging of the P2 strain in WT mice produced a mouse-adapted virus (P21) that induces a robust inflammatory immune response in the host, resulting in severe disease (Supplementary Fig. 7a). We utilised these models to perform a pre-clinical assessment of WEHI-P8 in improving acute disease outcomes in both mild and severe disease. To define an appropriate in vivo dosing regimen, we conducted pilot experiments using our mild disease model (SARS-CoV-2 P2 strain), treating at -2 h pre-, 6 h, and 24 h post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Nirmatrelvir (150 mg/kg) and ritonavir (19 mg/kg) alone showed no antiviral activity in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 7c), which we attributed to the absence of co-dosing, a requirement for efficacy in humans. Consequently, we calculated the mouse-equivalent dose of Paxlovid prescribed for COVID-19 patients, based on a human body weight of 65 kg (300 mg nirmatrelvir, 100 mg ritonavir) and a literature-derived conversion factor of 12.3. The resulting PLT dose for mice was 57 mg/kg nirmatrelvir and 19 mg/kg ritonavir, which we used throughout this study as a control. This PLT regimen demonstrated antiviral efficacy in inhibiting P2 virus replication, comparable to that observed with WEHI-P8 administered at 150 mg/kg using the same dosing schedule (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Furthermore, our data suggest that the antiviral activity of WEHI-P8 is independent of ritonavir and cannot be further enhanced by concurrent ritonavir co-treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Notably, initiating treatment after infection with our clinical isolate P2 (6 h, 24 h, and 48 h) did not change the antiviral efficacy of PLT and WEHI-P8 (Supplementary Fig. 7d).

Ritonavir Interactions With ASMs

Another potential clinically relevant interaction exists between lamotrigine (LTG) and ritonavir (r), an element of the WHO recommendation for PEP. Ritonavir (r) can reduce lamotrigine (LTG) concentration by 50% within days, therefore lamotrigine dosing may need to be modified during short-term PEP treatment containing ritonavir (r). Irrespective of potential lamotrigine adjustments or decreases during PEP, the removal of ritonavir (r) may contribute to a rise in serum lamotrigine concentration. This may be associated with both transient increased adverse effects of lamotrigine, similar to those during the placebo week of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, as well as increased risk of Steven's Johnson Syndrome (SJS). Data from withdrawal of lamotrigine during long-term inpatient monitoring suggest the risk of SJS is low if lamotrigine dosing was lower for less than 7 days, but the duration of ritonavir (r) in PEP typically lasts 4 weeks. Therefore, during this period of PEP and afterward, the dosing of lamotrigine may need to be increased and additional counseling provided regarding monitoring for SJS. In addition to lamotrigine, the European Medicines agency recently issues a warning regarding the interaction with everolimus and ritonavir, which also is an element of treatment for Covid-19 in combination with nirmatrelvir in Paxlovid.

Other ASMs and Other ARTs Without Known Interactions

In addition to highlighting the presence of known or theoretical interaction between certain ASMs and many of the ARTs used in PrEP/PEP, we emphasize that there are several ASMs without known or limited interactions. When possible, patients with anticipated need for PrEP/PEP should aim to achieve seizure and side effect freedom with these noninteracting ASMs. However, one third of patients with epilepsy have medication-resistant epilepsy, defined by failure by 2 or more appropriately prescribed and tolerated ASMs, therefore this may not be possible. Additionally, while levetiracetam (LEV) was recently added to the WHO essential medications list, these modern ASMs often are not widely available globally due to cost, regulatory approval, and supply chain challenges. Analogously, modern ARTs typically have fewer drug–drug interactions; therefore, they may emerge as preferred elements of PrEP and PEP regimens in people taking ASMs.

Challenge 4: establishing a Paxlovid commercial supply chain

Rapidly scaling the manufacturing process to deliver millions of high-quality Paxlovid doses relied on the experience and capability within the network of manufacturing sites and key strategic partners. As the commercial manufacturing process and anticipated demand became clear, unprecedented agility and coordination among manufacturing site operations and supply chain professionals were needed to replan existing production across the network and to support Paxlovid supplies. Critical to these efforts were colleagues at those facilities and testing sites and across all supportive manufacturing functions, coupled with close collaboration with the research and development team.

Early in development, with lead times exceeding 7 months, scale-up within the existing manufacturing facility network was recognized as only part of the solution to supplying Paxlovid. Another critical consideration was production scale-out to multiple existing external suppliers and forging new supply relationships, which included all supply chain elements. With 25 supply nodes, including internal and partner sites across 10 countries, Paxlovid supply relies on a complex, global supply chain (Fig. 4). A component within this supply chain is ritonavir, which needs to be co-administered with each nirmatrelvir dose. Although ritonavir is widely available from multiple suppliers, any appearance, size, shape, and physical and chemical specification variations limited the number of viable sources. Capacity and availability of sufficient quantities were challenging. Uncertainty in the initial forecasted volumes of finished, packed Paxlovid and varied regulatory status of each ritonavir source added to the complexity. With potential volumes of > 100 million finished Paxlovid packs required by the end of 2022, a substantial increase in ritonavir supply was needed to avoid disrupting its existing global availability. As with all key materials sourced externally, incremental ritonavir production by suppliers was funded at risk to ensure sufficient stock availability for final packing operations.

### A mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 immunity predicts paxlovid rebound [^f4c1f313]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), an oral antiviral medication targeting SARS-CoV-2, remains an important treatment for COVID-19. Initial studies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were performed in SARS-CoV-2 unvaccinated patients without prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, most individuals have now either been vaccinated and/or have experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. After nirmatrelvir/ritonavir became widely available, reports surfaced of "Paxlovid rebound", a phenomenon in which symptoms (and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity) would initially resolve, but after finishing treatment, symptoms and test positivity would return. We used a previously described parsimonious mathematical model of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection to model the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment in unvaccinated and vaccinated patients. Model simulations show that viral rebound after treatment occurs only in vaccinated patients, while unvaccinated (SARS-COV-2 naïve) patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir do not experience any rebound in viral load. This work suggests that an approach combining parsimonious models of the immune system could be used to gain important insights in the context of emerging pathogens.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^24ccf294]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Timing of outcome measurement

We collected information on outcomes from all time points reported in the publications and study reports. If only a few studies contributed data to an outcome, we planned to pool different time points, provided the studies produced valid data and pooling was clinically reasonable. The current review version included one study.

In case of time‐to‐event analysis, e.g. for time to death, we planned to use the longest follow‐up time measured from randomization.

We have reported time points of outcome measurement in the footnotes of the forest plots. We included SAEs and AEs occurring during the study period, includingAEs during active treatment and long‐term AEs. If sufficient data had been available, we planned to group the measurement time points of eligible outcomes into those measured directly after treatment (up to seven days), medium‐term outcomes (up to 14 days), and longer‐term outcomes (28 days or more).

Secondary outcomes

This review specifies no secondary outcomes. All outcomes were treated as a primary outcome set which informed the summary of findings tables.

### Comparing molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir / ritonavir efficacy and the effects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in animal models [^dee0f4af]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2 are underutilized. Two oral drugs, molnupiravir and paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir), have received emergency use authorization. Initial trials suggested greater efficacy of paxlovid, but recent studies indicated comparable potency in older adults. Here, we compare both drugs in two animal models; the Roborovski dwarf hamster model for severe COVID-19-like lung infection and the ferret SARS-CoV-2 transmission model. Dwarf hamsters treated with either drug survive VOC omicron infection with equivalent lung titer reduction. Viral RNA copies in the upper respiratory tract of female ferrets receiving 1.25mg/kg molnupiravir twice-daily are not significantly reduced, but infectious titers are lowered by > 2log orders and direct-contact transmission is stopped. Female ferrets dosed with 20 or 100mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice-daily show 1-2log order reduction of viral RNA copies and infectious titers, which correlates with low nirmatrelvir exposure in nasal turbinates. Virus replication resurges towards nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment end and virus transmits efficiently (20mg/kg group) or partially (100mg/kg group). Prophylactic treatment with 20mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir does not prevent spread from infected ferrets, but prophylactic 5mg/kg molnupiravir or 100mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir block productive transmission. These data confirm reports of similar efficacy in older adults and inform on possible epidemiologic benefit of antiviral treatment.

### Paxlovid for the treatment of severe or critical COVID-19 in children [^c3a641bc]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic brought over 774 million infections and 7 million fatalities worldwide. Up to now, there are still 200–300 thousand additional cases and several hundred deaths per week across the globe. Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) has been proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults. However, clinical data on its use in children remain limited. While Phase II/III trials for pediatric patients (NCT05261139) are ongoing, no published results are yet available. Only a few case reports and small case series have assessed Paxlovid in children, with one retrospective study evaluating its safety and efficacy in 31 pediatric ICU patients, including 9 who received Paxlovid. Due to the lack of robust evidence, current guidelines recommend the use of Paxlovid in children on a case-by-case basis. This uncertainty can present challenges for clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Although Paxlovid has been recommended for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults, specifically when administered within 5 days of symptom onset, its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in severe or critical cases. While COVID-19 in children is generally less severe than in adults, children with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk for complications such as hospitalization, intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and even death. A global study involving 1,500 children with cancer found that 20% experienced severe or critical COVID-19, with a mortality rate of 3%. Given that an estimated 400,000 children and adolescents aged 0–19 are diagnosed with cancer annually, this suggests that approximately 12,000 children could potentially die from COVID-19. Therefore, providing Paxlovid to children, especially those with compromised immune systems due to underlying conditions, may help prevent the progression of COVID-19 to severe stages and reduce mortality rates.

To further assess the safety and effectiveness of Paxlovid in pediatric populations, we conducted a prospective observational study. This study included children and adolescents treated with Paxlovid, with cases stratified by severity, and followed up over a 6-month period.

### Influenza in pregnancy: prevention and treatment aug 2025 update [^07c116f3]. ACOG (2025). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy — Paxlovid use and influenza co-infection: If a pregnant patient tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, obstetric care professionals should discuss and offer Paxlovid to mitigate the severity of infection, as well as to lower the risk of long COVID. The dosage for Paxlovid in patients with normal renal function is 300 mg of nirmatrelvir (two 150-mg tablets) with 100 mg of ritonavir (one 100-mg tablet), with all three tablets taken together twice daily for 5 days, and for moderate renal impairment the nirmatrelvir component is lowered by half, to one 150-mg tablet twice daily. Obstetrician–gynecologists should ensure that the patient has no contraindications and should review any possible drug–drug interactions and how to handle them before prescribing Paxlovid. If there is suspected or confirmed co-infection with influenza and SARS-CoV-2, both oseltamivir and Paxlovid should be prescribed and can be taken together. There are no clinically significant drug–drug interactions between the antiviral agents or immunomodulators that are used to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 and the antiviral agents that are used to treat influenza. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care professionals should refer to ACOG recommendations frequently for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 treatment recommendation updates.

### The unprecedented paxlovid journey from milligrams to millions of patient doses during the COVID-19 pandemic [^0c7d4f5c]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection led to a global pandemic, resulting in > 770 million cases and 7.1 million deaths to date. Fast-paced vaccine development led to the successful launches of the Covid-19 vaccines reducing the impact of the pandemic. Antiviral treatments have played a key role in improving outcomes in individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19. Medicinal chemistry approaches used for discovery of the oral antiviral, nirmatrelvir, including artificial intelligence (AI) and structure-based drug design, were critical to development of Paxlovid TM (Pfizer Inc, New York, NY). An earlier effort in response to the 2002 SARS outbreak led to the identification of Lufotrelvir (prodrug of the active component PF-00835231) as a potent inhibitor of recombinant SARS-CoV-1 main protease (M pro), which provided promising starting point for the discovery of Nirmatrelvir, a SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitor with enhanced bioavailability suitable for oral delivery. Nirmatrelvir is a peptide-based covalent-reversible inhibitor. When co-administered with ritonavir, it is an oral antiviral COVID-19 treatment, Paxlovid. In the EPIC-HR phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial (NCT04960202), Paxlovid reduced hospitalization or death by 89% and 88% among unvaccinated nonhospitalized individuals at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19 when treated within 3 and 5 days of symptom onset, respectively. Based on a review of medical records of 44,551 nonhospitalized ≥ 50-years-old individuals with COVID-19 in the United States during the Omicron wave, Paxlovid treatment reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 44% compared with those not receiving treatment.

### Evolving COVID-19 landscape: assessing the effectiveness and safety profile of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in adolescents [^cce7b1a2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

This study evaluates nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) in preventing severe coronavirus disease 2019 in adolescents (12–18). Conducted from January 2022 to July 2023, it compared hospital admissions and healthcare visits within 30 days post-treatment. Results showed similar follow-up rates between treated and untreated groups, with slightly more adverse effects in the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group. Further research is needed to confirm its efficacy in this population.

### Virologic response and safety of ibuzatrelvir, A novel SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, in adults with COVID-19 [^415448fe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaccination, naturally acquired immunity, antiviral therapies such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV/r; Paxlovid; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY), and improved understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) management have led to better outcomes for patients with COVID-19 compared with early during the pandemic. However, new variants evade immune response, allowing COVID-19 to continue causing high mortality and straining global healthcare systems. This burden persists partly because antiviral therapies for patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 are underused; one reason for this is potential risk of drug–drug interactions with NMV/r. New, efficacious antiviral therapies with safety profiles appropriate for a broader population are needed.

Ibuzatrelvir (PF-07817883) is a second-generation, orally bioavailable, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) M pro inhibitor that has demonstrated potent, pan-human coronavirus antiviral activity. Ibuzatrelvir achieves expected therapeutic systemic concentrations (> 90% of the population achieving free minimum observed plasma concentration [C min] ≥ 90% maximal effective concentration [EC 90]) without the need for a co-administered agent (eg, ritonavir) to increase drug exposures. Because ritonavir is a potent cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor, administration of ibuzatrelvir alone (without ritonavir), as well as low potential of ibuzatrelvir to affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of other drugs, may simplify clinical management. Our aim in this study was to evaluate virologic response and safety of different ibuzatrelvir doses among nonhospitalized adults with confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^a4a3b64c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

There are several therapeutic options for people with COVID‐19. Choice of therapy depends on severity of illness; drug availability; route of administration; time of onset of symptoms to starting treatment; co‐administered medication; and patient‐specific factors such as age, pregnancy, or current lactation. In people who are at the highest risk of hospitalization or progression to severe illness, including consideration in women who are pregnant or lactating, the WHO Living Guideline for Therapeutics and COVID‐19 includes a strong recommendation for use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, in addition to symptomatic management (WHO 2023b). Alternative therapeutics for people in this group include remdesivir, which requires intravenous administration, and in some countries, the oral antiviral molnupiravir. Molnupiravir has a conditional recommendation for use by the WHO in people with non‐severe COVID‐19 at highest risk of hospitalization, excluding pregnant or breastfeeding women, and children. It is noted at the current time that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended the refusal of the marketing authorization of molnupiravir; however, this drug is available outside the EU.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is not recommended by the WHO for people with severe COVID‐19; recommended therapeutics in these patients include corticosteroids, interleukin‐6 receptor blockers (tocilizumab, sarilumab), remdesivir (an antiviral), and the janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib in addition to cardiorespiratory support measures as indicated (WHO 2023b).

The WHO also has a conditional recommendation against the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in people with non‐severe illness at the lowest risk of hospitalization (WHO 2023b).

The WHO currently does not recommend any therapeutic to prevent COVID‐19 in close contacts of infected patients or in other high‐risk groups (WHO 2023c).
