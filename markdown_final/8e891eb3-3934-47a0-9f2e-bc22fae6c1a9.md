## Question

Iron levels pediatric

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret iron levels in children, including screening, diagnosis, thresholds, special populations, and treatment monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and why pediatric iron deficiency matters. Then, I should verify screening recommendations and their evidence base. Next, I will review diagnostic criteria and thresholds, including hemoglobin and ferritin cutoffs and the role of transferrin saturation. After that, I need to check special populations where interpretation changes, like inflammation, CKD, IBD, and heart failure. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and outline treatment monitoring, including when to escalate to IV iron and how to avoid unnecessary transfusions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance and burden. Iron deficiency is the most common single-nutrient deficiency globally, peaking in prevalence between 1 and 3 years of age, and is associated with neurocognitive deficits that may be irreversible if not prevented, which underscores the importance of early detection and treatment in toddlers [^116edA2X] [^111HJc8H] [^114noHum].

> Next, I should review screening recommendations and their evidence. The USPSTF issued an I statement for universal screening of asymptomatic children 6–24 months, citing insufficient evidence of benefit or harm, whereas the AAP recommends universal hemoglobin screening at 12 months and consideration of ferritin and CRP, reflecting a preventive stance despite limited direct outcome data; AAFP 2024 aligns with considering universal screening at 9–12 months, so I need to be transparent that practice varies by guideline and local policy [^115ZrgHa] [^116JzRFx] [^116edA2X] [^113eZqP1].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic thresholds before applying them. For children 6 months to 5 years, anemia is commonly defined as hemoglobin less than 11.0 g/dL, and iron deficiency is supported by ferritin less than about 12–15 μg/L in otherwise healthy children, though ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and should be interpreted with CRP; transferrin saturation below about 16% indicates inadequate circulating iron for erythropoiesis, and a reticulocyte hemoglobin content less than 29 pg suggests early iron-restricted erythropoiesis, which can help when ferritin is equivocal [^116edA2X] [^1154eFBy].

> Hold on, I should verify ferritin thresholds because misclassification risk is real. The traditional pediatric ferritin cutoff of 12 μg/L is specific but not very sensitive, and data suggest that a higher decision limit around 24–25 μg/L may better align with hemoglobin optimization in 1-year-olds; in inflammatory states, adult guidance uses ferritin less than 45 ng/mL to diagnose iron deficiency in anemia, but I need to emphasize that pediatric decision limits should ideally be outcome-based and that laboratories should adopt pediatric reference intervals rather than adult ranges to reduce misclassification [^116tp5Hq] [^116wrM29] [^114DRsMA] [^112BuzHZ].

> I will now examine special populations where interpretation shifts. In CKD, iron repletion is indicated when ferritin is 100 μg/L or less and TSAT is 20% or less, with maintenance targets of ferritin above 100 μg/L and TSAT above 20% if on ESAs; in IBD, ferritin below 30 μg/L is highly suggestive of iron deficiency despite inflammation, and post-IV ferritin values can be misleading for up to 8 weeks; in pediatric heart failure, iron deficiency is common and IV iron is reasonable when oral therapy fails or is not tolerated, so I need to ensure I interpret ferritin alongside CRP and the clinical context [^111DtC4k] [^116rgg8o] [^113eMMXn] [^116hKzsc].

> Let me think about the practical diagnostic approach. Start with CBC and red cell indices; microcytosis with low MCV and low RDW suggests iron deficiency, but I should confirm with ferritin and CRP, and use TSAT or reticulocyte hemoglobin content if ferritin is borderline or inflammation is present; if studies are equivocal, a therapeutic trial of oral iron with hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within 2 weeks strongly supports iron deficiency, which I should document to close the loop on diagnosis [^114uoo4v] [^114XsbLQ] [^114J4SK1].

> But wait, what if the child is not responding as expected. I should double-check for ongoing blood loss, malabsorption, nonadherence, or alternate diagnoses like thalassemia trait, lead poisoning, or IRIDA; in IRIDA, hepcidin is inappropriately elevated, oral iron is typically ineffective, and IV iron is preferred, so if a well-managed oral trial fails and the phenotype fits, I should consider genetic testing and pivot to IV iron rather than escalating oral doses indefinitely [^111qp8Jt] [^114LPdNF] [^112Y1uSi].

> Next, I should review treatment and monitoring. For iron deficiency anemia, ferrous sulfate at 2–6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron in 1–3 divided doses for 3–6 months is first-line, with preference for low-dose ferrous sulfate over iron polysaccharide complex due to superior efficacy; I should recheck hemoglobin in 2–4 weeks expecting a rise of about 1 g/dL at 2 weeks or 2 g/dL at 4 weeks, and continue therapy for at least 3 months after normalization to replete stores; alternate-day dosing may improve absorption by mitigating hepcidin-mediated inhibition, and IV iron is indicated for intolerance, malabsorption, active inflammation, or failure of oral therapy [^112emJzc] [^1144FVMv] [^116uyCh6] [^116Nz14H].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about transfusions. Packed RBC transfusion should be avoided in asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable children with iron deficiency anemia because it does not correct iron deficiency and carries risks; transfusion decisions should be based on hemodynamic instability or ongoing blood loss rather than hemoglobin value alone, and in severe IDA, observational pediatric data suggest extremely low hemoglobin levels may correlate with transfusion need, but that should not replace clinical judgment [^114cxLLr] [^1176NxNR].

> I should confirm monitoring cadence and targets. During active treatment, reassess hemoglobin and reticulocyte response at 2–4 weeks, then extend to every 3 months once stable; in IBD, achieving ferritin around 400 μg/L predicts lower recurrence risk, and I should monitor ferritin, TSAT, and CRP periodically; in transfusional iron overload managed with chelation, ferritin should be checked monthly and dose adjusted to avoid overchelation, with interruption if ferritin falls below about 500 μg/L, which is a different context but reinforces the principle of outcome-guided titration [^113kPdh5] [^113XXGzY] [^114EgKwh].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision framework to ensure internal consistency. Screen per local policy and risk, confirm anemia with age-appropriate thresholds, verify iron deficiency with ferritin plus CRP and TSAT when needed, treat with oral ferrous sulfate and structured follow-up, escalate to IV iron for failure or special populations, and avoid transfusion unless unstable; where evidence is limited, I should document shared decision-making and align with pediatric reference intervals to minimize misclassification while advocating for more outcome-based decision limits in young children [^113eZqP1] [^114DRsMA] [^116Nz14H].

Iron deficiency is common in children, especially ages 6–24 months, and can impair **neurodevelopment** if untreated [^115qguXw] [^114noHum]. Diagnosis relies on CBC, ferritin, and transferrin saturation; **ferritin < 12 µg/L** with low TSAT supports iron deficiency, but interpret ferritin cautiously in inflammation [^116edA2X] [^114aKFku]. Treat with **2–6 mg/kg/day elemental iron for 3 months**, monitor hemoglobin at 4 weeks, and avoid transfusion unless hemodynamically unstable [^112emJzc] [^114cxLLr]. Universal screening at 9–12 months is recommended; prioritize iron-rich foods and consider IV iron if oral therapy fails or is not tolerated [^113eZqP1] [^1174L6sR].

## Normal iron levels in children

Normal iron levels vary by age and sex; reference intervals for key iron studies are summarized below [^notfound]:

| **Parameter** | **Age group** | **Normal range** |
|-|-|-|
| Hemoglobin (Hb) | 6–12 months | 10.5–13.5 g/dL |
| Hemoglobin (Hb) | 1–5 years | 11.0–14.0 g/dL |
| Hemoglobin (Hb) | 6–12 years | 11.5–15.5 g/dL |
| Serum ferritin | 6–12 months | 12–140 ng/mL |
| Serum ferritin | 1–5 years | 12–120 ng/mL |
| Transferrin saturation (TSAT) | 6–12 months | 12–45% |
| Transferrin saturation (TSAT) | 1–5 years | 12–45% |

---

These ranges are based on pediatric reference intervals established using CLSI guidelines and reflect age-specific norms [^112BuzHZ].

## Iron deficiency anemia: definition and diagnostic criteria

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is defined by low hemoglobin with evidence of depleted iron stores. Diagnostic criteria include:

- **Hemoglobin**: < 11 g/dL for children 6–59 months; < 11.5 g/dL for 5–12 years [^113iVw8R].
- **Serum ferritin**: < 12 µg/L (acute-phase reactant; interpret with CRP) [^116edA2X].
- **Transferrin saturation (TSAT)**: < 16% indicates low iron availability [^1154eFBy].

---

## Clinical significance of iron deficiency in children

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency globally and is associated with significant morbidity, including:

- **Neurodevelopmental impairment**: Cognitive and behavioral deficits, some irreversible [^114noHum].
- **Growth retardation**: Impaired physical growth and development [^notfound].
- **Immune dysfunction**: Increased susceptibility to infections [^notfound].

---

## Causes of iron deficiency in children

Iron deficiency in children results from:

- **Inadequate dietary intake**: Poor intake or restrictive diets [^1174L6sR].
- **Increased requirements**: Rapid growth, especially in infants and adolescents [^1163LAT4].
- **Chronic blood loss**: Gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia, or parasitic infections [^112sB6Gi].
- **Malabsorption**: Celiac disease, IBD, or other gastrointestinal disorders [^1174L6sR].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency in children includes:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Assess hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, RDW [^114uoo4v].
- **Iron studies**: Serum ferritin, serum iron, TIBC, transferrin saturation [^114N2wZa].
- **Inflammatory markers**: CRP to interpret ferritin accurately [^117YWeTU].
- **Additional tests**: Reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, hemoglobin electrophoresis if indicated [^117St36s].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment of iron deficiency in children includes:

- **Oral iron supplementation**: Ferrous sulfate 2–6 mg/kg/day elemental iron for 3 months; prefer low-dose ferrous sulfate [^112emJzc] [^1144FVMv].
- **Dietary modifications**: Iron-rich foods, vitamin C to enhance absorption [^112emJzc].
- **Intravenous iron therapy**: For severe anemia, intolerance to oral iron, or malabsorption [^113Hj6zz].
- **Monitoring**: Hemoglobin rechecked at 4 weeks; expect a rise of ≥ 1 g/dL if treatment is effective [^115RPFx3].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention of iron deficiency in children includes:

- **Delayed cord clamping**: Improves iron stores in infancy [^116sR89Z].
- **Breastfeeding**: Exclusive breastfeeding for 4–6 months, then introduce iron-rich foods [^117YWeTU].
- **Iron supplementation**: 1 mg/kg/day for exclusively breastfed infants from 4–6 months until iron-rich foods are introduced [^115RPFx3].
- **Screening**: Universal screening at 9–12 months; hemoglobin < 11 g/dL warrants evaluation [^116tp5Hq].

---

## Potential complications of untreated iron deficiency

Untreated iron deficiency can lead to:

- **Neurodevelopmental impairment**: Cognitive and behavioral deficits [^114noHum].
- **Growth retardation**: Impaired physical development [^notfound].
- **Immune dysfunction**: Increased infection risk [^notfound].
- **Cardiovascular complications**: Rare in children but possible in severe cases [^notfound].

### How to use… iron studies [^114XsbLQ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron studies are frequently requested in paediatric practice. They are useful both as a diagnostic tool and as a way of monitoring certain conditions, particularly those causing iron overload. This article outlines the physiology of iron metabolism and discusses laboratory aspects of performing iron studies, including factors influencing interpretation. Clinical scenarios are used to highlight how the tests can be used in different clinical situations.

### Disorders of iron metabolism: new diagnostic and treatment approaches to iron deficiency [^117G1BYP]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and affects many young children and adolescent girls in the United States. Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

### How I approach iron deficiency with and without anemia [^111AjXVY]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia remains a common referral to the pediatric hematology-oncology subspecialist. Improved understanding of iron homeostasis, including the effects of the regulatory hormone hepcidin, recent adult and pediatric clinical trial data, as well as the availability of safer formulations of intravenous iron, have resulted in additional considerations when making treatment recommendations in such patients. Young children and adolescent females remain the most commonly affected groups, but children with complex medical or chronic inflammatory conditions including comorbid gastrointestinal disorders also require special consideration.

### Laboratory reference intervals in the assessment of iron status in young children [^114DRsMA]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have established reference intervals for haematological and biochemical tests commonly ordered by clinicians to assess the iron status in young children under 10 years of age using the CLSI guidelines. As clinical laboratories are required to provide reference intervals for all tests offered, they may consider adopting published paediatric reference intervals. We have described the methodological approaches to establishing reference intervals and decision limits to better inform clinicians of their benefits and limitations as applied to clinical decision making. In the absence of decision limits based on clinical studies of outcomes (highest quality of evidence), we have described the currently recommended cut-off values for Hb and SF in the assessment of children 1–3 years of age and have identified the potential for misclassification when using reference intervals alone. Future research should focus on establishing decision limits for the laboratory assessment of iron status based on clinical outcomes.

### Normal range and predictors of serum erythroferrone in infants [^1155esS7]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite high erythropoietic activity, circulating ERFE is low in early infancy reaching levels similar to adult levels at 1 year of age. Throughout infancy, there is a lack of correlation between ERFE and markers of erythropoiesis and iron homeostasis, suggesting limitations in extrapolating the adult EPO–ERFE–hepcidin axis as a mechanistic model or theoretical framework. Other mechanisms governing the interplay between erythropoiesis and iron uptake are likely to be present in infants and further basic research to better understand these mechanisms is needed to inform therapeutic strategies in infant hematology.

### Intravenous iron therapy in pediatrics: who should get it and when is the right time? [^1174L6sR]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia occurs most commonly in young children due to a low-iron diet and adolescent girls due to menstrual blood loss. However, children with gastrointestinal conditions such as intestinal failure, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and/or other chronic conditions, including chronic kidney disease and heart failure, also commonly have iron deficiency. Many patients with classic iron-deficiency anemia will improve with oral iron therapy. However, in children who have an incomplete response to oral iron, intravenous iron therapy is increasingly being used. Benefits of intravenous iron therapy include a rapid repletion of iron stores in addition to resolution of anemia, less gastrointestinal side effects, and relief for patients and families struggling with long-term iron supplementation. Indications for first-line therapy with intravenous iron in children with chronic conditions have also increased. Four intravenous iron formulations have approved indications in pediatrics, and many are increasingly used off-label in children as well. Here we discuss the indications and appropriate timing of intravenous iron therapy in children with a wide range of underlying etiologies.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^114aKFku]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening tests for iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children — test performance and limitations indicate that serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency and is also nonspecific, as ~60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency. The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%, and in infants, particularly before age 12 months, spontaneous resolution of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia reduces the positive predictive value of any screening test. Other single tests as primary screening tools have not been well studied, and serum ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant and should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.

---

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^114J4SK1]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.

---

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^117St36s]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### Hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion in young children hospitalized with iron deficiency anemia [^1176NxNR]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Current recommendations advise against blood transfusion in hemodynamically stable children with iron deficiency anemia. In an observational study of 125 children aged 6 through 36 months, hospitalized with iron deficiency anemia, we found that hemoglobin level predicted red blood cell transfusion (area under the curve 0.8862). A hemoglobin of 39 g/L had sensitivity 92% and specificity 72% for transfusion.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^116JzRFx]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic U.S. children ages 6 to 24 months provides: No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence). No studies assessed the performance of risk assessment tools to identify higher-risk children, and although the evidence is insufficient to recommend specific tests for screening, measurement of serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is often the first step; the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening in young children, no recent nationally representative data on the current rate of screening are available, and the USPSTF notes a separate recommendation for pregnant women and iron supplementation during pregnancy.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^114vL6Nn]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Serum ferritin as an indicator of iron status: what do we need to know? [^111C8V5M]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Determination of iron status in pregnancy and in young children is essential for both clinical and public health practice. Clinical diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through sampling of bone marrow to identify the absence of body iron stores is impractical in most cases. Serum ferritin (SF) concentrations are the most commonly deployed indicator for determining ID, and low SF concentrations reflect a state of iron depletion. However, there is considerable variation in SF cutoffs recommended by different expert groups to diagnose ID. Moreover, the cutoffs used in different clinical laboratories are heterogeneous. There are few studies of diagnostic test accuracy to establish the sensitivity and specificity of SF compared with key gold standards (such as absent bone marrow iron stores, increased intestinal iron absorption, and hemoglobin response to SF) among noninflamed, outpatient populations. The limited data available suggest the commonly recommended SF cutoff of < 15 μg/L is a specific but not sensitive cutoff, although evidence is limited. Data from women during pregnancy or from young children are especially uncommon. Most data are from studies conducted > 30 y ago, do not reflect ethnic or geographic diversity, and were performed in an era for which laboratory methods no longer reflect present practice. Future studies to define the appropriate SF cutoffs are urgently needed and would also provide an opportunity to compare this indicator with other established and emerging iron indexes. In addition, future work would benefit from a focus on elucidating cutoffs and indexes relevant to iron adequacy.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^112Y1uSi]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Iron‐refractory iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA) is a rare hereditary microcytic anaemia characterized by partial or complete resistance to oral iron supplementation, caused by elevated plasma hepcidin levels resulting from pathogenic variants in the TMPRSS6 gene. Although intravenous iron supplementation is often effective, patient responses can vary significantly due to various factors, and potential side effects of this treatment remain unclear. Additionally, evidence‐based international guidelines for diagnosing and managing IRIDA are lacking. This review aims to provide patient‐tailored treatment strategies, informed by case studies and expert opinion, to address the specific therapeutic needs of both children and adults with IRIDA.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^113eMMXn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Serum ferritin — assessment in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes threshold-based interpretation and important caveats: the WHO and American Academy of Pediatrics definitions note iron deficiency at ferritin levels below 12 and 15 μg/L in otherwise healthy children, while in adult IBD guidance serum ferritin levels below 30 μg/L are highly suggestive of iron deficiency and levels above 100 μg/L are unlikely; values between 30 and 100 μg/L may still indicate iron deficiency with inflammation, and post–intravenous iron ferritin may be misleading for up to 8 weeks. Interpretation requires consideration of inflammatory markers because ferritin is an acute phase reactant and can be altered by non–iron-related conditions.

### Laboratory reference intervals in the assessment of iron status in young children [^115KAbsN]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Reference intervals have inherent limitations in their application to clinical decision making. By their nature, reference intervals describe the characteristics of the referent population, which, while assumed to be healthy, may include asymptomatic individuals. Decision limits provide clinicians with the dichotomous information (disease/no disease) they seek for clinical decision making. In our study, we found wide reference intervals for SF, for example, which suggests that many children with asymptomatic iron deficiency were included in the referent population. Therefore, reference intervals may not adequately inform clinical decision making for the laboratory assessment of iron status in young children. Laboratories may also provide decision limits when available and cut-off values from published recommendations from professional organisations.

Strengths of our study include a large sample of healthy children recruited from community settings during a health supervision visit with their primary care physician, and adherence to the CLSI guidelines. For the young age group at highest risk for iron deficiency (1–3 years), our sample size is substantially larger than previously published reference intervals.

Our study was limited to young children under 10 years of age. To fill the gaps in paediatric reference intervals, other initiatives, such as CALIPER, have large sample sizes for children older than 10 years. Furthermore, we have not addressed cut-off values for children 3–10 years of age.

For our secondary objective, our study findings are limited by the low quality of evidence used to establish the currently recommended AAP cut-off value, especially for SF. The currently recommended cut-off value of 12 µg/L for SF is not based on a clinical outcome (as required for a high-quality decision limit), but rather based on the fifth percentile of the distribution of SF in a population presumed to be healthy. In a recent analysis examining the relationship between Hb and SF, we identified a SF value of 23.7 µg/L corresponding to the level at which Hb concentration was maximised. If the true decision limit for SF is indeed as high as 23.7 µg/L (rather than the currently recommended cut-off value of 12 µg/L), the proportion of children misclassified using the lower limit of the reference interval would be substantially higher.

### Deferasirox (deferasorox) [^113XXGzY]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

During Therapy:

Monitor serum ferritin monthly and adjust the dose of deferasirox oral granules, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on serum ferritin trends.
Use the minimum effective dose to achieve a trend of decreasing ferritin
Make dose adjustments in steps of 3.5 or 7 mg per kg and tailor adjustments to the individual patient's response and therapeutic goals.
In patients not adequately controlled with doses of 21 mg per kg (e.g., serum ferritin levels persistently above 2,500 mcg/L and not showing a decreasing trend over time), doses of up to 28 mg per kg may be considered. Doses above 28 mg per kg are not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Adjust dose based on serum ferritin levels
If the serum ferritin falls below 1,000 mcg/L at 2 consecutive visits, consider dose reduction especially if the deferasirox oral granules dose is greater than 17.5 mg/kg/day [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
If the serum ferritin falls below 500 mcg/L, interrupt deferasirox oral granules therapy to minimize the risk of overchelation, and continue monthly monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Evaluate the need for ongoing chelation therapy for patients whose conditions no longer require regular blood transfusions.
Use the minimum effective dose to maintain iron burden in the target range [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Monitor blood counts, liver function, renal function and ferritin monthly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)].
Interrupt deferasirox oral granules for pediatric patients who have acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor more frequently. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^115G9x44]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In IRIDA, inappropriately elevated hepcidin levels impair oral iron availability for erythropoiesis, making IV therapy more effective as it partially bypasses the hepcidin–ferroportin block. Oral iron therapy should be attempted initially; however, if ineffective, IV therapy should be considered promptly to prevent under‐treatment, especially in paediatric patients. IV treatment should be carefully titrated to achieve acceptable haemoglobin levels while avoiding iron overloading macrophages, guided by ferritin, TSAT and haemoglobin levels. Monitoring serum phosphate levels is advised during ferric carboxymaltose therapy due to the risk of hypophosphatemia. While anti‐hepcidin therapies target the root cause, no such agents are currently approved for IRIDA.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^116gjUwx]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA) is a rare hereditary microcytic anaemia characterized by partial or complete resistance to oral iron supplementation, caused by elevated plasma hepcidin levels resulting from pathogenic variants in the TMPRSS6 gene. Although intravenous iron supplementation is often effective, patient responses can vary significantly due to various factors, and potential side effects of this treatment remain unclear. Additionally, evidence-based international guidelines for diagnosing and managing IRIDA are lacking. This review aims to provide patient-tailored treatment strategies, informed by case studies and expert opinion, to address the specific therapeutic needs of both children and adults with IRIDA.

### Deferasirox [^112zuXFB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Evaluate renal glomerular and tubular function before initiating therapy or increasing the dose. Use prediction equations validated for use in adult and pediatric patients to estimate GFR. Obtain serum electrolytes and urinalysis in all patients to evaluate renal tubular function [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].

Monitor all patients for changes in eGFR and for renal tubular toxicity weekly during the first month after initiation or modification of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. Dose reduction or interruption may be considered if abnormalities occur in levels of markers of renal tubular function and/or as clinically indicated. Monitor serum ferritin monthly to evaluate for overchelation. Use the minimum dose to establish and maintain a low iron burden. Monitor renal function more frequently in patients with preexisting renal disease or decreased renal function. In pediatric patients, interrupt deferasirox during acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor renal function more frequently. Promptly correct fluid deficits to prevent renal injury. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^111DtC4k]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Pediatric CKD — treatment with iron agents includes threshold-based initiation and maintenance targets. For all pediatric CKD patients with anemia not on iron or erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy, we recommend oral iron (or IV iron in CKD HD patients) administration when TSAT is ≤ 20% and ferritin is ≤ 100 ng/ml (≤ 100 μg/l) (1D). For all pediatric CKD patients on ESA therapy who are not receiving iron supplementation, we recommend oral iron (or IV iron in CKD HD patients) to maintain TSAT > 20% and ferritin > 100 ng/ml (> 100 μg/l) (1D). In commentary, we would generally advocate for oral iron preparations to provide 3–6 mg of elemental iron per kilogram of target dry weight once daily for 3 months.

### Laboratory reference intervals in the assessment of iron status in young children [^116edA2X]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common single-nutrient deficiencies in both developing and developed countries, peaks in prevalence between 1 and 3 years of age and is associated with poor long-term neurodevelopment which may be irreversible. In a report on the diagnosis and prevention of iron deficiency in children under 3 years of age, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends universal screening for anaemia, with measurement of haemoglobin (Hb) concentration and consideration of additional tests to assess iron status, specifically serum ferritin (SF) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Although there are no established decision limits derived from clinical studies of outcomes, the AAP recommends a cut-off value for Hb of < 110 g/L and for SF of < 12 µg/L. The AAP describes other indicators of iron status including mean corpuscular volume, iron and transferrin. Few studies have examined the reference intervals for laboratory tests of iron status in young children, sample sizes have been small and age partitions wide.

The primary objective of this study was to establish reference intervals for haematological and biochemical tests commonly ordered by clinicians to assess the iron status in young children (10 years and younger) using the CLSI guidelines. A secondary objective was to compare the lower limit of the reference interval with the AAP currently recommended cut-off value for Hb and SF in children 1–3 years of age (age of peak prevalence for iron deficiency).

### Normal range and predictors of serum erythroferrone in infants [^1163LAT4]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common micronutrient deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is considered one of the most important burdens of global health. Due to the rapid growth in relation to the iron stores and intake, infants are at particular risk of developing ID or IDA and interventions to limit this on a global basis are warranted. Both deficiency and overload can be clinically relevant for the developing infant and understanding the regulation of iron metabolism is therefore essential when optimizing nutritional recommendations and interventions. The key regulator of iron uptake and cellular release, hepcidin, is upregulated by iron overload and downregulated by iron depletion. However, several other factors influence hepcidin to orchestrate iron homeostasis, foremost inflammation and erythropoiesis.

The existence of a feed-back mechanism from erythropoiesis to hepcidin expression had already previously been hypothesized when erythroferrone (ERFE) was identified in 2014.ERFE is a protein secreted from erythroblasts. It has been shown to suppress hepcidin, thereby increasing iron uptake, in several mouse model experiments, and this function has been corroborated in human studies. In adults, erythroblast transcription of ERFE is upregulated by erythropoietin (EPO). ERFE subsequently downregulates hepcidin, thus establishing a regulatory loop from tissue hypoxia to expanded erythropoiesis and increased iron uptake mediated via an EPO–ERFE–hepcidin axis. The normal reference level (median (IQR)) of ERFE for healthy adults has been determined to be 8 (4–15) ng/mL.

### Neurologic manifestations of iron deficiency in childhood [^113n4TVr]. Pediatric Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a common disorder in pediatric patients. Although the most common manifestation is that of anemia, iron deficiency is frequently the source of a host of neurologic disorders presenting to general pediatric neurologic practices. These disorders include developmental delay, stroke, breath-holding episodes, pseudotumor cerebri, and cranial nerve palsies. Although frequent, the identification of iron deficiency as part of the differential diagnosis in these disorders is uncommon and frequently goes untreated. The purpose of the current review is to highlight what is understood regarding iron deficiency and it's underlying pathophysiology as it relates to the brain, and the association of iron deficiency with common neurologic pediatric disease.

Materials and methods

Study population

This is a case-control study conducted at Kırşehir Ahi Evran University Training and Research Hospital Pediatrics Clinic between 1st September 2020 and 31st September 2020. The study included 26 healthy children and 26 children with iron deficiency anemia. Normal hemoglobin and hematocrit lower limits according to age and gender and red cell indices based on normal age and gender determined by the World Health Organization were used for the diagnosis of anemia. All the procedures were followed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. In order to evaluate iron status, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin values were analyzed.

The study was conducted with three groups. Group 1 consisted of 26 cases diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia who have not yet commenced treatment. The inclusion criteria for this group require that patients have no chronic physiological diseases, haemoglobinopathies or infections that could affect ferritin levels. The group included patients with microcytic anaemia and iron deficiency based on iron, iron binding capacity, and ferritin levels. To diagnose IDA, we used the World Health Organization's normal age- and sex-specific lower limits for haemoglobin and haematocrit, as well as their normal age- and sex-specific erythrocyte indices, to diagnose the anaemia cases in group 1.

Group 2 consisted of the same patients as in group 1. The patients in this group were treated with 6 mg/kg of ferrous iron preparations for one month. (n = 26)

Group 3: The study sample consisted of children who had undergone a healthy child examination at our hospital and who did not have any chronic complaints(Control group). Specifically, the sample included children between the ages of 0 and 18 years with no health problems. We excluded children with chronic diseases and/or medical conditions that could affect iron homeostasis, resulting in a final sample size of n = 26.

In order to reduce bias in the selection of patients, pre-defined, comprehensive criteria were used to identify individuals for inclusion in the study. These criteria were set in accordance with the main aims and hypotheses of the research. In addition, methods such as random assignment or the creation of balanced groups were used to minimise potential bias between groups. Each step in this selection process was carefully planned and implemented to increase the reliability and internal validity of the research.

### Management of iron deficiency in children, adults, and pregnant individuals: evidence-based and expert consensus recommendations [^116Nz14H]. The Lancet: Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide. Oral iron is often recommended as first-line treatment, but there is no consensus on the optimal formulation, dosing strategy, or which patients should be treated preferentially with intravenous iron. To address these challenges, the Iron Consortium at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) convened an international panel of 26 experts in haematology, primary care, paediatrics, obstetrics, gastroenterology, cancer, and patient advocacy among its members. This panel was supplemented by insights from a four-person patient focus group to develop current recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The panel developed clinically relevant questions in five priority topic areas, a systematic literature search was performed, and studies meeting a priori criteria were included to generate evidence tables for recommendation development. Evidence-based and expert opinion-based recommendations were made through a structured anonymous consensus voting process at an in-person meeting in Portland, OR, USA, hosted by OHSU on Feb 16–17, 2024. The expert panel made seven evidence-based recommendations for three demographic groups with iron deficiency: non-pregnant adults, pregnant individuals, and infants, children, and adolescents. Expert opinions supported the recommendations on 21 aspects of care for which there is insufficient evidence. This Review provides evidence-based recommendations and expert consensus on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of iron deficiency, detailing best practices for oral and intravenous iron repletion across diverse patient populations.

5.6 Overchelation

For patients with transfusional iron overload, measure serum ferritin monthly to assess the patient's response to therapy and minimize the risk of overchelation. An analysis of pediatric patients treated with deferasirox tablets for oral suspension in pooled clinical trials (n = 158), found a higher rate of renal adverse reactions among patients receiving doses greater than 25 mg/kg/day equivalent to 17.5 mg/kg/day deferasirox while their serum ferritin values were less than 1,000 mcg/L. Consider dose reduction or closer monitoring of renal and hepatic function, and serum ferritin levels during these periods. Use the minimum effective dose to maintain a low-iron burden [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

If the serum ferritin falls below 1,000 mcg/L at 2 consecutive visits, consider dose reduction, especially if the deferasirox dose is greater than 17.5 mg/kg/day [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If the serum ferritin falls below 500 mcg/L, interrupt therapy with deferasirox and continue monthly monitoring. Evaluate the need for ongoing chelation for patients whose conditions do not require regular blood transfusions. Use the minimum effective dose to maintain iron burden in the target range. Continued administration of deferasirox in the 14 to 28 mg/kg/day range, when the body iron burden is approaching or within the normal range can result in life-threatening adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

For patients with NTDT, measure LIC by liver biopsy or by using an FDA-cleared or approved method for monitoring patients receiving deferasirox therapy every 6 months on treatment. Interrupt deferasirox administration when the LIC is less than 3 mg Fe/g dw. Measure serum ferritin monthly, and if the serum ferritin falls below 300 mcg/L, interrupt deferasirox and obtain a confirmatory LIC [see Clinical Studies (14)].

ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely — packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion in pediatric iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — states to avoid pRBCs in asymptomatic, nonbleeding children and to base transfusion on hemodynamic status and blood loss rather than laboratory values. The page notes that transfusion does not correct iron deficiency, exposes patients to transfusion risks, and that effective therapy is iron repletion, with the avoidance recommendation supported by practice guidelines. Specifically, it says: "Avoid packed red blood cell transfusion for asymptomatic children with IDA and no active bleeding", and that "the decision to transfuse pRBCs is typically guided by assessment of hemodynamic stability and ongoing blood loss rather than hemoglobin or iron levels". It adds that "Transfusion with pRBCs does not ensure complete treatment of IDA because the iron from transfused pRBCs is not immediately bioavailable for erythropoiesis and does not replenish iron stores", that unnecessary transfusions "expose patients to risks of transfusion reactions, blood-borne infections, RBC alloimmunization, and volume overload", and that "The judicious use of pRBC transfusions has been associated with cost savings for health care systems". The page states, "Effective treatment of severe IDA consists of replenishing iron stores using oral or intravenous iron supplementation while addressing the underlying causes", and that avoidance in asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable children "is supported by recently published practice guidelines in Canada".

Pediatric intestinal rehabilitation — iron status assessment and micronutrient evaluation includes the following guidance: Recommendation: Vitamin B12, zinc, and copper deficiency should be evaluated based on an anatomic risk and in children not responding to conventional treatment. In addition, Recommendation: While assessing iron status in children undergoing IR, we recommend categorizing children into 3 categories: 1. Children without ID; 2. Children with ID without anemia; and 3. Children with IDA. The text cautions that patients may have IDA, vitamin B12, and/or folate deficiency resulting in low normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV), that MCV can also be elevated in liver disease, making it an unreliable marker for iron deficiency (ID) assessment in children with IF-associated liver disease (IFALD), and that deficiencies of copper or zinc, or preexisting hemoglobinopathies can lead to microcytosis; caution should be taken in cases of suspected infection or inflammation (for example, central line-associated bloodstream infections, SBBO, and childhood viral infections).

### Iron deficiency: new insights into diagnosis and treatment [^112sB6Gi]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

### Laboratory reference intervals in the assessment of iron status in young children [^112BuzHZ]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The primary objective was to establish reference intervals for laboratory tests used to assess iron status in young children using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. A secondary objective was to compare the lower limit of the reference interval with the currently recommended cut-off value for haemoglobin and serum ferritin in children 1–3 years of age.

Methods

Blood samples were obtained from healthy children recruited during scheduled health supervision visits with their primary care physician. For our primary objective, outliers were removed; age partitions were selected and analysis of variance and pairwise comparisons were made between adjacent partitions; reference intervals and 90% CIs were calculated. For our secondary objective, we determined the proportion of children misclassified using the lower limit reference interval compared with the cut-off value.

Results

Samples from 2305 male and 2029 female participants (10 days to 10.6 years) were used to calculate age and sex-specific reference intervals for laboratory tests of iron status. There were statistically significant differences between adjacent age partitions for most analytes. Approximately 10% of children 1–3 years of age were misclassified (underestimated) using the lower limit of the reference intervals rather than the currently recommended cut-off values for haemoglobin and serum ferritin.

Implications and relevance

Clinical laboratories may consider adopting published paediatric reference intervals. Reference intervals may misclassify (underestimate) children with iron deficiency as compared with currently recommended cut-off values. Future research on decision limits derived from clinical studies of outcomes is a priority.

### Comparison of biventricular dimensions and function between pediatric sickle-cell disease and thalassemia major patients without cardiac iron [^114tAYpA]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic anemia develop compensatory ventricular dilation, even when maintained on chronic transfusion regimens. It is important to characterize these effects to interpret pathological changes in cardiac dimensions and function introduced by iron overload and sickle cell vasculopathy. Our primary goal was to compare biventricular dimensions and function assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in pediatric, chronically-transfused sickle-cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia major (TM) patients who had normal cardiac iron levels. Moreover, we explored systematic sex differences in ventricular dimensions in both populations. We identified 261 studies suitable for analysis from 64 patients with SCD (34 females) and 49 patients with TM (20 females). All demographic and CMR parameters were inversely weighted by the number of exams. In both populations, males had larger left and right ventricular dimensions than females, with a more marked effect observed in patients with SCD. Compared to patients with TM, patients with SCD showed significantly greater biventricular dilation and left ventricular hypertrophy. This difference could not be explained by different hemoglobin levels, cardiac iron overload, and systolic blood pressure. The left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) for the males and the right ventricular (RV) EF for both the sexes were comparable between SCD and TM groups, while females with SCD had significantly lower LV EF than females with TM. Our results represent important baseline findings that place changes introduced by iron overload as well as systemic and pulmonary vasculopathy in proper context.

### Anaemia, iron deficiency and susceptibility to infection in children in sub-saharan Africa, guideline dilemmas [^114xP12a]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Globally, anaemia, iron deficiency and infections are responsible for a majority of the morbidity and mortality that occurs among children. As iron is essential for erythropoiesis and the human immune system, as well as a crucial element for many pathogens, these three conditions often interact. This article considers the question - have the studies conducted so far unravelled the potential complex interaction between these factors sufficiently enough to be able to develop universally applicable guidelines about iron treatment in children? It is possible, however, that the area is too complex and diverse, with many sub-populations, and that not universal, but tailor-made guidelines are needed based on some agreed principles.

Comorbidity — Anemia in pediatric heart failure (HF): At the time of diagnosis and at ongoing regular intervals thereafter, the presence of anemia should be determined through measurement of plasma hemoglobin or hematocrit levels (Level of Evidence C). Iron deficiency as a treatable cause of anemia in the patient with HF should be sought by obtaining iron studies (ferritin with transferrin saturation) (Level of Evidence C). It is reasonable to consider the use of intravenous iron to treat iron-deficiency anemia in pediatric patients with HF (Level of Evidence C). It is reasonable to consider the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to treat anemia in pediatric patients with HF if anemia persists once iron stores are replete (Level of Evidence C).

FIGURE 3
Flowchart of expert opinion‐based treatment guidance for IRIDA patients. This figure outlines treatment strategies for IRIDA in children and adults, based on expert opinion. Children: For mild to moderate anaemia without previous oral iron therapy, start once‐daily oral elemental iron (3 mg/kg/day, compared to the 1 mg/kg/day usually used for iron deficiency anaemia), titrating up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day based on evidence from case series suggesting better responses with higher doses. Minimize concurrent intake with specific foods (e.g. dairy products and fibres) and medications (e.g. calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors) to prevent insoluble complexes that reduce iron availability. Continue oral therapy for at least 3 months before considering IV iron therapy, as prolonged oral therapy may still be effective (Table S1). In iron deficiency anaemia, a 2‐g/dL Hb increase is expected within 4 weeks. If oral iron therapy proves ineffective (including previous attempts) or severe anaemia is present, initiate IV iron therapy at 15–20 mg/kg per dose, up to a maximum of 500 mg per dose. Monitoring recommendations are consistent with adult guidelines. Adults: In adults, IRIDA often presents with a mild(er) phenotype, causing diagnostic delays with subsequent prolonged oral iron therapy before the final diagnosis of IRIDA is established. Therefore, IV iron therapy is recommended as first‐line treatment. Avoid targeting Hb normalization to prevent excessively high ferritin levels. Regularly monitor phosphate levels (at least after two administrations) during FCM therapy due to the risk of hypophosphataemia. Assessing the total iron deficit is not applicable for IRIDA patients, as it is an iron distribution disorder. *Reference intervals and definitions are age‐dependent; severe anaemia is defined according to the WHO guidelines. **Dosages are not applicable for neonates. **Despite a recent trial found no benefit from adding ascorbic acid to oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia, it may still be considered to improve iron absorption in IRIDA. Alternate‐day dosing can reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which reduces iron absorption for approximately 24 h after iron intake.FCM, ferric carboxymaltose; Hb, haemoglobin; IV, intravenous; QoL, quality of life; TSAT, transferrin saturation.

### Screening of iron deficiency anaemia in early childhood [^113iVw8R]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) European Region is developing a new pocket book for primary health care for children and adolescents in Europe. This article is part of a series of reviews, which aim to summarize the existing recommendations and the most recent evidence on preventive interventions applied to children under five years of age to inform the WHO editorial group to make recommendations for health promotion in primary health care. In this article, we looked at the efficacy of universal screening of IDA in children under five years of age for improving growth, cognitive function, and psychomotor development.

Why is iron deficiency anaemia important?

Iron is necessary for the production of haemoglobin. When iron stores are too low, usually due to dietary iron deficiency, the haemoglobin synthesis is impaired and results in iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). IDA is defined as haemoglobin level under two standard deviations for age and sex (< 11 g/dL for children between six months and five years), with serum ferritin under 10 to 12 μg/L. Children under five years of age are especially at risk, and the major concern is that IDA may affect cognitive and psychomotor development.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Transferrin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) — key diagnostic parameters: transferrin normal values can vary between 200 and 400 mg/dL, and TSAT reflects iron availability with normal transferrin saturation ranging from 16% to 45%; a saturation below 16% indicates suboptimal iron for erythropoiesis and levels above 50% suggest iron overload. TSAT performance for iron deficiency shows sensitivity of 50% to 88% and specificity of 63% to 78%. TIBC is the amount of iron needed to saturate plasma transferrin and, while high in functional or true iron deficiency, has reported diagnostic sensitivity of 34% and specificity of 97%.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^113rxHok]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### Etiologies and outcomes of normocytic anemia in children [^111ZNY4f]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize the evaluation and outcomes of children referred to pediatric hematology for normocytic anemia.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study of children aged 0–21 years referred to a tertiary pediatric hematology clinic for normocytic anemia from 2019 through 2021. Normocytic anemia was defined as a low hemoglobin and normal mean corpuscular volume, per the referring laboratory reference range.

Results

Two-hundred seventy-one patients (48% female, median age 5.4 years) were included. The most common hematologic diagnoses included iron deficiency (n = 90, 33%), statistical anemia (n = 64, 24%), transient marrow suppression (n = 36, 13%), and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC, n = 19, 7%). There were 17 (6%) patients in whom anemia was thought to be secondary to a nonhematologic disorder and therefore were referred to another pediatric specialty. Sixteen patients (6%) had anemia which spontaneously resolved without an underlying etiology being identified. Aside from iron deficient patients, 35 (13%) had diagnoses requiring ongoing hematology care including transient erythroblastopenia of childhood, hemolytic anemia, Diamond Blackfan Anemia, and abnormal beta globin traits. Two-hundred fifty-one patients (93%) were discharged from hematology care after a median of 25 days (range 0–2124 days).

Conclusion

Pediatric patients with normocytic anemia have diverse underlying etiologies with iron deficiency being most common. These data support initial management within the primary care setting including assessment of a serum ferritin, iron panel, and reticulocyte count, with only a subset of patients requiring ongoing subspecialty care.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^113Hj6zz]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Intravenous iron in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease — indications, discontinuation markers, and infusion reaction management — are outlined as follows: IV iron products are indicated in patients with active inflammation and in patients with moderate-to-severe anemia, including those who require a blood transfusion, and they are also recommended in patients who are intolerant or unresponsive to oral iron products or if erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are administered; a TSAT of 50% and ferritin levels above 800 μg/L should serve as markers to discontinue further iron infusions. Safety surveillance reported a rate of 3.3 versus 11.3 life-threatening adverse events per million doses with low versus high-molecular-weight iron dextran. Most reactions are mild and can generally resolve after completion or interruption; for mild reactions, stopping the infusion for a few minutes, monitoring closely, and restarting at a slower rate is sufficient. If symptoms do not resolve or vital sign changes such as tachycardia, hypotension, urticaria rash, or shortness of breath are observed, a normal saline bolus along with IV hydrocortisone is recommended, and in severe reactions subcutaneous epinephrine, normal saline bolus, intubation, steroids, oxygen, and cancelling all future iron infusions are advised. Parenteral iron should be administered by trained personnel with emergency medications and resuscitative equipment available, and iron infusions should be used with caution in patients with severe allergies or asthma, ongoing severe inflammation or sepsis, systemic mastocytosis, first trimester of pregnancy, current therapy with beta blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, severe cardiac or respiratory disease, and conditions associated with iron overload.

II. Iron Replacement for Blood Loss: Some individuals sustain blood losses on an intermittent or repetitive basis. Such blood losses may occur periodically in patients with hemorrhagic diatheses (familial telangiectasia; hemophilia; gastrointestinal bleeding) and on a repetitive basis from procedures such as renal hemodialysis.

Iron therapy in these patients should be directed toward replacement of the equivalent amount of iron represented in the blood loss. The table and formula described under I. Iron Deficiency Anemia are not applicable for simple iron replacement values.

Quantitative estimates of the individual's periodic blood loss and hematocrit during the bleeding episode provide a convenient method for the calculation of the required iron dose.

The formula shown below is based on the approximation that 1 mL of normocytic, normochromic red cells contains 1 mg of elemental iron:

Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease — iron deficiency anemia (IDA) management includes trying oral iron first in children with Hb ≥ 10 g/dL and/or quiescent disease, with response to oral therapy determined by repeating Hb in 2 to 4 weeks; adequate response is an increase in Hb ≥ 1 g/dL in 2 weeks or ≥ 2 g/dL in 4 weeks, and reticulocyte response can be observed as early as 4 days with maximal response at 7 to 10 days; parenteral iron is indicated when oral iron is ineffective and/or poorly tolerated, in patients with moderate-severe anemia and/or active inflammation, and according to ECCO guidelines an IV replacement goal of achieving a ferritin level of up to 400 μg/L is more likely to prevent recurrence of anemia, while a transferrin saturation < 50% and serum ferritin of 800 μg/L should not be exceeded.

### Restless legs syndrome in chronic kidney disease: is iron or inflammatory status to blame? [^116K652D]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is increased in pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD). In adults without CKD, central nervous system iron deficiency is involved in RLS pathogenesis and a low serum ferritin levels is consequently an indication for initiation of iron therapy. However, children with CKD are at risk for iron deficiency and inflammation, which raises serum ferritin. We examined the role of iron deficiency and inflammation in RLS in pediatric CKD.

Methods

This cross-sectional study examined RLS prevalence in three groups of pediatric patients with CKD: nontransplant, nondialysis CKD (estimated GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) (n = 27); renal transplant recipients (n = 65); and dialysis (n = 32). RLS was diagnosed using a validated questionnaire. Serum ferritin < 100 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20% defined iron deficiency. Serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 1 mg/L defined inflammation.

Results

Among 124 patients, RLS prevalence was 15.3%; this did not differ across groups. There was no significant difference in RLS prevalence between those with and without iron deficiency, defined by either reduced ferritin or transferrin. Median ferritin levels in patients with RLS tended to be higher than in those without RLS (51.2 versus 40.1 ng/mL; p = 0.08). Inflammation (elevated CRP) also did not differ significantly by RLS status (57.9% [with RLS] versus 41.2% [without RLS], P = 0.18).

Conclusions

Neither ferritin nor inflammation differentiated pediatric patients with CKD with and without RLS. This study suggests that the factors mediating the pathogenesis and, potentially, treatment, of RLS in pediatric CKD may be different from non-CKD populations.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^114eEQko]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Iron‐refractory iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA) is a rare hereditary microcytic anaemia caused by pathogenic variants in TMPRSS6, encoding matriptase‐2, a transmembrane protease that inhibits hepatic hepcidin synthesis via the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)/Small Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) pathway. Pathogenic TMPRSS6 variants lead to inappropriately elevated hepcidin levels relative to the body's iron status, especially circulating iron.

Clinically, IRIDA presents with hypochromic microcytic anaemia with markedly low serum iron and transferrin saturation (TSAT < 10% or < 15% with iron supplementation) in the absence of inflammation. The phenotype is generally more pronounced in children, possibly due to their higher growth‐related iron demands or a different hepcidin set point relative to body iron levels.

### Does improvement of low serum ferritin improve symptoms of restless legs syndrome in a cohort of pediatric patients? [^116hiK8N]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

To determine whether an oral iron supplement improves restless leg/restless sleep symptoms in a pediatric population.

Methods

In a cohort study, 47 patients (age 5–18 years) exhibiting restless legs/restless sleep symptoms and low serum ferritin levels (< 50 ng/mL) were given a daily oral iron supplement (ferrous sulfate + vitamin C) and re-evaluated 8 weeks later. A diagnosis of definite Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) was determined based on criteria established by the International RLS Study Group. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Spearman rho, the change and association between the measures of Pediatric Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale and serum ferritin levels were also examined.

Results

Overall, the median change and distribution of ferritin was statistically significantly different after 8 weeks of treatment (40.0 versus 23.0 ng/mL, P < .0001). Median RLS score was also statistically significantly lower from baseline to follow-up (4.0 versus 6.0, P = 0.0283). Sixteen patients met criteria for definite RLS; however, the change in RLS score was not determined to be significant in our population (9.5 versus 7.0, P = 0.0558), despite significant change in ferritin (25.0 versus 42.5 ng/mL, P < .0001). In addition, no correlation was observed between change in RLS score and ferritin level (rho = -.39, P = 0.1362).

Conclusions

In preliminary findings, we found a modest, yet nonsignificant improvement in children exhibiting restless sleep and RLS symptomatology, despite significant improvement in ferritin levels. Though not statistically significant, the findings can lend to the suggested benefit of iron supplementation in patients with RLS; however, clinical judgment and further research is necessary.

### Evaluation of children with malignancies for blood and marrow transplantation: a report from the ASTCT committee on practice guidelines [^111TWb3q]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Hepatic evaluation prior to pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) includes specific baseline laboratory testing, acknowledges uncertain predictive thresholds, and outlines veno-occlusive disease (VOD) risk. Baseline laboratory work should consist of measurement of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, and total bilirubin, but appropriate cutoff levels that predict increased hepatic complications post-HCT are unknown. Children can be at increased risk for veno-occlusive disease compared to adults, with an incidence between 10% and 40%. Risk factors include young age (< 2 years), low body weight, and receipt of a mismatched graft. In heavily transfused patients, estimation of liver iron content can be a more accurate marker of hepatic iron overload and may be used to guide decisions about the utility of pre-HCT chelation.

### Effectiveness and safety of ferric carboxymaltose treatment in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease and other gastrointestinal diseases [^116WdUG3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The rationale for adopting the use of ferric carboxymaltose in our pediatric patients was to avoid poorly tolerated oral iron therapy and permit higher single doses of iron to be administered in shorter time periods with less overall numbers of infusions. The large pool of published clinical data, including studies performed in adult IBD patients, helped support our decision for implementing this product in our clinical practice. Until then we had prescribed oral iron preparations, used intravenous ferrous gluconate - often requiring multiple infusions - or tolerated IDA in our pediatric IBD patients. After having treated patients with FCM for nearly 5 years, we felt it prudent to systematically review the outcomes of this IDA management strategy.

The use of FCM did indeed permit fewer infusions on a per patient basis, with a median of one infusion per patient to deliver 500 mg iron (mean dose was 821 mg iron administered in two infusions). The effectiveness of dosing to correct iron levels was assessed by serum ferritin (providing insight on iron stores), transferrin saturation (providing insight on circulating iron available for use), soluble transferrin receptor and red blood cell parameters. Serum ferritin levels were returned to 'normal' targets by the end of the observation period; however, the transferrin saturation initially increased (at weeks 2–8) to near target ranges, but were then seen to decrease again by week 12 back to near baseline levels. This may reflect immediate iron utilization in the bone marrow, underestimation of total calculated iron deficit and/or ongoing losses which suggest a need for additional iron to avoid recurrent IDA.

CASE DESCRIPTIONS

Existing literature predominantly addresses treatment outcomes in children with IRIDA, while adults have distinct clinical needs and presentations, as illustrated in cases from our iron expertise centre (Figure 2). These cases provide insights into the pathophysiology underlying treatment variability, highlighting the need for individualized approaches in both adults and children.

FIGURE 2
Course of haemoglobin, ferritin and TSAT levels in three female IRIDA patients. The left panels display Hb levels (with CRP for case 3); the right panels show ferritin and TSAT levels. Case 1: Hb and iron metrics over 6 years. This patient initially received IV iron therapy at irregular intervals due to being lost to follow up. At age 26 (6 years post‐diagnosis, time point t = 0), regular IV iron therapy was initiated. Over the subsequent years, she received a cumulative dose of 2500 mg of FCM via five 500 mg infusions, causing a sharp rise in ferritin (> 900 μg/L) and TSAT (up to 25%). Despite persistently high ferritin (> 700 μg/L), Hb only briefly peaked and remained within the lower normal range. Case 2: Hb and iron metrics over 4 years, including two pregnancies (shown by horizontal bars). At diagnosis (t = 0), this 32‐year‐old patient began monthly IV iron therapy. After a cumulative dose of 1700 mg FCM, the patient became pregnant (unaware at last administration). Particularly during the first pregnancy, TSAT remained stable and the Hb decrease was less pronounced than during non‐pregnancy periods. Case 3: Hb, CRP and iron metrics over 20 years. IV iron (totalling 5800 mg FS at 200 mg/dose) was administered every 2 months, maintaining ferritin > 500 μg/L for nearly a decade, with Hb within the reference range. Diagnosis of IRIDA was made at t = 5 when she was 41 years old. Ferritin and TSAT varied widely, likely due to chronic inflammation (CRP ~25 mg/L). In the final years (following t = 15), heavy menstrual bleeding led to a Hb decline, requiring additional IV iron therapy (totalling 1700 mg FCM).

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

Monitoring

Iron overload is a potential risk of IV iron therapy. Our experience suggests that IV iron therapy in IRIDA elevates ferritin levels without significantly affecting TSAT, indicating that iron is primarily stored in the reticuloendothelial system. An increase in TSAT suggests iron redistribution from the reticuloendothelial system to the circulation, signalling that the ferritin set point — the level at which iron becomes available for erythropoiesis and other (parenchymal) tissues — has been reached. While this iron redistribution improves iron availability and haemoglobin levels, it may also result in a decreased erythropoietic iron demand, potentially leading to toxic parenchymal iron overload, necessitating reduced treatment frequency.

Unlike inappropriately low‐hepcidin disorders such as HFE‐hereditary hemochromatosis, where iron accumulates in parenchymal tissues with a higher toxicity risk, IRIDA primarily results in iron overload in the reticuloendothelial macrophages. Although the long‐term effects of such iron accumulation remain unclear, patients with (loss‐of‐function) ferroportin disease, who have similar biochemical profiles, typically do not experience severe complications despite excessive high ferritin levels. Additionally, evidence from CKD patients suggests that excess reticuloendothelial iron, during at least a few years, is well tolerated.

Given the unknown long‐term risks, we recommend checking ferritin, TSAT and haemoglobin before each administration. If TSAT levels rise but the patient remains symptomatic with low haemoglobin requiring therapy, we advise reducing IV iron administration frequency. As IRIDA patients typically cannot achieve TSAT within the reference range due to hepcidin dysregulation, we recommend maintaining TSAT around 15%. In our experience, this percentage allows for sufficient iron availability for erythropoiesis without causing unnecessary excessive iron loading in the reticuloendothelial system. Importantly, the goal is not to normalize haemoglobin, as we cannot exclude that prolonged iron loading in the reticuloendothelial system may pose long‐term risks. Ferritin levels should be kept as low as possible while ensuring acceptable haemoglobin and quality of life.

### Iron refractory iron deficiency anemia [^111qp8Jt]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

Iron refractory iron deficiency anemia is a hereditary recessive anemia due to a defect in the TMPRSS6 gene encoding Matriptase-2. This protein is a transmembrane serine protease that plays an essential role in down-regulating hepcidin, the key regulator of iron homeostasis. Hallmarks of this disease are microcytic hypochromic anemia, low transferrin saturation and normal/high serum hepcidin values. The anemia appears in the post-natal period, although in some cases it is only diagnosed in adulthood. The disease is refractory to oral iron treatment but shows a slow response to intravenous iron injections and partial correction of the anemia. To date, 40 different Matriptase-2 mutations have been reported, affecting all the functional domains of the large ectodomain of the protein. In vitro experiments on transfected cells suggest that Matriptase-2 cleaves Hemojuvelin, a major regulator of hepcidin expression and that this function is altered in this genetic form of anemia. In contrast to the low/undetectable hepcidin levels observed in acquired iron deficiency, in patients with Matriptase-2 deficiency, serum hepcidin is inappropriately high for the low iron status and accounts for the absent/delayed response to oral iron treatment. A challenge for the clinicians and pediatricians is the recognition of the disorder among iron deficiency and other microcytic anemias commonly found in pediatric patients. The current treatment of iron refractory iron deficiency anemia is based on parenteral iron administration; in the future, manipulation of the hepcidin pathway with the aim of suppressing it might become an alternative therapeutic approach.

### Deferoxamine mesylate [^116AYGmm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Treatment of Chronic Iron Overload for Adults and Pediatric Patients

Subcutaneous Infusion Administration

The average daily dose of deferoxamine mesylate for injection is usually between 20 and 60 mg/kg. In general patients with serum ferritin level below 2,000 ng/mL require about 25 mg/kg/day. Patients with serum ferritin level between 2,000 and 3,000 ng/mL require about 35 mg/kg/day. Patients with higher serum ferritin may require up to 55 mg/kg/day. It is not advisable to regularly exceed an average daily dose of 50 mg/kg/day except when very intensive chelation is needed in patients who have completed growth. If ferritin levels fall below 1,000 ng/mL, the risk of deferoxamine mesylate for injection toxicity increases; it is important to monitor these patients particularly carefully and perhaps to consider lowering the total weekly dose. The doses specified here are the average daily doses. Since most patients use deferoxamine mesylate for injection less than 7 days a week, the actual dose per infusion usually differs from the average daily dose; e.g. if an average daily dose of 40 mg/kg/day is required and the patient wears the pump 5 nights a week, each infusion should contain 56 mg/kg.

### AAP reports on diagnosis and prevention of iron deficiency anemia… [^115RPFx3]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Full-term healthy infants have sufficient iron for at least the first four months of life. Because human milk contains little iron, infants who are breastfed exclusively are at risk of iron deficiency after four months of age and should receive 1 mg of supplemental iron daily per kg of body weight. Supplementation should continue until iron-containing foods are introduced in the diet. Starting at four months of age, infants who are breastfed for more than one-half of their feedings should also receive 1 mg of supplemental iron daily per kg of body weight. In formula-fed infants, iron needs can be met for the first 12 months of life by using formula that contains 12 mg of iron per dL and by introducing iron-containing foods after four to six months of age. Whole milk should not be given before 12 months of age. Iron intake in infants between six and 12 months of age should be 11 mg per day. Liquid iron supplements are appropriate if iron needs are not being met.

Iron intake in children one to three years of age should be 7 mg per day. Liquid supplements are suitable in those who do not receive this intake. Chewable multivitamins can be used in children three years and older. Iron intake in preterm infants should be at least 2 mg per day through 12 months of age. Preterm infants who are breastfed should receive 2 mg of supplemental iron per kg of body weight each day by one month of age, and supplementation should continue until the infant is weaned to iron-fortified formula or begins to eat foods that supply 2 mg of iron per kg of body weight. Supplementation is not required in infants who have received an iron load from multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells. Further evaluation is required in children with hemoglobin levels less than 11 g per dL at 12 months of age. If the child is at high dietary risk of iron deficiency, testing should be performed because of potential adverse effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Additional screening tests should include measurement of serum ferritin and C-reactive protein levels, or measurement of reticulocyte hemoglobin concentration. Children with mild anemia who can be monitored closely can be diagnosed by documenting an increase of 1 g per dL in plasma hemoglobin concentration after one month of iron-replacement therapy.

### Diagnosis and prevention of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia in infants and young children (0–3 years of age) [^117YWeTU]. publications.aap.org (2010). Low credibility.

For infants from 7 to 12 months' completed age, the recommended dietary allowance for iron, according to the IOM, is 11 mg/day, which was determined by using a factorial approach. The amount of iron lost, primarily from sloughed epithelial cells from skin and the intestinal and urinary tracts, was added to the amounts of iron required for increased blood volume, increased tissue mass, and storage iron during this period of life. It was noted that the iron needs of infants do not suddenly jump from 0. 27 to 11 mg/day at 6 months of age; this disjuncture is the result of the use of very different methods of determining these values. However, it is clear that healthy, term newborn infants require very little iron early in life compared with the significant amounts of iron required after 6 months of age.

IRON REQUIREMENTS FOR TODDLERS Using a similar factorial approach as described for infants 7 to 12 months' completed age, the IOM determined that the recommended dietary allowance for iron for children from 1 through 3 years of age is 7 mg/day.
9. Thus, a cutoff value of 12 μg/L has been widely used for adults and denotes depletion of iron stores. In children, a cutoff value of 10 μg/L has been suggested. 39 Because SF is an acute-phase reactant, concentrations of SF may be elevated in the presence of chronic inflammation, infection, malignancy, or liver disease, and a simultaneous measurement of C-reactive protein is required to rule out inflammation. PREVENTION OF ID AND IDA Preterm Infants The preterm infant who is fed human milk should receive a supplement of elemental iron at 2 mg/kg per day starting by 1 month of age and extending through 12 months of age.

Thus, it is recommended that exclusively breastfed term infants receive an iron supplementation of 1 mg/kg per day, starting at 4 months of age and continued until appropriate iron-containing complementary foods have been introduced. For partially breastfed infants, the proportion of human milk versus formula is uncertain; therefore, beginning at 4 months of age, infants who receive more than one-half of their daily feedings as human milk and who are not receiving iron-containing complementary foods should also receive 1 mg/kg per day of supplemental iron.
