## Question

should you treat psychiatric symptoms or wait until thyroid is normal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether psychiatric symptoms should be treated concurrently or whether one should wait until thyroid function normalizes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the thyroid status into overt versus subclinical versus biochemically normal, because this will shape the treatment sequence. Then, I should assess the severity and urgency of psychiatric symptoms, since red flags may necessitate immediate concurrent psychiatric care. Next, I will review evidence on brain and symptom reversibility with thyroid normalization in overt dysfunction to estimate timelines and expectations. After that, I need to appraise the evidence for subclinical dysfunction, where waiting for thyroid normalization may not help psychiatric outcomes. I will then consider patients with normal serum tests but persistent symptoms, including the tissue-level T3 hypothesis and combination therapy data, and I must be careful to verify conflicting evidence. I should also review special populations like bipolar disorder and pregnancy, where integrated strategies differ. Finally, I will synthesize a monitoring and decision framework that balances thyroid and psychiatric treatment in parallel when necessary, with attention to autoimmune mechanisms and potential drug interactions.

> Let me first confirm how to categorize thyroid dysfunction because the management hinges on this. Overt hypothyroidism is typically elevated TSH with low FT4, and overt hyperthyroidism is suppressed TSH with elevated FT4, whereas subclinical states have abnormal TSH with normal FT4; central hypothyroidism requires attention when FT4 is low with inappropriately low or normal TSH, and unusual patterns like high FT4 with nonsuppressed TSH warrant evaluation for assay interference, resistance to thyroid hormone, or TSHoma before attributing symptoms to primary thyroid disease, so I need to ensure the biochemical diagnosis is correct before deciding to wait or treat concurrently [^115D3Sp4] [^11385f4o] [^111HXJkK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about deferring psychiatric care; I need to check the immediacy of psychiatric risk. Suicidality, severe mania or psychosis, delirium, or inability to care for self demand immediate psychiatric intervention in parallel with thyroid management because waiting for biochemical euthyroidism can be unsafe; in hyperthyroid crises, psychosis can even herald thyroid storm and in profound hypothyroidism delirium can occur, both requiring urgent endocrine treatment alongside psychiatric stabilization, so delay is inappropriate in these high-risk scenarios [^116BsELq] [^1164rCy4] [^113Yoxta] [^113Pp2KJ] [^117KQdE5].

> Next, I will examine overt thyroid dysfunction where thyroid treatment is primary but I should verify how fast psychiatric and cerebral changes reverse. In untreated overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine over approximately three months abolishes pretreatment cerebral metabolic abnormalities on FDG-PET and significantly reduces psychiatric symptoms, and in hyperthyroidism, antithyroid therapy reverses abnormal brain metabolism as thyroid hormones fall; this supports prioritizing thyroid correction but not withholding psychiatric care when symptoms are severe, with expected psychiatric improvement over weeks to months as euthyroidism is achieved [^115BTGyQ] [^113ZQ4U9] [^1129vyEN]. Let me also confirm targets and timelines: consensus guidance suggests optimizing LT4 to a TSH roughly 0.3–2.0 mIU/L for 3–6 months before judging residual symptoms; therefore, if psychiatric symptoms remain after sustained euthyroidism, specific psychiatric treatment should be escalated rather than waiting further [^1155V2B7].

> For subclinical hypothyroidism, I should double-check whether waiting for thyroid normalization helps mood; the evidence indicates it generally does not. High-quality guidelines and meta-analyses show no clinically meaningful improvement in depressive symptoms, quality of life, or cognitive outcomes with levothyroxine when TSH is mildly elevated with normal FT4, so psychiatric symptoms should be treated directly without delay while monitoring the thyroid, and many mild TSH elevations normalize spontaneously on retesting after a few months, reducing the rationale to wait for thyroid-directed effects on mood [^114LBMH9] [^116E5fuv]. Hmm, wait a minute, in older adults with depression, the yield of attributing depression to borderline TSH is low, and severity does not track with mildly elevated TSH, cautioning me not to defer psychiatric care based on marginal thyroid abnormalities; shared autoimmune biology, rather than thyroid hormones per se, likely explains part of the comorbidity, again arguing against waiting for thyroid normalization in subclinical states [^113oqqB2] [^112Sj9sM] [^113XpJjG] [^113XpJjG].

> But what if thyroid labs are "normal" and psychiatric symptoms persist; let me consider the low tissue T3 hypothesis and combination therapy data. A subset of LT4-treated patients remain symptomatic despite normal TSH, and hypotheses include tissue-specific T3 deficiency and autoimmune neuroinflammation; optimizing LT4 into the lower-normal TSH range for a few months is reasonable before concluding persistent psychiatric illness, but I need to be cautious about overpromising T4+T3 benefits [^111jJi9V] [^111bFDq8] [^1155V2B7]. Wait, let me verify the combination therapy evidence: one systematic review claimed improved mental health yet also reports no significant benefit on quality of life or depressive symptoms, and the pivotal randomized trial showed no mood advantage for adding T3, consistent with guidelines advising against routine combination therapy; so if I initially thought combined therapy "improves mental health", I should correct that interpretation and note that routine T3 augmentation is not supported for depressive symptoms in most patients, reserving specialist-guided trials for carefully selected, refractory cases after optimizing LT4 and excluding other causes [^114QkmHB] [^1114yr6n] [^116zs8V6].

> I will now examine special populations where integration is particularly important. In bipolar disorder, lower pretreatment thyroid function predicts slower antidepressant response and lithium increases hypothyroidism risk, especially in women; therefore, I should proactively optimize thyroid function and monitor more frequently, and in selected refractory bipolar depression, adjunctive supraphysiologic LT4 has signal of benefit in women, so more aggressive concurrent thyroid optimization or augmentation may be reasonable rather than sequential waiting, with careful safety monitoring [^115srRjp] [^116afznd] [^1164uikN] [^113aFZFC] [^111uUiyv]. In pregnancy or preconception, I need to ensure TSH targets are tighter and psychiatric symptoms must be addressed promptly due to maternal-fetal risk; aiming for TSH less than 2.5 mIU/L while treating mood disorders without delay is recommended [^114czVEz].

> Next, I should review the autoimmune and inflammatory component because this affects expectations. Strong genetic correlations between thyroid disease and depression and anxiety localize to immune-related regions, suggesting that for some patients psychiatric symptoms will not fully remit with thyroid normalization alone; therefore, I should not wait on thyroid treatment to rescue psychiatric symptoms when they are clinically significant, and I must treat mood and anxiety disorders on their own merits while also managing thyroid autoimmunity appropriately [^112Sj9sM] [^115BTGyQ] [^114aPam9] [^113XpJjG].

> I need to ensure monitoring is structured and that I do not miss confounders. Thyroid function should be checked every 6–8 weeks after dose changes until stable, then periodically, while psychiatric symptoms are tracked with validated scales such as GHQ-12 or depression inventories; drug interactions matter, as SSRIs can modestly reduce T3 and T4 within the euthyroid range, and lithium elevates hypothyroidism risk and mandates more frequent thyroid monitoring, so I must double-check medications before attributing symptoms solely to thyroid status [^111HXJkK] [^1117ghQJ] [^112XSKE8] [^116afznd] [^1164uikN]. But wait, if biochemistry and symptoms are discordant, I should reconsider central hypothyroidism or rare causes with abnormal patterns like raised FT4 with nonsuppressed TSH, and correct any assay interferences before making treatment decisions that would delay necessary psychiatric care [^115D3Sp4] [^11385f4o].

> Putting this together, I should confirm that we do not wait for thyroid normalization when psychiatric symptoms are severe or functionally dangerous; we treat psychiatric symptoms concurrently while initiating thyroid therapy in overt dysfunction, expecting improvement over weeks to months with euthyroidism, but not relying on thyroid treatment alone to resolve psychiatric illness, particularly in subclinical dysfunction where thyroid hormones generally do not improve mood or quality of life; conversely, when psychiatric symptoms are mild and attributable to overt thyroid disease, a short period focused on thyroid correction with close monitoring is reasonable, escalating psychiatric treatment if symptoms persist after 3–6 months of stable euthyroidism or at any point if risk emerges [^1129vyEN] [^113ZQ4U9] [^1155V2B7] [^114LBMH9] [^113oqqB2]. Hold on, I should verify one more point: normalizing TSH does not guarantee psychiatric recovery, especially given autoimmune contributions and the limited efficacy of T3 augmentation in most contexts, so parallel, patient-tailored care is the safest, evidence-aligned approach rather than sequential waiting for thyroid labs to normalize before addressing psychiatric needs [^112Sj9sM] [^1114yr6n] [^116zs8V6].

Treat psychiatric symptoms **concurrently with thyroid normalization** when symptoms are severe or disabling [^112Sj9sM], as thyroid correction alone [^1129vyEN] may not fully resolve psychiatric issues [^111jJi9V] and delays can worsen outcomes. For **mild symptoms**, monitor closely during thyroid treatment and add psychiatric treatment if symptoms persist once euthyroidism is achieved [^114LBMH9] [^111bFDq8]. Always screen for thyroid dysfunction in new psychiatric presentations and coordinate endocrine and psychiatric care [^115BTGyQ].

---

## Clinical evidence on psychiatric symptom resolution with thyroid normalization

- **Hypothyroidism and psychiatric symptoms**: Hypothyroidism is linked to depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and psychosis; thyroid hormone replacement often improves these symptoms, but not always completely [^1129vyEN].

- **Hyperthyroidism and psychiatric symptoms**: Hyperthyroidism is associated with anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and psychosis; antithyroid therapy can improve these symptoms, but some may persist [^113ZQ4U9].

- **Persistent symptoms despite thyroid normalization**: A significant minority report ongoing psychiatric symptoms despite biochemical euthyroidism [^111jJi9V] [^1117ghQJ], suggesting additional psychiatric treatment is often needed [^111bFDq8].

---

## Risks of delaying psychiatric treatment until thyroid normalization

Delaying psychiatric care can exacerbate symptoms, reduce quality of life [^111jJi9V], and **increase suicide risk**. Even after thyroid function normalizes, untreated psychiatric symptoms can cause substantial functional impairment and delay recovery, prolonging suffering [^111bFDq8].

---

## Benefits of concurrent psychiatric and thyroid treatment

Concurrent management can provide faster symptom relief and **improve quality of life** [^111jJi9V]. Treating psychiatric symptoms in parallel may enhance adherence to thyroid therapy and deliver comprehensive, coordinated care.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Screening and diagnosis**: Always screen for thyroid dysfunction in new psychiatric presentations [^115BTGyQ].

- **Initial thyroid treatment**: Start thyroid hormone replacement or antithyroid therapy promptly when indicated [^1117tFt3] [^116BsELq].

- **Concurrent psychiatric treatment**: Begin psychiatric treatment concurrently if symptoms are severe or disabling.

- **Monitoring and adjustment**: Monitor closely and adjust psychiatric treatment as thyroid function normalizes.

- **Persistent symptoms**: If symptoms persist after euthyroidism, continue or initiate psychiatric treatment [^111bFDq8].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| Severe psychiatric symptoms (e.g. psychosis, severe depression) | Treat concurrently with thyroid normalization |
| Mild psychiatric symptoms (e.g. mild anxiety, mild depression) | - Monitor during thyroid treatment <br/> - Add psychiatric treatment if symptoms persist [^114LBMH9] |
| Persistent psychiatric symptoms after thyroid normalization | Initiate or continue psychiatric treatment [^111bFDq8] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Treat psychiatric symptoms **concurrently with thyroid normalization** when symptoms are severe or disabling [^111jJi9V]. For mild symptoms, monitor during thyroid treatment and add psychiatric treatment if symptoms persist once euthyroidism is achieved [^114LBMH9]. Always screen for thyroid dysfunction in new psychiatric presentations and coordinate endocrine and psychiatric care for optimal outcomes [^115BTGyQ]. Concurrent treatment is **often necessary** because thyroid correction alone may not fully resolve psychiatric symptoms [^1129vyEN] [^111bFDq8], and delays can worsen outcomes.

### The enigma of persistent symptoms in hypothyroid patients treated with levothyroxine: A narrative review [^111bFDq8]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Low credibility.

A significant minority of patients with hypothyroidism report persistent symptoms despite achieving normal thyroid biochemistry after levothyroxine (L-T4) replacement. Four principal lines of thinking, which are not mutually exclusive, may explain this enigma:

- **Low tissue liothyronine hypothesis**: This emphasizes the potential imperfections of L-T4 replacement therapy that may result in hypothyroidism in some tissues, such as the brain, while others (e.g. hypothalamus) are euthyroid.

- **Somatic symptom and related disorders hypothesis**: This draws attention to an incidental coexistence of a diagnosis of somatic symptom and related disorders in patients with treated hypothyroidism.

- **Autoimmune neuroinflammation hypothesis**: This highlights the potential consequences of inflammatory mediators due to thyroid autoimmunity (the most common cause of hypothyroidism) on the brain.

- **Comorbidities and psychosocial hypothesis**: This implicates a variety of physical and psychosocial factors that have been noted to be associated with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, which may primarily cause persistent complaints.

Over the past twenty years, significant time and effort have been expended pursuing the 'low tissue liothyronine hypothesis', which has failed to yield results that translate to patient benefits. This has skewed the balance in clinical practice in favor of pursuing answers relating to L-T4 and liothyronine combination treatment, while the alternative explanations have been downplayed and potentially useful interventions have been given insufficient attention.

### Brain glucose metabolism in hypothyroidism: A positron emission tomography study before and after thyroid hormone replacement therapy [^1129vyEN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is frequently associated with subtle behavioral and psychiatric symptoms, and the consequences of inadequate thyroid hormone availability to brain metabolism are poorly understood. This study assessed the relationships between neuropsychiatric symptoms and changes in relative regional cerebral glucose metabolism in hypothyroid patients undergoing thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

- **Design, setting, and outcome measure**: Relative regional cerebral glucose metabolism was compared in 13 previously untreated hypothyroid patients and 10 healthy control participants. Effects of thyroid hormone replacement therapy (levothyroxine, 3 months) were assessed using neuropsychiatric measures and positron emission tomography with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose.

- **Results**: Before treatment, hypothyroid patients exhibited lower regional activity than control subjects in the bilateral amygdala, hippocampus, perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left subgenual ACC, and right posterior cingulate cortex. The severity of depressive symptoms covaried negatively with pretreatment activity in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus and right subgenual and dorsal ACC. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy abolished pretreatment group differences in regional activity, robustly increased activity in the ventral ACC, and significantly reduced both clinician-rated and self-rated behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. Increased activity within the ventral ACC was associated with reduced somatic complaints, whereas increased activity within the dorsal ACC was associated with reduced severity of symptoms.

### Reversible changes in brain glucose metabolism following thyroid function normalization in hyperthyroidism [^113ZQ4U9]. AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with hyperthyroidism frequently present with regional cerebral metabolic changes, but the consequences of endocrine-induced brain changes after thyroid function normalization are unclear. We hypothesized that the changes in regional cerebral glucose metabolism are related to thyroid hormone levels in patients with hyperthyroidism, and some of these changes can be reversed with antithyroid therapy.

- **Materials and methods**: Relative regional cerebral glucose metabolism was compared between 10 new-onset untreated patients with hyperthyroidism and 20 healthy control participants using brain FDG-PET scans. Levels of emotional distress were evaluated using the SAS and SDS. Patients were treated with methimazole. A follow-up PET scan was performed to assess metabolic changes of the brain when thyroid functions normalized.

- **Results**: Compared with controls, patients exhibited lower activity in the limbic system, frontal lobes, and temporal lobes before antithyroid treatment. There were positive correlations between scores of depression and regional metabolism in the cingulate and paracentral lobule. The severity of depression and anxiety covaried negatively with pretreatment activity in the inferior temporal and inferior parietal gyri, respectively. Compared with the hyperthyroid status, patients with normalized thyroid functions showed increased metabolism in the left parahippocampal, fusiform, and right superior frontal gyri. The decrease in both FT3 and FT4 was associated with increased activity in the left parahippocampal and right superior frontal gyri.

### Psychological well-being in patients on 'adequate' doses of l-thyroxine: Results of a large, controlled community-based questionnaire study [^1117ghQJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

Over 1% of the UK population is receiving thyroid hormone replacement with l-thyroxine (T4). However, many patients complain of persistent lethargy and related symptoms on T4 even with normal TSH levels. At the time of writing, there has been no large study to determine whether this is related to thyroxine replacement or coincidental psychological morbidity. We have therefore attempted to address this issue using a large, community-based study.

- **Design and patients**: Computerized prescribing records of five general practices were used to identify 961 patients who had been on thyroxine for a minimum of four months from a population of 63,000 (1.5%), along with age- and sex-matched controls. All 1,922 individuals were sent a two-page questionnaire, made up of the short form of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), designed to detect minor psychiatric disorders in the community, and a 12-question 'thyroid symptom questionnaire' (TSQ) in the same format. A covering letter explained that we were interested in 'how patients felt on medication' and made no direct reference to thyroxine.

- **Measurements**: Scores from the GHQ and TSQ were marked for each individual using the GHQ and Likert scoring methods. Patients' latest TSH measurements were obtained from laboratory records. Comparisons were then made on scores for the total GHQ-12, TSQ and individual questions between patients (P) and control (C) groups. Separate analyses were made comparing the patients with a normal TSH (nP) and the control group.

- **Results**: Five hundred and ninety-seven (62%) of the patients (P) and 551 (57%) of the control group (C) completed the questionnaires.

### How does thyroid hormone profile differ on and off replacement treatment [^116MtbCY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is estimated to affect around 3% of the population in Europe and is more common in certain groups such as females and older adults. Clinically, hypothyroidism presents with symptoms such as cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Biochemically, it is diagnosed through measurement of thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), with increased TSH and decreased FT4 being the typical pattern seen in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Additionally, there is a subset of the population with high TSH levels but normal FT4 and no or minimal symptoms; this is known as subclinical hypothyroidism.

The most prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, which is converted into the more metabolically active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), by deiodinases within the body. LT4 is a widely prescribed drug, with 33.8 million prescriptions in the UK alone in 2022. Other thyroid hormone treatments, such as natural desiccated thyroid (NDT) and liothyronine (LT3), are available but used much less commonly in modern practice.

The ideal therapeutic goal in hypothyroidism is to restore clinical and biochemical euthyroidism via physiologic thyroid hormone replacement. This concept may seem straightforward, but there are subtleties that have only recently been recognized. In the majority of patients, LT4 treatment will normalize TSH levels and lead to symptom resolution. However, it is estimated that around 5%–15% of patients taking LT4 still experience symptoms.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^1117tFt3]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a highly prevalent global health problem that can substantially affect patients' wellbeing. Lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone (replacement therapy) is needed when the diagnosis of persistent thyroid hormone deficiency is confirmed; consequently, levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in Western countries, and this is likely to increase further in the foreseeable future.

Long-term adverse health outcomes in patients with thyroid dysfunction and treatment targets to optimize these outcomes, generally monitored by serial measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), have been extensively investigated. In particular, the cardiovascular effect of thyroid dysfunction and the negative ramifications of clinical (overt) thyroid hypofunction, mediated by changes in systemic vascular resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis, are well documented. One of the targets for treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is to reverse such adverse effects. Guidelines in Europe and the US recommend that replacement therapy should be aimed at resolving symptoms and achieving "normalization" of TSH. However, no specific optimal target for TSH exists in the context of thyroid hormone replacement. This uncertainty is reflected in the guidelines proposed by the American Thyroid Association Task Force and the statement issued by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee, which suggest a wide range for TSH, 0.4–4.0 mIU/L, as an indication for optimal replacement.

### Medical monitoring in patients with bipolar disorder: Clinical recommendations [^117EVfzB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Treatments for bipolar disorder can increase the risk for thyroid dysfunction, weight gain, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Because of these risks, a planned regimen of patient monitoring is recommended to track health concerns such as fluctuations in thyroid levels, weight, blood pressure, glucose levels, and lipid profile. Different health tests are needed depending on the type of medication the patient is prescribed.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^1147HkMT]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

For a broader definition of thyroid disease patients, and especially to include those who never received in-patient treatment and were diagnosed by general practitioners, we utilized self-reported diagnoses in the U.K. Biobank (data field 20002). We further referenced the self-reported medication field (data field 20003), which records medications that individuals were actively taking during their verbal interview with the U.K. Biobank. For hypothyroidism, medication codes considered included levothyroxine sodium (1141191044), thyroxine sodium (1140874852), thyroxine product (1140884516), and sodium thyroxine (1140910814). For hyperthyroidism, we accounted for carbimazole (1140874866), propylthiouracil (1140874776), and propylthiouracil product (1141157288).

We considered three common psychiatric disorders in this work: MDD, BIP, and ANX. These phenotypes were extracted from various data fields and questionnaires similar to previous studies. To select MDD subjects, we combined data fields 2090 and 2100: individuals seen by a doctor (GP) or psychiatrist for nerves, anxiety, tension, or depression, and in-patient ICD-10 codes (data field 41202).

For ANX, data field 20544 was used, which corresponds to mental health problems ever diagnosed by a professional. It included codes for social anxiety or social phobia, any other phobia (e.g. disabling fear of heights or spiders), panic attacks, anxiety, nerves, generalized ANX, and agoraphobia. Utilizing the same data field, subjects were excluded from the anxiety group if they reported schizophrenia, mania, hypomania, bipolar or manic-depression, Asperger's syndrome, or autism spectrum disorders.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

After excluding confounding causes such as measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities, or drug therapies, genuinely raised circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired condition (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma). Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different heterozygous mutations (approximately 230 known) in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence of 2.8 per million than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients and the magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations do not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing for RTHβ and pituitary imaging for TSHoma should readily differentiate these entities, several issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ, and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^115em58w]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

There remains a significant knowledge gap regarding whether the observed associations between (minor or overt) thyroid abnormalities and psychiatric diseases are directly mediated through thyroid hormones (TH) or not. This is clinically relevant because understanding the complex interactions between thyroid status, autoimmunity, and psychiatric disorders is necessary for making treatment recommendations to prevent or treat coinciding psychiatric disorders in a patient with mild thyroid dysfunction or vice versa.

- **In the context of complex interactions**: It is noteworthy that an estimated 60–70% of the interindividual variation in thyroid function is determined by genetic factors. In addition to a direct genetic relationship between thyroid function and psychiatric disorders, various studies have suggested that genetic factors play an important role in various other autoimmune diseases, as well as psychiatric disorders.

In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been particularly successful in identifying the genetic determinants of thyroid function and, more recently, of psychiatric disorders. With the availability of these data, this is the optimal moment to investigate the role of common genetic variants in the complex relationships between thyroid function, autoimmunity, and common psychiatric diseases. Doing so could help understand whether the well-known clinical comorbidity between thyroid diseases and psychiatric disorders is specifically driven by THs or has a more general autoimmune-related basis.

### Evaluation of thyroid function monitoring in people treated with lithium: Advice based on real-world data [^1164uikN]. Bipolar Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Blood test monitoring is essential for the management of lithium treatment, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance recommends 6-monthly serum testing of thyroid function. We examined conformity to these guidelines and the impact of monitoring outside these intervals.

- **Methods**: We extracted serum lithium and thyroid hormone results at one center between January 2009 and December 2020. We identified 266 patients who started lithium during this period with no history of thyroid abnormality within the previous 2 years and were at risk of developing thyroid abnormalities. We examined the interval between tests, the time between the onset of lithium testing and the first thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) outside the laboratory reference range and assessed the impact of testing outside the recommended 6-monthly intervals.

- **Results**: The most common testing frequency was 3 months (± 1 month), accounting for 17.3% of test intervals. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that most thyroid dysfunction manifests within 3 years (proportion with abnormal TSH at 3 years = 91.4%, 19.9% of total patients). In the first 3 months after commencing lithium therapy, eight patients developed subclinical hypothyroidism and had clinical follow-up data available. Of these, half spontaneously normalized without clinical intervention. In the remaining patients, thyroxine replacement was only initiated after multiple occasions of subclinical hypothyroidism (median = 2 years after initiating lithium, range: 6 months to 3 years).

Conclusion

The peak interval at 3 months suggests that thyroid function monitoring in lithium-treated patients may require more frequent assessment to prevent or manage thyroid abnormalities effectively.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^116BsELq]. Thyroid (2016). High credibility.

In the medical management of thyroid storm, particularly concerning pharmacotherapy, the 2016 ATA guidelines recommend administering a propylthiouracil loading dose of 500–1,000 mg orally, followed by 200 mg every four hours for patients experiencing a thyroid storm. Intravenous administration should be considered.

### Does a combination regimen of thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine improve depressive symptoms better than T4 alone in patients with hypothyroidism? Results of a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial [^1114yr6n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Some hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine replacement therapy complain of depressive symptoms despite normal TSH measurements. It is not known whether adding T(3) can reverse such symptoms. We randomized 40 individuals with depressive symptoms who were taking a stable dose of levothyroxine for the treatment of hypothyroidism (excluding those who underwent thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid) to receive T(4) plus placebo or the combination of T(4) plus T(3) in a double-blind manner for 15 weeks. Participants receiving combination therapy had their prestudy dose of T(4) reduced by 50%, and T(3) was initiated at a dose of 12.5 micrograms, twice daily. T(4) and T(3) doses were adjusted to maintain TSH concentrations within the normal range. Compared with the group taking T(4) alone, the group taking both T(4) and T(3) did not report any improvement in self-rated mood and well-being scores. These scores included all subscales of the Symptom Check-List-90, the Comprehensive Epidemiological Screen for Depression, and the Multiple Outcome Study. The P-value was greater than 0.05 for all indexes. In conclusion, the data do not support the routine use of combined T(3) and T(4) therapy in hypothyroid patients with depressive symptoms.

### Supraphysiologic doses of levothyroxine as adjunctive therapy in bipolar depression: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111uUiyv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Suboptimal availability of circulating thyroid hormones may contribute to the high rate of treatment failures in bipolar disorder. This study tested the efficacy of adjunctive treatment with supraphysiologic doses of levothyroxine in patients with bipolar depression and hypothesized that women would display a better outcome compared to men.

The study was a multicenter, 6-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled fixed-dose (300 μg/d) trial conducted from 2004 to 2009. Its aims were to assess the efficacy and tolerability of levothyroxine as an adjunct to ongoing treatment with mood stabilizers and/or antidepressant medication for patients with bipolar I or II disorder, who were currently depressed (DSM-IV). It also sought to investigate gender differences in treatment response. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score.

A total of 74 patients were enrolled in the study, and 62 were randomized (35 with bipolar I; mean age = 44.9 years). The mean change in HDRS score from randomization to week 6 was larger in the levothyroxine group compared to the placebo group, with a 2.7-point difference (decline of -7.8 [38.3%] vs. -5.1 [25.5%]; last-observation-carried-forward analysis). The course of HDRS scores over time from randomization to week 6 was significantly different between groups at week 4 (P = 0.046) but not at the end of the placebo-controlled phase (P = 0.198). The secondary analysis of women (n = 32) revealed a significant difference between groups in mean change in HDRS score (-16.6% placebo vs. -42.4% levothyroxine, P = 0.018).

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^113eJzW1]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Large-scale administrative claims data provide the opportunity to obtain estimates of adverse medication effects in large populations across a range of geographical regions in "real-world" health care settings and often over long periods of exposure. Such data capture a substantial amount of heterogeneity in disease severity and treatment response over the disease course, whereas most clinical trials enroll a homogeneous cohort followed over relatively short time periods.

Advantages of claims data, however, can be offset by their observational nature and inconsistency in collection, coding, and recording. Treatment biases and confounding factors require specific attention and have been addressed in our analyses.

The objective of this study was to determine the comparative risk of hypothyroidism with lithium monotherapy versus eight of the most commonly prescribed anticonvulsants and second-generation antipsychotics used to treat patients with bipolar disorder. The study is innovative in that it comprehensively utilizes medical claims data on over a million patients with bipolar disorder in a competing risk survival analysis framework. It is also the first to compare all of the above-mentioned therapies head-to-head in a single study.

### Cognitive and neuropsychiatric aspects of subclinical hypothyroidism: Significance in the elderly [^112DSk7r]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

The effects of overt hypothyroidism (HO) on cognition and mood are well established, and HO is considered a common cause of reversible dementia. There is now increasing evidence to suggest that subclinical hypothyroidism (i.e. elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone in the presence of normal thyroxine concentrations) may be a predisposing factor for depression, cognitive impairment, and dementia. Subclinical hypothyroidism is more common than HO and is most prevalent in the elderly, particularly in women.

Older adults may be more vulnerable to the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism, given age-related changes to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. There is an association between thyroid status and cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly. The purpose of this review is to summarize existing data on the cognitive and neuropsychiatric consequences of subclinical hypothyroidism, benefits of treatment, and recommendations for screening and monitoring in older adults.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^112Sj9sM]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

The hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis coordinates brain development and postdevelopmental function. Thyroid hormone (TH) variations, even within the normal range, have been associated with the risk of developing common psychiatric disorders, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

- **Methods**: To gain new insight into the potentially shared mechanisms underlying thyroid dysfunction and psychiatric disorders, we performed a comprehensive analysis of multiple phenotypic and genotypic databases. We investigated the relationship of thyroid disorders with depression, bipolar disorder (BIP), and anxiety disorders (ANX) in 497,726 subjects from the U.K. Biobank. We subsequently examined genetic correlations between thyroid disorders, thyrotropin (TSH), and free thyroxine (fT4) levels, with genome-wide factors that predispose individuals to psychiatric disorders. Finally, the observed global genetic correlations were pinpointed to specific local genomic regions.

- **Results**: Hypothyroidism was positively associated with an increased risk of major depressive disorder (MDD; OR = 1.31, p = 5.29×10⁻⁸⁹), BIP (OR = 1.55, p = 0.0038), and ANX (OR = 1.16, p = 6.22×10⁻⁸). Hyperthyroidism was associated with MDD (OR = 1.11, p = 0.0034) and ANX (OR = 1.34, p = 5.99×10⁻⁶). Genetically, strong coheritability was observed between thyroid disease and both major depressive disorders (rᵍ = 0.17, p = 2.7×10⁻⁴) and ANX (rᵍ = 0.17, p = 6.7×10⁻⁶). This genetic correlation was particularly strong at the major histocompatibility complex locus on chromosome 6 (p < 10⁻⁵).

### Thyroid hormones and illness [^112Zc8Kp]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

To review illness-associated changes in thyroid hormone levels with respect to the alterations in metabolism, regulation, and transport of thyroid hormones present in such a setting, we summarize normal pituitary-thyroid function and categorize the types of changes that have been noted during illness. In addition, we examine studies that have addressed the metabolic status of patients with low thyroid hormone levels and the potential utility of thyroid hormone treatment in severely ill patients.

The finding of altered thyroid hormone levels in hospitalized patients confirms the participation of these factors in the adaptive response to illness. Thyroid hormone alterations that occur during illness can be classified into three categories:

1. Decreased production of triiodothyronine.
2. Decreased serum binding of thyroid hormones.
3. Decreased secretion of thyrotropin.

Study of these hormonal changes has provided insight into normal thyroid hormone regulation and metabolism as well as into neuroendocrine adaptations to illness.

It seems reasonable to conclude that illness-associated changes in thyroid hormone levels are generally beneficial to the patient as a whole; however, the possibility of concomitant regional or individual tissue hypothyroidism exists. Conclusions about the potential utility of pharmacologic administration of triiodothyronine in selected diseases and clinical settings must await additional clinical trials. Finally, the predictable occurrence of altered thyroid hormone levels in hospitalized patients is noteworthy.

### Combination treatment with T4 and T3: Toward personalized replacement therapy in hypothyroidism [^114dAJph]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy is the traditional lifelong replacement therapy for hypothyroid patients. In recent years, new evidence has prompted clinicians to consider combined T3 and T4 treatment to improve quality of life, cognition, and peripheral parameters of thyroid hormone action in hypothyroidism. This review aims to assess the physiological basis and the results of studies on this topic.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We searched Medline for reports published with the following search terms:
	- **Condition and treatments**: hypothyroidism, levothyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroid, treatment
	- **Related guidelines and parameters**: guidelines, deiodinases, clinical symptoms, quality of life, cognition
	- **Psychosocial factors**: mood, depression, patient preference for combined therapy
	- **Physical and biochemical markers**: body weight, heart rate, cholesterol, bone markers, SHBG

	The search was restricted to reports published in English since 1970, though some reports published before 1970 were also included. We supplemented the search with records from personal files and references of relevant articles and textbooks. Parameters analyzed included the rationale for combination treatment, the type of patients to be selected, the optimal T4/T3 ratio, and the potential benefits of this therapy on symptoms of hypothyroidism, quality of life, mood, cognition, and peripheral parameters of thyroid hormone action.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The outcome of our analysis suggests that it may be time to consider a personalized regimen of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in hypothyroid patients.

- **Conclusions**: Further prospective randomized controlled studies are needed.

### Paradigm shifts in thyroid hormone replacement therapies for hypothyroidism [^116td1M6]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Impaired psychological well-being, depression, or anxiety are observed in 5–10% of hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine, despite normal TSH levels. Such complaints might hypothetically be related to increased free T₄ and decreased free T₃ serum concentrations, which result in the abnormally low free T₄:free T₃ ratios observed in 30% of patients on levothyroxine. Evidence is mounting that levothyroxine monotherapy cannot assure a euthyroid state in all tissues simultaneously and that normal serum TSH levels in patients receiving levothyroxine reflect pituitary euthyroidism alone.

Levothyroxine plus liothyronine combination therapy is gaining popularity. Although the evidence suggests it is generally not superior to levothyroxine monotherapy, some of the 14 published trials definitely preferred this combination and associated it with improved metabolic profiles. Disappointing results with combination therapy could be related to the use of inappropriate levothyroxine and liothyronine doses, resulting in abnormal serum free T₄:free T₃ ratios. Alternatively, its potential benefit might be confined to patients with specific genetic polymorphisms in thyroid hormone transporters and deiodinases that affect the intracellular levels of T₃ available for binding to T₃ receptors.

Levothyroxine monotherapy remains the standard treatment for hypothyroidism. However, in selected patients, new guidelines suggest that experimental combination therapy might be considered.

### Gender differences in thyroid system function: Relevance to bipolar disorder and its treatment [^112QDf5f]. Bipolar Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormones play a critical role in the functioning of the adult brain, and thyroid diseases impair both mood and cognition. This paper reviews gender differences in thyroid system function that are relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: The study comprised a comprehensive literature review of gender differences in thyroid disease that are pertinent to mood disorders.

- **Results**: The prevalence of thyroid disease was found to be much higher in females than males and to increase with age. The most commonly detected abnormality was subclinical hypothyroidism, which was found to occur in up to 20% of postmenopausal women. Females also had higher rates of thyroid autoimmunity. Individuals at risk for thyroid disease, such as adult females, may have had less ability to compensate for additional challenges to thyroid metabolism, including lithium treatment. Thyroid abnormalities were associated with a poorer response to standard treatments for mood disorders. Females with treatment-resistant mood disorders may have responded better than males to adjunctive therapy with thyroid hormones.

- **Conclusions**: Disturbances of thyroid system function, which occur commonly in females, may complicate the diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders. In particular, this is clinically relevant during lithium treatment because lithium may impair vital thyroid metabolic pathways secondary to its anti-thyroid activity.

### Acute delirium in the setting of primary hypothyroidism: The role of thyroid hormone replacement therapy [^113Pp2KJ]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Psychiatric illness, mostly mania and psychosis, is reported to occur after the rapid normalization of thyroid function in patients with primary hypothyroidism. It is generally believed that the gradual restoration of thyroid function may reduce the risk of psychiatric complications. This case report describes the occurrence of acute delirium in a 67-year-old man with primary hypothyroidism shortly after the initiation of thyroid hormone replacement. The use of low-dose thyroxine initially, and persistent severe biochemical hypothyroidism on presentation with psychiatric symptoms, illustrate that psychiatric illness can still occur despite unaggressive thyroid hormone replacement. A temporal relationship with the initiation of thyroxine and rapid recovery of mental state over 1 to 2 weeks differentiates this condition from hypothyroidism-related psychopathology, which tends to have a more prolonged course.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^116ptV67]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by episodes of mania, hypomania, and depression, occurring in about 2% of the population. While acute episodes can be dramatic and require hospitalization, successful treatment rests on the effective prevention of recurrences and residual symptoms.

Lithium has been a cornerstone of the treatment of acute mania and the prevention of mood episodes during the maintenance phase of the disease. Despite its narrow therapeutic range, which requires careful monitoring of drug serum levels, lithium has proven effective in 30–50% of patients, particularly in those with a family history of BD, with non-rapid cycling BD, and without comorbid substance use disorders. Lithium appears to have neuroprotective properties and reduces suicidal behavior. However, potentially severe side effects have also been reported, including hypothyroidism, particularly in middle-aged women, for whom rates as high as 37% have been reported. The link between hypothyroidism and lithium treatment has been supported by case reports and other observational studies as reflected in a recent meta-analysis. These anticipated adverse effects have led to recommendations for frequent thyroid testing of patients treated with lithium as reflected in recent UpToDate guidelines, despite some negative findings.

Guidelines for lithium treatment in patients with BD recommend thyroid function studies prior to treatment, once or twice during the first six months of therapy, and…

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thyroid disease in pregnancy, specifically in relation to thyroid function tests, the ATA 2017 guidelines recommend measuring serum TSH before conception in patients treated with levothyroxine and planning pregnancy. It is advised to adjust the levothyroxine dose to achieve a TSH level of less than 2.5 mU/L.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QkmHB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Our meta-analysis assessed the effects of combined T4 + T3 therapy versus T4 monotherapy on psychological and quality-of-life measures across different studies, examining TSQ-36, GHQ-28, and BDI scores. The analysis showed no significant impact on quality of life, as measured by TSQ-36 scores, with a mean difference of 0.27 (95% CI: -1.34 to 1.88) among 370 participants, suggesting that combined therapy does not significantly enhance quality of life compared to monotherapy. Additionally, the analysis showed no significant impact on mental health and well-being with combined therapy, as GHQ-28 scores among 280 participants revealed a mean difference of 1.71 (95% CI: -1.82 to 5.23), with a highly significant effect and no heterogeneity, pointing to a reliable benefit in mental health. However, depressive symptoms measured by BDI scores in 170 participants showed no significant changes (mean difference: -0.39, 95% CI: -2.41 to 1.62), confirming that combined T4 + T3 therapy does not significantly affect depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that while combined T4 + T3 therapy significantly improves mental health, it does not have a marked impact on overall quality of life or depressive symptoms compared to T4 monotherapy.

The risk of bias within the included studies was systematically evaluated across seven key domains, as shown in the Risk of Bias Summary. Most studies exhibited a low risk of bias in random sequence generation and allocation.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^116afznd]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Thyroid abnormalities in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) have been linked to lithium treatment for decades, yet other drugs have been less well studied. Our objective was to compare hypothyroidism risk for lithium versus the anticonvulsants and second-generation antipsychotics commonly prescribed for BD. Administrative claims data on 24,574 patients with BD were analyzed with competing risk survival analysis. Inclusion criteria were (i) one year of no prior hypothyroid diagnosis nor BD drug treatment, (ii) followed by at least one thyroid test during BD monotherapy on lithium carbonate, mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, or carbamazepine) or antipsychotics (aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine). The outcome was cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism per drug, in the presence of the competing risk of ending monotherapy, adjusted for age, sex, physician visits, and thyroid tests.

Adjusting for covariates, the four-year cumulative risk of hypothyroidism for lithium (8.8%) was 1.39-fold that of the lowest risk therapy, oxcarbazepine (6.3%). Lithium was non-statistically significantly different from quetiapine. While lithium conferred a higher risk when compared to all other treatments combined as a group, hypothyroidism risk error bars overlapped for all drugs. Treatment (p = 3.86e-3), age (p = 6.91e-10), sex (p = 3.93e-7), and thyroid testing (p = 2.79e-87) affected risk. Patients taking lithium were tested for hypothyroidism 2.26–3.05 times more frequently than those on other treatments.

### Effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on thyroid function in depressed patients with primary hypothyroidism or normal thyroid function [^112XSKE8]. Thyroid (2009). Low credibility.

Several studies with ambiguous results have examined the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on thyroid function. This study aimed to establish the effects of fluoxetine and sertraline treatments on thyroid function and thyroid autoimmunity in patients with major depression and primary hypothyroidism and in patients with major depression and normal thyroid function.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, controlled intervention study involving 67 subjects: 28 patients with major depression and hypothyroidism on adequate levothyroxine therapy randomized for treatment with fluoxetine (n = 13) or sertraline (n = 15); 29 patients with major depression and normal thyroid function treated with fluoxetine (n = 15) or sertraline (n = 14); and 10 control patients with hypothyroidism on adequate levothyroxine therapy without depression. Main outcome measures included thyrotropin, thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine, triiodothyronine (T3), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) rating scale.

- **Results**: Patients with normal thyroid function who were treated with fluoxetine demonstrated a significant reduction of T3 after 15 and 30 days of treatment (p = 0.034 and p = 0.011) and a significant reduction of T4 throughout the intervention period (p = 0.04 after 15 days; p = 0.015 after 30 days; and p = 0.029 after 90 days). However, all thyroid parameters remained within the euthyroid range. No changes were observed among hypothyroid patients on levothyroxine replacement therapy who were treated with either SSRI.

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: When to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^116E5fuv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. Increasingly, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment. Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least 2 months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L. While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.

TSH goals are age dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

### Low yield of thyroid-stimulating hormone testing in elderly patients with depression [^113oqqB2]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Although hypothyroidism is purportedly an important cause of depression, prior studies have involved small samples of young people and produced conflicting results. We examined the yield of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) testing in a large group of elderly patients with major depression or dysthymic disorder. The study sample comprised 883 outpatients aged 60 years or older from 18 primary care sites enrolled in the intervention arm of a clinical trial of depression management. Thyroid function was assessed by a single TSH value. Depressive diagnoses were confirmed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), and depression severity was assessed with the HSCL-20, a modified depression scale of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist.

TSH results were available for 725 (82.1%) participants. Although 32 (4.4%) of those tested had TSH > 5 mIU/L, the vast majority (27/32) had marginally elevated results (5.1–9.4 mIU/L). Only five patients (0.7%) had TSH levels > 10 mIU/L. Patients with elevated TSH did not differ from those with TSH ≤ 5 mIU/L in the severity or symptom pattern of depression, as measured by the baseline HSCL-20 score (P = 0.37) or SCID score (P = 0.44). These findings should caution physicians against acceptance of borderline TSH values as the primary cause of a patient's clinical depression.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^114aPam9]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

We studied the co-occurrence of thyroid dysfunction and psychiatric disorders in 502,480 subjects of the U.K. Biobank. The clinical diagnosis of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism was recorded as International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes using inpatient medical records during a hospital stay (U.K. Biobank data field 41202). More specifically, hypothyroidism was defined by either "Hypothyroidism, unspecified" (E039) or "Autoimmune thyroiditis" (E063) codes. For hyperthyroidism, we considered "Thyrotoxicosis with diffuse goiter" (E050), "Toxic single thyroid nodule" (E051), "Thyrotoxicosis with toxic multinodular goiter" (E052), and "Thyrotoxicosis, unspecified" (E059).

Subjects were excluded based on multiple ICD-10 codes associated with thyroid conditions (n = 2,730 subjects), spanning malignant or benign neoplasm of thyroid gland (C73 and D34), carcinoma in situ of thyroid and other endocrine glands (D093), thyrotoxicosis from ectopic thyroid tissue (E053), factitial thyrotoxicosis (E054), other thyrotoxicosis (E058), acute, subacute, or drug-induced thyroiditis (E060, E061, and E064), chronic thyroiditis with transient thyrotoxicosis (E062), and other or unspecified chronic thyroiditis (E065, E069). Other exclusions included congenital hypothyroidism with diffuse goiter (E030) and without goiter (E031), hypothyroidism due to medications and other exogenous substances (E032), postinfectious hypothyroidism (E033), acquired atrophy of thyroid (E034), myxedema coma (E035), other specified hypothyroidism (E038), and postprocedural hypothyroidism (E890).

### Use of liothyronine (T3) in hypothyroidism: Joint British Thyroid Association/Society for Endocrinology consensus statement [^1155V2B7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Persistent symptoms in patients treated for hypothyroidism are common. Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomized trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focused on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments.

- **Clinical practice points**: The statement emphasizes several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism. Firstly, it is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism; patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement. In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimized, aiming for a TSH in the 0.3–2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. In some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below the reference range (e.g. 0.1–0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term. We suggest that for some patients with confirmed overt hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms who have had adequate treatment with levothyroxine and in whom other comorbidities have been excluded, further evaluation and management options should be considered.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: A clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

- **Recommendation**: The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

- **How this guideline was created**: A guideline panel, including patients, clinicians, and methodologists, produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

- **The evidence**: The systematic review included 21 trials with 2,192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high-quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low-quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113nGTgj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Both the non-specific nature of complaints and inherent deficiencies in the diagnostic process raise an unsettling dilemma for patients and thyroid specialists alike. These issues are particularly pertinent to an etiological disease entity whose consequences are paralleled in similar outcomes: primary hypothyroidism due to total thyroidectomy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Treatment requirements and dosing of the drug LT4 changed when guidelines relaxed the need for TSH-suppressive treatment targets for these patients. The reason for this shift was not primarily motivated by any improvement in the replacement strategy, but by a revision of the long-held tenet that TSH may act as a thyroid growth-stimulating hormone. Even when present at a low level in circulation, it was believed that TSH could potentially stimulate the growth of remaining tumor cells and thereby promote the relapse of thyroid cancer in the long term.

This view has recently been revised, and TSH suppression is now deemed unnecessary for many thyroid cancer patients. However, this remarkable strategy change has presented a unique opportunity to study the implications for patient complaints stemming from the far-reaching decision to abandon TSH-suppressive LT4 treatment in low-risk thyroid cancer. Although this could not be done in a prospective study, careful retrospective analysis has revealed some interesting trends. Over the years when replacement therapy aimed at complete TSH suppression, a relatively low rate of persistent hypothyroid complaints was reported by patients.

### Small changes in thyroxine dosage do not produce measurable changes in hypothyroid symptoms, well-being, or quality of life: Results of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial [^115a5BfG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

In patients with primary hypothyroidism, anecdotal evidence suggests that well-being is optimized by fine adjustment of T(4) dosage, aiming for a serum TSH concentration in the lower reference range. This has not been tested in a clinical trial.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to test whether adjustment of T(4) dosage aiming for a serum TSH concentration less than 2 mU/liter improves well-being compared with a serum TSH concentration in the upper reference range.

- **Design**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial with a crossover design.

- **Participants**: Fifty-six subjects (52 females) with primary hypothyroidism taking T(4) (≥ 100 µg/day) with baseline serum TSH 0.1–4.8 mU/liter participated.

- **Interventions**: Each subject received three T(4) doses (low, middle, and high in 25-µg increments) in random order.

- **Outcome measures**: Outcome measures included visual analog scales assessing well-being (the primary endpoint) and hypothyroid symptoms, quality of life instruments (General Health Questionnaire 28, Short Form 36, and Thyroid Symptom Questionnaire), cognitive function tests, and treatment preference.

- **Results**: Mean (± SEM) serum TSH concentrations were 2.8 ± 0.4, 1.0 ± 0.2, and 0.3 ± 0.1 mU/liter for the three treatments. There were no significant treatment effects on any of the instruments assessing well-being, symptoms, quality of life, or cognitive function, and no significant treatment preference.

- **Conclusions**: Small changes in T(4) dosage do not produce measurable changes in hypothyroid symptoms, well-being, or quality of life.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113wgRe5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Using the observed historical narrower therapeutic range for an individual patient, we note that the treatment targets may overlap for patients in a group. If that is true, the general assumption that maintaining TSH anywhere within its broad reference limits to routinely achieve a satisfactory outcome for each and every patient may be ill-advised. We have refuted the applicability of treatment targets based on the consideration of the reference ranges in the healthy population by demonstrating dissociations between FT3 and FT4, and FT3 and TSH in LT4-treated athyreotic patients, and documenting altered equilibria between the hormones on LT4, compared to the healthy state.

Others have arrived at similar conclusions. In laboratory diagnostics, the high individuality of TSH and thyroid hormones has long been recognized since the pioneering work of Andersen and colleagues. However, this applies equally to the statistical analysis of associations involving thyroid parameters. Data clustering, whether in groups with similar properties or in subjects where multiple measurements are obtained over time, potentially masks the true relationship, abolishing the strong associations at the group level when the data are combined for analysis.

This phenomenon, known as Simpson's paradox, is readily demonstrated with a fictitious random sample of two groups with a slightly shifted center showing the same strong inverse correlation. Unlike the correct analysis by individual groups, a combined analysis of the total cohort artificially weakens the correlation.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^113XpJjG]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

One way to investigate the mechanistic relationship between hypothyroidism and mood disorders is to perform genetic correlation analyses on TPO antibodies and mood disorders. At the time of writing, the GWAS of TPO antibodies has not shown a strong heritable signal (h2 SNP < 0.002), probably due to a combination of limited statistical power and the fact that it was performed in population-based cohorts after excluding individuals on thyroid medication, effectively excluding most of the subjects with diagnosed Hashimoto's hypothyroidism. Therefore, future larger GWASs of (thyroid) autoimmune biomarkers and conditions will help elucidate whether the thyroid-mood axis is predominantly mediated through TH levels or pathways involved in (auto)immunity.

Irrespective of the exact underlying mechanisms, our findings also have clinical relevance. Based on the well-known clinical correlations, thyroid dysfunction is among the first somatic disorders to be ruled out in a patient with a newly diagnosed psychiatric disorder. Various studies have investigated whether the correction of milder forms of thyroid dysfunction (including subclinical hypothyroidism) improves depressive and anxiety-related symptoms, with disappointing results. Our finding that the genetically determined relationship between hypothyroidism and mood/ANXs is not mediated through THs, but more likely by (general) autoimmunity, is a plausible explanation for this lack of effects and supports a restrictive attitude toward treating mild thyroid dysfunction in psychiatric patients.

Besides psychiatric disorders, milder affective and anxiety symptoms remain under study in this context.

### Are we restoring thyroid hormone signaling in levothyroxine-treated patients with residual symptoms of hypothyroidism [^111jJi9V]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) at doses that maintain the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels within the normal range constitutes the standard of care for the treatment of hypothyroidism. After a few months, this eliminates the signs and symptoms of overt hypothyroidism in the majority of patients, owing to the endogenous activation of thyroxine to triiodothyronine, the biologically active thyroid hormone. Still, a small percentage of patients (10%-20%) exhibit residual symptoms, despite having normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. These symptoms include cognitive, mood, and metabolic deficits, with significant impairment in psychological well-being and quality of life.

- **Objective**: To provide a summary of progress in the approach of patients with hypothyroidism that exhibit residual symptoms despite treatment.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the literature and focused on the mechanisms leading to a deficiency of T3 in some LT4-treated patients, the role of residual thyroid tissue, and the rationale for combination therapy with LT4 + liothyronine (LT3).

- **Results**: A score of clinical trials comparing therapy with LT4 versus LT4 + LT3 concluded that both are safe and equally effective (neither is superior); however, these trials failed to recruit a sufficiently large number of patients with residual symptoms. New clinical trials that considered LT4-treated symptomatic patients revealed that such patients benefit from and prefer therapy containing LT4 + LT3. Desiccated thyroid extract has also been used with similar results.

### Changes in brain size with treatment in patients with hyper- or hypothyroidism [^111DrwRa]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2002). Low credibility.

Although neuropsychological symptoms and signs are common in thyroid disease, their organic substrate is unknown. We performed brain MR imaging in patients with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism before and after treatment and correlated the results with hormonal markers.

- **Methods**: Eight patients with hyperthyroid disease and three with hypothyroid disease underwent imaging within 1–2 days of a thyroid hormone test. Images were registered, and brain and ventricular sizes were measured using a semiautomated contour and thresholding technique. Changes in brain and ventricular volumes were correlated with serum levels of total thyroxine (T(4)), unbound triiodothyronine (free T(3)), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) before and after treatment.

- **Results**: With treatment, brain size decreased by 6,329–31,183 mm(3) in the hyperthyroid group and increased by 2,599–48,825 mm(3) in the hypothyroid group. Conversely, ventricular size increased by 325–6,279 mm(3) in the hyperthyroid group and decreased by 760–2,376 mm(3) in the hypothyroid group. There was a highly significant correlation between the reduction in brain size and reduction in T(4), as well as between the increase in ventricular size and reduction in T(4). There was a significant correlation between the reduction in ventricular size and reduction in free T(3). There were highly significant correlations between reduced levels of TSH and increase in brain size, as well as between increased levels of TSH and increase in ventricular size.

### Influence of preexisting psychiatric morbidity on liothyronine use in hypothyroidism: A Swedish nationwide cohort study [^113fds5T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder affecting 1–2% of the population in iodine-sufficient areas. While levothyroxine is the standard treatment, a substantial number of patients report persistent symptoms despite adequate treatment. The use of liothyronine as an adjunct to levothyroxine therapy has increased. The psychiatric characteristics of patients receiving liothyronine remain largely unknown. This study examines the association between preexisting psychiatric morbidity and subsequent liothyronine use in autoimmune hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: This nationwide retrospective cohort study includes all adults in Sweden with autoimmune hypothyroidism and initiated on treatment with thyroid hormones between 2006 and 2020. Data were obtained from the National Patient Register and the National Prescribed Drug Register. Psychiatric morbidity prior to diagnosis was identified using ICD-10 codes and ATC codes for psychiatric medications. Logistic models estimated associations, adjusting for sex, age, and region.

- **Results**: Among 353,708 patients, 44.8% had a history of psychiatric morbidity. These patients were more likely to receive liothyronine (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.90, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.83–1.97, p < 0.001) compared to those without a psychiatric history. This was most evident among individuals with affective or anxiety morbidity (aOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.84–1.98, p < 0.001). No association was found for psychotic morbidity (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 0.98–1.19, p = 0.11).

- **Conclusion**: Patients with a psychiatric history before autoimmune hypothyroidism were more likely to receive liothyronine.

### European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^114F14mb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). High credibility.

With early and adequate treatment, intellectual disability (defined as an IQ < 70) has disappeared from cohorts screened for congenital hypothyroidism (CH), and the mean global IQ is now 10 to 30 points higher in these patients than in the prescreening era. Some affected patients still have neurocognitive and behavioral sequelae of CH that persist into adolescence and adulthood, which are related to disease severity. Cognitive outcomes are linked to age at treatment and L-T4 dosage; school progression may be affected. Additionally, cognitive outcomes are related to the parents' socio-educational status.

Behavior scores on initial admission to school fall within the normal range, and the perception of CH's impact on behavior varies with age, differing between children and their parents. The effect of informing teachers of the CH diagnosis has not been investigated. Patients with CH do not have an increased risk of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, but they may experience more sustained attention problems related to episodes of overtreatment and, in severe cases, slower information processing.

Subtle and specific memory deficits and reduced hippocampal volumes may be observed. There is also a risk of fine motor impairment. However, most early-treated patients integrate well into society without impairment in educational levels.

- **Hearing, visual, verbal development**
- 4.1.7 Repeated (not just neonatal) hearing tests should be carried out before school age and as required (2|⊕⊕○).
- 4.1.8 Assessing patients for evidence of visual processing problems (not just visual acuity) is crucial.

### Female vulnerability for thyroid function abnormality in bipolar disorder: role of lithium treatment [^113aFZFC]. Bipolar Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Previous studies have provided evidence of subtle thyroid hormone metabolism abnormalities in patients with mood disorders. Although these studies are informative, the precise role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in bipolar disorder, especially in women, remains unclear. We sought to further corroborate thyroid function in patients with bipolar disorder in comparison to patients with other psychiatric, as well as non-psychiatric, diagnoses.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective, cross-sectional, naturalistic study, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in a total sample of 3,204 patients were compared. The study sample included patients with bipolar disorder (n = 469), unipolar depression (n = 615), and other psychiatric diagnoses (n = 999), along with patients from endocrinology clinics (n = 645) and dermatology clinics (n = 476). Analyses were completed using two different normal ranges for TSH: a high normal range (0.4–5.0 μIU/mL) and a low normal range (0.3–3.0 μIU/mL).

- **Results**: Patients with bipolar disorder showed significantly higher serum TSH levels compared to all other groups. In women, the rate of above-normal range TSH was highest in patients with bipolar disorder for both high (5.0 μIU/mL; 12.1%) and low (3.0 μIU/mL; 30.4%) upper normal limits. In patients with bipolar disorder, serum TSH levels did not differ significantly between different mood states. In the lithium-treated patients (n = 240), a significantly lower percentage of women (55.9%) compared to men (71.2%) fell within the 0.3–3.0 μIU/mL normal TSH window (p = 0.016).

### Hypothyroidism: Diagnosis and treatment [^111oVG6n]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Clinical hypothyroidism affects one in 300 people in the United States, with a higher prevalence among female and older patients. Symptoms range from minimal to life-threatening, such as myxedema coma; more common symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, and voice changes. The signs and symptoms that suggest thyroid dysfunction are nonspecific and nondiagnostic, especially early in disease presentation. Therefore, a diagnosis is based on blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine. There is no evidence that population screening is beneficial.

Symptom relief and normalized thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are achieved with levothyroxine replacement therapy, started at 1.5 to 1.8 mcg per kg per day. Adding triiodothyronine is not recommended, even in patients with persistent symptoms and normal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Patients older than 60 years or with known or suspected ischemic heart disease should start at a lower dosage of levothyroxine (12.5 to 50 mcg per day). Women with hypothyroidism who become pregnant should increase their weekly dosage by 30%, up to nine doses per week (i.e. take one extra dose twice per week), followed by monthly evaluation and management.

Patients with persistent symptoms after adequate levothyroxine dosing should be reassessed for other causes or the need for referral. Early recognition of myxedema coma and appropriate treatment is essential. Most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do not benefit from treatment unless the thyroid-stimulating hormone level is greater than the normal range.

### Brain fog in hypothyroidism: What is it, how is it measured, and what can be done about it [^111TVLJu]. Thyroid (2022). Low credibility.

Some levothyroxine (LT4)-treated hypothyroid patients report a constellation of persistent and distressing cognitive symptoms that has been termed brain fog. This narrative review focuses on attempts to define and measure hypothyroid-associated brain fog, summarize possible etiologies and contributing factors, present treatment options, and propose avenues for future research.

- **Methods**: Published literature was reviewed to summarize available information on patient-reported symptoms associated with brain fog in hypothyroidism, as well as objective evidence of impairment based on neurocognitive testing and functional imaging studies. Given the limited information specific to hypothyroid-associated brain fog, relevant data from other medical conditions associated with brain fog were also reviewed and incorporated into recommendations for clinical care and future research areas.

- **Results**: Hypothyroid-associated brain fog has not been well defined or quantitated, and the underlying pathophysiology is unclear. Symptoms vary among patients but commonly include fatigue, depressed mood, and cognitive difficulties in the areas of memory and executive function. Symptoms often predate the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and the magnitude of cognitive impairment can range from mild to severe. Regardless of severity, these symptoms are associated with impaired quality of life and cause dissatisfaction with treatment, often leading to requests for alternative therapies. Disease-specific and psychological factors impact the experience of brain fog in complex ways, including potential interactions that require further investigation.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^111VJFvy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

In this article, we take a closer look at how these technical changes may have impacted patient care. A transition occurred from the era when a low metabolic rate was regarded as synonymous with hypothyroidism to a purely biochemically based definition. Hence, TSH measurement became the new determinant of hypothyroidism. Consequently, treatment habits changed over the last decade and were more related to laboratory records than subjective patient experience. In particular, LT4 replacement doses tended to decrease, as a suppressed TSH was viewed as evidence of overtreatment.

However, for two reasons, this is an area of considerable uncertainty. Firstly, thyroid-related patient complaints overlap with a plethora of non-specific symptoms caused by other conditions and diseases. Thyroid tests are also more likely to be obtained in patients with unspecific symptoms. In these conditions, LT4 treatment may not be superior to placebo in symptom alleviation. Secondly, TSH is increasingly recognized to be less reliable as a definitive diagnostic tool than previously assumed. Not only is its reference interval not universally agreed upon or adjusted for various influences, such as ethnicity, iodine supply, and age, but the univariate statistical derivation of a TSH reference range is inherently ill-defined owing to its nature as a controlling element. Physiologically, stimulation by TSH raises thyroid hormones to a level appropriate to the optimal well-being of a person because TSH, FT4, and FT3 are interrelated through the operation of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid feedback regulation.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: A specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^115BTGyQ]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone (TH) plays a key role in brain development and neurocognitive function. Both hypo- and hyperthyroidism have been associated with an increased risk of various psychiatric diseases, including depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders (ANXs). More recently, it has even been shown that minor subclinical variations in thyroid function, even within the normal range, are associated with these psychiatric diseases, although some studies report contradicting findings. A better understanding of the biological processes underlying these associations could have highly valuable implications for both clinical psychiatry and endocrinology.

The most common forms of thyroid dysfunction have an autoimmune origin, and there is increasing evidence that the immune system and inflammatory response are also relevant for the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Beyond the direct effects of TH on the brain, the effects of thyroid dysfunction on psychiatric diseases could thus be mediated by more generally associated autoimmune processes. Various cellular mechanisms have been proposed for this phenomenon, ranging from binding of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies to human astrocytes, coinciding anti-central nervous system auto-antibodies in thyroid diseases, to increased production of monocyte- and T lymphocyte-derived cytokines. Vice versa, psychiatric disorders have also been shown to be associated with abnormalities in thyroid function tests. These include mild elevations and decreases in TH levels, as well as blunting of the thyrotropin (TSH) response.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: Prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^113yC48n]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

- **Methods**: Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed, using the best available evidence.

### Slower treatment response in bipolar depression predicted by lower pretreatment thyroid function [^115srRjp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Because treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder is a clinical challenge, and hypothyroidism is known to be associated with depression, the authors examined the relationship between pretreatment thyroid values and response to antidepressant treatment. It was hypothesized that subjects with lower thyroid function, even within the normal range, would have a poorer response to initial treatment.

- **Method**: The subjects were 65 patients in the depressed phase of bipolar I disorder who were enrolled in a larger ongoing study. A panel of thyroid measures, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine, triiodothyronine resin uptake, and free thyroxine index (FTI), were determined before initiation of algorithm-guided treatment. The effect of each thyroid measurement on time to remission was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model.

- **Results**: Both lower values of FTI and higher values of TSH were significantly associated with longer times to remission, i.e. slower response to treatment. Outcomes were relatively poor unless patients had FTI values above the median and TSH values below the median. Patients with this optimal profile experienced remission 4 months faster than the remainder of the study group.

- **Conclusions**: This study provides further evidence that patients with bipolar disorder are particularly sensitive to variations in thyroid function within the normal range. Our results suggest that nearly three-quarters of patients with bipolar disorder have a thyroid profile that may be suboptimal for antidepressant response.

### Association of thyroid dysfunction with cognitive function: An individual participant data analysis [^1156weVT]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction is considered a potentially reversible cause of cognitive decline; hence, thyroid function screening tests are described in guidelines as an essential component of the workup for the diagnosis of dementia. Thyroid dysfunction is frequently observed in individuals with suspected dementia. However, the outcomes of treatment for overt hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and subclinical hyperthyroidism on cognitive function are not fully clarified. For subclinical hypothyroidism, four out of five recent randomized clinical trials and a meta-analysis on levothyroxine treatment did not find evidence for an improvement in cognitive function.

Moreover, meta-analyses of observational studies have yielded inconsistent results on associations of subclinical and overt thyroid dysfunction with cognitive impairment and the risk of dementia. An individual participant data analysis of cohort studies might help clarify the conflicting results of previous studies, as it allows for uniform definitions of thyroid dysfunction, and it can assess the differential associations by age groups, sex, and thyroid medication in subgroup analyses. In the present study, we investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of thyroid dysfunction with cognitive function and dementia in an individual participant data analysis of multiple cohorts.

### Risk of psychiatric disorders in patients with Graves' disease: A nationwide population-based analysis [^111qZNGk]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune hyperthyroidism and is associated with various psychiatric symptoms, such as irritability, mood changes, and insomnia. However, the epidemiological risk of psychiatric disorders among individuals with GD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether a diagnosis of GD is associated with an increased incidence of various psychiatric disorders at a nationwide level.

- **Methods**: This study was a retrospective cohort study using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Claims database. We identified 20,851 patients with newly diagnosed GD and 46,008 age- and sex-matched controls. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of incident psychiatric disorders in patients with GD compared to controls. We further analyzed the hazard ratios (HRs) by follow-up period (< 2 years, ≥ 2 years) since the diagnosis of GD.

- **Results**: Patients with GD exhibited a higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders compared to controls. The risk for incident depression (HR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.24–1.44), bipolar disorder (HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.31–1.89), anxiety disorder (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.43–1.63), and sleep disorder (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.32–1.58) was significantly elevated. This increased risk for various psychiatric disorders, except schizophrenia, persisted even two years after the GD diagnosis. The association between GD and schizophrenia was not statistically significant.

In conclusion, this large-scale, population-based study demonstrates a significant association between GD and an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders.

### Association of hypothyroidism and clinical depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cPiHJ]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is considered a cause of or a strong risk factor for depression, but recent studies provide conflicting evidence regarding the existence and the extent of the association. It is also unclear whether the link is largely due to subsyndromal depression or holds true for clinical depression. To estimate the association of hypothyroidism and clinical depression in the general population, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases were searched from inception until May 2020 for studies on the association of hypothyroidism and clinical depression.

Two reviewers independently selected epidemiologic and population-based studies that provided laboratory or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems diagnoses of hypothyroidism and diagnoses of depression according to operationalized criteria (e.g. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) or cutoffs in established rating scales.

Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated studies based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Summary odds ratios (OR) were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Prespecified coprimary outcomes were the association of clinical depression with either hypothyroidism or autoimmunity.

Of 4350 articles screened, 25 studies were selected for meta-analysis, including 348,014 participants. Hypothyroidism and clinical depression were ass
