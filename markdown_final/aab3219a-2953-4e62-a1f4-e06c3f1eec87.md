## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a physical therapy evaluation and plan for an 84-year-old woman with a left diabetic foot ulcer, recent infection, multiple comorbidities, and functional decline presenting with decreased strength, coordination, neuromotor control, postural alignment, pain, and reduced dynamic balance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical question and establishing the immediate priorities, including frailty and limb threat. Then, I should verify wound status and infection severity per IWGDF/IDSA and determine vascular sufficiency and debridement needs. Next, I will assemble the right multidisciplinary team and outline pain control, offloading, and dressing strategies. After that, I need to plan rehabilitation dosing and safety monitoring in the context of CHF/CKD, optimize cardiometabolic comorbidities, and design transitional care to reduce readmissions. Finally, I will define objective monitoring and address barriers such as frailty stigma and resource constraints, synthesizing the plan into staged priorities supported by guidelines and trials [^113XMgvb] [^113CkSYW] [^116ZyRb4] [^114Hys4r] [^113v5VU2] [^115uxtMM] [^116QcDY4] [^111arvZd] [^112MynjX].

> Let me first confirm the problem framing and risk level. This is a frail older adult with multimorbidity and recent functional decline; I should verify frailty status and baseline function using a comprehensive geriatric lens while acknowledging that clinicians often avoid formal frailty tools and may rely on appearance and history, which can hinder guideline uptake and continuity of care, so I need to explicitly plan around those barriers [^111yAEEP]. I should also confirm she has had a diabetes foot risk evaluation and monofilament testing, since annual risk stratification and foot inspection at every visit for those with sensory loss or prior ulcer/amputation are ADA-recommended and directly influence escalation pathways and preventive intensity [^111arvZd]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: I need to check whether her current ulcer is actually infected, because that determines antibiotics, imaging, and urgency of debridement [^113XMgvb] [^113CkSYW].

> I will now examine the wound and infection status systematically. Per IWGDF/IDSA, I should diagnose infection clinically and not treat uninfected ulcers with antibiotics; if the ulcer is uninfected, antibiotics do not reduce future infection risk or promote healing, and topical antibiotics should also be avoided for this purpose [^113XMgvb] [^113CkSYW]. If infection is present, I should grade severity, obtain appropriate cultures after debridement of superficial contaminants, and select systemic therapy aligned with severity while addressing source control. Wait, let me verify my plan about offloading: I initially thought to cite offloading recommendations directly from the provided IWGDF/IDSA excerpt, but the supplied text here emphasizes antibiotic stewardship rather than offloading specifics; offloading remains standard of care, yet I should avoid over-claiming the excerpt's scope and simply implement pressure redistribution based on clinical standards without mis-citation [^113XMgvb].

> Next, I should review perfusion and procedural needs. Given her likely PAD risk, I need to assess arterial supply and plan debridement if necrosis is present; for extensive debridement pain, the WHS update recommends considering a peripheral nerve block, which is particularly relevant in ischemic, painful wounds in older adults [^116ZyRb4]. For ongoing ischemic pain, let me consider the WHS pain ladder starting with topical and non-opioid measures, escalating as needed; for refractory ischemic pain in PAD, spinal cord stimulation may be considered to improve pain and potentially perfusion, but I should confirm candidacy with vascular and pain specialists first [^114Hys4r] [^116DE4iJ]. Hold on, I should verify that any invasive step follows an objective vascular workup and aligns with the patient's goals and frailty context before proceeding [^114Hys4r].

> I need to ensure the right multidisciplinary team is in place because outcomes in chronic limb-threatening ischemia and complex wounds improve with coordinated, specialty-driven care. A vascular specialist should typically drive the limb-salvage team, with podiatry/wound care, endocrinology, rehabilitation, and surgical services integrated, and local team structure should be tailored to community resources and practice patterns to reduce amputation risk [^113v5VU2]. Let me verify the broader principle: across complex conditions, multidisciplinary models and standardized team processes improve coordination and outcomes, which supports building consistent pathways here even if our setting has resource limits [^115uxtMM].

> Now, pain management must be methodical and renal/cardiac-safe. Per WHS, I should start with topical and non-opioid analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) and escalate cautiously to weak then strong opioids only if necessary, always balancing frailty, fall risk, and constipation prophylaxis, and considering regional techniques during debridement when appropriate [^114Hys4r] [^116ZyRb4]. If she is already on chronic opioids, I need to check for dependence and avoid abrupt discontinuation, using a slow, individualized taper to prevent withdrawal, uncontrolled pain, or harm; also, I should avoid concomitant benzodiazepines when possible due to the risk of profound sedation and respiratory depression [^115faUm1] [^1151JHaV] [^115HoaBp]. Hmm, wait a minute, if severe ischemic pain persists despite optimization, I should re-evaluate revascularization candidacy with vascular surgery before escalating systemic opioids further [^113v5VU2].

> Rehabilitation dosing requires careful calibration to her cardiopulmonary and renal reserve. Let me first confirm medical stability and then initiate low-intensity, progressive strengthening, balance, coordination, and gait training with close vitals monitoring, recognizing that home-based or outpatient geriatric rehabilitation after hospitalization helps maintain mobility and ADLs and aligns with WHO rehabilitation aims in older adults [^114nnP6t]. Next, I should review evidence that transitional care models including comprehensive recovery pathways and outpatient rehabilitation show the strongest benefits for physical performance, which supports early PT involvement and continuity from hospital to home [^116QcDY4]. If neuropathic pain syndromes like CRPS emerge, I can layer pain education and graded motor imagery from multidisciplinary pain programs, acknowledging mixed evidence and the need for specialized teams and patient preparation [^11662y5o]. I should double-check that therapy dosage progresses slowly given CHF and prior respiratory failure, with energy conservation and assistive device optimization to reduce fall risk [^114nnP6t].

> Comorbidity optimization must run in parallel. For diabetes with CKD/CHF, SGLT2 inhibition confers heart failure and kidney benefits; dapagliflozin has indications across HF and CKD and improves HF outcomes, though glycemic efficacy is limited when eGFR is below 45, so I should verify renal function and align use to cardiorenal indications rather than glycemic lowering alone in advanced CKD [^111JiHBv]. If using combination dapagliflozin/metformin products such as Xigduo XR for glycemic control, I must check eGFR for both components and educate about rare but serious Fournier's gangrene, adjusting insulin or secretagogues to mitigate hypoglycemia risk when combined [^114YXNZt] [^116MmKBH]. For hypertension, I should confirm thresholds and initiate or intensify therapy when average BP is ≥ 130/80 mmHg in the setting of diabetes or CKD to reduce CVD risk per 2025 AHA/ACC, and in HFpEF consider ARBs and/or MRAs to reduce HF hospitalizations while lowering BP if above target, titrating cautiously in frailty [^112MynjX] [^1172HN9b]. Let me reconsider nephrotoxin exposure as well; medication reconciliation is essential to avoid agents that could worsen CKD or impair wound healing while we titrate GDMT [^112MynjX].

> Transitional care is the glue that prevents deconditioning and rehospitalization. I should confirm a structured discharge plan with scheduled wound clinic follow-up in one week, cardiology/nephrology within two weeks, and PT continuity at home or in clinic depending on mobility, as multidisciplinary transitional care programs reduce readmissions and can improve quality of life and mortality when tailored to the local context and patient needs [^115uxtMM]. Next, I should review that interventions with comprehensive recovery pathways and outpatient rehabilitation demonstrate notable gains in physical performance, reinforcing the need for proactive coordination and caregiver education before discharge [^116QcDY4]. Hold on, I should verify transportation and home safety barriers ahead of time to avoid missed visits and early setbacks in this frail patient [^115uxtMM].

> Monitoring needs to be objective and time-bound. In the short term, I should track weekly wound dimensions and tissue quality, daily or visit-based pain scores, hemodynamic response to therapy, and red flags for infection progression or ischemia, while documenting functional measures such as sit-to-stand, TUG, and balance to quantify PT gains; aligning with geriatric rehabilitation principles will help sustain independence [^114nnP6t]. Over one to three months, I will follow ulcer closure trajectory, amputation avoidance, readmissions, and patient-reported outcomes, maintaining diabetes foot risk surveillance with at least annual comprehensive foot evaluations and monofilament testing, and more frequent inspections given her ulcer history [^111arvZd]. I should double-check that outcome review loops feed back into team huddles to recalibrate intensity and address barriers promptly [^116QcDY4].

> I need to address barriers and facilitators explicitly. Frailty stigma, reluctance to use screening tools, and discontinuity after acute admissions are common and can derail guideline implementation; naming these issues with the team and the patient can improve uptake of protocols, shared language, and follow-through [^111yAEEP]. Let me consider that resource constraints require tailoring the team to available services while preserving the vascular-led structure for limb salvage and embedding standardized communication and education, which are core to multidisciplinary success [^113v5VU2] [^114ywcVC].

> Synthesis and final recommendation: Hold on, I should verify the immediate priorities. Immediately, confirm infection status and perfusion, debride as indicated, avoid antibiotics if uninfected per IWGDF/IDSA, initiate evidence-based pain control with regional options as needed, and offload and dress appropriately while arranging a vascular-led team huddle [^113XMgvb] [^113CkSYW] [^116ZyRb4] [^114Hys4r] [^113v5VU2]. In the short term, start low-dose, closely monitored rehabilitation focusing on strength, balance, and safe gait, and initiate or optimize cardiometabolic therapies with SGLT2-based cardiorenal protection and guideline-based antihypertensives as tolerated, with medication safety checks in CKD and frailty [^111JiHBv] [^112MynjX]. In the medium to long term, embed a tailored multidisciplinary transitional care plan with scheduled specialty follow-up and outpatient rehab, because high-quality evidence shows such programs reduce readmissions, improve quality of life, and enhance physical performance in complex patients like this one [^115uxtMM] [^116QcDY4]. Taking this integrated, guideline-aligned approach is most likely to improve wound healing, reduce amputation risk, enhance function, and lower mortality for this high-risk older adult, provided we continuously verify infection control, vascular status, and rehab tolerance and adjust the plan accordingly [^113XMgvb] [^113v5VU2] [^116QcDY4].

This 84-year-old woman with a left diabetic foot ulcer and infection, plus multiple comorbidities (IDDM, CKD, heart failure, asthma, hypertension, depression, aortic valve replacement, GI bleed, tobacco use), presents with an **exacerbation of weakness; impaired coordination and neuromotor control; poor postural alignment; pain; and reduced dynamic balance**. Her decline is **multifactorial**, driven by infection/inflammation, neuropathy, vascular insufficiency, deconditioning, pain, and medication effects. PT should implement a **multidisciplinary, individualized plan** with careful monitoring, fall-prevention measures, and close coordination with wound care, cardiology, nephrology, and endocrinology to address her complex needs and reduce complications [^115uxtMM] [^116QcDY4].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying functional decline

### Infection and inflammation

Systemic infection drives cytokine-mediated catabolism that accelerates **muscle wasting and weakness**. Progression to sepsis can further impair neuromotor control and balance [^114nnP6t].

---

### Diabetic neuropathy

Peripheral sensory loss diminishes proprioception, undermining **coordination and balance**, while motor neuropathy causes weakness and atrophy, reducing strength and compromising postural alignment [^111arvZd].

---

### Vascular insufficiency

Peripheral arterial disease and ischemia, prevalent in diabetes and CKD, cause ischemic muscle **pain and weakness**. Poor perfusion also delays ulcer healing, prolonging immobility and deconditioning [^114Hys4r].

---

### Deconditioning and sarcopenia

Hospitalization and immobility accelerate sarcopenia, reducing strength and balance. Age-related frailty heightens vulnerability to stressors and hastens **functional decline** [^114nnP6t].

---

### Pain and psychological factors

Pain from the ulcer and infection **restricts mobility**, leading to disuse and progressive weakness. Concurrent depression reduces motivation and participation, compounding the decline.

---

### Medication side effects

Polypharmacy can cause sedation, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, and myopathy, which together **impair neuromotor control and balance**.

---

## Impact of comorbidities on rehabilitation outcomes

### Diabetes mellitus and diabetic foot ulcer

Hyperglycemia **impairs tissue repair** and increases infection risk, delaying ulcer resolution. Concomitant sensory neuropathy limits improvements in balance and coordination.

---

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Anemia and electrolyte disturbances contribute to fatigue and **reduced exercise tolerance**. Volume shifts further provoke postural instability and dizziness.

---

### Heart failure

Reduced cardiac output **limits exercise capacity** and accelerates exertional fatigue. Fluid overload with edema and dyspnea further impairs mobility and balance.

---

### Asthma and respiratory failure

Dyspnea constrains activity and endurance. Hypoxemia **impairs neuromotor function** and worsens balance.

---

### Hypertension and aortic valve replacement

Blood pressure lability, including orthostatic hypotension, **elevates fall risk**. Valve disease limits safe exercise intensity and overall tolerance.

---

### Depression

Low engagement **reduces participation and adherence** to therapy. This undermines rehabilitation progress.

---

## Evidence-based physical therapy interventions

Given the patient's complexity, PT should be **individualized and closely monitored**.

---

### Strength and balance training

Implement **progressive resistance** to improve strength and function. Concurrent balance training reduces fall risk and improves stability [^114nnP6t].

---

### Neuromotor control and coordination exercises

Use **task-specific practice** to improve coordination and motor control. Integrate functional training to enhance ADLs and promote independence.

---

### Pain management strategies

Use a **multimodal approach** with topical and non-opioid analgesics, TENS, and graded activity [^114Hys4r]. For severe pain that limits participation, consider peripheral nerve blocks [^116ZyRb4].

---

### Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation

Provide low-intensity, monitored **aerobic training** to improve endurance and reduce dyspnea. Add breathing exercises to support respiratory function and reduce anxiety.

---

### Multidisciplinary team approach

Team-based care coordinates PT with **wound care, cardiology, nephrology, endocrinology, and psychology** to optimize outcomes [^113v5VU2]. This integrated approach aligns goals and ensures robust safety monitoring [^116QcDY4].

---

## Potential complications and risks during rehabilitation

- **Falls**: High risk due to balance deficits, neuropathy, and orthostatic hypotension.
- **Cardiopulmonary events**: Exacerbations of heart failure, asthma, or respiratory failure [^117CZgdY].
- **Infection progression**: Worsening foot infection or sepsis [^113XMgvb].
- **Hypoglycemia**: During exercise in insulin-dependent diabetes [^114YXNZt].
- **Medication interactions**: Adverse effects from polypharmacy [^115HoaBp].

---

## Recommended monitoring strategies and outcome measures

- **Vital signs**: Monitor BP, HR, SpO2, and glucose during sessions [^117CZgdY].
- **Functional tests**: Use TUG, 6MWT, and Berg Balance Scale [^114nnP6t].
- **Pain assessment**: Regularly reassess and adjust interventions.
- **Wound monitoring**: Track ulcer healing and infection status [^113XMgvb].
- **Patient-reported outcomes**: Use PROMs for function and quality of life [^1135H2me].

---

## Multidisciplinary team involvement

- **Wound care**: For ulcer management and infection control [^113XMgvb].
- **Cardiology**: For heart failure and valve disease management [^111JiHBv].
- **Nephrology**: For CKD and electrolyte management [^116MmKBH].
- **Endocrinology**: For diabetes and glycemic control [^111arvZd].
- **Psychology**: For depression and adherence support.

---

Overall, the patient's decline is **multifactorial** — stemming from infection/inflammation, neuropathy, vascular insufficiency, deconditioning, pain, and medication effects. PT should provide a **multidisciplinary, individualized plan** with vigilant monitoring and fall-prevention strategies, coordinated closely with wound care, cardiology, nephrology, and endocrinology to address her complex needs and reduce complications [^111arvZd] [^116QcDY4].

The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that multidisciplinary transitional care interventions addressing patients' complex care needs offer a viable solution to improve their quality of life and physical performance while reducing hospital readmissions and mortality. Given the varying effects observed across studies, we recommend tailoring strategies to implement such interventions to the environments, settings, and populations in which they are implemented to maximize their impact on health-related outcomes. A systematic and thorough needs assessment before implementing a transitional care intervention might improve its chances of success. However, further research is needed to determine how to tailor strategies to implement these interventions successfully.

### Using multidisciplinary teams to improve outcomes for treating chronic-limb threatening ischemia [^113v5VU2]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Multidisciplinary teams are necessary to treat complex patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). The need for adequate wound care and control of comorbid conditions cannot be accomplished by the vascular specialist alone. Numerous specialties, including surgical podiatry, orthopedic surgery, plastic and reconstructive surgery, endocrinology, and wound care, play a role in this group. However, the vascular specialist must drive this team, as patients are usually referred to them. Numerous studies have shown a direct correlation between major amputations and the lack of vascular involvement.

Creating these teams is unique within each community and must consider practice patterns that are relevant to the local region. CLTI is a challenging disease to manage, and multidisciplinary teams have demonstrated an ability to improve outcomes and deliver superior care to this patient population.

### Hospital-based health professionals' perceptions of frailty in older people [^111yAEEP]. The Gerontologist (2024). Low credibility.

There is a high prevalence of frailty amongst older patients in hospital settings. Frailty guidelines exist, but implementation at the time of writing has been challenging. Understanding health professionals' attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs about frailty is critical to understanding the barriers and enablers to guideline implementation. The aim of this study was to understand these factors within rehabilitation multidisciplinary teams in hospital settings.

- **Research design and methods**: Twenty-three semistructured interviews were conducted with health professionals working in multidisciplinary teams on geriatric and rehabilitation wards in Adelaide and Sydney, Australia. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded by two researchers. A codebook was created, and interviews were recoded and applied to the Framework Method of thematic analysis.

- **Results**: Three domains were developed: diagnosing frailty, communicating about frailty, and managing frailty. Within these domains, eight themes were identified:
	1. Diagnosing frailty has questionable benefits.
	2. Clinicians don't use frailty screening tools.
	3. Frailty can be diagnosed on appearance and history.
	4. Frailty has a stigma.
	5. Clinicians don't use the word "frail" with patients.
	6. Frailty isn't always reversible.
	7. There is a lack of continuity of care after acute admission.
	8. The community setting lacks resources.

- **Discussion and implications**: Implementation of frailty guidelines will remain challenging while staff avoid using the term "frail", don't perceive the benefit of using screening tools, and focus on other aspects of care.

The study, MATINEE, was published in 2025 in the journal *The New England Journal of Medicine*. This study is related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The trial question was: what is the effect of mepolizumab for preventing exacerbations in patients with COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype? The study's design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 804 patients (253 female, 551 male).

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with COPD, a history of exacerbations, and a blood eosinophil count of ≥ 300 cells/mL who were receiving triple inhaled therapy.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: History of asthma; recent pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, or lower respiratory tract infection (in the past 4 weeks); lung volume reduction surgery (in the past 12 months); parasitic infestation (in the past 6 months); cirrhosis or unstable liver disease; immunodeficiency; alcohol or drug abuse in the past 2 years.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Mepolizumab group**: n = 403, receiving 100 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52–104 weeks.
	- **Placebo group**: n = 401, receiving a matching placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52–104 weeks.

- **Primary outcome**: Significant decrease in the incidence of the annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (0.8 events/year vs. 1.01 events/year; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94).

- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant increase in time to the first moderate or severe exacerbation (419 days vs. 321 days; HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.08).

### Aridol bronchial challenge test kit [^114pemBL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Bronchial challenge testing with Aridol and methacholine demonstrated similar sensitivity and specificity when calculated relative to a blinded study physician's diagnosis of asthma in subjects at the end of the study.

In Study 1, the sensitivity and specificity of bronchial challenge testing with Aridol in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years were similar to those in the overall population.

- **Study 2 details**: This was a crossover study comparing bronchial challenge testing with Aridol to hypertonic (4.5%) saline in identifying bronchial hyperresponsiveness in subjects aged 6 to 83 years, with (n = 551) and without (n = 95) asthma. The efficacy endpoint of interest was an estimation of the sensitivity and specificity of bronchial challenge testing with Aridol with respect to a physician's clinical diagnosis of asthma. Following completion of the bronchial challenge tests with Aridol and hypertonic saline, a respiratory physician assessed the data and categorized the subjects as having or not having asthma.

- **Sensitivity and specificity findings**: The sensitivity of the Aridol bronchial challenge test in subjects with a physician diagnosis of asthma was 58% [54%, 62%, 95th CI] compared to a sensitivity of the physician diagnosis in the same population of 97% [95%, 98%, 95th CI]. The specificity of the Aridol bronchial challenge test in subjects without asthma was 95% [90%, 99%, 95th CI] compared to the specificity of the physician diagnosis of 98% [95%, 100%, 95th CI].

### World burn care and the multidisciplinary team [^114ywcVC]. Burns (2025). Low credibility.

Burn care is a multifaceted, multiparametric, and multimodal process that requires a multidisciplinary team to improve patient outcomes and the skills of health professionals through standardization, regardless of the environment. This work proposes a framework of personal quality improvement that aims to provide a basis for an effective multidisciplinary team. Such a team can deliver harmonization of clinical practice based on practice guidelines and minimize the micro and macro barriers contributing to the global burden of burn care. The key focus of the framework is on the effort to closely engage and merge with the larger systems of healthcare, as well as with colleagues and the public, to create a 'wider multidisciplinary team'. This approach would help broaden the scope of influence and impact any changes made to burn care. In this way, communication, coordination, and shared decision-making between various professionals are fundamental principles of achieving excellent quality of care.

### Bydureon BCise [^114tCaHe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Please keep these instructions to use for your next dose.

- **Common questions and answers**:
	1. **Where is the needle?** The needle is attached to the autoinjector and covered by the orange cap. When you unscrew the orange cap, the green shield keeps the needle covered until you inject. For more information, please see Figure N in Step 3B in the Instructions for Use.

	2. **How do I know if the medicine is fully mixed?** After shaking the autoinjector, look through both sides of the window. You should not see any white medicine along the bottom, top, or sides. If you see white medicine, it is unmixed. To mix, shake the autoinjector hard until the white medicine is no longer on the bottom, top, or sides. The medicine should look even throughout.

	3. **Why do I need to hold the autoinjector upright while removing the orange cap?** Holding the autoinjector with the orange cap straight up helps prevent the medicine from leaking. It is normal to see a few drops of medicine inside the orange cap after you unscrew it.

	4. **Why should I inject my medicine right away after mixing it?** If you do not inject your medicine right away after mixing, the medicine may separate, and you will not get your full dose. You can re-mix your medicine if your autoinjector is in the locked position. However, after you unlock it, you must complete the preparation steps right away and inject to get the full dose. You cannot save it for later use.

### Multidisciplinary approach and the self-training educative pain sensation (STEPS) model for managing orofacial complex regional pain syndrome [^11662y5o]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The STEPS model comprises four key components, each with demonstrated effectiveness in managing CRPS. The first component, pain education, serves as a first-line intervention and has proven efficacy in various chronic pain conditions, including CRPS. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) guidelines strongly recommend this step because it empowers patients through self-management and active engagement.

Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) constitutes the second component of the STEPS model. This case report aligns with other studies by demonstrating the successful application of GMI in the patient's treatment. However, some studies present contrasting results. For instance, Johnson et al. reported conflicting outcomes regarding pain intensity and function in patients across two treatment centers following GMI implementation. This discrepancy might be attributed to the lack of prior patient education before GMI, a crucial step for patient engagement. Furthermore, the study by Johnson et al. employed non-specialized pain rehabilitation teams to administer GMI in person and over the phone. Managing a complex condition like O-CRPS necessitates a qualified pain rehabilitation team capable of delivering this complex intervention while addressing individual patient needs.

- **Multidisciplinary collaboration**: This case report highlights the crucial role of multidisciplinary teams in effectively managing orofacial complex regional pain syndrome (O-CRPS), a complex condition requiring a multifaceted approach.
- **Successful application of the self-training educative pain sensation (STEPS) model**: A trained pain rehabilitation team's success is demonstrated through the application of the STEPS model, emphasizing the importance of a specialized approach tailored to individual patient needs.

### Xigduo XR [^114YXNZt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypoglycemia with concomitant use with insulin or insulin secretagogues**: Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g. sulfonylureas) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Xigduo XR may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

- **Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene)**: Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with Xigduo XR presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue Xigduo XR, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

### Xigduo XR [^115e41We]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

- **Clinical trials with metformin HCl extended-release in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus**: In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of metformin HCl extended-release, diarrhea and nausea/vomiting were reported in more than 5% of metformin-treated patients and more commonly than in placebo-treated patients (9.6% versus 2.6% for diarrhea and 6.5% versus 1.5% for nausea/vomiting). Diarrhea led to discontinuation of study medication in 0.6% of the patients treated with metformin HCl extended-release.

- **Clinical trials with dapagliflozin in adults**: Dapagliflozin has been evaluated in clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in adult patients with heart failure, and in adult patients with chronic kidney disease. The overall safety profile of dapagliflozin was consistent across the studied indications. No new adverse reactions were identified in the DAPA-HF, DELIVER, and DAPA-CKD trials.

- **Pools of placebo-controlled clinical trials for glycemic control in adults**: Data from a prespecified pool of adult patients from eight short-term, placebo-controlled trials of dapagliflozin co-administered with metformin HCl immediate release provide additional insights into glycemic control.

### Proceedings of the 31st European paediatric rheumatology congress: Part 2 [^114oPe6L]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune, inflammatory joint disease. It is the most common rheumatic disease in children and one of the more common chronic illnesses of childhood. Turner's syndrome (TS) is a condition characterized by complete or partial monosomy of the X chromosome and defined by a combination of phenotypic features. Half of the patients with Turner's syndrome have a 45X chromosome complement. Turner syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 2000 to 1 in 2500 live female births.

- **Objectives**: Recent studies have suggested that there is a higher incidence of autoimmune diseases (AD) in people with Turner syndrome. In this paper, we report a 4-year-old Iranian girl with Turner syndrome who was complicated with JIA.

- **Methods**: The patient is a 4-year-old Iranian girl born after an uneventful pregnancy and normal delivery. She was the third child of non-consanguineous, phenotypically normal parents. At the age of 2 years, dysmorphic features were noticed. She also had failure to thrive, ambiguous genitalia, and developmental delay. She was diagnosed with Turner syndrome via a genetic study which revealed a mi…

### Clozaril [^113baFi7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Discuss the following issues with patients and caregivers:

- **Severe neutropenia**: Instruct patients and caregivers beginning treatment with Clozaril about the risk of developing severe neutropenia and infection. Instruct patients to immediately report to their physician any symptom or sign of infection (e.g. flu-like illness; fever; lethargy; general weakness or malaise; mucus membrane ulceration; skin, pharyngeal, vaginal, urinary, or pulmonary infection; or extreme weakness or lethargy) occurring at any time during Clozaril therapy to aid in evaluation for neutropenia and to institute prompt and appropriate management [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.12, 5.14)].

- **Clozapine REMS program**: Inform patients and caregivers that Clozaril is available only through a restricted program called the Clozapine REMS Program. This program is designed to ensure the required blood monitoring in order to reduce the risk of developing severe neutropenia. Advise patients and caregivers of the importance of having blood tested as follows:
	- Weekly blood tests are required for the first 6 months.
	- An ANC is required every 2 weeks for the next 6 months if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the first 6 months of continuous therapy.
	- An ANC is required once every 4 weeks thereafter if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the second 6 months of continuous therapy.

Clozaril is available only from certified pharmacies participating in the program. Provide patients and caregivers with website information and the telephone number on how to obtain the product (www.clozapinerems.com or 1–844–267–8678).

### Xigduo XR [^116MmKBH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Xigduo XR is a combination of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, and metformin hydrochloride (HCl), a biguanide. It is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Dapagliflozin, when used as a component of Xigduo XR, is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to reduce the risk of:

- **Sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure**: In patients with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.
- **Cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visits**: In patients with heart failure.
- **Hospitalization for heart failure**: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and either established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.

- **Limitations of use**:

- Xigduo XR is not recommended for use to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
- Because of the metformin HCl component, the use of Xigduo XR is limited to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for all indications.
- It is not recommended for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in patients with polycystic kidney disease or patients requiring or with a recent history of immunosuppressive therapy for the treatment of kidney disease. Xigduo XR is not expected to be effective in these populations.

### Multimorbidity, comorbidity, frailty, and venous thromboembolism [^113hSSi9]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

Related concepts to multimorbidity include comorbidity and frailty. Comorbidity is defined as any additional ailment co-existing with an index disease, whereas multimorbidity is defined as the co-existence of two or more chronic conditions, where one is not necessarily more central than the others. This distinction, though it might appear trivial, reflects how different parts of the healthcare system handle patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCC).

The concept of multimorbidity is particularly useful in primary care, where the focus may change according to patients' priorities. Conversely, comorbidity is often more applicable in secondary and tertiary care settings, traditionally structured around diseases or organ systems.

Frailty, a related condition, is gaining more attention due to the growing population of older adults worldwide. It is defined as a decline in functioning across several physiological systems, accompanied by increased susceptibility to stressors. Despite numerous efforts, no consensus has yet been reached on a standard instrument to identify frailty. A systematic review indicated that most included articles defined multimorbidity as having two or more diseases. Frailty is most often determined according to the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria, which define it as the presence of at least three of the following: weight loss, low handgrip strength, slow gait speed, exhaustion, and reduced physical activity.

### The impact of multidisciplinary transitional care interventions for complex care needs: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116QcDY4]. The Gerontologist (2025). High credibility.

A recently conducted comprehensive review examined mono- and multidisciplinary transitional care interventions involving 97,408 participants with a wide range of conditions or diseases from 126 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted worldwide. The study investigated whether the effectiveness of transitional care interventions differed depending on the number of components they contained. Interventions with fewer components were associated with relative reductions in hospital readmissions between 18% and 55% compared with usual care. This was less pronounced in more complex interventions, potentially because simpler interventions are easier to implement and execute. On the other hand, interventions with more components were more effective in improving patient satisfaction.

Unlike the interventions evaluated in the study, which often focused solely on improving medication adherence, this meta-analysis included complex interventions addressing patients' physical, cognitive, and/or psychosocial needs through multidisciplinary approaches. As a result, subgroup analyses based on complexity were not performed; instead, interventions were categorized by content to explore their effects on readmissions and health-related outcomes. For most comparisons, no significant differences were found between intervention types. However, for physical performance, type 3 interventions — those led by a multidisciplinary team and including comprehensive recovery pathways and outpatient rehabilitation — demonstrated notable benefits.

### Characteristics of goal-setting tools in adult rehabilitation: A scoping review [^1179h8HY]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

This scoping review aims to map the literature on goal-setting tools in adult rehabilitation, exploring their characteristics, target users, and supporting evidence to inform practice and future research in this area.

- **Methods**: We completed a comprehensive search of four databases to identify relevant articles on tools for goal setting in rehabilitation. We followed Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review process to guide article selection, data extraction, and data analysis.

- **Results**: We identified a total of 165 studies that reported on 55 different goal-setting tools, including tools for goal selection and goal documentation (n = 31), goal setting and intervention planning (n = 15), and for measuring the quality of the goal-setting process (n = 9). Over half of the tools were primarily designed for use in the rehabilitation of physical disabilities (n = 32). Some tools fell under multiple sub-categories based on their characteristics as follows: 22 framework tools, 12 interview tools, 9 outcome measurement tools for goal achievement, 6 outcome measurement tools for goal quality, and 25 documentation tools. The majority of goal-setting instruments targeted goals at the level of activity and participation (n = 51) and aimed to facilitate a client-centered or shared decision-making approach to rehabilitation planning (n = 46).

- **Conclusions**: This study provides a comprehensive overview of existing goal-setting tools, highlighting their characteristics, target users, and identified needs. These findings can enhance practitioners' awareness of the range of goal-setting tools available.

### Multimodal home-based rehabilitation intervention after discharge from inpatient geriatric rehabilitation (GeRas): Study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^114nnP6t]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). High credibility.

Limitations in mobility and the activities of daily living (ADL) are highly prevalent in older adults and may lead to a loss of independence in this population. A decrease in muscle mass, muscle strength, and flexibility, as well as impairments in balance and coordination, are likely to compromise the functionality and mobility of older people. Acute illness and hospitalization pose a particular threat to the mobility of older adults and may precipitate a decline in functionality and an increase in the risk of admission to long-term care facilities. Hence, strategies to maintain mobility and independence are of great relevance to foster the quality of life in older adults.

Rehabilitation is a key strategy to achieve the third of seventeen Sustainable Development Goals of the World Health Organization (WHO): "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages". The WHO defines rehabilitation as "a set of interventions designed to optimize functioning and reduce disability in individuals with health conditions in interaction with their environment". Rehabilitation addresses limitations in daily physical, mental, and social functioning caused by aging or an acute or chronic illness. Geriatric rehabilitation (GR) aims to promote activity and maintain the functional reserves of older adults to optimize social participation and to prevent disability. While there is a growing demand for GR, access to and the duration of GR services are limited due to financial restraints in most health-care systems.

### Percocet [^1151JHaV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during the use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration, meaning a higher dose of the drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of the drug.

Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity, such as naloxone, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics, including pentazocine, butorphanol, and nalbuphine, or partial agonists like buprenorphine. Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use.

The abrupt discontinuation of Percocet in a patient physically dependent on opioids is not advised. Rapid tapering of Percocet in such patients may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.

When discontinuing Percocet, it is essential to gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of Percocet the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient.

### Codeine sulfate [^1147Y69f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Withdrawal**: Do not abruptly discontinue codeine sulfate tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing codeine sulfate tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of codeine in such patients may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and the return of pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

	- Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g. pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g. buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including codeine sulfate tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Risks of driving and operating machinery**: Codeine sulfate tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of codeine sulfate tablets and know how they will react to the medication.

### Aridol bronchial challenge test kit [^115JzFvK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Table 2 displays the combined common adverse reactions (≥ 1%) within a day after bronchial challenge testing with Aridol or methacholine in the overall population for Studies 1 and 2.

The maximum reduction in FEV1 following bronchial challenge testing with Aridol was 46%, compared to 54% for exercise testing and 67% for the methacholine challenge. The incidences of decreases in FEV1 ≥ 30% and ≥ 60% following Aridol, methacholine, and exercise challenges for Studies 1 and 2 are shown in Table 3.

There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. The clinical trials did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently compared to subjects below 65 years of age.

- **Pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years**: Overall, the types and severities of adverse reactions in children were similar to those observed in the adult population. As in the adult population, the adverse reactions of pharyngolaryngeal pain, nausea, and headache were more common, with incidences of 4%, 3%, and 3%, respectively. There were no major differences in the types of adverse reactions observed in children aged 6–11 years compared to adolescents aged 12–17 years.

The decrease in FEV1 in pediatric patients and adolescents who received the Aridol bronchial challenge test was similar to that of the adult population, with 5%, 15%, and 9% of pediatric patients who had bronchial challenge testing with Aridol, methacholine, and exercise, respectively, experiencing a reduction in FEV1 ≥ 30%.

### Rehabilitation needs screening to identify potential beneficiaries: a scoping review [^1135H2me]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

We systematically searched the following databases for studies published from January 1, 2010, to February 3, 2023: CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), and PsycINFO (Ovid). The search was restricted to 13 years to provide an overview of available recent tools and settings of use. An experienced medical information specialist developed and tested the search strategy in collaboration with the other authors. The strategy was peer-reviewed by a second information specialist, which resulted in one suggested revision. Consistent with scoping review methodology, the search strategy was broad and inclusive, utilizing terminology such as rehabilitation, screening tools, and needs assessment. MeSH terms and free-text terms linked with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) were used. The search was not limited to any particular study design and was restricted to the English language, excluding grey literature. The complete search strategy is provided in online supplemental file 1.

The paper selection was conducted in two phases:

- **Title and abstract screening**: Search results from all databases were imported into an online systematic review software called Eppi Reviewer. After deduplication, two reviewers — a junior physiotherapist doctoral candidate and a senior rehabilitation physician in public health — used eligibility criteria to independently screen titles and abstracts.

### Conjupri [^1114SjsU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Conjupri® is a calcium channel blocker and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive and antianginal agents for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of both fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.

- **Hypertension**: Conjupri® is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and patients 6 years and older, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been observed in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including levamlodipine.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction that is primarily responsible for those benefits.

### Farxiga [^111JiHBv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Farxiga is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor indicated for several conditions:

- **Reducing risk in chronic kidney disease**: To reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.

- **Reducing risk in heart failure**: To reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visits in adults with heart failure.

- **Reducing risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus**: To reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and either established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.

- **Improving glycemic control**: As an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Limitations of use**:

- Farxiga is not recommended to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

- It is not recommended for use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m², as Farxiga is likely to be ineffective in this setting based on its mechanism of action.

- The medication is not recommended for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in patients with polycystic kidney disease or those requiring, or with a recent history of, immunosuppressive therapy for kidney disease. Farxiga is not expected to be effective in these populations.

### Exploring fathers' experiences of caring for a child with complex care needs through ethnography and arts-based methodologies [^112xue8X]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Fathers in this study were committed to being there for their child with complex care needs through active engagement in activities and by being physically present with and for the child. The concept of "being there" has been discussed in past work detailing the caring experience of fathers of children with complex chronic conditions, terminal illnesses, disabilities, as well as in the fathering literature about typically developing children. The enriching details we have provided of how fathers strived to be there for their child are of significance to service providers and programming designed to support fathers of children with complex care needs, especially those who are struggling to "be there" for their child.

In this study, we documented fathers' active involvement in caring activities, expression of admiration and pride in their children, and meaning-making. All these activities have been documented in past research examining fathers' experiences in this context. Our study provides new insights about how fathers make participation in everyday life accessible and inclusive for their children. Fathers made adaptations and readjustments to physical spaces, obtained needed devices and tools, sought out accessible activities, and engaged in various activities with their child to this end. Fathers also noted they often encountered inaccessible physical environments (e.g. buildings, public facilities such as hockey arenas), transportation (e.g. personal vehicles), and urban design (e.g. snow-covered sidewalks in the winter, parking spots).

### Anafranil [^113s6kfo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical worsening and suicide risk – Patients, their families, and caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the following signs, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down:

- **Emotional and behavioral signs**: anxiety, agitation, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity
- **Psychological symptoms**: panic attacks, insomnia, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania
- **Mood changes**: other unusual behavioral changes, worsening of depression, suicidal ideation

Families and caregivers should monitor for such symptoms daily, as changes may occur abruptly. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, particularly if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's initial symptoms. These symptoms may be linked to an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior, indicating the need for close monitoring and potentially medication adjustments.

Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients prescribed Anafranil:

- **Risk of seizure**: See further details in the WARNINGS section.

- **Sexual dysfunction**: There is a relatively high incidence of sexual dysfunction among males (see Sexual Dysfunction).

- **Performance of complex tasks**: As Anafranil may impair mental and/or physical abilities and is associated with a risk of seizures, patients should be cautioned about performing complex and hazardous tasks (see WARNINGS).

- **Consumption of substances**: Patients should be cautioned about using alcohol, barbiturates, or other CNS depressants concurrently, as Anafranil can interact with these substances.

### Onfi [^115HoaBp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Risks from concomitant use with opioids**: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including ONFI, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe ONFI concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when ONFI is used with opioids [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: The use of benzodiazepines, including ONFI, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. Before prescribing ONFI and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction.

### Adakveo [^113LGers]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The main efficacy results of the pivotal study, SUSTAIN, are summarized in Table 4.

- **Stand**: The efficacy of two doses of Adakveo, with or without HU/HC, was evaluated, but not established, in the STAND trial [NCT03814746], a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical study in adolescent and adult sickle cell disease patients with a history of VOCs. The efficacy results of the STAND study are summarized in Table 6 below.

In this study, VOC was defined as a pain crisis (acute onset of pain for which there is no other medically determined explanation other than vaso-occlusion) which requires therapy with oral or parenteral opioids or parenteral NSAIDs. Acute chest syndrome (ACS), priapism, and hepatic or splenic sequestration were considered VOCs in this study.

A total of 252 sickle cell disease patients were randomized to the study: 85 in the placebo arm, 84 in the Adakveo 5 mg/kg arm, and 83 in the Adakveo 7.5 mg/kg arm. The 7.5 mg/kg Adakveo dose is not approved and is not recommended for use. Demographic and other baseline characteristics were similar among the treatment groups (see Table 5).

The percentages for subgroups of race and genotype do not add up to 100% due to rounding to one decimal place. The results of the efficacy analysis did not confirm the statistical superiority of Adakveo over placebo in reducing VOCs leading to a healthcare visit over the first year post-randomization.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111arvZd]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for lower extremity amputation, specifically with respect to risk assessment, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive foot evaluation in patients with diabetes at least annually to identify risk factors for ulcers and amputations. Foot inspections should be performed at every visit in patients with evidence of sensory loss or a history of ulceration or amputation. Additionally, conduct annual 10-g monofilament testing in all patients with diabetes to identify feet at risk for ulceration and amputation.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypertension, specifically concerning indications for treatment and high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, the 2025 guidelines by AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AHA/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM recommend initiating pharmacotherapy to lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension who do not have clinical CVD but have diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or increased short-term CVD risk. This risk is defined by an estimated 10-year CVD risk of ≥ 7.5%, according to the PREVENT estimation model, when the average systolic blood pressure (SBP) is ≥ 130 mmHg or the average diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is ≥ 80 mmHg. This approach aims to reduce the risk of CVD events and total mortality.

### Kombiglyze XR [^112LYXXk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Therefore, it is important to assess renal function more frequently in the elderly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- **Saxagliptin**: In the seven double-blind, controlled clinical safety and efficacy trials of saxagliptin, a total of 4,751 (42.0%) out of 11,301 patients randomized to saxagliptin were 65 years and over, and 1,210 (10.7%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients.

	- **Metformin HCI**: Controlled clinical trials of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range. This reflects the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy, along with the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Renal impairment**:

	- **Saxagliptin**: In a 12-week randomized placebo-controlled trial, saxagliptin 2.5 mg was administered to 85 patients with moderate (n = 48) or severe (n = 18) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (n = 19) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo.

### Monoferric [^114xnqtH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Geriatric use**: Of the 3,934 patients in clinical studies of Monoferric, 29% were 65 years and over, while 13% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experiences have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

### Xigduoxr [^116gZsYu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Time to the first occurrence of the composite of cardiovascular death**: The composite endpoint includes hospitalization for heart failure or urgent heart failure visit. In the DAPA-HF trial and DELIVER trial, the urgent heart failure visit is defined as an urgent, unplanned assessment by a physician, for example, in an Emergency Department, requiring treatment for worsening heart failure (other than just an increase in oral diuretics). In the DAPA-HF trial, the cardiovascular death component of the primary endpoint included death of undetermined cause, whereas in the DELIVER trial, it excluded death of undetermined cause. Patients at risk refer to the number of patients at risk at the beginning of the period. HR stands for hazard ratio, CI stands for confidence interval, and CV stands for cardiovascular.

The treatment effect of dapagliflozin on the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, or urgent heart failure was consistent across the LVEF range as evaluated in the DAPA-HF and DELIVER trials (Figure 8).

- **Treatment effects for primary composite endpoint by LVEF**: Within the DAPA-HF trial, one patient had an LVEF greater than 40. In the DELIVER trial, four patients had an LVEF of 40 or less. In the DAPA-HF trial, the 5th and 95th percentiles of LVEF were 20 and 40, respectively. In the DELIVER trial, they were 42 and 70, respectively.

In the DAPA-HF trial, the treatment benefit of dapagliflozin 10 mg in reducing the incidence of the primary composite endpoint was consistent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.63, 0.9].

Regarding medical management for asthma, particularly in relation to the management of exacerbations within the emergency department setting (evaluation), the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining close monitoring of oxygen saturation, preferably by pulse oximetry. Oxygen saturation levels below 92% should be viewed as a predictor of the need for hospitalization in pediatric patients. Saturation levels below 90% should be seen as a signal for the need for aggressive therapy in both pediatric and adult patients.

### Apadaz [^115GgEqt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during the use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration, meaning that a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity, such as naloxone, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics like pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine, or partial agonists like buprenorphine. Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use.

Avoid abruptly discontinuing Apadaz in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of Apadaz in such patients may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and risks of suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be misinterpreted as drug-seeking behavior for abuse.

When discontinuing Apadaz, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the dose of Apadaz the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient.

### Determinants of healthy lifestyle behaviours in colorectal cancer survivors: A systematic review [^114QzG56]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Low credibility.

Interventions that aim to change health behaviours, such as healthy eating and physical activity, are often complex interventions. These are interventions that contain several interacting components, involving a range of behaviours, expertise, and skills. They target a number of groups, organizational levels, or settings, and allow a certain flexibility or tailoring of the intervention or its components. The use of a structured intervention development protocol can help to overcome the challenges of designing and implementing a complex intervention by establishing how the intervention works and evaluating which components contribute to the effectiveness of a trial. An essential step in the design of a behaviour change intervention is the identification and selection of relevant determinants of that specific behaviour. Insight into which determinants are applicable in CRC survivors gives further direction to which factors should be targeted to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviours.

CRC survivors who completed treatment might have different factors influencing health behaviours than CRC survivors undergoing treatment. These factors include dealing with a (temporary) stoma and treatment-related side effects. Furthermore, the perspective of CRC survivors might shift from focusing on survival to dealing with the aftermath of the disease, such as the fear of recurrence, dealing with physical symptoms, and returning to work. In systematic reviews, it is therefore important to clearly state where the CRC survivors are in their cancer journey.

### Rehabilitation needs screening to identify potential beneficiaries: A scoping review [^112MUReG]. BMJ Public Health (2024). Low credibility.

Using Global Burden of Disease data, a recent work estimated that 2.4 billion people have health conditions that could potentially benefit from rehabilitation. However, to bridge the gap between service needs and provision, these estimates of rehabilitation needs based on epidemiological data need to be complemented with more accurate measurement. Screening tools with good sensitivity and specificity play an essential role in identifying persons who are in need of specific health services, but at the time of writing, there is no evidence synthesis about screening tools used in rehabilitation.

The objective of this scoping review is to identify and compare the content of rehabilitation need screening tools and assessments used to select rehabilitation beneficiaries, and to describe the context of their use. The synthesis can guide stakeholders in selecting screening tools for rehabilitation needs, as well as criteria used to select a potential rehabilitation beneficiary. Given the efforts for strengthening rehabilitation in health systems, this scoping review is also fundamental to evaluate whether new screening tools for rehabilitation are needed and to inform future tool developments. The design of this scoping review is aligned with previously published reviews on screening tools.

### Nesina [^116hbAgo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial (EXAMINE) was conducted to evaluate the cardiovascular risk of Nesina. The trial compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) between Nesina (N = 2701) and placebo (N = 2679) when added to standard of care therapies for diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD). The trial was event-driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued.

Eligible patients were adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had inadequate glycemic control at baseline (e.g. HbA1c > 6.5%) and had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome event (e.g. acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) 15 to 90 days prior to randomization. The dose of Nesina was based on estimated renal function at baseline per dosage and administration recommendations (see Dosage and Administration 2.2). The average time between an acute coronary syndrome event and randomization was approximately 48 days.

The mean age of the population was 61 years. Most patients were male (68%) and White (73%), and were recruited from outside of the United States (86%). Asian and Black or African American patients contributed 20% and 4% of the total population, respectively. At the time of randomization, patients had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for approximately 9 years, 87% had a prior myocardial infarction, and 14% were smokers. Hypertension (83%) and renal impairment (27% with an eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min/1.7) were prevalent in the study population.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11247AmX]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, and more specifically with respect to the management of exacerbations in a primary care setting, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend the following steps. Practitioners should elicit a brief focused history, perform a relevant physical examination, and obtain objective measurements concurrently with the prompt initiation of therapy in patients with asthma exacerbations presenting to primary care.

- **History**: Timing of the onset and cause (if known) of the present exacerbation; severity of asthma symptoms, including any limiting exercise or disturbing sleep; any symptoms of anaphylaxis; any risk factors for asthma-related death; all reliever and maintenance medications, including doses and devices prescribed, adherence pattern, any recent dose changes, and response to therapy.

- **Physical examination**: Signs of exacerbation severity and vital signs (level of consciousness, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, ability to complete sentences, use of accessory muscles, wheezing); complicating factors (such as anaphylaxis, pneumonia, pneumothorax); signs of alternative conditions explaining acute breathlessness (such as cardiac failure, inducible laryngeal obstruction, inhaled foreign body, or pulmonary embolism).

- **Objective measurements**: Pulse oximetry (saturation levels); peak expiratory flow in patients older than 5 years.

### Kalydeco [^1139dVh4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 150 mg of Kalydeco (n = 34) or a placebo (n = 35) every 12 hours with fat-containing food for 24 weeks, in addition to their prescribed CF therapies. The primary efficacy endpoint was improvement in lung function, determined by the mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through 24 weeks of treatment. The treatment difference for the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24 was 2.1 percentage points. This analysis, conducted with the full analysis set which included all 69 patients, did not reach statistical significance.

- **Other efficacy variables**: These included the absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through Week 24, improvement in cystic fibrosis respiratory symptoms through Week 24 as assessed by the CFQ-R respiratory domain score, absolute change in body mass index (BMI) at Week 24, and time to first pulmonary exacerbation. The overall treatment difference for the absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 24 was 0.3 kg/m², and the calculated hazard ratio for time to first pulmonary exacerbation was 0.93. These were not statistically significant.

Statistically significant improvements in clinical efficacy (FEV1, CFQ-R respiratory domain score) were seen in several subgroup analyses, and decreases in sweat chloride were observed in all subgroups. The mean baseline sweat chloride for all patients was 70 mmol/L. Subgroups analyzed included those based on age, lung function, and poly-T status.

### Pentazocine and naloxone [^1167YPDm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Individually titrate Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as reassessing for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.

If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets dosage. If, after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between the management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

- **Safe reduction or discontinuation of pentazocine and naloxone tablets**: Do not abruptly discontinue Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioids.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^1172HN9b]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically concerning the management of hypertension in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. This approach aims to reduce heart failure hospitalizations and lower blood pressure in patients with symptomatic HFpEF who have blood pressure above the target level.

### Butrans [^115faUm1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Do not abruptly discontinue BUTRANS in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in such patients has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. It has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients might also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.

When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking BUTRANS, consider a variety of factors. These include the total daily dose of opioid (including BUTRANS) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care and agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.

### Apadaz [^111xYYKE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Do not abruptly discontinue APADAZ in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in these patients has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Additionally, rapid discontinuation has been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking behavior for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.

When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking APADAZ, various factors should be considered. These include the total daily dose of opioid (including APADAZ) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care for the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that both patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic.

- **Treatment due to a suspected substance use disorder**: When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2024 [^111Ewesy]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity, particularly in the context of assessing obesity-related complications and diabetes mellitus, the ADA 2024 guidelines recommend considering testing for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in asymptomatic adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m², or ≥ 23 kg/m² for Asian American individuals) and have at least one risk factor:

- **First-degree relative with diabetes**: This increases the genetic predisposition to the disease.
- **High-risk race/ethnicity**: This includes African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, and Pacific Islander groups.
- **History of cardiovascular disease (CVD)**: Previous CVD events warrant increased vigilance.
- **Hypertension**: Blood pressure levels ≥ 130/80 mmHg or ongoing therapy for hypertension are risk factors.
- **High triglyceride levels**: HDL-C > 250 mg/dL (> 2.8 mmol/L) may indicate increased risk.
- **Females with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: This condition is associated with increased insulin resistance.
- **Physical inactivity**: A sedentary lifestyle contributes to the risk.
- **Other clinical conditions related to insulin resistance**: Conditions such as severe obesity and acanthosis nigricans suggest underlying metabolic issues.

These guidelines emphasize a proactive approach to identifying diabetes risks in individuals with obesity, thereby enabling earlier interventions.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: A clinical practice guideline [^115kJsAP]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for rotator cuff disorders, specifically in relation to history and physical examination, the APTA 2025 guidelines recommend the following steps:

- **Physical assessment**: Conduct a comprehensive physical assessment and differential diagnosis for an adult patient experiencing shoulder pain.

- **Observations and measurements**: Observe the shoulder complex for any deformity, muscle atrophy, or swelling. Measure both active and passive range of motion (ROM) and assess muscle strength.

- **Palpation and special tests**: Perform palpation of shoulder structures and consider clinical orthopedic special tests, tailored to the patient's condition and diagnostic reasoning.

- **Screening examination**: Include a screening examination of the cervical spine to rule out related issues.

### Development and validation of the physical exercise program "Active Mums" for postpartum recovery: Application of the CReDECI-2 guidelines [^1122eHeT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

Evidence supports the importance of developing specific exercise programs for postpartum recovery with the goal of returning to pre-pregnancy condition. However, the literature search revealed that postpartum exercise-based interventions are lacking. Moreover, interventions in physical activity and exercise lack homogeneous methods of development, implementation, and evaluation due to their complexity, and there are no structured models of intervention specifically for the postpartum period.

Therefore, it becomes extremely important to develop and validate reproducible and effective physical exercise programs that promote health and physical fitness during the postpartum period. A physical exercise program can be considered a complex intervention, as it is adapted to a specific population and environment, and it is influenced by several components regarding efficacy and safety. Thus, the need arises to develop and validate well-defined and replicable exercise protocols to fill the identified gaps. The CReDECI-2 has the potential to help professionals in the development and planning of complex interventions, such as an exercise program, thereby filling these gaps. A pilot study was developed to evaluate the feasibility of the postpartum exercise program and its potential impact on maternal health and fitness parameters.

The main limitation of the study is that, although the three stages of CReDECI-2 were followed, this process does not guarantee the effectiveness of the intervention. Another limitation is that the pilot intervention included a small number of participants, which may affect the robustness of the findings.

### Fentanyl transdermal [^113sRMwZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Do not abruptly discontinue the fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in such patients has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Furthermore, rapid discontinuation has been linked to attempts to seek other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be misconstrued as drug-seeking behavior for abuse. Patients might also resort to treating their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.

When the decision is made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient using the fentanyl transdermal system, various factors should be considered. These include the total daily opioid dose (including the fentanyl transdermal system), the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, as well as the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is essential to ensure ongoing patient care and to establish an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that both patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic.

If opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient or refer them for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should incorporate evidence-based approaches, such as medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.

### Aridol bronchial challenge test kit [^117JoEpR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of ARIDOL for assessing bronchial hyperresponsiveness in adult and pediatric patients aged 6 years or older, who do not have clinically apparent asthma, have been established. This use is supported by evidence from two clinical studies, which included 246 pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years.

The mean and median maximum percentage reduction in FEV1 in patients with a positive ARIDOL challenge test in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years (19% and 18%, respectively) showed no apparent difference compared to the adult population (19% and 18%, respectively).

The safety profile of the ARIDOL bronchial challenge test in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years was similar to that in the adult population in two clinical studies.

Safety and effectiveness of ARIDOL have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years old. Bronchial challenge testing with ARIDOL should not be performed in children under 6 years of age due to their inability to provide reliable spirometric measurements.

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies of ARIDOL did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 50 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients.

- **Hepatic and renal impairment**: Formal pharmacokinetic studies with mannitol, the active ingredient in ARIDOL, have not been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, an increase in systemic exposure of mannitol can be expected.

### Dupixent [^112mFfWY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the treatment of exacerbations in adult subjects with COPD, the primary endpoint for the BOREAS and NOTUS trials was the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations during the 52-week treatment period. In both trials, Dupixent demonstrated a significant reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations compared to placebo when added to background maintenance therapy.

- **Risk reduction**: Treatment with Dupixent decreased the risk of a moderate to severe COPD exacerbation as measured by time to first exacerbation when compared with placebo in BOREAS (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.98) and NOTUS (HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.89).

For lung function in adult subjects with COPD, both trials (BOREAS and NOTUS) demonstrated numerical improvement in post-bronchodilator FEV1 at weeks 12 and 52 compared to placebo when added to background maintenance therapy. Significant improvements of similar magnitude were observed in change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at weeks 12 and 52 in subjects treated with Dupixent compared to placebo across both trials.

- **Health-related quality of life**: In both trials (BOREAS and NOTUS), the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score responder rate (defined as the proportion of subjects with SGRQ improvement from baseline of at least 4 points) at week 52 was evaluated. In BOREAS, the responder rate was 51% for subjects treated with Dupixent versus 43% for placebo (N = 939, odds ratio: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.89). In NOTUS, the responder rate was 51% for subjects treated with Dupixent versus 47%.

### Ponvory [^112U4CUm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

If four or more consecutive daily doses are missed during treatment initiation or maintenance treatment, reinitiate on Day 1 of the dose titration with a new starter pack and follow first-dose monitoring recommendations [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Respiratory effects**: Dose-dependent reductions in forced expiratory volume over one second (FEV1) and reductions in diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were observed in Ponvory-treated patients, mostly occurring in the first month after treatment initiation. In Study 1, the reduction from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at two years was 8.3% in Ponvory-treated patients compared to 4.4% in patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. Seven patients in Study 1 discontinued Ponvory due to pulmonary adverse events. There is insufficient information to determine the reversibility of the decrease in FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) after treatment discontinuation. Ponvory should be used with caution in patients with severe respiratory disease, such as pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Spirometric evaluation of respiratory function should be performed during therapy with Ponvory if clinically indicated.
