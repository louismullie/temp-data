## Question

what is the role of aspirin in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about aspirin's role in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, including mechanism, magnitude of benefit, dosing, duration, special populations, and how to distinguish this from primary prevention guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining secondary prevention and confirming the clinical contexts where aspirin is indicated. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic mechanism that plausibly explains benefit in established atherothrombotic disease. Next, I will quantify benefits and risks from high-quality meta-analyses and landmark trials. After that, I need to check dosing, formulation, and duration, including any evolving nuances in chronic coronary syndromes. Finally, I will consider special populations, contrast with primary prevention, and synthesize practical recommendations with attention to bleeding risk and guideline concordance [^111oBoek] [^112PpSbE].

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope of secondary prevention so I don't conflate it with primary prevention. Secondary prevention refers to preventing recurrent events in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including prior myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or TIA, symptomatic peripheral artery disease, or coronary revascularization with stenting or bypass surgery, where aspirin has long been foundational therapy [^111oBoek] [^112PpSbE].

> I need to verify the mechanistic basis that makes aspirin particularly valuable in established disease. Aspirin irreversibly acetylates platelet COX-1, suppressing thromboxane A2 and thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation; in patients with established atherothrombosis, this directly targets the final common pathway of arterial thrombosis, which explains consistent benefits across vascular beds, whereas in low-risk primary prevention populations the absolute thrombotic risk is lower and bleeding risk becomes relatively more prominent [^112Qn4i5] [^116PX8t1].

> Next, I should review the magnitude of benefit from high-quality evidence. The Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of 16 secondary prevention trials in 17,000 high-risk patients showed a 20% proportional reduction in serious vascular events, driven by fewer myocardial infarctions and strokes, with a smaller absolute increase in major extracranial bleeding; importantly, the absolute reduction in vascular events far exceeded the absolute increase in bleeding in this high-risk population, establishing a favorable net clinical benefit for secondary prevention [^111oBoek] [^113SWVsw]. Wait, let me verify the absolute numbers: yes, serious vascular events fell from 8.2% to 6.7% per year on aspirin, with a corresponding reduction in coronary events and stroke, confirming the clinical relevance of benefit in established disease [^111oBoek].

> I should confirm dosing and formulation because higher doses can increase bleeding without improving efficacy. The optimal long-term dose is low-dose aspirin, typically 75–100 mg daily; higher doses do not enhance antithrombotic efficacy but do increase gastrointestinal bleeding, and enteric coating does not reliably mitigate bleeding risk while potentially delaying onset, so uncoated low-dose aspirin is generally preferred when used chronically [^115zxghe] [^111zWgQn]. Hold on, I should verify whether any subgroup needs higher dosing; contemporary analyses and guidelines consistently support 75–100 mg daily as standard for secondary prevention unless there is a specific short-term indication for higher dosing, which is uncommon outside acute settings [^115zxghe] [^111zWgQn].

> Now, duration of therapy and evolving paradigms in chronic coronary syndromes require careful consideration. Historically, lifelong aspirin has been standard after an index event, but emerging data suggest that in some stable patients — particularly older adults at higher bleeding risk or those requiring oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation — tailored strategies that de-emphasize or discontinue aspirin may be reasonable after an initial period of dual antiplatelet therapy or when anticoagulation is indicated, prompting a patient-specific reassessment rather than a blanket lifelong mandate [^112aB6Fb] [^1172Z1cx]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should emphasize that this is an area of active reappraisal; for most patients with established CAD, continued low-dose aspirin remains appropriate unless bleeding risk or competing antithrombotic regimens alter the risk–benefit calculus [^112aB6Fb].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In patients with prior ischemic stroke or TIA, aspirin reduces recurrent vascular events and is first-line unless contraindicated; in symptomatic peripheral artery disease, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel is recommended; in diabetes with established ASCVD, aspirin for secondary prevention is indicated with attention to bleeding risk; and in older adults, I should balance ischemic benefit against higher gastrointestinal bleeding risk, sometimes favoring gastroprotection or dose adjustment when appropriate [^115efeN3] [^111fUUTu] [^115W4fh1]. I should double-check that these align with guideline direction; yes, major guidelines endorse aspirin broadly for secondary prevention while encouraging individualized bleeding risk mitigation in older or high-risk patients [^115efeN3] [^111fUUTu].

> But wait, what if someone conflates secondary prevention with primary prevention where the calculus differs substantially. I need to ensure I clearly distinguish these. In primary prevention, contemporary trials and meta-analyses show only modest reductions in nonfatal MI at best, with no consistent mortality benefit and increased major bleeding, leading USPSTF and ACC/AHA to recommend against routine aspirin initiation in most adults, especially those over 60 or with elevated bleeding risk; shared decision-making is advised only in select higher-risk 40–70-year-olds without bleeding risk, underscoring that secondary prevention benefits do not translate to net benefit in low-risk populations [^117ScdpR] [^1126UTd9] [^116hjCXJ]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of bleeding risk; pooled analyses consistently show about a 40–50% relative increase in major bleeding with aspirin in primary prevention, which offsets the small absolute cardiovascular benefit in low-risk cohorts [^116hjCXJ] [^114EjncG].

> I will now examine practical implementation details to close the loop. Aspirin should be initiated promptly after an acute coronary syndrome or ischemic stroke when not contraindicated, continued through the indicated antiplatelet phase, and then maintained long term at 75–100 mg daily in stable secondary prevention unless bleeding risk, drug interactions, or evolving antithrombotic strategies dictate otherwise; clinicians should screen for gastrointestinal bleeding risk and consider gastroprotection in high-risk patients, and periodically reassess the need for ongoing aspirin as patient risk profiles change over time [^112PpSbE] [^111zWgQn] [^112aB6Fb]. Let me reconsider whether any competing antiplatelet strategies supplant aspirin monotherapy in stable secondary prevention; outside of defined DAPT indications after stenting or acute coronary syndromes, single antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin remains the default for most patients with established ASCVD [^116xLPsx].

> In summary, aspirin remains a cornerstone of secondary prevention because it directly inhibits platelet thrombosis in patients with established atherothrombotic disease, yields substantial reductions in recurrent MI, stroke, and vascular death with a favorable net clinical benefit at low dose, and is recommended broadly across guidelines; however, I need to ensure ongoing vigilance for bleeding risk, reassess lifelong use in light of evolving evidence and patient-specific factors, and strictly avoid extrapolating these benefits to primary prevention where the risk–benefit balance is unfavorable for most adults today [^111oBoek] [^115zxghe] [^117ScdpR].

---

Aspirin is a **cornerstone of secondary prevention** in cardiovascular disease (CVD) [^1172Z1cx], providing a **20% relative risk reduction** in serious vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) among patients with established CVD [^115aFQvm]. It is indicated for patients with prior MI, ischemic stroke/TIA, or peripheral artery disease [^112PpSbE], and is recommended indefinitely unless contraindicated [^116xLPsx]. Low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) is preferred due to lower bleeding risk [^115zxghe]; higher doses do not improve efficacy but increase bleeding [^111zWgQn]. The absolute benefit is greatest in high-risk patients, while bleeding risk rises with age, prior GI bleeding, or anticoagulant use [^notfound]. Aspirin is not routinely indicated for primary prevention because bleeding risks often outweigh benefits [^112E294o] [^117ScdpR].

---

## Mechanism of action

Aspirin **irreversibly inhibits platelet COX-1**, reducing thromboxane A2 and platelet aggregation [^115ub5qY], thereby lowering thrombotic risk in atherosclerotic disease [^116PX8t1].

---

## Clinical evidence for secondary prevention

Multiple large randomized trials and meta-analyses demonstrate **substantial benefit** in secondary prevention:

- **Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (ATC)**: 20% relative risk reduction in serious vascular events (MI, stroke, vascular death) in patients with established CVD [^111oBoek] [^111MesTc].
- **Meta-analyses**: Consistent ~20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in secondary prevention populations [^111wE4gP].
- **Individual trials**: Significant reductions in recurrent MI, stroke, and vascular death across diverse CVD populations [^115aFQvm].

---

## Indications for aspirin use in secondary prevention

Aspirin is indicated for the following **clinical scenarios**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| Prior myocardial infarction (MI) | Strongly recommended [^116xLPsx] |
| Prior ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) | Strongly recommended [^115efeN3] |
| Established peripheral artery disease (PAD) | Strongly recommended [^notfound] |
| Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery | Recommended [^111MesTc] |
| Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement | Recommended (typically as part of dual antiplatelet therapy) [^116xLPsx] |

---

## Recommended aspirin dosage

Low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) is preferred for secondary prevention because it achieves maximal antiplatelet effect with minimal bleeding risk [^115zxghe]; higher doses (e.g. 325 mg/day) do not improve efficacy and increase gastrointestinal bleeding [^115zxghe].

---

## Duration of aspirin therapy

Aspirin is generally continued indefinitely in secondary prevention unless contraindications arise (e.g. allergy, major bleeding) [^111MesTc]. In patients undergoing PCI, dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) is recommended for 12 months, followed by aspirin monotherapy indefinitely if tolerated [^116xLPsx].

---

## Risks and contraindications

While aspirin confers significant benefits, it also carries risks — most notably **major gastrointestinal bleeding** [^111oBoek]. Risk factors include age ≥ 70 years, prior GI bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, concurrent anticoagulant or corticosteroid use, and chronic NSAID use. Contraindications include allergy to aspirin, active bleeding, severe hepatic or renal impairment, and certain hematologic disorders.

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Increased bleeding risk necessitates careful risk–benefit assessment; consider proton pump inhibitor (PPI) co-therapy [^115y6ebB].
- **Patients with atrial fibrillation**: Aspirin is inferior to oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention; use anticoagulants when indicated [^114pN4bf].
- **Patients undergoing surgery**: Aspirin may be continued perioperatively in high-risk cardiac patients, but individualized decisions are required [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other antiplatelet agents

Aspirin remains the **first-line antiplatelet agent** for secondary prevention due to its proven efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness [^111oBoek]. P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) are typically reserved for acute coronary syndromes or as part of dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI [^116xLPsx].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Major society guidelines consistently **recommend aspirin** for secondary prevention in patients with established CVD, including the American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^114pN4bf].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Recent studies have questioned the universal need for lifelong aspirin in all secondary prevention patients, particularly in the era of modern risk-factor management and alternative antiplatelet strategies [^112aB6Fb]. Nonetheless, current evidence and guidelines continue to support aspirin as a cornerstone of secondary prevention [^116xLPsx].

---

Aspirin is a **cornerstone of secondary prevention** in CVD, providing substantial reductions in recurrent events. Low-dose aspirin is preferred, and therapy is generally lifelong unless contraindicated. The absolute benefit is greatest in high-risk patients, while bleeding risk must be considered, especially in older adults and those with prior GI bleeding.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis with a particular focus on subgroups [^114EjncG]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the benefit-risk ratio of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD with a particular focus on subgroups.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD versus control and including at least 1000 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and net clinical benefit. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Subgroup analyses involving sex, concomitant statin treatment, diabetes, and smoking were performed.

Results

Thirteen randomized controlled trials comprising 164,225 patients were included. The risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was similar for aspirin and control groups (RR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93–1.02; RR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.90–1.08; respectively). Aspirin reduced the relative risk (RRR) of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 9% (RR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86–0.95), myocardial infarction by 14% (RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77–0.95), and ischemic stroke by 10% (RR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82–0.99), but was associated with a 46% relative risk increase of major bleeding events (RR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.30–1.64) compared with controls. Aspirin use did not translate into a net clinical benefit adjusted for event-associated mortality risk (mean 0.034%; 95% CI, -0.18 to 0.25%). There was an interaction for aspirin effect in three patient subgroups: (i) in patients under statin treatment, aspirin was associated with a 12% RRR of MACE (RR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96), and this effect was lacking in the no-statin group; (ii) in non-smokers, aspirin was associated with a 10% RRR of MACE (RR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82–0.99), and this effect was not present in smokers; and (iii) in males, aspirin use resulted in a 11% RRR of MACE (RR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83–0.95), with a non-significant effect in females.

Conclusions

Aspirin use does not reduce all-cause or cardiovascular mortality and results in an insufficient benefit-risk ratio for CVD primary prevention. Non-smokers, patients treated with statins, and males had the greatest risk reduction of MACE across subgroups.

### Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: current knowledge and future research needs [^115VNCAi]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In secondary prevention, among a very wide range of survivors of prior occlusive cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and those suffering acute myocardial infarction (MI) or occlusive stroke, aspirin decreases risks of MI, stroke, and CVD death. In these high risk patients, the absolute benefits are large and absolute risks are far smaller so aspirin should be more widely prescribed. In contrast, in primary prevention, aspirin reduces risks of first MI but the evidence on stroke and CVD death remain inconclusive. Based on the current totality of evidence from predominantly low risk subjects where the absolute benefits is low and side effects the same as in secondary prevention, any decision to prescribe aspirin for primary prevention should be an individual clinical judgment by the healthcare provider that weighs the absolute benefit in reducing the risk of a first MI against the absolute risk of major bleeding. If the ongoing trials of intermediate risks subjects show net benefits then general guidelines may be justified with several caveats. First, any decision to use aspirin should continue to be made by the healthcare provider. Second, therapeutic lifestyle changes and other drugs of life saving benefit such as statins should be considered with aspirin as an adjunct, not alternative. The more widespread and appropriate use of aspirin in primary prevention is particularly attractive, especially in developing countries where CVD is emerging as the leading cause of death. In addition, aspirin is generally widely available over the counter and is extremely inexpensive.

### Would you recommend aspirin to this patient for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^112evdqi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Reducing ASCVD risk through primary prevention strategies has been shown to be effective; however, the role of aspirin in primary prevention remains unclear. The decision to recommend aspirin has been limited by the difficulty clinicians and patients face when trying to balance benefits and harms. In 2016, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force addressed this issue by determining the risk level at which prophylactic aspirin generally becomes more favorable, recommending aspirin above a risk cut point (> 10% estimated ASCVD risk). In 2019, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued a guideline on the primary prevention of CVD that recommends low-dose aspirin might be considered for the primary prevention of ASCVD among select adults aged 40 to 70 years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased risk for bleeding. Here, 2 experts discuss how to apply this guideline in general and to a patient in particular while answering the following questions: How do you assess ASCVD risk, and what is the role, if any, of the coronary artery calcium score?; At what risk threshold of benefits and harms would you recommend aspirin or not?; and How do you help a patient come to a decision about starting or stopping aspirin therapy?

### Aspirin in primary prevention: what changed? A critical appraisal of current evidence [^114Ux9Q7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin has been the mainstay of both secondary and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease for half a century. In 2018, 3 trials showed a modest reduction in cardiovascular outcomes that appeared counterbalanced by the risk of clinically significant bleeding. The latest ACC/AHA primary prevention guidelines downgraded their recommendation for aspirin use in primary prevention to that of physician preference. Despite the consistent and robust evidence previously supporting the use of aspirin in cardiovascular disease prevention, little discussion has been given to mechanisms or analytic explanations for this revision of recommendations. In this review, we explore 3 possible mechanisms that may have contributed to the alteration of our perception of aspirin's role in primary prevention. These include changes in the population potentially using aspirin in primary prevention, changes in cardiovascular disease and its presentation, and changes in aspirin itself. Here we present a translational look at knowledge gaps that should be addressed to better guide contemporary aspirin use in primary prevention. In conclusion, based on these considerations, the current recommendations might be improved by recalibration of the cardiovascular risk threshold above which aspirin should be recommended for primary prevention, including the incorporation of newer risk assessment modalities such as calcium scoring. A second enhancement would be developing a bleeding risk calculator to support clinicians' assessment of risk vs benefit. The use of enteric-coated aspirin vs noncoated aspirin should also be reassessed.

### Lifelong aspirin for all in the secondary prevention of chronic coronary syndrome: still sacrosanct or is reappraisal warranted? [^112aB6Fb]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Four decades have passed since the first trial suggesting the efficacy of aspirin in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. Further trials, collectively summarized by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, solidified the historical role of aspirin in secondary prevention. Although the benefit of aspirin in the immediate phase after a myocardial infarction remains incontrovertible, a number of emerging lines of evidence, discussed in this narrative review, raise some uncertainty as to the primacy of aspirin for the lifelong management of all patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS). For example, data challenging the previously unquestioned role of aspirin in CCS have come from recent trials where aspirin was discontinued in specific clinical scenarios, including early discontinuation of the aspirin component of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention and the withholding of aspirin among patients with both CCS and atrial fibrillation who require anticoagulation. Recent primary prevention trials have also failed to consistently demonstrate net benefit for aspirin in patients treated to optimal contemporary cardiovascular risk factor targets, indicating that the efficacy of aspirin for secondary prevention of CCS may similarly have changed with the addition of more modern secondary prevention therapies. The totality of recent evidence supports further study of the universal need for lifelong aspirin in secondary prevention for all adults with CCS, particularly in stable older patients who are at highest risk for aspirin-induced bleeding.

### A critical appraisal of aspirin in secondary prevention: is less more? [^1172Z1cx]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Aspirin represents the sine qua non for antiplatelet pharmacotherapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases because of its well-established role in secondary prevention and its widespread availability and affordability. Historical studies, conducted in an era that bears little resemblance to contemporary clinical practice, demonstrated large reductions in thrombotic risk when aspirin was compared with placebo, thus forming the evidence base promulgated in practice guidelines and recommendations. P2Y 12 inhibitors have mostly been studied in addition to aspirin; dual-antiplatelet therapy proved superiority compared with aspirin monotherapy for the prevention of ischemic events, despite increased bleeding risks. An alternative approach currently under investigation includes evaluation of single-antiplatelet therapy with P2Y 12 inhibitors alone versus dual-antiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndromes or coronary stent implantation. As the availability of more effective antiplatelet agents increases, it is time to revisit the existing and long-standing paradigm supporting aspirin use for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events. Ongoing trials will provide new evidence whether the less-is-more strategy is justified.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^112T2D1u]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Clinical decision making regarding the appropriate use of aspirin for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events is complex, and requires an individualized benefit to risk assessment.

Objective

To review advances in the individualized assessment for ASCVD and bleeding risk, and to provide an update of the randomized clinical trial evidence that examined the use of aspirin for primary prevention (primarily for ASCVD, and secondarily for colorectal cancer). The recently released 2016 US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations are discussed, as well as the role of ASCVD risk, age, sex, and aspirin dose/formulation in clinical decision making.

Evidence Review

We performed a detailed review of peer-reviewed publications that were identified through searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database through 2016 using the literature search terms "aspirin", "primary prevention", "cardiovascular disease", "mortality", "cancer". Bibliographies from these references as well as meta-analyses of these randomized clinical trials were also reviewed.

Findings

Evidence from a total of 11 trials involving more than 118 000 patients is available to guide clinical decision making for aspirin use in the primary prevention of ASCVD. Clinicians should balance the benefit to risk ratio and the individual's preferences, calculating the 10-year ASCVD risk and evaluating risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, to facilitate a safer and more personalized approach to appropriate selection of candidates for low-dose aspirin (75 to 81 mg/d) for the primary prevention of ASCVD, with secondary considerations for reducing colorectal cancer risk when taken for longer periods (> 10 years). Both the net ASCVD benefit and the bleeding risk of aspirin therapy increased as the absolute ASCVD risk increased, but the net benefits generally exceeded the risks at higher baseline ASCVD risk (≥ 10% ASCVD 10-year risk). The Aspirin-Guide is a clinical decision making support tool (app for mobile devices) with internal risk calculators to help clinicians with this dual assessment by calculating the ASCVD risk and the bleeding risk in the individual patient, and incorporating age- and sex-specific guidance based on randomized trial results.

Conclusions and Relevance

Balancing the benefit of ASCVD reduction with the risk of bleeding from low-dose aspirin is difficult but essential for informed decision making and achieving a net clinical benefit from aspirin for primary prevention. This is facilitated by a free and readily available evidence-based clinical decision support tool.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^115oPnCm]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality.1 For example, in 2000, it accounted directly for around 2 million deaths in the European Union. Worldwide, many people take aspirin daily in the belief that doing so helps to prevent CVD. This approach is established for the secondary prevention of recurrent vascular events. However, there has been some uncertainty about the place of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.6 In particular, there have been doubts about whether any benefits of aspirin in people with no history of CVD outweigh the risks (e.g. the fact that long-term low-dose aspirin therapy almost doubles the likelihood of gastrointestinal haemorrhage). Here we consider the place of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention of CVD.

### Aspirin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in 51 low-, middle-, and high-income countries [^114aCSRz]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Aspirin is an effective and low-cost option for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and improving mortality rates among individuals with established CVD. To guide efforts to mitigate the global CVD burden, there is a need to understand current levels of aspirin use for secondary prevention of CVD.

Objective

To report and evaluate aspirin use for secondary prevention of CVD across low-, middle-, and high-income countries.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional analysis using pooled, individual participant data from nationally representative health surveys conducted between 2013 and 2020 in 51 low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Included surveys contained data on self-reported history of CVD and aspirin use. The sample of participants included nonpregnant adults aged 40 to 69 years.

Exposures

Countries' per capita income levels and world region; individuals' socioeconomic demographics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Self-reported use of aspirin for secondary prevention of CVD.

Results

The overall pooled sample included 124 505 individuals. The median age was 52 (IQR, 45–59) years, and 50.5% (95% CI, 49.9%-51.1%) were women. A total of 10 589 individuals had a self-reported history of CVD (8.1% [95% CI, 7.6%-8.6%]). Among individuals with a history of CVD, aspirin use for secondary prevention in the overall pooled sample was 40.3% (95% CI, 37.6%-43.0%). By income group, estimates were 16.6% (95% CI, 12.4%-21.9%) in low-income countries, 24.5% (95% CI, 20.8%-28.6%) in lower-middle-income countries, 51.1% (95% CI, 48.2%-54.0%) in upper-middle-income countries, and 65.0% (95% CI, 59.1%-70.4%) in high-income countries.

Conclusion and Relevance

Worldwide, aspirin is underused in secondary prevention, particularly in low-income countries. National health policies and health systems must develop, implement, and evaluate strategies to promote aspirin therapy.

### Usefulness of aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^1166twct]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin use in the prevention of cardiovascular events has been a mainstay of treatment for decades. However, the use of aspirin in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has recently come under scrutiny. Several recent studies have evaluated the use of aspirin in primary prevention and the results suggest that in many patients the risks may outweigh the benefits. Closer examination of these trials suggests that the use of aspirin therapy for primary prevention may have a role but likely needs a more tailored approach and that caution is needed in prescribing aspirin for primary prevention. In conclusion, in this article we review the evolving evidence for aspirin in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### Revisiting the role of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1176By5P]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is the cornerstone of the antithrombotic management of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but major guidelines provide conflicting recommendations for its use in primary prevention. Findings from recent randomized trials totaling > 47000 patients called into question the net clinical benefits of aspirin in primary prevention for 3 key populations: patients with diabetes mellitus, community-dwelling elderly individuals, and patients without diabetes mellitus who are at intermediate risk for atherosclerotic events. In the context of increasing emphasis on the use of other treatments for primary prevention in patients with moderate-high future risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention has become uncertain. Key unresolved questions regarding the role of aspirin in primary prevention include the optimal drug formulation, dosing schedule, weight-based dose selection, and interplay between sex and treatment response. In the current era, most patients without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should not be prescribed aspirin. Rather, aggressive management of comorbidities tailored to the expected cardiovascular risk needs to be emphasized. In this context, informed shared decision making between clinicians and patients regarding the use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events is a suitable and laudable approach. In this article, we revisit the role of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases by critically reviewing the key scientific literature, highlight key areas of uncertainties for future research, and propose a decisional framework for clinicians to support prescription of aspirin in primary prevention.

### The rise and fall of aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112E294o]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Aspirin is one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide and is generally considered effective for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. By contrast, the role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is controversial. Early trials evaluating aspirin for primary prevention, done before the turn of the millennium, suggested reductions in myocardial infarction and stroke (although not mortality), and an increased risk of bleeding. In an effort to balance the risks and benefits of aspirin, international guidelines on primary prevention of cardiovascular disease have typically recommended aspirin only when a substantial 10-year risk of cardiovascular events exists. However, in 2018, three large randomised clinical trials of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease showed little or no benefit and have even suggested net harm. In this narrative Review, we reappraise the role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, contextualising data from historical and contemporary trials.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the 21Century: a review of the evidence [^116A6Rsb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin (ASA) is the most commonly prescribed antiplatelet agent. Although the evidence for efficacy of aspirin for secondary prevention of ischemic events in patients with established cardiovascular disease is strong, its role in primary prevention has been subject of controversies over the past decades. In fact, historical trials have shown only modest benefit in terms of reduction of ischemic events, mostly myocardial infarction and to a lesser extent stroke, and only at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding. These observations have led to divergent recommendations from professional societies on the use of ASA for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease manifestations. However, recent results from three trials of primary prevention have shown either no benefit or modest benefit on combined ischemic end points, without any impact on hard cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke, accompanied by an increased risk of bleeding. Overall, this translated into neutral net benefit or even harm with the use of aspirin in patients with no overt cardiovascular disease. These results have accordingly led to a downgrade in the current recommendations on the use of ASA for primary prevention. This article provides an overview on the current evidence on the use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^116abzZB]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

The benefits of aspirin therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease clearly outweigh the risks of bleeding, and low-dose aspirin is uniformly recommended in this setting. However, no clear consensus exists about whether, and if so in whom, aspirin therapy is appropriate for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Three trials of low-dose aspirin versus placebo in three populations at increased risk of myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke in the absence of established cardiovascular disease were reported in 2018. The ASPREE trial in elderly people was terminated early for futility because aspirin had no effect on disability-free survival but significantly increased the risk of major haemorrhage and, unexpectedly, all-cause mortality. In the ASCEND trial in patients with diabetes mellitus and no evidence of vascular disease, aspirin significantly reduced serious vascular events but increased major bleeding. In the ARRIVE trial in people with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, aspirin had no effect on major cardiovascular events but increased gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim of this Review is to place these new results in the context of previous evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and to appraise whether the new evidence is likely to enable the more targeted use of aspirin in particular individuals for whom the net benefit is both clinically worthwhile and statistically definite.

### Overview of aspirin and platelet biology [^112Qn4i5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin (ASA) has historically been one of the most important drugs in cardiology and has long been the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy. Although its role in acute coronary syndrome remains undisputed, emerging data suggest that reappraisal of the efficacy of long-term ASA in some primary and secondary prevention may be warranted. The aim of this review is to place these new results in the context of previous evidence on aspirin by appraising the current body of evidence on its use of for cardiovascular diseases. This overview first summarizes the history of the discovery of aspirin, as well as its pharmacology and the concept of ASA resistance. We subsequently recapitulate the evidence of ASA on primary prevention and secondary prevention starting from the classical studies in order to serve as an introductory background to the examination of the most recent clinical trials that will be performed in the rest of the articles of this Supplement. Although the benefit of ASA in acute coronary syndrome remains incontrovertible, emerging evidence challenge the universal need for primary prevention, or for lifelong treatment in secondary prevention or all adults with stable coronary disease who are at highest risk for ASA-induced bleeding. The role of aspirin is quickly changing in recent times and this review provides a review for the clinician about the current role of this drug in cardiovascular care.

### Aspirin in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease: past and current perspectives and future directions [^114UB78W]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In secondary prevention among a wide range of patients who have survived a prior occlusive vascular event, as well as during acute myocardial infarction and acute occlusive stroke, aspirin produces statistically significant and clinically important reductions in the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular death. In primary prevention, aspirin reduces risk of a first myocardial infarction, but the data on stroke and vascular deaths remain inconclusive. In addition, the average absolute risk of subjects randomized in the primary prevention trials was so low that it is not possible to get reliable estimates of the benefit-to-risk ratio in primary prevention in subjects at moderate risk. Until the results of ongoing trials are available, nobody would disagree that a nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke is more likely to be disabling than a nonfatal bleed. Thus, in primary prevention at present, the appropriate and judicious use of aspirin by clinicians based on individual clinical judgments that weigh their absolute benefits against the absolute risks of the drug, will avoid premature morbidity and possibly, mortality.

### Aspirin for primary prevention: a challenging decision [^113KnG66]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a challenging issue for clinicians, patients, and health policy makers. Even with the availability of multiple randomized trials and several high‐quality systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, significant debate remains about which patients, if any, should be offered aspirin for primary prevention. – The main US guideline‐issuing organizations, including the US Preventive Services Task Force and the American Heart Association, have made recommendations in favor of aspirin use for primary prevention in people with increased CVD risk who are not at high risk for aspirin's adverse effects. – Others have recommended against aspirin use for most patients without a prior history of CVD events. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a statement reaffirming that "[it] has reviewed the available data and does not believe the evidence supports the general use of aspirin for primary prevention of a heart attack or stroke".

Much of the debate about aspirin's use for primary prevention centers on 2 key issues: (1) how to integrate information on potential benefits derived from multiple trials that were performed in heterogeneous populations, that used a range of doses of aspirin, and that were conducted in the context of differing availability of other effective interventions, such as statins; and (2) how to assess whether the potential benefits outweigh the known harms of aspirin, including gastrointestinal bleeding and, less commonly but more seriously, hemorrhagic stroke. Most analyses accept the general concept that aspirin will be more clearly indicated for people at higher CVD risk because even a modest reduction in relative risk of CVD events would offer net benefit after taking into account aspirin's effects on bleeding.

The potential stakes of the aspirin decision are enormous. Decisions about aspirin for primary prevention could apply to the more than 100 million US adults aged 40 to 75 years. CVD remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this age group and results in more than $200 billion in direct and indirect care costs. Cost‐effectiveness analyses have suggested that aspirin, if modestly effective for CVD prevention, could extend lives and reduce health care costs, particularly in higher‐risk patients. – An analysis by the Prevention Priorities Project ranks aspirin near the top of all preventive services in terms of cost‐effectiveness and ability to reduce burden of suffering. Alternatively, if the downsides of aspirin exceed its benefits (overall or in people below a certain level of CVD risk), widespread use could cause large amounts of morbidity and deflect health resources from better uses.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^112xCoAw]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — aspirin prophylaxis recommendations and dosing — In recent trials, the estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk has exceeded observed risk during follow-up, supporting a lower class of recommendation with removal of a specific PCE threshold; accordingly, a Class IIb recommendation remains more suitable than a Class III recommendation for adults 40 to 70 years of age. Given the narrow balance of benefits and harms, there is limited justification to use aspirin at doses > 100 mg daily for primary prevention; meta-analyses suggest the ASCVD risk benefit for low-dose aspirin is equivalent to that for high-dose aspirin, but the bleeding risk is higher with high-dose aspirin, and low-dose prophylactic aspirin may be best justified among persons at high ASCVD risk who cannot achieve optimal control of other ASCVD risk factors.

Antiplatelet Therapy

Primary Prevention

Aspirin

Unlike secondary prevention, data regarding the use of aspirin in the primary prevention of ASCVD is equivocal. Most early data came from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, which evaluated 95 456 patients from 6 clinical trials. Treatment with aspirin was associated with a small reduction in serious vascular events but carried a small increase in the rates of major gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeding. More recently, other studies have called into question the value of aspirin in primary prevention. – Finding an appropriate balance between preventing vascular events and exposing individuals to an increased bleeding risk with aspirin therapy remains an area of active research.

Current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend the use of low‐dose aspirin for primary prevention, as listed in Table 3. Because guideline recommendations and data vary, –, treatment with aspirin should be individualized based on the patient's risk–benefit profile.

### Guideline concordance of aspirin use for primary prevention in adult outpatients [^116Y2d9k]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Aspirin has an established role in the secondary prevention of CVD, as the antithrombotic benefit is generally considered to be greater than the added risk of bleeding. The use of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD, however, has been a longstanding source of debate, with shifting perspectives over the years. Most recently in 2022, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended an individualized approach to aspirin initiation in patients aged 40 to 59, and against initiation in adults ≥ 60 years. These recommendations rely partially on modeling data that suggest a net harm when starting aspirin with advancing age. As the net benefit likely decreases in a similar way for patients who already take aspirin, data suggest that it is reasonable to consider stopping around age 75.

The recent USPSTF guidelines (2022) largely echo the 2019 recommendations from the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA), which recommend against using primary prevention aspirin on a routine basis for adults > 70 years old or those at increased risk of bleeding. They report that aspirin can be considered for adults aged 40 to 70 who have increased CVD risk but do not have increased bleeding risk. Both of these updated guidelines reflect findings from recent large, randomized control trials such as Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events, A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes, and Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly, which together suggest that the potential benefits of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD may be offset by increased bleeding. Both Raber et aland Khan et aleffectively summarize the trial data and meta-analyses that inform the latest aspirin guidelines. With significant advances in blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and lipid management, it is possible that there is a diminished role for primary prevention aspirin use in modern health care. Indeed, other international guidelines have come to similar conclusions on primary prevention aspirin use (Table 1).

### Aspirin in primary prevention: It is time to start stepping away [^1136ADVL]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is one of the most widely used drugs in medicine. While the benefits in secondary prevention have long been clear, the risk-benefit calculus in primary prevention is far less straightforward. Several randomized controlled trials conducted in the 1980s and 1990s showed cardiovascular benefits of aspirin in primary prevention, but more recent studies have called this benefit into question. One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that in the more recent era of statin therapy for primary prevention, the absolute risk of the population — and therefore, the absolute benefit of aspirin — has been reduced. Understanding the impact of aspirin therapy in patients on concomitant statins is highly relevant to current clinical practice and yet has been underexplored.

In this issue of JACC: Advances, Khan et aladdress this important question by assessing the impact of aspirin with and without statin therapy in patients without known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The authors performed a meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials of aspirin (at least 75 mg every other day) in adults without ASCVD. The primary outcomes were fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and major bleeding requiring transfusion or hospitalization or leading to death. These outcomes were assessed in patients at various ASCVD risk categories based on the Cholesterol treatment Trialist's Collaboration framework, ranging from very low risk of an event (< 5%) to very high risk (≥ 30%).

USPSTF aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) states: For adults aged 40 to 59 years with an estimated 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in this group should be an individual one (Grade: C). For adults 60 years or older, do not initiate aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD (Grade: D). This applies to adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD and who are not at increased risk for bleeding.

### Recent evidence examining efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary cardiovascular disease prevention [^116M1Wer]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Data on aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are conflicting and changing as new trials are published on the subject.

Objective

To review recent data evaluating the efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD.

Data Sources

Articles evaluating aspirin for primary prevention of CVD were gathered using a MEDLINE search with the keywords aspirin review, aspirin peripheral artery disease, aspirin stroke, aspirin coronary artery disease, aspirin diabetes, aspirin primary prophylaxis, and aspirin elderly. Primary literature published from January 2008 through November 2018 was reviewed. Additional references were identified from a review of citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized clinical trials that reported on aspirin for primary CVD prevention were included. In all, 10 publications met the inclusion criteria. The authors individually compared and contrasted the results from each publication.

Data Synthesis

The evidence for primary CVD prevention using aspirin varies widely. Previous analyses identified a benefit to aspirin use in certain populations, and current guidelines reflect this. However, new studies published in the past 10 years call the historically identified benefit of aspirin into question and force us to reexamine which patients, if any, are indicated for aspirin for primary prevention of CVD. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review provides a thorough discussion on the evidence behind aspirin for primary prevention of CVD.

Conclusion

Based on current evidence, aspirin is not recommended for primary prevention of CVD.

### Aspirin in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular disease: collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials [^111oBoek]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Low-dose aspirin is of definite and substantial net benefit for many people who already have occlusive vascular disease. We have assessed the benefits and risks in primary prevention.

Methods

We undertook meta-analyses of serious vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death) and major bleeds in six primary prevention trials (95,000 individuals at low average risk, 660,000 person-years, 3554 serious vascular events) and 16 secondary prevention trials (17,000 individuals at high average risk, 43,000 person-years, 3306 serious vascular events) that compared long-term aspirin versus control. We report intention-to-treat analyses of first events during the scheduled treatment period.

Findings

In the primary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a 12% proportional reduction in serious vascular events (0.51% aspirin vs 0.57% control per year, p = 0.0001), due mainly to a reduction of about a fifth in non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.18%vs 0.23% per year, p < 0.0001). The net effect on stroke was not significant (0.20%vs 0.21% per year, p = 0.4: haemorrhagic stroke 0.04%vs 0.03%, p = 0.05; other stroke 0.16%vs 0.18% per year, p = 0.08). Vascular mortality did not differ significantly (0.19%vs 0.19% per year, p = 0.7). Aspirin allocation increased major gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeds (0.10%vs 0.07% per year, p < 0.0001), and the main risk factors for coronary disease were also risk factors for bleeding. In the secondary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a greater absolute reduction in serious vascular events (6.7%vs 8.2% per year, p < 0.0001), with a non-significant increase in haemorrhagic stroke but reductions of about a fifth in total stroke (2.08%vs 2.54% per year, p = 0.002) and in coronary events (4.3%vs 5.3% per year, p < 0.0001). In both primary and secondary prevention trials, the proportional reductions in the aggregate of all serious vascular events seemed similar for men and women.

Interpretation

In primary prevention without previous disease, aspirin is of uncertain net value as the reduction in occlusive events needs to be weighed against any increase in major bleeds. Further trials are in progress.

### Association of aspirin use for primary prevention with cardiovascular events and bleeding events: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hjCXJ]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The role for aspirin in cardiovascular primary prevention remains controversial, with potential benefits limited by an increased bleeding risk.

Objective

To assess the association of aspirin use for primary prevention with cardiovascular events and bleeding.

Data Sources

PubMed and Embase were searched on Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials from the earliest available date through November 1, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials enrolling at least 1000 participants with no known cardiovascular disease and a follow-up of at least 12 months were included. Included studies compared aspirin use with no aspirin (placebo or no treatment).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were screened and extracted independently by both investigators. Bayesian and frequentist meta-analyses were performed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary cardiovascular outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The primary bleeding outcome was any major bleeding (defined by the individual studies).

Results

A total of 13 trials randomizing 164 225 participants with 1 050 511 participant-years of follow-up were included. The median age of trial participants was 62 years (range, 53–74), 77 501 (47%) were men, 30 361 (19%) had diabetes, and the median baseline risk of the primary cardiovascular outcome was 9.2% (range, 2.6%-15.9%). Aspirin use was associated with significant reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome compared with no aspirin (57.1 per 10 000 participant-years with aspirin and 61.4 per 10 000 participant-years with no aspirin) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89 [95% credible interval, 0.84–0.95]; absolute risk reduction, 0.38% [95% CI, 0.20%-0.55%]; number needed to treat, 265). Aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding events compared with no aspirin (23.1 per 10 000 participant-years with aspirin and 16.4 per 10 000 participant-years with no aspirin) (HR, 1.43 [95% credible interval, 1.30–1.56]; absolute risk increase, 0.47% [95% CI, 0.34%-0.62%]; number needed to harm, 210).

Conclusions and Relevance

The use of aspirin in individuals without cardiovascular disease was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events and an increased risk of major bleeding. This information may inform discussions with patients about aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events and bleeding.

### Low-dose aspirin in primary prevention: cardioprotection, chemoprevention, both, or neither? [^115aFQvm]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been shown to be effective in preventing about one-fifth of atherothrombotic vascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death) in a meta-analysis of 16 secondary prevention trials in patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient cerebral ischaemia. This corresponds to an absolute reduction of about 10–20 per 1000 patients in the yearly incidence of non-fatal events, and to a smaller, but still definite, reduction in vascular death. Against this benefit, the absolute increase in major extracranial bleeding complications [mostly, gastrointestinal (GI)] is 20- to 50-fold smaller, depending on age and sex. Hence, for secondary prevention, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy substantially exceed the risks. For primary prevention, the balance between vascular events avoided and major bleeds caused by aspirin is substantially uncertain because the risks without aspirin, and hence the absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis, are at least an order of magnitude lower than in secondary prevention. The aim of this article is to review the updated evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention and to discuss additional health benefits resulting from prolonged antiplatelet therapy in apparently healthy people at low average risk of vascular events.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^115wxL3G]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease events in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease is controversial.

Purpose

To examine the benefits and harms of aspirin chemoprevention.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966 to May 2001).

Study Selection

1) Randomized trials at least 1 year in duration that examined aspirin chemoprevention in patients without previously known cardiovascular disease and 2) systematic reviews, recent trials, and observational studies that examined rates of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to aspirin use.

Data Extraction

One reviewer read and extracted data from each included article and constructed evidence tables. A second reviewer checked the accuracy of the data extraction. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Meta-analysis was performed, and the quantitative results of the review were then used to model the consequences of treating patients with different levels of baseline risk for coronary heart disease. Five trials examined the effect of aspirin on cardiovascular events in patients with no previous cardiovascular disease. For patients similar to those enrolled in the trials, aspirin reduces the risk for the combined end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (summary odds ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.87]). Aspirin increased the risk for hemorrhagic strokes (summary odds ratio, 1.4 [CI, 0.9 to 2.0]) and major gastrointestinal bleeding (summary odds ratio, 1.7 [CI, 1.4 to 2.1]). All-cause mortality (summary odds ratio, 0.93 [CI, 0.84 to 1.02]) was not significantly affected. For 1000 patients with a 5% risk for coronary heart disease events over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 6 to 20 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events. For patients with a risk of 1% over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 1 to 4 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events.

Conclusions

The net benefit of aspirin increases with increasing cardiovascular risk. In the decision to use aspirin chemoprevention, the patient's cardiovascular risk and relative utility for the different clinical outcomes prevented or caused by aspirin use must be considered.

### Use of aspirin for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in the United States, 2011–2012 [^112D18HA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. In 2010, CVDs killed over 700 000 Americans, and accounted for 29.4% of total deaths. Moreover, CVD accounts for a significant portion of the financial burden of medical care, costing > $312.6 billion in healthcare spending and lost productivity in 2010. Aspirin therapy is a prevention measure that can reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke, and is recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force to prevent heart attack and ischemic stroke. Aspirin is used as a primary prevention measure to aid in the prevention of a first occurrence of CVD. – It can also be used as a secondary prevention measure among individuals who have experienced a heart attack or stroke to prevent additional cardiovascular events. The American Heart Association recommends the use of low‐dose aspirin daily for people at high risk of a heart attack and regular use of low‐dose aspirin for heart attack survivors.

A variety of studies have examined whether individuals at risk of having a heart attack in the United States were taking aspirin. – However, many of these studies failed to ascertain whether a person was recommended to take aspirin by their physician or whether they were taking it on their own initiative. Thus, these studies may be not an accurate assessment of physician recommendations for aspirin use. Further, much of the past research has used various risk factors to determine whether people were at high risk of CVD, rather than using the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) as recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force in 2009, the 2010 American Diabetes Association/American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology recommendations, and the 2008 American College of Chest Physician guidelines.

Prevention of CVD events is particularly important, and understanding physician recommendations for aspirin therapy is critical for delivering quality health care. Our current understanding of who is being encouraged to take aspirin for CVD prevention is limited. We sought to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations of aspirin therapy for CVD prevention, in a nationally representative sample.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^117MfeiK]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Approaches to pharmacological primary cardiovascular disease prevention. Primary preventive antihypertensive and statin therapy are prescribed after a cardiovascular risk assessment and the measurement of a biomarker related to the drug class's primary mechanism of action. In contrast, primary preventive aspirin therapy is prescribed after cardiovascular risk assessment alone and is not guided by any related biomarker. CV indicates cardiovascular; and LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

In contrast, guidelines directing the use of aspirin for primary CVD prevention do not consider a mechanism-related biomarker. This is as previous primary CVD prevention trials of aspirin therapy enrolled subjects based on age alone or age and CVD risk and did not use measures of platelet activity. The absence of a platelet biomarker in these trials is notable, as both the risk (excess bleeding) and benefit (protection against thrombosis) of aspirin reflect the drug's platelet-inhibitory effects. Though the measurement of platelet activity in response to P2Y 12 inhibition among individuals on dual antiplatelet therapy (P2Y 12 inhibitor and aspirin) did not improve clinical outcomes in prospective randomized secondary prevention trials, studies were limited by analyzing only ADP-induced platelet activity and small sample size with inadequate power. We propose a different approaching — measuring the platelet phenotype at baseline to identify individuals at particular risk for platelet-mediated events, for example, MI and stroke. It stands to reason that adding this measurement of baseline platelet activity to traditional CV risk assessment may be the key to developing better aspirin use practices. This leads to the question of how best to measure platelet activity.

Alternative Approaches to Primary CVD Prevention

The recent USPSTF update on aspirin use, which reflects the evidence to date and is in line with guidelines from major national and international heart societies, suggests either (1) aspirin should have no regular role in primary CVD prevention, or (2) we must adopt a new approach to identify individuals who will benefit from prophylactic aspirin use. Given aspirin's favorable antithrombotic properties, we advocate for the latter proposition and point to the paradigm guiding use of other primary CVD prevention therapies as a model for future aspirin use (Figure 2). Antihypertensives are recommended for primary CVD prevention when hypertension is diagnosed in conjunction with elevated CVD risk. The dosing and number of antihypertensives are titrated to achieve a blood pressure goal, reflecting evidence that blood pressure level and CVD risk are directly correlated. In short, the initiation and titration of antihypertensive therapy are guided by the measurement of a biomarker, blood pressure, with direct relevance to the medication's mechanism of action. While guidelines for primary CVD prevention with statins are more complex, they remain closely linked to a relevant biomarker, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). Indications for statin initiation emphasize LDL-C level, age, diabetes, or familial hypercholesterolemia, CVD risk, and other risk-enhancing factors. Even when therapy is initiated absent an LDL-C trigger, the regimen may be guided by serial LDL-C measurements, reflecting evidence that the net value of LDL-C lowering increases with the degree of reduction. Moreover, the favorable safety profile of statins means that they are typically of net value in individuals at even moderate CVD risk.

### Primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^11241qmc]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Aspirin for primary prevention — evidence and absolute effects: An individual participant data meta-analysis includes 95,000 individuals (660,000 person-years, 3,554 vascular events) from six large trials, and doses of aspirin varied between 75 mg and 300 mg without an apparent difference in benefit or harm. In low-risk patients, aspirin use would be associated with six fewer myocardial infarctions (MIs) and four more major bleeding events per 1,000 treated over a 10-year period, and aspirin would be associated with six fewer total deaths, but the 95% confidence interval includes zero fewer deaths. For moderate- to high-risk patients, aspirin reduces nonfatal MI (19 fewer/1,000 treated and 31 fewer/1,000 treated, respectively) and increases major bleeding (16 more/1,000 treated and 22 more/1,000 treated, respectively), with a similar impact on total mortality (six fewer total deaths). Relative effects include a vascular mortality relative risk of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.87–1.09) and a reduction in cancer mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.87), translating to ~20 fewer cancer deaths (30 fewer to eight fewer) per 1,000 treated for 10 years; the larger absolute cancer mortality effect reflects a higher 10-year cancer mortality risk of 60 per 1,000 in trials vs a low 10-year total mortality of 10 per 1,000 in a 50-year-old man. The overall quality of evidence is rated as moderate given the imprecision in the relative effect estimates for total mortality.

Aspirin

Clear support exists for the use of aspirin in the secondary prevention of CVD. The most convincing results come from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, in which ≈17 000 high‐risk patients randomized to low‐dose aspirin versus placebo were found to have a significant reduction in major vascular events (6.7% versus 8.2% per year), stroke (2.1% versus 2.5%), and coronary events (4.3% versus 5.3%). A subsequent meta‐analysis involving ≈135 000 patients at high risk for occlusive vascular events demonstrated risk reduction of ≈25% in serious vascular events with aspirin or other oral antiplatelet therapy.

For patients who undergo coronary revascularization, lifelong aspirin therapy is strongly recommended. Traditionally, higher doses of aspirin have been used for at least 1 month after percutaneous revascularization. Recently, 2 large clinical trials (CURRENT‐OASIS 7 [Clopidogrel Optimal Loading Dose Usage to Reduce Recurrent EveNTs/Optimal Antiplatelet Strategy For Interventions] and TRITON‐TIMI 38 [Trial To Assess Improvement In Therapeutic Outcomes By Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasugrel]) did not show greater efficacy with high‐dose (325 mg/d) versus low‐dose (75 to 100 mg/d) aspirin therapy. – Moreover, there is a US Food and Drug Administration black box warning against the concurrent use of high‐dose aspirin with ticagrelor. This warning is based on a significant geographic‐treatment interaction in the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes trial (PLATO), with less efficacy with ticagrelor among patients enrolled in North America potentially due to more frequent use of high‐dose aspirin. Consequently, most secondary prevention patients are more appropriately treated with low‐dose aspirin therapy (< 100 mg/d).

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^112yAchP]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thirty years ago, the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration published the first individual participant data (IPD) overview of 145 randomized trials of prolonged antiplatelet therapy for prevention of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke (vascular events) in various categories of patients. The most widely tested antiplatelet regimen was 'medium dose' (75–325 mg/day) aspirin, and the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration found no evidence that either a higher aspirin dose or any other antiplatelet regimen was more effective than medium-dose aspirin in preventing vascular events. At about the same time, I published a review article on aspirin as an antiplatelet drug that concluded 'The present recommendation of a single loading dose of 200 to 300 mg followed by a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg is based on findings that this dose is as clinically efficacious as higher doses and is safer than higher doses'. Moreover, I added 'the efficacy of a cheap drug such as aspirin in preventing one fifth to one third of all important cardiovascular events should not discourage the pharmaceutical industry from attempting to develop more effective antithrombotic drugs, since a sizable proportion of these events continue to occur despite currently available therapy'.

During the past 30 years, we have witnessed several developments in the antiplatelet field, including (i) a large number of trials exploring the role of aspirin in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease;(ii) several attempts by the pharmaceutical industry to develop antiplatelet drugs, more effective and safer than aspirin;(iii) a shift in emphasis from efficacy to safety leading to a strong opinion movement favouring aspirin-free antiplatelet regimens after percutaneous coronary intervention; and (iv) an IPD meta-analysis comparing P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy with aspirin monotherapy for secondary prevention of coronary events. Moreover, evidence supporting a chemopreventive effect of low-dose aspirin against colorectal (and other digestive tract) cancer has strengthened, as recently reviewed.

The aim of this article is to revisit the role of aspirin in the prevention of atherothrombosis across the cardiovascular risk continuum, in view of developments in the antiplatelet field. The review will offer a clinical perspective on aspirin's mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. This will be followed by a detailed discussion of its clinical efficacy and safety (Graphical Abstract).

### Use of aspirin to reduce risk of initial vascular events in patients at moderate risk of cardiovascular disease (ARRIVE): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116Pe9C6]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study ARRIVE (aspirin) was published by Gaziano JM and colleagues in 2018 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiovascular disease prevention, Transient ischemic attack, Acute ischemic stroke, Unstable angina, ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the trial question was: what is the role of aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients at moderate risk of CVD? In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the population was: 12546 patients (3708 female, 8838 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a moderate estimated risk of a first cardiovascular event. The key exclusion criteria were high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or other bleeding, diabetes, history of a vascular event, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery angioplasty or stenting, CABG, congestive HF, or vascular intervention. In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the interventions were: n = 6270 aspirin (100 mg PO once daily daily) n = 6276 placebo (matching tablet once daily). In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, unstable angina, or TIA (4.29% vs. 4.48%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.81 to 1.13). In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction in the intention-to-treat population (1.52% vs. 1.78%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.11) No significant difference in the intention-to-treat population, nonfatal myocardial infarction (1.4% vs. 1.56%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.2) No significant difference in death, in the intention-to-treat population (2.55% vs. 2.57%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.8 to 1.24). In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events (82.01% vs. 81.72%). significant differences in overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events (16.75% vs. 13.54%, p < 0.0001), and gastrointestinal bleeding events (0.97% vs. 0.46%, p = 0.0007). In the ARRIVE (aspirin) study, the conclusion was: in patients with a moderate estimated risk of a first cardiovascular event, aspirin was not superior to placebo with respect to myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, unstable angina, or TIA.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^11273tu4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States.

Purpose

To update a systematic review about the benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults aged 40 years or older and to evaluate effect modification in subpopulations.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2008 to January 2015), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Study Selection

Two investigators independently reviewed 3396 abstracts and 65 articles according to prespecified criteria. All included trials evaluated aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Data Extraction

Two investigators assessed study quality; data were abstracted by 1 reviewer and checked by a second.

Data Synthesis

Two good-quality and 9 fair-quality randomized, controlled trials were identified. In analyses of all doses, aspirin reduced the risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (relative risk [RR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.87]) but not nonfatal stroke; aspirin showed little or no benefit for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Benefits began within the first 5 years. Older adults achieved greater relative MI reduction, but no other effect modifications were found in analyzed subpopulations. In trials with aspirin doses of 100 mg or less per day, the reduction in nonfatal MI benefit persisted (absolute risk reduction, 0.15 to 1.43 events per 1000 person-years) and a 14% reduction in nonfatal stroke benefit was noted, but no benefit was found for all-cause mortality (RR, 0.95 [CI, 0.89 to 1.01]) or cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.97 [CI, 0.85 to 1.10]).

Limitation

Evidence for aspirin in primary prevention is heterogeneous and limited by rare events and few credible subgroup analyses.

Conclusion

The beneficial effect of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is modest and occurs at doses of 100 mg or less per day. Older adults seem to achieve a greater relative MI benefit.

### Effects of changing guidelines on prescribing aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events [^114y3uBw]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasingly being questioned. Aspirin may not benefit this population and may increase the risk of major bleeding events. Data support aspirin use in patients with known CVD.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of de-identified electronic health record (EHR) data from 131,050 individuals with known CVD or elevated risk for CVD as determined by diagnostic, demographic, and clinical data collected from 33 primary care practices in 11 different clinical organizations across 6 states. The percentage of the population of each cohort with aspirin recorded on their medication list, created through risk base analysis, was observed across 4 time periods.

Results

From 2007 to 2011, aspirin usage reflected in the EHR increased for the entire population and for each individual high-risk diagnosis. The percentage of the population initiating aspirin therapy for primary prevention within a year of diagnosis of CVD risk factors or CVD "equivalency" increased between 2007 and 2011. Among those with a new diagnosis of CVD, aspirin usage also steadily increased over the 4-year period, indicating no negative impact from new negative primary prevention studies.

Conclusions

Primary care clinicians have a central role in providing evidence-based preventive services and should integrate revised information into their practice to improve outcomes. Even with new evidence against the use of aspirin for primary prevention, it is difficult to change beliefs about the effectiveness and safety of aspirin, as reflected in the behavior of physicians and patients.

### Aspirin therapy in primary cardiovascular disease prevention: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology working group on thrombosis [^112wYM4j]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although the use of oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists) has been abandoned in primary cardiovascular prevention due to lack of a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, the indications for aspirin use in this setting continue to be a source of major debate, with major international guidelines providing conflicting recommendations. Here, we review the evidence in favor and against aspirin therapy in primary prevention based on the evidence accumulated so far, including recent data linking aspirin with cancer protection. While awaiting the results of several ongoing studies, we argue for a pragmatic approach to using low-dose aspirin in primary cardiovascular prevention and suggest its use in patients at high cardiovascular risk, defined as ≥ 2 major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) projected per 100 person-years, who are not at increased risk of bleeding.

Stable CAD

Aspirin remains the cornerstone for secondary prevention of patients with stable CAD, irrespective of the management strategy. In a large meta-analysis including 16 secondary prevention trials and 17 000 high-risk patients, low-dose aspirin (75–150 mg/day) was associated with a 20% relative risk reduction in MACE (cardiovascular (CV) death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI)) (rate ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.88), a 31% relative risk reduction in MI (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.80) and a 22% relative risk reduction in ischaemic stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.99), at the expense of an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.90) and major extracranial bleeding (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.76). Aspirin marginally reduced CV mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00, p = 0.06), resulting in a 10% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99, p = 0.02). At variance of the antiplatelet effects, the gastrointestinal side effects of aspirin increase at higher doses. The optimal risk:benefit ratio appears to be achieved with an aspirin dosage of 75–150 mg daily.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: For adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use should be an individual one; evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this group is small, and persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily are more likely to benefit (C recommendation). For adults 60 years or older, the USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD (D recommendation). The target population is adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD who are not at increased risk for bleeding. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit, and concludes with moderate certainty that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit.

### Is aspirin useful in primary prevention? [^112YLe5M]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

There is no evidence that aspirin is effective for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, although it may change the way that they present. Indeed, there is no evidence that long-term aspirin should be given to patients even with known cardiovascular disease. Theoretical arguments that aspirin can prevent cardiovascular events by reducing the propagation of thrombus are countered by evidence that plaque haemorrhage from vasa vasorum may also cause plaque growth and instability. There is evidence that aspirin causes serious bleeding into the brain and the gut. Aspirin may also detract from the benefits of drugs that have definite cardiovascular benefits, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Meta-analysis is prone to multiple biases in favour of aspirin, including publication bias, bias due to trial and endpoint selection and bias due to interpretation. Meta-analysis should not be relied on in preference to adequately powered clinical trials. Unfortunately, the benefits of aspirin, if they exist, may be so small that a very large study indeed would be required to demonstrate that its benefits outweigh its risks. The evidence that aspirin might reduce cancer is intriguing but relies on data from trials conducted many decades ago using a wide range of aspirin doses. There is no reliable evidence that aspirin used in the current fashionable doses of 50–100 mg/day is of any benefit in any common clinical setting.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis with a particular focus on subgroups [^115ub5qY]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acetylsalicylic acid (commonly referred to as "aspirin") is an antithrombotic agent that inhibits platelets by irreversibly acetylating the serine residue of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in platelets with subsequently reduced levels of prothrombotic thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2). In patients with known cardiovascular disease (CVD), the potential for aspirin to reduce further cardiovascular (CV) events significantly outweighs the risks of major bleeding and thus aspirin has since become a mainstay in secondary prevention of CVD. However, in primary prevention, its role is still under debate. This is due to an as yet unclear balance between the benefits and risks of aspirin treatment in patients without a diagnosed atherosclerotic disease.

Previously published meta-analyses have indicated that aspirin significantly reduced myocardial infarction (MI) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) without an impact on stroke and CV- or all-cause death. Furthermore, an increased risk of major bleeding events under aspirin strongly outweighed the benefits of aspirin treatment in primary prevention. As a result, the current guidelines on CVD prevention from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) do not recommend antiplatelet therapy in patients free of overt CVD. On the contrary, the recently published 2019 ACC/AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease states that aspirin might be considered in selected adults aged 40 to 70 who are at higher CV risk but at no increased bleeding risk. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends initiation of aspirin treatment depending on age and 10-year CVD risk.

Recently, three major trials (ARRIVE, ASCEND, and ASPREE) evaluating the use of aspirin in primary prevention of CVD were published. The ARRIVE trial enrolled patients with moderate to high cardiovascular risk, the ASCEND trial patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) only, and the ASPREE trial elderly patients. Only the ASCEND trial showed a significant reduction in the rate of major adverse CV events, but the effect was, once again, accompanied by a significant increase in major bleeding. Using the three recently published trials, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis with a particular focus on subgroups in order to potentially characterize patient populations with a more favorable benefit-risk ratio.

### Within-the-clinic shared decision for an over-the-counter medication [^117KqrSu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin and its relatives are some of the oldest and most widely used drugs, dating back thousands of years and treating aches, pains, and fevers. Since the 1980s, aspirin has been regularly used to prevent and treat heart disease and stroke. Unlike the robust data supporting the use of aspirin in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, uncertainty remains regarding its role in primary prevention. The uncertainty behind aspirin use in primary prevention is mainly due to imprecision underlying the relative size of the risk and benefit of aspirin use in a low‐risk, otherwise healthy population. 1 Despite this, nearly every major cardiovascular health organization has published guidelines and statements on the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Controversy and complexity of the available research combined with the over‐the‐counter accessibility of aspirin make translation of the evidence into practice particularly challenging for both clinicians and patients alike.

In 2009, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) assigned grade‐A recommendations for the use of aspirin in men ages 45 to 79 years for the prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) and in women ages 55 to 79 years for the prevention of ischemic stroke, in both cases where the prevention risks outweigh the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. 2 These recommendations are echoed to varying degrees in multiple cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines, including those of the American Heart Association (AHA). 3 Conversely, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014 declared that the available evidence does not support the general use of aspirin for primary prevention. These conflicting statements can be confusing for both healthcare providers and patients to digest, potentially leading to underutilization of aspirin for primary prevention. 4 The key for appropriate use of aspirin in primary prevention lies in the identification of the correct candidate for whom aspirin use is truly beneficial. This can be a complex task as consensus on assessment of cardiovascular risk remains elusive, and integrating bleeding risk with cardiovascular risk further complicates the decision‐making process.

### A meta-analysis of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in the context of contemporary preventive strategies [^1167CoXX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases remains controversial, particularly in the context of contemporary aggressive preventive strategies.

Methods

Relevant randomized clinical trials were included, and risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using random-effects models. Additional moderator analyses were performed to compare the pooled treatment effects from recent trials (those reported after the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel were published in 2001; thus, conducted on the background of contemporary preventive strategies) to the results of older trials.

Results

Data from 14 randomized controlled trials involving 164,751 patients were included. Aspirin use decreased myocardial infarction risk by 16% compared with placebo (RR 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.94); however, in the moderator analyses, aspirin was not associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction in recent trials, but was in older trials (P-interaction = .02). Overall, aspirin use significantly increased the occurrence of major bleeding (RR 1.49; 95% CI, 1.32–1.69) and hemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01–1.54). In moderator analyses, the risk of major bleeding (P-interaction = .12) or hemorrhagic stroke (P-interaction = .44) with aspirin was not significantly different between the older and new trials. Differences between aspirin and placebo in the risks for all-cause stroke, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality were not found.

Conclusions

In the context of contemporary primary prevention guidelines, the effect of aspirin on myocardial infarction risk was significantly attenuated, whereas its major bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke complications were retained. Therefore, in contemporary practice, routine use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events may have a net harmful effect.

### The use of aspirin for primary and secondary prevention in venous thromboembolism and other cardiovascular disorders [^112Cxm9A]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) includes a number of conditions such as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. CVD is a leading health problem worldwide and a major cause of mortality, morbidity, and disability; it is also associated with high healthcare costs. The incidence of CVD is predicted to increase in the forthcoming years, and thus it is crucial that physicians are aware of the benefits and limitations of the available therapies to ensure patients receive optimized treatment. Current clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelets for both the prevention and treatment of CVD. Aspirin is the most studied antiplatelet agent in this context. The benefits of aspirin are well documented and supported by data from robust clinical trials for CVD conditions, such as acute coronary syndrome and stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, the clinical benefits of aspirin are less clear for other conditions, namely for primary prevention of venous thromboembolism after major orthopaedic surgery, particularly in comparison with newer drugs such as the direct oral anticoagulants. This article provides an outline of the current guidelines and a critical assessment of the efficacy and safety data supporting the recommendations for the use of aspirin in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism and other cardiovascular disorders.

### Effect of aspirin on cardiovascular events and bleeding in the healthy elderly [^116ekqcS]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Aspirin is a well-established therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. However, its role in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is unclear, especially in older persons, who have an increased risk.

Methods

From 2010 through 2014, we enrolled community-dwelling men and women in Australia and the United States who were 70 years of age or older (or ≥ 65 years of age among blacks and Hispanics in the United States) and did not have cardiovascular disease, dementia, or disability. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo. The primary end point was a composite of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability; results for this end point are reported in another article in the Journal. Secondary end points included major hemorrhage and cardiovascular disease (defined as fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure).

Results

Of the 19,114 persons who were enrolled in the trial, 9525 were assigned to receive aspirin and 9589 to receive placebo. After a median of 4.7 years of follow-up, the rate of cardiovascular disease was 10.7 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 11.3 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.08). The rate of major hemorrhage was 8.6 events per 1000 person-years and 6.2 events per 1000 person-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.62; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The use of low-dose aspirin as a primary prevention strategy in older adults resulted in a significantly higher risk of major hemorrhage and did not result in a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease than placebo.

Aspirin (75–100 mg) compared with no aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease reports outcome-specific relative risks as follows: MI nonfatal events RR 0.77 (0.67–0.89), Stroke includes nonfatal ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes RR 0.95 (0.85–1.06), and Major extracranial bleed RR 1.54 (1.30–1.82).

### Efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111gAWxD]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

The role of aspirin in the primary prevention setting is continuously evolving. Recent randomized trials have challenged the role of aspirin in the primary prevention setting.

Methods and Results

Electronic databases were searched for randomized trials that compared aspirin vs. placebo (or control) in subjects without established atherosclerotic disease. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality, while the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Summary estimates were reported using a DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. A total of 11 trials with 157 248 subjects were included. At a mean follow-up of 6.6years, aspirin was not associated with a lower incidence of all-cause mortality [risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93–1.02; P = 0.30]; however, aspirin was associated with an increased incidence of major bleeding (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.31–1.65; P < 0.0001) and intracranial haemorrhage (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13–1.58; P = 0.001). A similar effect on all-cause mortality and major bleeding was demonstrated in diabetic and high cardiovascular risk patients (i.e. 10-year risk > 7.5%). Aspirin was associated with a lower incidence of myocardial infarction (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.94; P = 0.006); however, this outcome was characterized by considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 67%), and this effect was no longer evident upon limiting the analysis to the more recent trials. Trial sequential analysis confirmed the lack of benefit of aspirin for all-cause mortality up to a relative risk reduction of 5%.

Conclusion

Among adults without established cardiovascular disease, aspirin was not associated with a reduction in the incidence of all-cause mortality; however, it was associated with an increased incidence of major bleeding. The routine use of aspirin for primary prevention needs to be reconsidered.

### Aspirin for primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention as baseline risk increases: a meta-regression analysis [^111ak3t6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Aspirin has long had a role in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); however, recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have challenged this practice. Despite this, aspirin is still commonly recommended for high-risk primary prevention. We tested the hypothesis that aspirin is more efficacious for the primary prevention of ASCVD as the baseline risk increases.

Methods

RCTs that compared aspirin with control for primary prevention and evaluated ASCVD (composite of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke) and major bleeding were included. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. A regression analysis was performed using the ASCVD event rate in the control arm of each RCT as the moderator.

Results

Twelve RCTs were identified with 963,829 patient-years of follow-up. Aspirin was associated with a reduction in ASCVD (4.7 vs 5.3 events per 1000 patient-years; RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79–0.92). There was increased major bleeding among aspirin users (2.5 vs 1.8 events per 1000 patient-years; RR 1.41; 95% CI, 1.29–1.54). Regression analysis found no relationship between the log RR of ASCVD or major bleeding and rate of ASCVD in the control arm of each RCT.

Conclusion

Aspirin is associated with a reduction in ASCVD when used for primary prevention; however, it is unlikely to be clinically significant given the increase in bleeding. More importantly, aspirin's treatment effect does not increase as ASCVD risk increases, as many hypothesize. There is no suggestion from these data that use of aspirin for higher-risk primary prevention patients is beneficial.

### Use of aspirin for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in the United States, 2011–2012 [^112gdUsb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, patients report nonideal rates of being recommended to take aspirin. High‐risk patients who are not receiving the recommendation are put at increased risk of CVD events. Low‐risk patients are exposed to adverse risk with unnecessary use of aspirin based upon a physician's recommendation. It is clear that quality of care for primary prevention falls far short of ideal. Further research on clinical decision support systems and interventions designed to reinforce the use of appropriate risk calculation is necessary to ensure that patients receive appropriate preventive care.

Aspirin dosing and bleeding risk in established coronary artery disease (CAD) indicate no added efficacy with higher doses and increased bleeding with very high doses. Across different daily doses of aspirin (50–1,500 mg vs 160–325 mg vs 75–150 mg vs < 75 mg), direct comparisons of high- vs low-dose aspirin found no significant differences, and uncertainty remains for aspirin < 75 mg versus ≥ 75 mg; indirect comparisons found no evidence that high doses (eg, ≥ 160 mg/d) are more effective than 75 to 160 mg. A 2007 systematic review identified eight prospective trials including nearly 10,000 patients taking aspirin 30 to 1,300 mg/d, in which a significant benefit of higher doses was not identified and, in most, the lowest event rates were seen in lower-dose groups. Regarding bleeding, a review including > 190,000 patients in 31 randomized controlled trials found aspirin > 200 mg associated with an ~30% increase in major bleeding compared with doses < 200 mg (P = .05), and nonmajor bleeding increased in patients receiving 100 to 200 mg of aspirin per day compared with < 100 mg/d; the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration found no difference in major extracranial bleed across < 75, 75–150, and 160–325 mg compared with placebo, and did not comment on > 325 mg. Taken together, these findings provide moderate-quality evidence to support the use of aspirin 75 to 100 mg/d for patients with established CAD.

### Aspirin use and misuse for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [^1125LNKN]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Daily aspirin use for primary cardiovascular disease prevention is common among adults. Numerous clinical trials observe reduced cardiovascular disease with regular low-dose aspirin. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 published guidelines for aspirin use, but controversy exists about the side effects, and overuse or underuse may be common despite the guidelines. Using the Task Force recommendations, this paper describes the prevalence of appropriate aspirin use and physician advice in a population sample.

Methods

A random sample of men and women (aged 50–69 years) living in the Upper Midwest in 2017–2018 were surveyed, collecting demographic data, health history, and aspirin use. Appropriate primary prevention with aspirin was defined as having ≥ 10% cardiovascular disease risk (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking) with daily or every other day aspirin use. Those with prevalent cardiovascular disease were labeled as secondary prevention.

Results

A total of 1,352 adults were surveyed (697 women, 655 men). The criteria for secondary prevention were fulfilled in 188 participants, and these were eliminated from the analysis. In the remaining group, aspirin was indicated in 32.9% (383 of 1,164). Among those, 46.0% (176 of 383) were appropriate users, and 54.0% (207 of 383) were nonusers despite indications. Overuse, where aspirin is not indicated, was common at 26.9% (210 of 781). Discussion with a physician, although reported in 29% of subjects, was associated with some improvement in the appropriate use but also with overuse and underuse.

Conclusions

Aspirin use for primary cardiovascular disease prevention is common. However, many adults are medicating without indication (overuse) or are not using aspirin despite guidelines (underuse).

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and CAD — moderate-intensity warfarin (international normalized ratio [INR] 2.0–3.0) plus aspirin vs aspirin alone — prior low-dose warfarin (INR < 2.0) plus aspirin has not shown it to be more effective than aspirin alone; high-intensity warfarin (INR 2.8–4.2) without aspirin was more effective than aspirin alone but was associated with increased bleeding risk; a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials involving 5,938 patients randomized to moderate-to-high-intensity warfarin plus low-dose aspirin vs aspirin alone provides evidence of a substantial reduction in MI and nonfatal stroke at the costs of increased major extracranial bleeds, but trials were pre-stent with < 1-year follow-up and heterogeneity, and it is difficult to apply this evidence, therefore "we do not make recommendations for warfarin in these patient populations".

Biological understanding of aspirin's effects — mechanistic benefits and risks are summarized: 'At lower doses, aspirin is an irreversible cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme inhibitor. At higher doses, aspirin also inhibits COX-2'.Aspirin 'reduces the risk for atherothrombosis through the inhibition of platelet function (through COX-1 inhibition) and has been used widely for the prevention of CVD events, particularly for secondary prevention'.However, 'The COX-1 enzyme is also responsible for producing a variety of prostaglandins that protect the gastrointestinal mucosa. By inhibiting this enzyme, aspirin use can promote gastrointestinal bleeding'.The page also notes that 'The mechanism for the possible antineoplastic effects of aspirin is not as well understood'.

### Effect of aspirin on mortality in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113jgpBQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The lack of a mortality benefit of aspirin in prior meta-analyses of primary prevention trials of cardiovascular disease has contributed to uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks of aspirin in primary prevention. We performed an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of aspirin to obtain best estimates of the effect of aspirin on mortality in primary prevention.

Methods

Eligible articles were identified by searches of electronic databases and reference lists. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and bleeding. Data were pooled from individual trials using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model, and results are presented as relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Nine randomized controlled trials enrolling 100,076 participants were included. Aspirin reduced all-cause mortality (RR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88–1.00), myocardial infarction (RR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–1.00), ischemic stroke (RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.98), and the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death (RR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83–0.94), but did not reduce cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.84–1.09). Aspirin increased the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01–1.82), major bleeding (RR 1.66; 95% CI, 1.41–1.95), and gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.15–1.62). A lack of availability of patient-level data precluded exploration of benefits and risks of aspirin in key subgroups.

Conclusion

Aspirin prevents deaths, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke, and increases hemorrhagic stroke and major bleeding when used in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^115efeN3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

For the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, we support the recommendation to use either aspirin (81 to 325 mg/d) or clopidogrel (75 mg/d) alone; dual antiplatelet therapy is associated with increased bleeding. Although it is reasonable to use aspirin (81 to 325 mg/d) or clopidogrel alone (75 mg/d) for symptomatic peripheral artery disease, there is a need for future studies to evaluate antiplatelet therapy in patients with asymptomatic peripheral artery disease. Finally, current guideline recommendations related to the use of aspirin and P2Y 12 receptor antagonists for secondary prevention are listed in Table 3.

Aspirin for established vascular disease — effects and applicability: A meta-analysis of individual participant data from 16 randomized trials with 17,000 patients with established vascular disease (six trials of previous MI and 10 trials of previous transient ischemic attack [TIA] or stroke) found that in this high-risk population (8.2% yearly risk) aspirin significantly reduced total mortality, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke at the cost of increased nonfatal extracranial bleeding events, with the number of vascular events and total deaths prevented far greater than the number of bleeding events; similar antiplatelet effects were found in patients with a history of MI (12 trials) and in patients with a history of stable angina and CAD (seven trials).

Aspirin for primary prevention — subgroups and decision aids: We do not make specific recommendations for the use of aspirin based on patient characteristics, such as older age, sex, and diabetes mellitus, and sophisticated risk calculators used in decision aids for specific populations may enhance individual decision-making, and when well done, we encourage their use. Concerning diabetes, current evidence is interpreted as suggesting that the relative benefit of aspirin is similar in patients with and without diabetes, and analyses from the individual participant data meta-analysis provide no support for a difference in relative effect of aspirin in those with or without diabetes.

### Primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116xLPsx]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This guideline focuses on long-term administration of antithrombotic drugs designed for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, including two new antiplatelet therapies.

Methods

The methods of this guideline follow those described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement.

Results

We present 23 recommendations for pertinent clinical questions. For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, we suggest low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/d) in patients aged > 50 years over no aspirin therapy (Grade 2B). For patients with established coronary artery disease, defined as patients 1-year post-acute coronary syndrome, with prior revascularization, coronary stenoses > 50% by coronary angiogram, and/or evidence for cardiac ischemia on diagnostic testing, we recommend long-term low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel (75 mg/d) (Grade 1A). For patients with acute coronary syndromes who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement, we recommend for the first year dual antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin in combination with ticagrelor 90 mg bid, clopidogrel 75 mg/d, or prasugrel 10 mg/d over single antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1B). For patients undergoing elective PCI with stent placement, we recommend aspirin (75–325 mg/d) and clopidogrel for a minimum duration of 1 month (bare-metal stents) or 3 to 6 months (drug-eluting stents) (Grade 1A). We suggest continuing low-dose aspirin plus clopidogrel for 12 months for all stents (Grade 2C). Thereafter, we recommend single antiplatelet therapy over continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1B).

Conclusions

Recommendations continue to favor single antiplatelet therapy for patients with established coronary artery disease. For patients with acute coronary syndromes or undergoing elective PCI with stent placement, dual antiplatelet therapy for up to 1 year is warranted.

### Aspirin dose for the prevention of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review [^115zxghe]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

More than 50 million US adults take aspirin regularly for long-term prevention of cardiovascular disease, typically either 81 mg/d or 325 mg/d. Controversy remains regarding the most appropriate long-term daily dose.

Objective

To review the mechanism of action of aspirin and the clinical literature for relationships among aspirin dosage, efficacy, and safety.

Evidence Acquisition

A systematic review of the English-language literature was undertaken using MEDLINE and EMBASE (searched through February 2007) and the search term aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid and dose. The search was limited to clinical trials and was extended by a review of bibliographies of pertinent reports of original data and review articles. Published prospective studies using different aspirin dosages in the setting of cardiovascular disease were included.

Evidence Synthesis

Although pharmacodynamic data demonstrate that long-term aspirin dosages as low as 30 mg/d are adequate to fully inhibit platelet thromboxane production, dosages as high as 1300 mg/d are approved for use. In the United States, 81 mg/d of aspirin is prescribed most commonly (60%), followed by 325 mg/d (35%). The available evidence, predominantly from secondary-prevention observational studies, supports that dosages greater than 75 to 81 mg/d do not enhance efficacy, whereas larger dosages are associated with an increased incidence of bleeding events, primarily related to gastrointestinal tract toxicity.

Conclusions

Currently available clinical data do not support the routine, long-term use of aspirin dosages greater than 75 to 81 mg/d in the setting of cardiovascular disease prevention. Higher dosages, which may be commonly prescribed, do not better prevent events but are associated with increased risks of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Reducing cardiovascular and cancer risk: how to address global primary prevention in clinical practice [^1176zt79]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Emerging evidence suggesting the possibility that interventions able to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) may also be effective in the prevention of cancer have recently stimulated great interest in the medical community. In particular, data from both experimental and observational studies have demonstrated that aspirin may play a role in preventing different types of cancer. Although the use of aspirin in the secondary prevention of CVD is well established, aspirin in primary prevention is not systematically recommended because the absolute cardiovascular event reduction is similar to the absolute excess in major bleedings. By adding to its cardiovascular prevention benefits, the potential beneficial effect of aspirin in reducing the incidence of mortality and cancer could tip the balance between risks and benefits of aspirin therapy in primary prevention in favor of the latter and broaden the indication for treatment with aspirin in populations at average risk. Prospective and randomized studies are currently investigating the effect of aspirin in prevention of both cancer and CVD; however, clinical efforts at the individual level to promote the use of aspirin in global (or total) primary prevention already could be made on the basis of a balanced evaluation of the benefit/risk ratio.

### Do clinicians recommend aspirin to patients for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^116H3qcz]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released updated guidelines in 2009 recommending aspirin to prevent myocardial infarction among at-risk men and stroke among at-risk women.

Objective

Our aim was to examine clinician aspirin recommendation among eligible persons based on cardiovascular risk scores and USPSTF cutoffs.

Design

We used across-sectional analysis of a current nationally representative sample.

Participants

Participants were aged 40 years and older, and in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2011–2012).

Main Measures

We determined aspirin eligibility for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention for each participant based on reported and assessed cardiovascular risk factors. We assessed men's risk using a published coronary heart disease risk calculator based on Framingham equations, and used a similar calculator for stroke to assess risk for women. We applied the USPSTF risk cutoffs for sex and age that account for offsetting risk for gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We assessed clinician recommendation for aspirin based on participant report.

Results

Among men 45–79 years and women 55–79 years, 87% of men and 16% of women were potentially eligible for primary CVD aspirin prevention. Clinician recommendation rates for aspirin among those eligible were low, 34% for men and 42% for women. Rates were highest among diabetics (63%), those 65 to 79 years (52%) or those in poor health (44%). In contrast, aspirin recommendation rates were 76% for CVD secondary prevention. After accounting for patient factors, particularly age, eligibility for aspirin prevention was not significantly associated with receiving a clinician's recommendation for aspirin (AOR 0.99%; CI 0.7–1.4).

Conclusions

Despite an "A recommendation" from the USPSTF for aspirin for primary prevention of CVD, the majority of men and women potentially eligible for aspirin did not recall a clinical recommendation from their clinician.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^115eRH8U]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The lowest effective daily dose of aspirin for long-term antiplatelet prophylaxis ranges between 50 and 100 mg, with no evidence that higher doses are more effective, consistent with saturability of platelet COX-1 inactivation at low doses. This evidence is based on indirect comparisons of RCTs employing different aspirin dosing regimens, as well as on a limited number of head-to-head randomized comparisons of a lower vs. a higher dose, both in acute coronary syndromesand stable patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

There is also no convincing evidence that the dose requirement for the antithrombotic effect of aspirin varies in different clinical settings or as a function of body weight. Similarly, there is no evidence that the effect of aspirin on major vascular events is influenced by gender, age, concomitant treatments, or primary vs. secondary prevention. In the ASPREE trial involving 19 114 healthy elderly persons (median age, 74 years) who did not have known cardiovascular disease (CVD), the use of low-dose aspirin did not result in a significantly lower risk of CVD than placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83–1.08]. However, the widely cited message from ASPREE that low-dose aspirin is ineffective in old age is potentially misleading, for the following reasons: (i) CVD was not the primary endpoint of ASPREE; (ii) CVD, a pre-specified secondary endpoint, was a composite of platelet-dependent as well as platelet-independent events, i.e. fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, fatal or non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure; and (iii) when the analysis was restricted to a traditional composite of fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, or fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke, the rate of this endpoint was 7.8 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 8.8 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.77–1.03). Such a moderate treatment effect is identical to that reported for younger subjects (< 65 years) in a setting of primary prevention, an effect that ASPREE failed to detect as statistically significant in a population at low cardiovascular risk (< 1.0% per year) because it was largely underpowered. Despite serious limitations, these results were published as a separate, stand-alone paper in the New England Journal of Medicine and named as one of the 12 'game changers' of 2018.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1125SJyG]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Supporting evidence — benefits of preventive medication reports 13 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 161 680 participants; most trials used low-dose aspirin of 100 mg/d or less or aspirin every other day, with mean ages ranging from 53 years to 74 years. In pooled analyses of low-dose aspirin, decreased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction was observed (Peto odds ratio [OR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80–0.96]) across 11 trials (n = 134 470) and decreased risk of nonfatal ischemic stroke (Peto OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78–1.00]) across 5 trials (n = 54 947). Low-dose aspirin was not associated with statistically significant effects on fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality at 3.6 to 10.1 years of follow-up, and although evidence does not suggest that the relative effect is modified by baseline CVD risk, the absolute magnitude of the benefit is greater in persons at higher CVD risk.

### Modulation of microRNAs by aspirin in cardiovascular disease [^115f2DrR]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is among the most widely prescribed drugs in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases for both primary and secondary prevention. The major mechanisms underlying its benefits are the inhibitory effects on platelet activation and prostanoid biosynthesis induced by COX-1 and COX-2 inactivation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are newly proposed mediators of the effects of aspirin. In this review, we summarize the evidence on the links between miRNAs and aspirin use in relation to cardiovascular diseases. In addition, we discuss the studies suggesting a possible role for miRNAs as biomarkers of aspirin resistance, a condition during which atherothrombotic events occur despite aspirin use, and which affects a considerable proportion of patients with cardiovascular disease.

### Aspirin has potential benefits for primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes in diabetes: updated literature-based and individual participant data meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^115y6ebB]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Implications of our findings

Compared with aspirin use for the secondary prevention of vascular disease, the use of aspirin for primary prevention has been a widely debated and controversial topic. Two recently published landmark trials, ASCEND, and ASPREE, evaluated the efficacy and safety of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes in people with diabetes and have been included in this review. Whereas the absolute benefits of aspirin on vascular benefits were counterbalanced by the bleeding hazard in the ASCEND study, there was no differential effect of aspirin on the risk of CVD and bleeding in people with diabetes in the ASPREE trial. Though our results show aspirin may have a beneficial effect in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes, aspirin had no differential effect on bleeding risk. Given the imprecise estimates reported for GI and non-GI bleeding, these results may be due to inadequate power of these trials to detect these events. Indeed, a wealth of data from general and secondary prevention populations suggests that the main adverse effect associated with aspirin use is GI bleeding. Both low aspirin dosage and long term therapy is associated with an absolute excess of GI bleeding complications in these population groups. A higher risk of bleeding events has also been reported among the elderly and people at low cardiovascular risk. Though the current data suggests otherwise, real-world data in general populations have demonstrated higher rates of bleeding in people with diabetes on aspirin therapy. Taking the overall findings together, two questions still remain on the role of aspirin therapy in primary prevention of CVD in diabetes: (i) are the absolute vascular benefits of aspirin counterbalanced by the potential for bleeding and (ii) in what groups of the population do the benefits of aspirin outweigh its bleeding hazards. Based on a recent comprehensive narrative review by Lippi and colleagues, the authors suggest that the harms of aspirin in primary prevention of CVD may be larger than the benefits, especially in the elderly general population. Our study findings suggest there may be important differences in the effect of aspirin by treatment dosage, treatment duration, as well as smoking status, but these results are based on limited data from subgroup analyses. Though our findings showed no suggestions of differences in the effect of aspirin by gender on all outcomes evaluated, there is evidence suggesting that the variation in the effect of aspirin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes could be explained by gender. In a meta-analysis of 23 trials which aimed to evaluate whether gender might play a role in explaining the large variation of aspirin efficacy across primary and secondary MI prevention trials, the authors demonstrated that gender accounted for a substantial proportion of the variability in the efficacy of aspirin in reducing MI rates across these trials. Emerging evidence points to the fact that women have an increased risk of aspirin resistance compared to men, which makes aspirin less effective in women. Apart from the condition diabetes which is associated with reduced rates of responsiveness to aspirin, other factors that could potentially reduce the antiplatelet effect of aspirin include older age, obesity, renal insufficiency, and platelet count. To answer all these pertinent questions may require an IPD meta-analysis based on all contributing trials. An updated meta-analysis by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration could help address some of these questions. There have been contradictory guideline recommendations on the role of aspirin in primary CVD prevention; however, the ADA recommends the use of low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in adults with type 1 and 2 diabetes who are at increased CVD risk, whereas not recommended for people at low CVD risk as the potential for bleeds likely offsets potential benefits in these people. Though the current findings do not justify these recommendations, it appears the clinical decision to initiate low dose aspirin for primary prevention is a complex process and should be individualised and tailored to each patient's baseline CVD and bleeding risk, as these tend to differ from one individual to another. Patients preferences should also be taken into account when making the decision. Leggio and colleagues in their review recommend that when a decision is taken to initiate primary CVD prevention, uncoated aspirin formulations with higher bioavailability should be prescribed at the lowest effective lower dose and concurrently used with proton-pump inhibitors for those at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided and those with rapid platelet turnover should be considered for twice-daily dosing regimen.

For primary prevention, low-dose aspirin should be considered in women aged 40 to 70 years with a 10-year cardiovascular risk of 20% or more or in women with diabetes and a 10-year cardiovascular risk of 10% or more. The risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits in low-risk women and in women aged 70 years and older.

3 ALLOCATION OF ASPIRIN FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION WITH CAC

Despite the highly prevalent use of aspirin for primary prevention of ASCVD historically, new data has called into question the overall benefit of aspirin given the associated increased risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. In response, the 2019 ACC/AHA Primary Prevention of ASCVD guideline changed the recommendation for low‐dose aspirin from Class I to Class IIb in select adults at elevated ASCVD risk but not elevated bleeding risk.

A 2014 study of 4229 aspirin‐naïve subjects from the MESA cohort investigated the role of CAC in identifying optimal candidates for primary prevention aspirin. Five‐year number needed to treat (NNT) estimates were calculated using a threshold of 18% RR reduction (RRR) in coronary events, and 5‐year number needed to harm (NNH) estimates were calculated using major bleeding risk from prior studies. Individuals with CAC ≥ 100 were determined to have an estimated likely net benefit with aspirin (low NNT, high NNH), while those with CAC of 0 had an estimated net harm. After consideration of these data, the Society of Cardiovascular CT recommended the strong consideration of aspirin in most patients with CAC > 100 who do not have elevated bleeding risk (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Advanced CAC scores identifies a population with very elevated ASCVD risk (equivalent to that in secondary prevention cohorts) who may benefit from aggressive preventive treatments. ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CAC, coronary artery calcium; SPRINT, Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial.

A subsequent 2020 analysis of 3540 MESA participants who were not at elevated bleeding risk was performed after the release of the updated ACC/AHA guidelines, strengthening the prior study's findings by using updated meta‐analysis data and observed bleeding rates to generate NNH. The 5‐year NNT was created from a 12% RRR in ASCVD events, and the 5‐year NNH was created from a 42% RR increase in major bleeding events. Again, CAC ≥ 100 identified subjects who likely would derive a net benefit from aspirin, and subjects with CAC of 0 would likely have net harm, irrespective of the subjects' underlying ASCVD risk.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. 1 Reductions in CVD morbidity and mortality have been achieved by reducing risk factor exposure with lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions, including use of aspirin. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Aspirin has been demonstrated to prevent a first myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke among individuals at high risk 12, 13 and to be cost‐effective. 16, 17 It also decreases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events and death among individuals who have already experienced an MI or stroke. 14, 15

Regular aspirin use for primary prevention (PP) of CVD has been evaluated in multiple well‐designed clinical trials. In 1989, the Physician's Health Study reported a 44% reduction in risk of a first MI for male participants who received aspirin. 12 Regular aspirin use led to a 24% reduction in risk for ischemic stroke in women as demonstrated in the Women's Health Study in 2005. 13 These studies and others 18, 19, 20 led the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2009 to develop a class A recommendation for PP aspirin use in men aged 45 to 79 years and women aged 55 to 79 years for whom CVD ischemic event prevention outweighs bleeding risk. 21 This recommendation provided a distinctly favorable recommendation for aspirin use compared with the 2002 statement. The 2009 recommendation also offered specific benefit/risk guidance tables to facilitate the use of aspirin for PP, compared with the 2002 statement, which only recommended a discussion between clinicians and patients at increased risk for CVD ischemic events. Contemporary studies of PP aspirin use in low‐risk cohorts (eg, the Japanese Primary Prevention Project 22) have since demonstrated similar reductions in a first MI. A recent systematic review analyzed 11 PP aspirin trials completed in the past 3 decades. The meta‐analysis demonstrated a significant 22% reduction in nonfatal MI (relative risk, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.87). 23

### Appropriate aspirin or anticoagulant use-million hearts ®… [^114pN4bf]. millionhearts.hhs.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Appropriate Aspirin or Anticoagulant Use Appropriate Aspirin Use Low-dose aspirin is a proven and effective medication for secondary cardiovascular disease prevention. 1, 2, 3 This includes treatment of patients with a history of heart attack, stroke, transient ischemic attack, vascular stent, or vascular surgery. Aspirin's role in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events is not in question and should be used barring significant contraindications. Data suggest that at least four million American adults not taking aspirin for secondary prevention as recommended. 4 For people who have never had a cardiovascular event, aspirin is only recommended if they are at high risk and only after consultation with a clinician. It is not recommended that a person starts or stops taking daily low-dose aspirin without talking to their clinical team.

5 Strokes related to atrial fibrillation tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. 5 Oral anticoagulant medications, like warfarin, when appropriately prescribed and used, significantly reduce the risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation. In addition to warfarin, there are now several direct-acting oral anticoagulants that are FDA approved. 7 National clinical practice guidelines recommend DOACs as first-line agents for most indications, including nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, especially among older patients with an elevated bleeding risk. 8 However, data suggest that appropriate anticoagulation therapies are sub-optimally utilized among patients with atrial fibrillation.

Jin J. Use of Aspirin to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease. JAMA. 2022; 327:

1624. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2022. 5564 The US Preventive Services Task Force has recently published recommendations about the use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease involves the buildup of plaque, which causes blockages inside important blood vessels in the body, including arteries of the heart, brain, and legs. Cardiovascular disease can cause heart attacks and strokes, and it is the leading cause of death in the US. Aspirin blocks the action of platelets, blood cells that clump together to form clots in the blood. Although aspirin can be useful to prevent clotting, it can also cause the serious side effect of bleeding. Aspirin can be used for either primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Primary prevention refers to use of aspirin in people without known cardiovascular disease to prevent its development. Secondary prevention refers to aspirin use in individuals who have already had a heart attack, a stroke, placement of a coronary artery stent, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery to prevent another such event. This USPSTF recommendation statement is focused on primary prevention. This recommendation applies to adults aged 40 years or older without known cardiovascular disease who are not at increased risk for bleeding. There is some evidence that low-dose aspirin has a small benefit in reducing the risk of nonfatal heart attack and stroke in adults aged 40 years or older who have no history of cardiovascular disease but are at increased cardiovascular risk.

In these patients, the magnitude of benefit of aspirin use rises with increasing cardiovascular risk, and the lifetime benefit is greater when aspirin is initiated at a younger age. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a small net benefit with use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease risk. For adults aged 60 years or older, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease has no net benefit.

### Aspirin for primary prevention-time to rethink our approach… [^113BVCwE]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Meta-analyses of early primary prevention trials of aspirin suggested a modest benefit of low-dose aspirin in the prevention of first heart attack or stroke at the cost of excess major bleeding. 2, 3 In fact, the number needed to treat to prevent a single cardiovascular event was comparable to the number needed to harm by causing 1 major bleeding event. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommend that low-dose aspirin use might be considered for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD among select adults ages 40 to 70 years at higher CVD risk but not at increased risk of bleeding. 1 Low-dose aspirin use is not recommended on a routine basis for primary prevention of CVD in adults older than 70 years, or among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding. A precision medicine approach holds promise to improve the identification of individuals who may benefit from the use of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD.

Pharmacologic therapy traditionally used for primary prevention consists of lipid-lowering therapy with statins, blood pressure–lowering therapy, glucose-lowering therapy, and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. 1 Traditionally, statins are recommended for the primary prevention of CVD in individuals with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or those determined to be at sufficient CVD risk after a patient-clinician risk discussion. Among adults with elevated blood pressure, pharmacologic therapy is used when blood pressure is sufficiently high, with blood pressure targets guided by background CVD risk. In contrast, aspirin is not considered in individuals based on their platelet activity.

However, if clinicians were able to identify individuals based on their increased platelet activity and an individual's likelihood of experiencing a platelet-mediated event, use of antiplatelet therapy and aspirin for the prevention of a first heart attack or stroke should be possible. Future study of aspirin for CVD prevention will require novel designs. Instead of identifying individuals' global CVD risk using traditional risk factors, the individual patient's platelet phenotype could be considered for the initiation of platelet targeting therapy, including aspirin. Because individuals with increased platelet activity are at greater cardiovascular risk and because aspirin decreases platelet activity, measuring platelet activity or the platelet transcriptome in individuals without CVD may help to identify a high-risk group that would benefit from preventive aspirin therapy.
