ARB vs ace I

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a comparison of ACE inhibitors versus ARBs, including mechanisms, outcomes, tolerability, special populations, and guideline-based recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms and whether they plausibly explain outcome differences. Then, I should verify the comparative efficacy on major cardiovascular outcomes from high-quality evidence. Next, I will examine tolerability and safety signals, including cough, angioedema, and renal/hyperkalemia risks. After that, I need to consider special populations such as diabetes, heart failure, CKD, and dialysis. I should then review guideline positions and reconcile any apparent contradictions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical decision framework and double-check for any pitfalls like dual RAS blockade or perioperative issues [^1143TDMX] [^111MARku] [^114bnyEQ].

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic distinctions because they often drive clinical expectations. ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II generation and increase bradykinin, which may confer additional vasodilatory and organ-protective effects, whereas ARBs selectively block the AT1 receptor while sparing AT2 signaling, which is often described as potentially beneficial, though clinical translation has been inconsistent; wait, I should verify whether ARBs truly provide more complete RAS blockade — on paper they do, but ACE-independent pathways can still generate angiotensin II, so the clinical advantage is not guaranteed in outcomes trials [^114t3nQi] [^1147mTro].

> Next, I should review head-to-head and placebo-controlled outcome data to avoid jumping to conclusions from mechanism alone. High-quality syntheses show that ACE inhibitors and ARBs have broadly similar effects on composite cardiovascular outcomes, with most differences attributable to achieved blood pressure; however, some analyses suggest ACE inhibitors may have blood pressure–independent reductions in coronary heart disease events, whereas ARBs do not consistently show such an effect, and a large BMJ review found no excess MI risk with ARBs versus ACE inhibitors, which reassures me about safety even if efficacy nuances exist [^115ABmEf] [^1118kMZa] [^111KJQX8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mortality differences. I initially thought ARBs might be inferior for mortality, but I should double-check the direct comparisons. The Cochrane review of head-to-head trials in primary hypertension found no significant difference between ACE inhibitors and ARBs for total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or major cardiovascular events, while ARBs had fewer withdrawals due to adverse effects, which is clinically meaningful for adherence; similarly, contemporary emulation analyses from ACCORD-BP and SPRINT found similar cardiovascular event rates between ARB and ACE inhibitor initiators, with a signal for lower death on ARBs that warrants cautious interpretation given the observational nature and weighting methods [^112HdZPs] [^116i4YKJ].

> I need to check tolerability carefully because it often dictates real-world effectiveness. ACE inhibitors have a higher incidence of cough and a small but important risk of angioedema, with higher discontinuation rates than ARBs in multiple analyses; conversely, ARBs are generally better tolerated, though both classes can cause renal function decline and hyperkalemia, especially in CKD or when combined with other RAAS agents; importantly, dual ACEi+ARB therapy increases adverse events without consistent outcome benefit and is discouraged in guidelines, so I should confirm we avoid that combination in routine practice [^112HdZPs] [^111MARku] [^113pQtY4].

> Now, let me consider diabetes, where I recall claims that ACE inhibitors reduce mortality but ARBs do not. A meta-analysis in diabetes did show ACE inhibitors reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and major events, whereas ARBs reduced heart failure but not mortality, suggesting a class difference; but wait, I should verify whether head-to-head data contradict this — indeed, direct comparisons generally show similar event rates, so the apparent mortality advantage of ACE inhibitors may reflect differences in trial populations, background therapies, or publication contexts rather than a universal superiority of the class in all diabetic patients [^1162wsLH] [^112HdZPs].

> For heart failure, I should confirm where each class fits. ACE inhibitors remain foundational therapy for HFrEF, and ARBs are appropriate alternatives when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated; combination ACEi+ARB reduces heart failure hospitalizations but not mortality and increases adverse effects, so it should not be routine; ARNIs have now superseded ACE inhibitors as first-line RAAS therapy in HFrEF, which I need to remember when sequencing therapy in current practice [^112EeCCz] [^115GMNgr].

> In CKD, let me verify the strength of evidence. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce proteinuria and slow progression, particularly in patients with albuminuria, and guidelines recommend either class when albuminuria is present; I should also note that stopping ACE inhibitors in advanced CKD may worsen kidney outcomes, whereas the STOP-ACEi program suggests that in selected advanced CKD patients, discontinuation may not worsen eGFR decline, though this remains controversial and not broadly generalizable; I need to ensure close monitoring of creatinine and potassium after initiation or dose changes [^1132EAqg] [^117Cjtr6].

> But wait, what about dialysis patients — do ACE inhibitors or ARBs help there? I should double-check because many assume RAAS blockade is uniformly beneficial. Meta-analyses in dialysis populations show no significant reduction in cardiovascular events or mortality with ACE inhibitors or ARBs versus control, despite reductions in left ventricular mass, so I should avoid extrapolating CKD benefits to dialysis and individualize decisions in this group [^1162nMJ4] [^11328EfE].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my recommendations align with standards. Contemporary U.S. and European guidelines list ACE inhibitors and ARBs as equivalent first-line options for hypertension, emphasize achieving blood pressure targets, and explicitly advise against dual RAS blockade; they also provide condition-specific preferences, such as favoring ACE inhibitors or ARBs in diabetes with albuminuria and in HFrEF, with ARBs as alternatives when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated [^1143TDMX] [^111MARku] [^114bnyEQ].

> I will now examine special scenarios where one class may be preferred. In patients with a history of ACE inhibitor–induced cough or angioedema, ARBs are the safer choice; in Black patients, the risk of ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema is higher, so ARBs may be preferred when a RAS blocker is indicated; in women of childbearing potential, ARBs are contraindicated due to teratogenicity, so ACE inhibitors are preferred if a RAS blocker is needed; in symptomatic HFrEF, prioritize ARNI, then ACE inhibitor if ARNI is not feasible, with ARB as the alternative [^112jpXUh] [^115GMNgr].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and verify it covers the essentials. Start by identifying compelling indications such as HFrEF, diabetes with albuminuria, or post–myocardial infarction, where a RAS blocker is strongly indicated; if there is no compelling indication, choose among first-line classes based on comorbidities, tolerability, and cost; prefer ACE inhibitors when there is strong outcome evidence in a specific phenotype or when cost is a major driver; prefer ARBs when ACE inhibitor intolerance is present or when tolerability is paramount; avoid dual RAS blockade; and always prioritize blood pressure control and adherence because class effects are modest relative to the impact of achieving targets [^1143TDMX] [^111MARku] [^112MMytN].

> Finally, I should double-check for pitfalls. Dual ACEi+ARB therapy should be avoided outside of rare, carefully selected contexts due to harm without outcome benefit; perioperative initiation of ACE inhibitors or ARBs is not clearly beneficial and may increase hypotension, so management should be individualized; and in advanced CKD, I need to monitor for hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury after starting or uptitrating RAS blockade, recognizing that a modest creatinine rise is expected and acceptable if clinically appropriate [^113pQtY4] [^111p3oTu] [^1132EAqg].

ACE inhibitors and ARBs both lower blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular risk, but **ACE inhibitors are first-line** for heart failure, post-MI, and diabetes with albuminuria because they reduce mortality and slow renal progression [^115YgDjY] [^1162wsLH] [^112V7dMV]. ARBs are preferred when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated due to cough or angioedema, with similar cardiovascular benefits but fewer adverse effects [^112HdZPs] [^111MARku]. Both are first-line for hypertension, and **dual therapy is not recommended** due to increased risk of renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia [^1143TDMX] [^113pQtY4] [^114bnyEQ].

---

## Mechanisms of action

ACE inhibitors block ACE, reducing angiotensin II and increasing bradykinin, which enhances vasodilation but can cause cough and angioedema [^114t3nQi]. ARBs selectively block AT1 receptors, reducing angiotensin II effects while sparing bradykinin, resulting in fewer cough and angioedema cases [^112HdZPs].

---

## Clinical indications

| **Clinical indication** | **Ace inhibitors** | **Arbs** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypertension | First-line therapy | First-line therapy |
| Heart failure (HFrEF) | First-line therapy | Alternative if ACE inhibitor not tolerated |
| Post-myocardial infarction | First-line therapy | Alternative if ACE inhibitor not tolerated |
| Diabetic nephropathy | First-line therapy | Alternative if ACE inhibitor not tolerated |
| Chronic kidney disease with proteinuria | First-line therapy | Alternative if ACE inhibitor not tolerated |

---

## Cardiovascular outcomes

ACE inhibitors reduce mortality, myocardial infarction, and heart failure hospitalizations across heart failure, post-MI, and diabetic nephropathy populations [^113CvTMe] [^1162wsLH]. ARBs have similar cardiovascular benefits to ACE inhibitors but **do not consistently reduce mortality** in heart failure or post-MI settings [^112EeCCz] [^111CnQd4].

---

## Renal outcomes

ACE inhibitors reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression, especially in diabetic nephropathy [^111MARku]. ARBs also reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression, with **similar efficacy** to ACE inhibitors [^114sg6en].

---

## Safety and tolerability

ACE inhibitors commonly cause cough (5–20%) and rarely angioedema (0.1–0.7%); they can also cause hyperkalemia and renal impairment, particularly in CKD [^notfound]. ARBs have a lower incidence of cough and angioedema, with **similar risks** of hyperkalemia and renal impairment [^111MARku].

---

## Combination therapy

Dual ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy is **not recommended** due to increased risk of renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and hypotension without added benefit [^113pQtY4] [^114bnyEQ].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Diabetes mellitus**: ACE inhibitors are preferred due to proven mortality and renal benefits; ARBs are acceptable alternatives [^1162wsLH] [^112nNNRK].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: ACE inhibitors are preferred for proteinuria; ARBs are alternatives [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Both are contraindicated; ACE inhibitors are teratogenic [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines

Current guidelines recommend either ACE inhibitors or ARBs as **first-line therapy** for hypertension, heart failure, post-MI, and diabetic nephropathy, with ACE inhibitors preferred in specific populations due to stronger outcome data [^1143TDMX] [^1136tJUN].

---

ACE inhibitors and ARBs are both effective for hypertension and cardiovascular risk reduction, but **ACE inhibitors are preferred** for heart failure, post-MI, and diabetic nephropathy due to stronger mortality and renal outcome data. ARBs are preferred when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated, with similar cardiovascular benefits and fewer adverse effects.

### The divergent cardiovascular effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on myocardial infarction and death [^112zTKKQ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a central role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and vascular disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) suppress angiotensin II (ANG II) concentrations, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) block the binding of ANG II to AT1 receptors. ACEis and ARBs are both effective anti-hypertensive agents and have similar risk reductions in stroke - a blood pressure dependent phenomenon. ACEis also reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and mortality in high risk hypertensive patients, as well as in diabetics, the elderly, those with vascular disease, and in congestive heart failure. ARBs, in contrast, do not reduce the risk of MI or death in clinical trials where the comparator has been another active therapy or even a placebo. Systematic reviews of ARBs that include meta-analyses or meta-regression analyses confirm that ARBs lack the cardiovascular protective effects of ACEis, which in part are "independent" of blood pressure lowering. Practice guidelines, especially those in high risk hypertensive patients, should reflect the evidence that ACEis and ARBs have divergent cardiovascular effects - ACEis reduce mortality, whereas ARBs do not. ACEis should be the preferred RAAS inhibitor in high risk patients.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertension: to use or Not to use? [^115tMHxs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Most guidelines for the management of patients with cardiovascular disease recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-choice therapy, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are merely considered an alternative for ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients. The aim of this review was to compare outcomes and adverse events between ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients. In patients with hypertension and hypertension with compelling indications, we found no difference in efficacy between ARBs and ACE inhibitors with regard to the surrogate endpoint of blood pressure and outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. However, ACE inhibitors remain associated with cough and a very low risk of angioedema and fatalities. Overall withdrawal rates because of adverse events are lower with ARBs than with ACE inhibitors. Given the equal outcome efficacy but fewer adverse events with ARBs, risk-to-benefit analysis in aggregate indicates that at present there is little, if any, reason to use ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension or its compelling indications.

### Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension [^112HdZPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed for primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg). However, while ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in placebo-controlled trials, ARBs have not. Therefore, a comparison of the efficacies of these two drug classes in primary hypertension for preventing total mortality and cardiovascular events is important.

Objectives

To compare the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on total mortality and cardiovascular events, and their rates of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs), in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the ISI Web of Science up to July 2014. We contacted study authors for missing and unpublished information, and also searched the reference lists of relevant reviews for eligible studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials enrolling people with uncontrolled or controlled primary hypertension with or without other risk factors. Included trials must have compared an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in a head-to-head manner, and lasted for a duration of at least one year. If background blood pressure lowering agents were continued or added during the study, the protocol to do so must have been the same in both study arms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Nine studies with 11,007 participants were included. Of the included studies, five reported data on total mortality, three reported data on total cardiovascular events, and four reported data on cardiovascular mortality. No study separately reported cardiovascular morbidity. In contrast, eight studies contributed data on WDAE. Included studies were of good to moderate quality. There was no evidence of a difference between ACE inhibitors and ARBs for total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.10), total cardiovascular events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.19), or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13). Conversely, a high level of evidence indicated a slightly lower incidence of WDAE for ARBs as compared with ACE inhibitors (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.8%, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 55 over 4.1 years), mainly attributable to a higher incidence of dry cough with ACE inhibitors. The quality of the evidence for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes was limited by possible publication bias, in that several studies were initially eligible for inclusion in this review, but had no extractable data available for the hypertension subgroup. To this end, the evidence for total mortality was judged to be moderate, while the evidence for total cardiovascular events was judged to be low by the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

Our analyses found no evidence of a difference in total mortality or cardiovascular outcomes for ARBs as compared with ACE inhibitors, while ARBs caused slightly fewer WDAEs than ACE inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors have shown efficacy in these outcomes over placebo, our results cannot be used to extrapolate the same conclusion for ARBs directly, which have not been studied in placebo-controlled trials for hypertension. Thus, the substitution of an ARB for an ACE inhibitor, while supported by evidence on grounds of tolerability, must be made in consideration of the weaker evidence for the efficacy of ARBs regarding mortality and morbidity outcomes compared with ACE inhibitors. Additionally, our data mostly derives from participants with existing clinical sequelae of hypertension, and it would be useful to have data from asymptomatic people to increase the generalizability of this review. Unpublished subgroup data of hypertensive participants in existing trials comparing ACE inhibitors and ARBs needs to be made available for this purpose.

### New users of angiotensin II receptor blocker-versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based antihypertensive medication regimens and cardiovascular disease events: a secondary analysis of ACCORD-BP and SPRINT [^116i4YKJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) block distinct components of the renin-angiotensin system. Whether this translates into differential effects on cardiovascular disease events remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS We used the ACCORD-BP (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Blood Pressure) trial and the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) to emulate target trials of new users of ARBs versus ACEIs on cardiovascular disease events (primary outcome) and death (secondary outcome). We estimated marginal cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and treatment-specific cumulative incidence functions with inverse probability of treatment weights. We identified 3298 new users of ARBs or ACEIs (ACCORD-BP: 374 ARB versus 884 ACEI; SPRINT: 727 ARB versus 1313 ACEI). For participants initiating ARBs versus ACEIs, the inverse probability of treatment weight rate of the primary outcome was 3.2 versus 3.5 per 100 person-years in ACCORD-BP (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.63–1.31]) and 1.8 versus 2.2 per 100 person-years in SPRINT (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.56–1.18]). There were no appreciable differences in pooled analyses, except that ARBs versus ACEIs were associated with a lower death rate (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.37–0.85]). ARBs were associated with a lower rate of the primary outcome among subgroups of male versus female participants, non-Hispanic Black versus non-Hispanic White participants, and those randomly assigned to standard versus intensive blood pressure (P interaction: < 0.01, 0.05, and < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS In this secondary analysis of ACCORD-BP and SPRINT, new users of ARB- versus ACEI-based antihypertensive medication regimens experienced similar cardiovascular disease events rates, with important subgroup differences and lower rates of death overall.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: where do we stand now? [^113CvTMe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease represents a continuum that starts with risk factors, such as hypertension, and progresses to atherosclerosis, target organ damage, and ultimately leads to heart failure or stroke. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been shown to be beneficial at all stages of this continuum. Both classes of agent can prevent or reverse endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, thereby potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. Such a reduction has been shown with ACE inhibitors in patients with coronary artery disease, but no such data are currently available for ARBs. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to reduce damage in target organs, such as the heart and kidney, and to decrease cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with congestive heart failure. Trials, such as the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) and the Telmisartan Randomised Assessment Study in ACE-Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND), that compare telmisartan, ramipril, and their combination in high-risk patients with vascular end-organ damage, should provide important new insights into the benefits of intervention with RAS blockade along the cardiorenovascular continuum.

### Are there meaningful differences in blood pressure control with current antihypertensive agents? [^111usRUX]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and small reductions in blood pressure can have a substantial impact on outcome. Effective control of hypertension per se is important in reducing morbidity and mortality, but there is growing evidence that the class of drug used in treatment may affect patient outcomes. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial provided evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), are particularly effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in a wide range of patients. These beneficial effects of ACEI may be independent of antihypertensive effect. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are the newest class of antihypertensive drug to enter clinical use. By blocking the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, ARB achieve more complete blockade of the RAS than ACEI. The ARB also have a substantially better side effect profile than ACEI, and early evidence suggests that ARB are beneficial in combating hypertension-related target organ damage. These favorable characteristics suggest that ARB should be considered as first-line treatment for hypertension. Based on comparative antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan, a new ARB, may represent a significant addition to this drug class.

### Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular deaths, and cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis [^1162wsLH]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may have different effects on cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis to separately evaluate the effects of ACEIs and ARBs on all-cause mortality, CV deaths, and major CV events in patients with DM. DATA SOURCES Data sources included MEDLINE (1966–2012), EMBASE (1988–2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, conference proceedings, and article reference lists.

Study Selection

We included randomized clinical trials reporting the effects of ACEI and ARB regimens for DM on all-cause mortality, CV deaths, and major CV events with an observation period of at least 12 months. Studies were excluded if they were crossover trials.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dichotomous outcome data from individual trials were analyzed using the risk ratio (RR) measure and its 95% CI with random-effects models. We estimated the difference between the estimates of the subgroups according to tests for interaction. We performed meta-regression analyses to identify sources of heterogeneity.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end points were all-cause mortality and death from CV causes. Secondary end points were the effects of ACEIs and ARBs on major CV events.

Results

Twenty-three of 35 identified trials compared ACEIs with placebo or active drugs (32,827 patients) and 13 compared ARBs with no therapy (controls) (23,867 patients). When compared with controls (placebo/active treatment), ACEIs significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 13% (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78–0.98), CV deaths by 17% (0.83; 0.70–0.99), and major CV events by 14% (0.86; 0.77–0.95), including myocardial infarction by 21% (0.79; 0.65–0.95) and heart failure by 19% (0.81; 0.71–0.93). Treatment with ARBs did not significantly affect all-cause mortality (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.82–1.08), CV death rate (1.21; 0.81–1.80), and major CV events (0.94; 0.85–1.01) with the exception of heart failure (0.70; 0.59–0.82). Both ACEIs and ARBs were not associated with a decrease in the risk for stroke in patients with DM. Meta-regression analysis showed that the ACEI treatment effect on all-cause mortality and CV death did not vary significantly with the starting baseline blood pressure and proteinuria of the trial participants and the type of ACEI and DM.

Conclusions and Relevance

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduced all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and major CV events in patients with DM, whereas ARBs had no benefits on these outcomes. Thus, ACEIs should be considered as first-line therapy to limit excess mortality and morbidity in this population.

### The clinical use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [^112LECpj]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Through an integrative understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiologic characteristics at the multiorgan level, significant achievements in cardiovascular therapeutics have been achieved and enabled the rationale design and development of drugs such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). In this article, we present a detailed review of the physiologic features of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), ACE inhibitors and ARB clinical pharmacologic characteristics, and specific diseases in which they are considered to be the standard of the care as supported by important clinical trial data. It is envisioned that an updated and detailed understanding of ACE inhibitors and ARBs will facilitate their successful use in the treatment of heart failure, myocardial infarction, hypertension, renal failure, and diabetic nephropathy.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: challenges in comparative effectiveness using Medicare data [^1173FRJh]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

An evidence gap exists in comparing the effectiveness of angiotensin receptor II blockers (ARBs) for hypertension with that of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). We identified elderly hypertensive patients in whom ACEI/ARB therapy had been initiated after hospitalization for coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), or stroke and who were eligible for Medicare and state pharmacy assistance programs. Of 18,801 initiators of ACEIs and 2,641 initiators of ARBs, 2,535 died during the follow-up. We observed substantial differences in characteristics between ARB and ACEI initiators, suggesting that ARB users were more health seeking. The incidence of death and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in ACEI initiators was 77 and 22 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. The relative risk for SCD comparing ARB initiators to ACEI initiators was 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50–0.96); when the analysis was restricted to patients with low ejection fraction (EF), the relative risk was 1.1. The reduced risk of SCD can be explained, at least partly, by (i) residual confounding because ARB users were healthier on unobserved domains and (ii) lack of data on EF.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers in hypertensive patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ihg48]. Hypertension Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are considered primary drugs for the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are used when ACEIs cannot be tolerated. However, it is unclear whether ACEIs or ARBs are more appropriate first-line drugs in hypertensive patients with MI or heart failure (HF). The present study aimed to compare the effects of ACEIs and those of ARBs in these patients. Sixty randomized controlled trails (RCTs) that compared the effects of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with MI or HF were extracted by searching PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Database, and the Medical Central Journal database according to the PRISMA guidelines. We finally selected six eligible RCTs and identified three systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The proportion of hypertensive patients ranged from 36 to 69%. Meta-analyses were performed for recurrence or new onset of MI (risk ratio 0.97 [95% confidence interval: 0.88, 1.06]), hospitalization for HF (0.98 [0.84, 1.14]), cardiovascular or total mortality (0.98 [0.91, 1.05]), cardiovascular events or stroke (1.02 [0.94, 1.11]), and adverse events (1.40 [1.11, 1.77]). There were no significant differences between ACEIs and ARBs for all outcomes, except adverse events. Study discontinuation owing to adverse events was significantly more common with ACEIs than with ARBs. Among hypertensive patients with MI or HF, it appears desirable to select the most appropriate drugs, ACEIs or ARBs, in each case by considering the function level, patient background, comorbidity presence, blood pressure target, drug price and other such factors comprehensively in addition to considering tolerability.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers: evidence for preserving target organs [^114t3nQi]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major problem throughout the developed world. Although current antihypertensive treatment regimens reduce morbidity and mortality, patients are often noncompliant, and medications may not completely normalize blood pressure. As a result, current therapy frequently does not prevent or reverse the cardiovascular remodeling that often occurs when blood pressure is chronically elevated. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is effective in controlling hypertension and treating congestive heart failure. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit the activity of the RAS, but these two classes of antihypertensive medications have different mechanisms of action and different pharmacologic profiles. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors block a single pathway in the production of angiotensin II (Ang II). In addition, angiotensin I is not the only substrate for ACE. The ACE inhibitors also block the degradation of bradykinin that may have potential benefits in cardiovascular disease. Bradykinin is, however, the presumed cause of cough associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. Data from clinical trials on ACE inhibitors serve to support the involvement of the RAS in the development of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin receptor blockers act distally in the RAS to block the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor selectively. Thus, ARBs are more specific agents and avoid many side effects. Experimental and clinical trials have documented the efficacy of ARBs in preserving target-organ function and reversing cardiovascular remodeling. In some instances, maximal benefit may be obtained with Ang II blockade using both ARBs and ACE inhibitors. This review describes clinical trials that document the efficacy of ARBs in protecting the myocardium, blood vessels, and renal vasculature.

### Are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers especially useful for cardiovascular protection? [^111Kq54X]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article seeks to objectively review the clinical trial evidence to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) have special cardiovascular protective effects.

Methods

An objective review of the clinical trial evidence.

Results

Clinical trials in hypertensive patients comparing ACEI and ARB with other drugs generally showed no difference in the primary cardiovascular outcome (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Group, Captopril Prevention Project, Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension 2, Japan Multicenter Investigation for Cardiovascular Diseases-B Randomized Trial, Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study Group, Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation). Where the primary, or major secondary, cardiovascular end-point favors one of the treatment arms, it was always the arm with the lower achieved blood pressure that saw the better clinical result as in Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension Study, Captopril Prevention Project, Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, and Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation. Trials comparing ACEI or ARB against placebo in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events have not showed a consistent result; cardiovascular outcomes were reduced in Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation, European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease, and the Jikei Heart Study, but were not significantly reduced in Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study, Comparison of Arnlodipine vs Enalapril to Limit Occurrences of Thrombosis Trial, Prevention of Events with ACEIs Trial, Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE-Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease Trial, and Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes Trial. In the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial, combining ACEIs with ARBs in high-risk patients did not reduce cardiovascular or renal outcomes compared with ACEI monotherapy alone. This absence of a reduction in cardiovascular outcome from the ACEI and ARB combination arm is further evidence suggesting that these drugs do not have any special cardiovascular protective effect. This objective review thus shows that the rennin-angiotensin antagonists do not have special cardiovascular protective properties.

Conclusion

The key to reducing cardiovascular outcome is to appropriately control blood pressure as well as to treat all other coronary risk factors.

### New opportunities in cardiovascular patient management: a survey of clinical data on the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [^1118dVu9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) differ in their actions on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). ACE inhibitors prevent the formation of angiotensin II, although angiotensin II may still be generated by alternative pathways. However, ACE inhibitors interrupt bradykinin breakdown, which in turn potentially enhances nitric oxide and prostacyclin mechanisms. In contrast, ARBs selectively prevent the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor while leaving the potentially beneficial effects of the AT(2) receptor unaffected. The supposition is that dual blockade of the RAAS effectively overcomes the harmful effects of angiotensin II mediated by the AT(1) receptor while offering the additional effects of the ACE inhibitor. This concept was first evaluated clinically more than a decade ago in small-scale studies that were not sufficiently powered to conclusively demonstrate benefits from dual blockade. Subsequently, larger-scale trials have been conducted to determine the effects of a combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in combating the effects of angiotensin II at different stages of cardiovascular and renal disease. This review explores these data in areas, such as hypertension, renal disease, and cardiovascular disease, and draws on this preliminary evidence to support the rationale for the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) program, which aims to fully explore the clinical end points and effects of dual RAAS blockade in patients at high risk for cardiovascular outcomes.

### Comparative effectiveness of antihypertensive medication for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review and multiple treatments meta-analysis [^116699LN]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

We conducted a systematic review of evidence from randomized controlled trials to answer the following research question: What are the relative effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease outcomes for healthy people at risk of cardiovascular disease?

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED (up to February 2011) and CENTRAL (up to May 2009), and reference lists in recent systematic reviews. Titles and abstracts were assessed for relevance and those potentially fulfilling our inclusion criteria were then assessed in full text. Two reviewers made independent assessments at each step. We selected the following main outcomes: total mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke. We also report on angina, heart failure and incidence of diabetes. We conducted a multiple treatments meta-analysis using random-effects models. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE-instrument.

Results

We included 25 trials. Overall, the results were mixed, with few significant differences, and with no drug-class standing out as superior across multiple outcomes. The only significant finding for total mortality based on moderate to high quality evidence was that beta-blockers (atenolol) were inferior to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) (relative risk (RR) 1.14; 95% credibility interval (CrI) 1.02 to 1.28). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors came out inferior to calcium-channel blockers (CCB) regarding stroke-risk (RR 1.19; 1.03 to 1.38), but superior regarding risk of heart failure (RR 0.82; 0.69 to 0.94), both based on moderate quality evidence. Diuretics reduced the risk of myocardial infarction compared to beta-blockers (RR 0.82; 0.68 to 0.98), and lowered the risk of heart failure compared to CCB (RR 0.73; 0.62 to 0.84), beta-blockers (RR 0.73; 0.54 to 0.96), and alpha-blockers (RR 0.51; 0.40 to 0.64). The risk of diabetes increased with diuretics compared to ACE-inhibitors (RR 1.43; 1.12 to 1.83) and CCB (RR 1.27; 1.05 to 1.57).

Conclusion

Based on the available evidence, there seems to be little or no difference between commonly used blood pressure lowering medications for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Beta-blockers (atenolol) and alpha-blockers may not be first-choice drugs as they were the only drug-classes that were not significantly superior to any other, for any outcomes.

### Limitations of angiotensin inhibition [^1147mTro]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) have beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular disease and in those with diabetes-related and diabetes-independent chronic kidney diseases. These beneficial effects are independent of the antihypertensive properties of these drugs. However, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and combinations of agents in these two classes are limited in the extent to which they inhibit the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Angiotensin breakthrough and aldosterone breakthrough may be important mechanisms involved in limiting the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Whether direct renin inhibitors will overcome some of the limitations of ACE-inhibitor and ARB therapy by blocking the deleterious effects of the RAAS remains to be proven. This important area is, however, in need of further investigation.

### Clinical trials of angiotensin receptor blockers in heart failure: what do we know and what will we learn? [^111ij2Kx]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Although interruption of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has evolved as the therapy of choice in heart failure based on large-scale morbidity and mortality clinical studies, treatment with angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) offers an alternative and potentially superior method of treating this condition. Early pilot studies were quite promising; however, two well designed, large-scale trials have shown that the reduction in heart failure mortality with ARB is not significantly different from the reduction with ACE inhibitors. Possible reasons for lack of ARB superiority include insufficient dosing of ARB, differences in effects mediated through angiotensin II type 2 receptors, interaction with beta-blockers, and bradykinin-mediated effects specific to ACE inhibitors. The ACE inhibitors remain the current therapy of choice in treating heart failure until further outcomes trial data become available; however, ARB are a reasonable alternative in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors.

### A hard look at angiotensin receptor blockers in heart failure [^115YgDjY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Multiple trials over the past several years have examined indications for angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction, both acutely after myocardial infarction and in chronic heart failure. Yet despite these data, there is still confusion regarding the efficacy of ARBs as monotherapy in these patient populations, as well as the specific indications for combination ARB/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. We examine the key differences among the trials-including the ACE inhibitor dose, the ARB and its dose, blood pressure reduction, and patient populations-to present our perspective on ARB use, alone or in combination with ACE inhibitors, in patients with chronic heart failure and post-myocardial infarction left ventricular dysfunction. We conclude that ACE inhibitors remain the first-line therapy for left ventricular dysfunction. Angiotensin receptor blockers should be reserved for monotherapy in ACE intolerant patients and for combination therapy in symptomatic class II/III patients with chronic heart failure.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are beneficial in normotensive atherosclerotic patients: a collaborative meta-analysis of randomized trials [^114uHFRA]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

It is unclear whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are beneficial in individuals with, or at increased risk for, atherosclerotic vascular disease who are normotensive.

Methods and Results

Two investigators independently searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1980 to 2011, bibliographies, and contacted primary study authors for randomized placebo-controlled outcome trials evaluating ACE-I or ARB which enrolled at least 1000 patients with, or at increased risk for, atherosclerotic vascular disease and followed them for at least 12 months. We approached all eligible trials to obtain data stratified by baseline systolic pressures. We pooled data from 13 trials of 80 594 patients; outcomes included 9043 all-cause deaths, 5674 cardiovascular deaths, 3106 myocardial infarctions, and 4452 strokes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or ARB reduced the composite primary outcome of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke by 11% (95% confidence interval 7–15%), with no variation in efficacy across baseline systolic blood pressure strata. In patients with baseline systolic pressure < 130 mmHg, ACE-I or ARB reduced the composite primary outcome by 16% (10–23%) and all-cause mortality by 11% (4–18%)-this benefit was consistent across all subgroups examined including those without systolic heart failure (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.75–0.88) and those without diabetes (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70–0.89).

Conclusion

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or ARB are beneficial in patients with, or at increased risk for, atherosclerotic disease even if their systolic pressure is < 130 mmHg before treatment.

### Establishing a new option for target-organ protection: rationale for ARB plus ACE inhibitor combination therapy [^1121SKvq]. American Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the promotion of cardiovascular disease and target-organ damage, mediated in part by hypertension. Combination therapy targeting RAS activation may reduce target-organ damage and provide superior blood pressure (BP) control; combining angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) represents one possible approach. In monotherapy studies, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have demonstrated similar positive effects on BP and on RAS-related target-organ damage, including nephropathy and congestive heart failure. Studies of combination therapy, most of which involved addition of an ARB to existing ACE inhibitor therapy, have demonstrated benefits among patients with congestive heart failure and renal disease. However, variances in study design and populations, dosing and titration methods, and clinical end points, in addition to inherent differences between agents, limit the ability to reach clinically meaningful conclusions about the value of dual RAS inhibition. Trials designed to document such efficacy are currently underway.

### Effects of different blood-pressure-lowering regimens on major cardiovascular events: results of prospectively-designed overviews of randomised trials [^115ABmEf]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

The benefits of reducing blood pressure on the risks of major cardiovascular disease are well established, but uncertainty remains about the comparative effects of different blood-pressure-lowering regimens. We aimed to estimate effects of strategies based on different drug classes (angiotensin-converting-enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-receptor blockers [ARBs], and diuretics or beta blockers) or those targeting different blood pressure goals, on the risks of major cardiovascular events and death.

Methods

We did seven sets of prospectively-designed overviews with data from 29 randomised trials (n = 162341). The trial eligibility criteria, primary outcomes, and main hypotheses were specified before the result of any contributing trial was known.

Findings

In placebo-controlled trials the relative risks of total major cardiovascular events were reduced by regimens based on ACE inhibitors (22%; 95% CI 17–27) or calcium antagonists (18%; 5–29). Greater risk reductions were produced by regimens that targeted lower blood pressure goals (15%; 5–24). ARB-based regimens reduced the risks of total major cardiovascular events (10%; 4–17) compared with control regimens. There were no significant differences in total major cardiovascular events between regimens based on ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, or diuretics or beta blockers, although ACE-inhibitor-based regimens reduced blood pressure less. There was evidence of some differences between active regimens in their effects on cause-specific outcomes. For every outcome other than heart failure, the difference between randomised groups in achieved blood pressure reduction was directly related to the observed difference in risk.

Interpretation

Treatment with any commonly-used regimen reduces the risk of total major cardiovascular events, and larger reductions in blood pressure produce larger reductions in risk.

### Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers on cardiovascular outcomes in dialysis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162nMJ4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are recommended by guidelines as first-line antihypertensive therapies in the general population or in patients with earlier stages of kidney disease. However, the cardioprotective benefit of these agents among patients on dialysis remains uncertain.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, PubMed and Cochrane databases from inception through February 2022 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of ACEIs/ARBs relative to placebo or no add-on treatment in patients receiving dialysis. RCTs were eligible if they assessed fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events as a primary efficacy endpoint.

Results

We identified five RCTs involving 1582 dialysis patients. Compared with placebo or no add-on treatment, the use of ACEIs/ARBs was not associated with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular events {risk ratio [RR] 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57–1.11]}. Furthermore, there was no benefit in cardiovascular mortality [RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.59–1.14)] and all-cause mortality [RR 0.86 (95% CI 0.64–1.15)]. These results were consistent when the included RCTs were stratified by subgroups, including hypertension, ethnicity, sample size, duration of follow-up and quality.

Conclusion

The present meta-analysis showed that among patients on dialysis, the use of ACEIs/ARBs is not associated with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality as compared with placebo or no add-on treatment.

### Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for preventing the progression of diabetic kidney disease [^113uVeP1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines suggest that adults with diabetes and kidney disease receive treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2006.

Objectives

We compared the efficacy and safety of ACEi and ARB therapy (either as monotherapy or in combination) on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in adults with diabetes and kidney disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplants Register of Studies to 17 March 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included studies evaluating ACEi or ARB alone or in combination, compared to each other, placebo or no treatment in people with diabetes and kidney disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

One hundred and nine studies (28,341 randomised participants) were eligible for inclusion. Overall, the risk of bias was high. Compared to placebo or no treatment, ACEi may make little or no difference to all-cause death (24 studies, 7413 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.15; I² = 23%; low certainty) and with similar withdrawals from treatment (7 studies, 5306 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.19; I² = 0%; low certainty). ACEi may prevent kidney failure (8 studies, 6643 participants: RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; I² = 0%; low certainty). Compared to placebo or no treatment, ARB may make little or no difference to all-cause death (11 studies, 4260 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; I² = 0%; low certainty). ARB have uncertain effects on withdrawal from treatment (3 studies, 721 participants: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.26; I² = 2%; low certainty) and cardiovascular death (6 studies, 878 participants: RR 3.36, 95% CI 0.93 to 12.07; low certainty). ARB may prevent kidney failure (3 studies, 3227 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94; I² = 0%; low certainty), doubling of serum creatinine (SCr) (4 studies, 3280 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97; I² = 32%; low certainty), and the progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria (5 studies, 815 participants: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85; I² = 74%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi, ARB had uncertain effects on all-cause death (15 studies, 1739 participants: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.88; I² = 0%; low certainty), withdrawal from treatment (6 studies, 612 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28; I² = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (13 studies, 1606 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.98; I² = 0%; low certainty), kidney failure (3 studies, 837 participants: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07; I² = 0%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (2 studies, 767 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.48; I² = 0%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi plus ARB, ACEi alone has uncertain effects on all-cause death (6 studies, 1166 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.40; I² = 20%; low certainty), withdrawal from treatment (2 studies, 172 participants: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.86; I² = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (4 studies, 994 participants: RR 3.02, 95% CI 0.61 to 14.85; low certainty), kidney failure (3 studies, 880 participants: RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.32; I² = 0%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (2 studies, 813 participants: RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.85; I² = 0%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi plus ARB, ARB alone has uncertain effects on all-cause death (7 studies, 2607 participants: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.37; I² = 0%; low certainty), withdrawn from treatment (3 studies, 1615 participants: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.24; I² = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (4 studies, 992 participants: RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.62 to 14.93; low certainty), kidney failure (4 studies, 2321 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.95; I² = 29%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (3 studies, 2252 participants: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.64; I² = 0%; low certainty). Comparative effects of different ACEi or ARB and low-dose versus high-dose ARB were rarely evaluated. No study compared different doses of ACEi. Adverse events of ACEi and ARB were rarely reported.

Authors' Conclusions

ACEi or ARB may make little or no difference to all-cause and cardiovascular death compared to placebo or no treatment in people with diabetes and kidney disease but may prevent kidney failure. ARB may prevent the doubling of SCr and the progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria compared with a placebo or no treatment. Despite the international guidelines suggesting not combining ACEi and ARB treatment, the effects of ACEi or ARB monotherapy compared to dual therapy have not been adequately assessed. The limited data availability and the low quality of the included studies prevented the assessment of the benefits and harms of ACEi or ARB in people with diabetes and kidney disease. Low and very low certainty evidence indicates that it is possible that further studies might provide different results.

### Are angiotensin II receptor blockers more efficacious than placebo in heart failure? Implications of ELITE-2. evaluation of losartan in the elderly [^116gNASN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

In the light of the recent randomized controlled trials in chronic heart failure, it is now commonly assumed that treatment with an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) is equivalent to treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. We performed an imputed placebo analysis using previous placebo-ACE inhibitor trials and the current ACE inhibitor-ARB comparison studies, which shows that ARBs may not even be superior to placebos, let alone an ACE inhibitor.

Pharmacological treatment for hypertension — primary therapy recommendation: We recommend offering a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, or either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker as primary pharmacologic therapy for hypertension for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes (Strong for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Supporting evidence notes that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) were equivalent to angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACEIs were equivalent to thiazide-type diuretics, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were equivalent to thiazide-type diuretics for composite cardiovascular outcomes, with no significant differences for ACEIs vs CCBs or ARBs vs CCBs and no critical outcomes noted for ARBs versus thiazide-type diuretics.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — first-line drug classes and comparative evidence are as follows: For adults initiating therapy, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are recommended as first-line therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Strong randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports 4 classes of first-line agents compared with placebo, and a meta-analysis of 50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals revealed subtle differences between first-line agents. βBs were less effective than first-line classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications. The primary goal of treatment should be to reduce blood pressure (BP) to the target level, considering the underlying CVD risk and compelling indications. In a large pragmatic RCT comparing hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg to chlorthalidone 12.5 mg, switching from HCTZ to chlorthalidone did not lower the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

### Meta-analysis: angiotensin-receptor blockers in chronic heart failure and high-risk acute myocardial infarction [^112EeCCz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The role of angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in treating patients with chronic heart failure and high-risk acute myocardial infarction (MI) has been controversial, and recent clinical trials provide more information on this topic.

Purpose

To quantify the effect of ARBs when compared with placebo (with and without background angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) and ACE inhibitors on all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with chronic heart failure and high-risk acute MI.

Data Sources

Data from original research published through 13 November 2003.

Study Selection

Predefined criteria were used to identify 24 trials.

Data Extraction

2 reviewers independently collected information on study characteristics and data on all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization.

Data Synthesis

24 trials involving 38 080 patients were included. Analysis of chronic heart failure trials revealed that 1) ARBs were associated with reduced all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.00]) and heart failure hospitalizations (OR, 0.64 [CI, 0.53 to 0.78]) as compared with placebo; 2) for ARBs versus ACE inhibitors, all-cause mortality (OR, 1.06 [CI, 0.90 to 1.26]) and heart failure hospitalization (OR, 0.95 [CI, 0.80 to 1.13]) did not differ; 3) and for combinations of ARBs plus ACE inhibitors versus ACE inhibitors alone, all-cause mortality was not reduced (OR, 0.97 [CI, 0.87 to 1.08]) but heart failure hospitalizations were reduced (OR, 0.77 [CI, 0.69 to 0.87]). For patients with high-risk acute MI, 2 randomized trials compared ARBs with ACE inhibitors but did not reveal differences in all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization.

Limitations

Comparative economic data between ARBs and ACE inhibitors are lacking.

Conclusions

Because ACE inhibitors and ARBs do not differ in efficacy for reducing all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with chronic heart failure and in patients with high-risk acute MI, ARBs should be regarded as suitable alternatives to ACE inhibitors.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers for heart failure [^111CnQd4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic heart failure (HF) is a prevalent world-wide. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed for chronic HF although their role is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the benefit and harm of ARBs compared with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or placebo on mortality, morbidity and withdrawals due to adverse effects in patients with symptomatic HF and left ventricular systolic dysfunction or preserved systolic function.

Search Methods

Clinical trials were identified by searching CENTRAL, HTA, and DARE, (The Cochrane Library 2010 Issue 3), as well as MEDLINE (2002 to July 2010), and EMBASE (2002 to July 2010). Reference lists of retrieved articles and systematic reviews were checked for additional studies not identified by the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

Double blind randomised controlled trials in men and women of all ages who have symptomatic (NYHA Class II to IV) HF and: 1) left ventricular systolic dysfunction, defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%; or 2) preserved ejection fraction, defined as LVEF > 40%.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included studies.

Main Results

Twenty two studies evaluated the effects of ARBs in 17,900 patients with a LVEF ≤ 40% (mean 2.2 years). ARBs did not reduce total mortality (RR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76, 1.00]) or total morbidity as measured by total hospitalisations (RR 0.94 [95% CI 0.88, 1.01]) compared with placebo. Total mortality (RR 1.05 [95% CI 0.91, 1.22]), total hospitalisations (RR 1.00 [95% CI 0.92, 1.08]), MI (RR 1.00 [95% CI 0.62, 1.63]), and stroke (RR 1.63 [0.77, 3.44]) did not differ between ARBs and ACEIs but withdrawals due to adverse effects were lower with ARBs (RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.52, 0.76]). Combinations of ARBs plus ACEIs increased the risk of withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 1.34 [95% CI 1.19, 1.51]) but did not reduce total mortality or total hospital admissions versus ACEI alone. Two placebo-controlled studies evaluated ARBs in 7151 patients with a LVEF > 40% (mean 3.7 years). ARBs did not reduce total mortality (RR 1.02 [95% CI 0.93, 1.12]) or total morbidity as measured by total hospitalisations (RR 1.00 [95% CI 0.97, 1.05]) compared with placebo. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were higher with ARBs versus placebo when all patients were pooled irrespective of LVEF (RR 1.06 [95% CI 1.01, 1.12]).

Authors' Conclusions

In patients with symptomatic HF and systolic dysfunction or with preserved ejection fraction, ARBs compared to placebo or ACEIs do not reduce total mortality or morbidity. ARBs are better tolerated than ACEIs but do not appear to be as safe and well tolerated as placebo in terms of withdrawals due to adverse effects. Adding an ARB in combination with an ACEI does not reduce total mortality or total hospital admission but increases withdrawals due to adverse effects compared with ACEI alone.

### Sex differences in the effectiveness of angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure – a population study [^111qhx98]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). We wish to determine whether there are sex-related differences in the optimal treatment of congestive heart failure.

Methods

Using administrative databases, all patients > ≥ 65 years of age discharged with a diagnosis of CHF between January 1998 and March 2003 and who filled a prescription for an ARB or an ACE inhibitor within 90 days of discharge were identified. Time to all-cause death in women and men on ACE inhibitors or ARBs was compared.

Results

There were 10,223 women (8627 ACE inhibitors and 1596 ARBs) and 9475 men (8484 ACE inhibitors and 991 ARBs). Hypertension was more common in women (50.1%) than men (33.1%). Women on ARBs had better survival than those on ACE inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59, 0.80). There was no difference in survival in men prescribed ARBs compared to ACE inhibitors (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95, 1.30).

Conclusion

These sex differences in treatment-related outcome are important but should be confirmed in a randomized trial before ARBs are preferentially prescribed to women with CHF.

### Comparison between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death: a meta-analysis [^113xwQzn]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality and total mortality.

Methods

We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized comparative trials between angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Inclusion criteria were publication in peer-reviewed journals indexed in Medline, randomized comparison of angiotensin II receptor blockers vs. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers + angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors vs. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, report of major complications including myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality or all-cause mortality; average follow-up of at least 1 year in at least 200 patients.

Results

Six trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria, for a total of 49 924 patients. In the pooled estimate, there were no significant differences between angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on the risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.95–1.07; P = 0.75), cardiovascular mortality (odds ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.98–1.08; P = 0.23) and total mortality (odds ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.97–1.10; P = 0.20). This was the case also when the analysis involved only the comparison between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Overall, the risk of stroke was slightly lower with angiotensin II receptor blockers than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (odds ratio 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.85–0.99; P = 0.037), the direct angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers comparison showing a nonsignificant trend in a similar direction. Statistical heterogeneity among trials was not significant, with a low to null inconsistency statistic, for stroke (P = 0.67), myocardial infarction (P = 0.86), cardiovascular mortality (P = 0.14) and total mortality (P = 0.12).

Conclusion

This overview suggests that angiotensin II receptor blockers are as effective as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on the risk of myocardial infarction, cardiovascular mortality and total mortality. Angiotensin II receptor blockers may be slightly more protective than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on the risk of stroke.

### Renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockade: little to No rationale for ACE inhibitor and ARB combinations [^111LLsb8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complexities and inter-related pathways of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system continues to evolve. Which drugs to use, when, and how, are everyday questions faced by clinicians in the ambulatory setting. Combining these classes, for the purpose of enhancing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and incremental blood pressure, nephroprotective, and cardioprotective effects, logically has emerged as an area for scientific inquiry and clinical use. Despite the lack of evidence on safety and efficacy in most disease states, dual therapy has been embraced as a treatment option. Most studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension have limitations. In contrast, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in systolic heart failure has been addressed in several large randomized controlled trials. Until recently, there has been limited and conflicting evidence for the use of combination therapy for the prevention or management of nephropathy. Based on the new evidence, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in the treatment and management of hypertension, heart failure, and nephropathy should be limited.

### Perioperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers for preventing mortality and morbidity in adults [^111p3oTu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative hypertension requires careful management. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have shown efficacy in treating hypertension associated with surgery. However, there is lack of consensus about whether they can prevent mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To systematically assess the benefits and harms of administration of ACEIs or ARBs perioperatively for the prevention of mortality and morbidity in adults (aged 18 years and above) undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia.

Search Methods

We searched the current issue of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to 8 December 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 8 December 2014), and references of the retrieved randomized trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing perioperative administration of ACEIs or ARBs with placebo in adults (aged 18 years and above) undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia. We excluded studies in which participants underwent procedures that required local anaesthesia only, or participants who had already been on ACEIs or ARBs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with a total of 571 participants in the review. Two of the seven trials involved 36 participants undergoing non-cardiac vascular surgery (infrarenal aortic surgery), and five involved 535 participants undergoing cardiac surgery, including valvular surgery, coronary artery bypass surgery, and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The intervention was started from 11 days to 25 minutes before surgery in six trials and during surgery in one trial. We considered all seven RCTs to carry a high risk of bias. The effects of ACEIs or ARBs on perioperative mortality and acute myocardial infarction were uncertain because the quality of the evidence was very low. The risk of death was 2.7% in the ACEIs or ARBs group and 1.6% in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 5.85). The risk of acute myocardial infarction was 1.7% in the ACEIs or ARBs group and 3.0% in the placebo group (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.14 to 2.26). ACEIs or ARBs may improve congestive heart failure (cardiac index) perioperatively (mean difference (MD) -0.60; 95% CI -0.70 to -0.50, very low-quality evidence). In terms of rate of complications, there was no difference in perioperative cerebrovascular complications (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.28, very low-quality evidence) and hypotension (RR 1.95; 95% CI 0.86 to 4.41, very low-quality evidence). Cardiac surgery-related renal failure was not reported. ACEIs or ARBs were associated with shortened length of hospital stay (MD -0.54; 95% CI -0.93 to -0.16, P value = 0.005, very low-quality evidence). These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to likely confounding by the clinical backgrounds of the participants. ACEIs or ARBs may shorten the length of hospital stay, (MD -0.54; 95% CI -0.93 to -0.16, very low-quality evidence) Two studies reported adverse events, and there was no evidence of a difference between the ACEIs or ARBs and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, this review did not find evidence to support that perioperative ACEIs or ARBs can prevent mortality, morbidity, and complications (hypotension, perioperative cerebrovascular complications, and cardiac surgery-related renal failure). We found no evidence showing that the use of these drugs may reduce the rate of acute myocardial infarction. However, ACEIs or ARBs may increase cardiac output perioperatively. Due to the low and very low methodology quality, high risk of bias, and lack of power of the included studies, the true effect may be substantially different from the observed estimates. Perioperative (mainly elective cardiac surgery, according to included studies) initiation of ACEIs or ARBs therapy should be individualized.

### Blood pressure-dependent and independent effects of agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system [^1118kMZa]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the blood pressure-dependent and independent effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) on major cardiovascular events.

Methods

Using data from 26 large-scale trials comparing an ACEI or an ARB with placebo or another drug class, meta-regression analyses were conducted in which treatment-specific relative risks for major cause-specific outcomes [stroke, major coronary heart disease (CHD) events and heart failure] were regressed against follow-up blood pressure differences.

Results

From a total of 146 838 individuals with high blood pressure or an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, 22 666 major cardiovascular events were documented during follow-up. The analyses showed comparable blood pressure-dependent reductions in risk with ACEI and ARB (P ≥ 0.3 for all three outcomes). The analyses also showed that ACEI produced a blood pressure-independent reduction in the relative risk of CHD of approximately 9% (95% confidence interval 3–14%). No similar effect was detected for ARB, and there was some evidence of a difference between ACEI and ARB in this regard (P = 0.002). For both stroke and heart failure there was no evidence of any blood pressure-independent effects of either ACEI or ARB.

Conclusion

There are similar blood pressure-dependent effects of ACEI and ARB for the risks of stroke, CHD and heart failure. For ACEI, but not ARB, there is evidence of blood pressure-independent effects on the risk of major coronary disease events.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and combined therapy in patients with micro-and macroalbuminuria and other cardiovascular risk factors: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^115U1Sfp]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A recent clinical trial showed harmful renal effects with the combined use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARB) in people with diabetes or vascular disease. We examined the benefits and risks of these agents in people with albuminuria and one or more cardiovascular risk factors.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE and Renal Health Library were searched for trials comparing ACEI, ARB or their combination with placebo or with one another in people with albuminuria and one or more cardiovascular risk factor.

Results

Eighty-five trials (21,708 patients) were included. There was no significant reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality or fatal cardiac-cerebrovascular outcomes with ACEI versus placebo, ARB versus placebo, ACEI versus ARB or with combined therapy with ACEI + ARB versus monotherapy. There was a significant reduction in the risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events with ACEI versus placebo but not with ARB versus placebo, ACEI versus ARB or with combined therapy with ACEI + ARB versus monotherapy. Development of end-stage kidney disease and progression of microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria were reduced significantly with ACEI versus placebo and ARB versus placebo but not with combined therapy with ACEI + ARB versus monotherapy.

Conclusions

ACEI and ARB exert independent renal and nonfatal cardiovascular benefits while their effects on mortality and fatal cardiovascular disease are uncertain. There is a lack of evidence to support the use of combination therapy. A comparative clinical trial with ACE, ARB and its combination in people with albuminuria and a cardiovascular risk factor is warranted.

### Vascular and cardiac benefits of angiotensin receptor blockers [^114Ye2Jq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Angiotensin II not only is a vasoconstrictor, but it also affects cell growth and apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and coagulation. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, either with inhibitors of the generation of angiotensin (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) or with blockers of angiotensin receptors, reduces blood pressure and inhibits other pathophysiological actions. These other effects provide benefits in coronary heart disease, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and stroke beyond blood pressure reduction. These benefits were first demonstrated with ACE inhibitors. However, the mechanism of action of angiotensin receptor blockers, which block angiotensin II stimulation at the angiotensin type 1 receptor but not at the type 2 receptor, may have advantages, particularly for endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling, as well as cardiac and renal protection. Recent multicenter trials suggest that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may reduce morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular and renal disease beyond blood pressure reduction. Several studies with different angiotensin receptor blockers, including comparisons with ACE inhibitors, are under way, and should provide further guidance for their clinical use.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers in heart failure: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116uySLM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure (HF).

Background

There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of ARBs as substitute or adjunctive therapy to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in the treatment of HF.

Methods

We conducted a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials that compared ARBs with either placebo or ACEIs in patients with symptomatic HF. The pooled outcomes were all-cause mortality and hospitalization for HF.

Results

Seventeen trials involving 12,469 patients were included. Overall, ARBs were not superior to controls in the pooled rates of death (odds ratio: 0.96; 95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 1.23) or hospitalization (0.86; 0.69 to 1.06). Stratified analysis, however, showed a non-significant trend in benefit of ARBs over placebo in reducing mortality (0.68; 0.38 to 1.22) and hospitalization (0.67; 0.29 to 1.51) when given in the absence of background ACEI therapy. When compared directly with ACEIs, ARBs were not superior in reducing either mortality (1.09; 0.92 to 1.29) or hospitalization (0.95; 0.80 to 1.13). In contrast, the combination therapy of ARBs and ACEIs was superior to ACEIs alone in reducing hospitalization (0.74; 0.64 to 0.86) but not mortality (1.04; 0.91 to 1.20).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis cannot confirm that ARBs are superior in reducing all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization in patients with symptomatic HF, particularly when compared with ACEIs. However, the use of ARBs as monotherapy in the absence of ACEIs or as combination therapy with ACEIs appears promising.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early (stage 1 to 3) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^116uCvV1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition that occurs as a result of damage to the kidneys. Early recognition of CKD is becoming increasingly common due to widespread laboratory estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, raised clinical awareness, and international adoption of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications. Early recognition and management of CKD affords the opportunity to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending kidney replacement therapy and for intervention to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on kidney outcomes and survival in people with a wide range of severity of kidney impairment have been reported; however, their effectiveness in the subgroup of people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain. This is an update of a review that was last published in 2011.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB or both in the management of people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus (DM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 6 July 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the effect of ACEi or ARB in people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who did not have DM were selected for inclusion. Only studies of at least four weeks duration were selected. Authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out by two authors independently, using a standard data extraction form. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another. When more than one study reported similar outcomes, data were pooled using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was analysed using a Chi² test and the I² test. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach MAIN RESULTS: Six studies randomising 9379 participants with CKD stages 1 to 3 (without DM) met our inclusion criteria. Participants were adults with hypertension; 79% were male from China, Europe, Japan, and the United States. Treatment periods ranged from 12 weeks to three years. Overall, studies were judged to be at unclear or high risk of bias across all domains, and the quality of the evidence was poor, with GRADE rated as low or very low certainty. In low certainty evidence, ACEi (benazepril 10 mg or trandolapril 2 mg) compared to placebo may make little or no difference to death (any cause) (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.26 to 15.37; I² = 76%), total cardiovascular events (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05; I² = 0%), cardiovascular-related death (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.26 to 11.66; I² = 54%), stroke (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.03; I² = 0%), myocardial infarction (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20; I² = 0%), and adverse events (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.41; I² = 0%). It is uncertain whether ACEi (benazepril 10 mg or trandolapril 2 mg) compared to placebo reduces congestive heart failure (1 study, 8290 participants): RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95) or transient ischaemic attack (1 study, 583 participants): RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.01; I² = 0%) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether ARB (losartan 50 mg) compared to placebo (1 study, 226 participants) reduces: death (any-cause) (no events), adverse events (RR 19.34, 95% CI 1.14 to 328.30), eGFR rate of decline (MD 5.00 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 95% CI 3.03 to 6.97), presence of proteinuria (MD -0.65 g/24 hours, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.52), systolic blood pressure (MD -0.80 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.89 to 2.29), or diastolic blood pressure (MD -1.10 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.29 to 1.09) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether ACEi (enalapril 20 mg, perindopril 2 mg or trandolapril 1 mg) compared to ARB (olmesartan 20 mg, losartan 25 mg or candesartan 4 mg) (1 study, 26 participants) reduces: proteinuria (MD -0.40, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.20), systolic blood pressure (MD -3.00 mm Hg, 95% CI -6.08 to 0.08) or diastolic blood pressure (MD -1.00 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.31 to 1.31) because the certainty of the evidence is very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of ACEi or ARB in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD who do not have DM. The available evidence is overall of very low certainty and high risk of bias. We have identified an area of large uncertainty for a group of patients who account for most of those diagnosed as having CKD.

### How should we manage heart failure developing in patients already treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and β-blockers for hypertension, diabetes or coronary disease? [^1135XQmb]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

An increasing number of patients in the community are being treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta-blockers for hypertension, coronary disease or diabetic renal and vascular complications. Some of these patients will develop heart failure despite such treatment. Based on data from hypertension trials it can be estimated that approximately 5% of treated patients will develop heart failure over 5 years. It is unclear whether patients developing heart failure on and off ACE-inhibitors or beta-blockers, respectively, at the time of heart failure diagnosis have similar prognosis. Treatment options for patients developing heart failure while already treated with ACE inhibitors/ARBs and beta-blockers are very limited if current heart failure guidelines are followed. In this review possible strategies are outlined and important areas for research are identified. It is suggested that trials are designed specifically to address prognosis and treatment in this growing population.

### Renin inhibition: what are the therapeutic opportunities? [^1134WDAS]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers has become a crucial element in cardiovascular and renal medicine. This review evaluates the potential of renin inhibition as an adjunct to therapies that depend on renin system interruption.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early (stage 1 to 3) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^112i7NXE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long term condition that occurs as a result of damage to the kidneys. Early recognition of CKD is becoming increasingly common due to widespread laboratory estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, raised clinical awareness, and international adoption of Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) classification. Early recognition and management of CKD affords the opportunity not only to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending renal replacement therapy, but also for intervening to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on renal outcomes and survival in people with a wide range of severity of renal impairment have been reported; however, their effectiveness in the subgroup of people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain.

Objectives

This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB or both in the management of people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus.

Search Strategy

In March 2010 we searched The Cochrane Library, including The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Reference lists of review articles and relevant studies were also checked. The search was conducted using the optimally sensitive strategy developed by the Cochrane Collaboration for the identification of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with input from an expert in trial search strategy.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs reporting the effect of ACEi or ARB in people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who did not have diabetes mellitus were selected for inclusion. Only studies of at least four weeks duration were selected. Authors, working in teams of two, independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts, and whenever necessary the full text of these studies were screened to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out by two authors, independently, using a standard data extraction form and cross checked by two other authors. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross checked by another author. When more than one study reported similar outcomes, data were pooled using the random-effects model, but a fixed-effect model was also analysed to ensure the robustness of the model chosen and to check susceptibility to outliers. Heterogeneity was analysed using a Chi² test on N-1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.05 used for statistical significance and with the I² test. Where data permitted, subgroup analysis was used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. The quality of the evidence was analysed.

Main Results

Four RCTs enrolling 2177 participants met our inclusion criteria. Of these, three compared ACEi with placebo and one compared ACEi with ARB. Two studies had an overall low risk of bias, and the other two were considered to be at moderate to high risk of bias. Low to moderate quality of evidence (from two studies representing 1906 patients) suggested that ACEi had no impact on all-cause mortality (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.17 to 19.27, P = 0.63) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.14, P = 0.31) in people with stage 3 CKD. For all-cause mortality, there was substantial heterogeneity in the results. One study (quality assessment: low risk of bias) reported no difference in the risk of end-stage kidney disease in those with an eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.74 m² treated with ACEi versus placebo (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.11, P = 0.99). The (high risk of bias) study that compared ACEi with ARB reported little difference in effect between the treatments when urinary protein, blood pressure or creatinine clearance were compared. No published studies comparing ARB with placebo or ACEi and ARB with placebo were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review demonstrated that there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of ACEi or ARB in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus. We have identified an area of significant uncertainty for a group of patients who account for most of those labelled as having CKD.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111MARku]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Blockers of the renin–angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE inhibitors] and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) are widely used and have similar effectiveness as each other and other major drug classes on major cardiovascular events and mortality outcomes; ARBs are associated with significantly lower treatment discontinuation rates for adverse events than those of all other antihypertensive therapies, and similar rates to placebo. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be combined for the treatment of hypertension because there is no added benefit on outcomes and an excess of renal adverse events; dual combination of renin–angiotensin system blockers also led to premature cessation of a trial when aliskiren was combined with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB in people with diabetes, and this result halted further research into the clinical utility of aliskiren for BP treatment. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce albuminuria more than other BP-lowering drugs and are effective at delaying the progression of diabetic and non-diabetic CKD.

### Combination therapy with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers in heart failure [^111m3eKW]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers have different pharmacologic mechanisms for blocking the effect of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on the cardiovascular system. Pharmacologically, the combination of these drug classes completely blocks the deleterious effect of angiotensin in patients with heart failure. However, clinical trials have not shown a marked benefit from using this combination compared with using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone. Patients who take combination therapy do not live longer, although they are less likely to be hospitalized for worsening symptoms. Most patients who take combination therapy will not experience marked improvement in symptoms or quality of life.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^115x2qQ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes because of postulated advantages for reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

This update includes three new RCTs, totaling 45 in all, involving 66,625 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large RCTs at low risk for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalizations, total cardiovascular (CV) events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalization), and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.90, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2%), and that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, absolute risk increase (ARI) 0.7%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs did not differ for all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09); total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02); and total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line thiazides did not differ for all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07); total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11); and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line beta-blockers did not differ for all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01); HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18); and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27). Blood pressure comparisons between first-line RAS inhibitors and other first-line classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. There is no information about non-fatal serious adverse events, as none of the trials reported this outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

All-cause death is similar for first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs, thiazides and beta-blockers. There are, however, differences for some morbidity outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased HF but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in HF exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total CV events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.

### Does the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan prevent morbid atherosclerotic events? [^115M4tQs]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

ONTARGET has established the efficacy of the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan to slow disease progression and delay or prevent morbid events in patients with atherosclerosis. Although the study failed to confirm additive efficacy of telmisartan and the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril, caution should be exercised in assuming that the mean response in a clinical trial applies to individual patients who might benefit from combination therapy. Physicians should also recognize that the design of the study, in which full doses of the ACE inhibitor and the ARB were administered, might not replicate clinical practice, where one drug is usually added to the other.

### Combination ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers for hypertension [^1131Apbs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review data concerning combined angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy for hypertension.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-April 2003), IPA (1970-April 2003), and EMBASE (1974-April 2003) with search terms of ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, essential hypertension, and combination therapy.

Data Synthesis

ACE inhibitors provide incomplete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, sometimes leading to loss of blood pressure control. Addition of ARBs may in theory further reduce blood pressure. Studies of combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy for managing hypertension were evaluated.

Conclusions

While studies have shown statistically significant blood pressure reductions with ACE/ARB combination therapy, clinical significance is lacking. Further trials are needed before routine use of the combination can be recommended.

### Cardiovascular effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade in hemodialysis: a meta-analysis [^11328EfE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Cardiovascular (CV) disease causes significant morbidity and mortality among the hemodialysis (HD) population. This meta-analysis was performed to determine whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce fatal and nonfatal CV events and left ventricular (LV) mass in patients receiving HD.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Studies were identified by searching electronic databases, bibliographies, and conference proceedings. Two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials using ACEIs or ARBs compared with control among patients receiving HD. Studies were independently assessed for inclusion, quality, and data extraction. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled relative risk (RR) for CV outcomes and the weighted mean difference (WMD) for pooled change-from-baseline comparisons for LV mass for ACEI or ARB treated patients compared with control.

Results

Compared with control, the RR of CV events associated with ACEI or ARB use was 0.66 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 1.25; P = 0.20]. ACEI or ARB use resulted in a statistically significant reduction in LV mass, with a WMD of 15.4 g/m(2) (95% CI 7.4 to 23.3; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Treatment with an ACEI or ARB reduced LV mass in patients receiving HD. However, their use was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of fatal and nonfatal CV events. Larger, high-quality trials in the HD population are required to determine if the effects of ACEI or ARB therapy on LV mass translate into decreased CV morbidity and mortality.

### Debate: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus angiotensin II receptor blockers – a gap in evidence-based medicine [^115MmgZc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

In this article, 2 leading physicians debate the strength of outcome data on the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors versus angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for reducing the incidence of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renovascular events. Dr. Stephen G. Ball notes that the efficacy of ACE inhibitors for reducing the risk for myocardial infarction independent of their effects on blood pressure is controversial. In the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, ramipril treatment in high-risk patients was associated with a 20% reduction in the risk for myocardial infarction; mean reduction in blood pressure was 3 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and 1 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. The HOPE investigators propose that the 20% reduction was much greater than would be expected based on the observed blood pressure reduction. However, a meta-regression analysis of blood pressure reduction in > 20 antihypertensive therapy outcome trials found that the reduction in myocardial infarction risk with ramipril observed in HOPE was consistent with the modest blood pressure reduction seen with that agent. Nevertheless, there are convincing data for prevention of myocardial infarction with ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure, including those with heart failure after myocardial infarction, as well as supportive evidence from studies in patients with diabetes mellitus and concomitant hypertension. On the other hand, Dr. William B. White takes the position that ARBs are well-tolerated antihypertensive agents that specifically antagonize the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor and provide a more complete block of the pathologic effects of angiotensin II-which are mediated via the AT(1) receptor-than ACE inhibitors. The Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly (ELITE) II study and the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (ValHeFT) suggest that ARBs reduce the risk for mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. The Losartan Intervention for Endpoint (LIFE) Reduction in Hypertension trial also demonstrated beneficial effects of ARBs in the prevention of stroke events. The Irbesartan in Patients with Diabetes and Microalbuminuria (IRMA) study, the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT), and the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study demonstrated significant reductions in the rate of progression of renal disease in patients receiving ARBs, independent of effects on blood pressure. These data support the use of ARBs, in addition to the standard of care, in hypertensive patients with heart failure who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors, and also provide compelling evidence for their use in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — adults initiating antihypertensive drug therapy are recommended first-line options from thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence "supports 4 classes of first-line agents", and a meta-analysis reported "50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals", while "all other antihypertensive agents are considered secondary" and "BBs were less effective than first-line antihypertensive classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications".

### Angiotensin type-1 receptor blockers in heart failure [^115cmqzf]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic heart failure is a common condition with a poor prognosis, usually associated with poor exercise tolerance and debilitating symptoms despite optimal modern therapy. Standard therapy includes diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta-blockers. Despite this, many patients remain symptomatic, and interest is high as to whether the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) would offer further advantage to a patient already receiving quadruple therapy. In addition, some patients are intolerant of ACEIs, and for this group the ARBs seem a logical choice. This article reviews the evidence for the use of ARBs as a class in heart failure concentrating on clinical recommendations and clinical needs and evidence rather than purely on statistical issues of significance in trials. The trials to date have demonstrated clearly similar hemodynamic effects to those seen with ACEIs and variety of ancillary benefits such as improvements in endothelial function, anti-thrombotic effects, and effects on neurohormonal inhibition. There is consistent evidence of a preservation of exercise tolerance when patients with heart failure are crossed over from stable ACEI therapy, and when added to ACEIs exercise tolerance appears to increase with ARBs. In terms of major outcomes, the two largest trials, Elite-II and Val-Heft, demonstrate that angiotensin receptor blockers probably have a clinical role in improving mortality and morbidity as an alternative to ACEIs in those patients unable to tolerate these agents, which remain, however, the first choice in unselected patients with heart failure. There is a worrying suggestion of a negative interaction when ARBs are added to beta-blockers, which is a reason for caution in using the ARBs, not a reason not to use beta-blockers.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^1143bGFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients on the basis of postulated advantages for the reduction of diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

We included 42 studies, involving 65,733 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large studies at a low risk of bias for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalization, total cardiovascular (CV) events (consisted of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalizations), and ESRF. Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.90, ARR 1.2%), and moderate quality evidence that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, ARI 0.7%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02; moderate quality evidence), total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence). The results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11; moderate quality evidence), and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01; moderate quality evidence). Results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, we found low quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and low quality evidence that they decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Our analyses do not exclude potentially important differences between first-line RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers on all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; low quality evidence), HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; low quality evidence), and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; low quality evidence). Blood pressure comparisons between RAS inhibitors and other classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. In the protocol, we identified non-fatal serious adverse events (SAE) as a primary outcome. However, when we extracted the data from included studies, none of them reported total SAE in a manner that could be used in the review. Therefore, there is no information about SAE in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found predominantly moderate quality evidence that all-cause mortality is similar when first-line RAS inhibitors are compared to other first-line antihypertensive agents. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. The quality of the evidence comparing first-line beta-blockers and first-line RAS inhibitors was low and the lower risk of total CV events and stroke seen with RAS inhibitors may change with the publication of additional trials. Compared with first-line CCBs, first-line RAS inhibitors reduced HF but increased stroke. The magnitude of the reduction in HF exceeded the increase in stroke. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the primary outcomes.

### Evaluation of the stopping angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor compared to angiotensin receptor blocker (STOP ACEi trial) in advanced and progressive chronic kidney disease [^117Cjtr6]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

In the STOP-ACEi trial, the outcome was similar whether or not renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) were discontinued. We now investigate whether the effect of withdrawing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) differed. In this open label trial patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) under 30ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) were randomized to stop or continue RASi. The primary outcome was eGFR at three years. The composite of kidney failure, over 50% fall in eGFR, or kidney replacement therapy (KRT) was also assessed. Of patients randomized, 99 stopped and 123 patients continued ACEi while 104 stopped and 77 continued ARB at baseline. At three years, the eGFR was similar whether or not patients were withdrawn from ACEi or from ARB. Kidney failure or initiation of KRT occurred in 65% of those stopping and 54% continuing ACEi (hazard ratio if stopped, 1.52; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.07 to 2.16) and in 60% on an ARB regardless of randomized group (hazard ratio if stopped, 1.23; 0.83 to 1.81). Kidney failure/Initiation of KRT with over 50% decline in eGFR occurred in 71% of those stopping and 59% continuing ACEi (relative risk if stopped, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.41) and in 65% stopping and 69% continuing ARB (relative risk if stopped, 0.96; 0.79 to 1.16). Thus, neither discontinuing ACEi nor ARB slowed the rate of decline in eGFR. Although discontinuation of ACEi appeared to have more unfavorable effects on kidney outcomes than stopping ARB, the trial was neither designed nor powered to show differences between agents.

### Rationale for the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (part I of II) [^112QnNKm]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Almost 5 million individuals in the United States are diagnosed with chronic heart failure (HF), and the prevalence is increasing. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers, neurohormonal antagonists that block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the sympathetic nervous system, respectively, have been shown in clinical trials to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HF, and these therapies are now integral components of standard HF treatment. Yet, morbidity and mortality rates in HF remain unacceptably high, and the limitations of current standard therapies are becoming increasingly apparent. About 10% of patients with HF are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors, often because of cough. In addition, ACE inhibition may not completely block the RAS because angiotensin II, the main end product of the RAS, can be generated via non-ACE enzymatic pathways. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may exert more complete RAS blockade than ACE inhibitors by interfering with the binding of angiotensin II at the receptor level, regardless of the enzymatic pathway of production. They are also better tolerated than ACE inhibitors and have been shown to improve symptoms and function in clinical trials in patients with HF. These factors provide a strong rationale for the study of the clinical effects of ARBs in patients with HF.

### Renin inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension [^116NdMvi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Renin inhibitors, which inhibit the first and rate-limiting step in the renin angiotensin system (RAS), are thought to be more effective than other RAS inhibitors in blocking the RAS. Previous meta-analyses have shown that renin inhibitors have a favourable tolerability profile in people with mild-to-moderate hypertension and a blood-pressure-lowering magnitude that is similar to that of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ARBs inhibit the RAS by interfering with the binding of angiotensin II with its receptors. ARBs are widely prescribed and recommended as first-line therapy by some hypertension guidelines. However, a drug's efficacy in lowering blood pressure cannot be considered as a definitive indicator of its effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity. The benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to ARBs in treating hypertension are unknown.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to angiotensin receptor blockers in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

On 26 January 2024, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials: Cochrane Hypertension's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase. The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) were also searched for ongoing trials. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work and checked the bibliographies of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, parallel-design clinical trials comparing renin inhibitors and ARBs for people with primary hypertension. Studies recruiting people with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias using the RoB 1 tool, and entered the data for analysis. We reported dichotomous outcomes as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and continuous variables as mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, total cardiovascular events, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), withdrawal due to adverse effects (WDAE), serious adverse events (SAE), and adverse events. The secondary outcomes were fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal heart failure or hospitalisation for heart failure, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and heart rate. We used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in the evidence.

Main Results

We included 11 double-blind RCTs involving 6780 participants with mild primary hypertension and without cardiovascular complications (mean age range 52 to 59 years), with a mean follow-up ranging from four weeks to nine months. Risk of bias was low or unclear for most domains except for other bias, which was high risk for 10 of the 11 trials due to industry funding. All the studies compared aliskiren, the only marketed molecule in the class of renin inhibitors, with an ARB. The ARB comparator was losartan in four trials, valsartan in three trials, irbesartan in three trials, and telmisartan in one trial. There were very limited or no data on cardiovascular outcomes and ESRD. There may be little to no difference between renin inhibitors and ARBs in all-cause mortality (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.64; 3 studies, 1932 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is probably little to no difference between renin inhibitors and ARBs in WDAE (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.02; 9 studies, 4634 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), SAE (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.27; 6 studies, 3283 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.06; 10 studies, 4722 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There is probably little to no difference between renin inhibitors and ARBs in lowering SBP (MD -0.25 mmHg, 95% CI -1.05 to 0.56; 10 studies, 4222 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be little to no difference in lowering DBP (MD 0.25 mmHg, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.64; 10 studies, 4222 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The available RCT evidence suggests little to no difference between renin inhibitors and ARBs in terms of mortality, SAE, WDAE, adverse events, and blood pressure in people with mild primary hypertension. The evidence was derived from short-term trials with a limited occurrence of morbidity outcomes, leaving any potential differences unknown. Larger RCTs of longer duration with a wider range of participants and a focus on cardiovascular outcomes are needed.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

Hypertension in diabetes — drug classes and combination cautions (Recommendations 10.9–10.10): Treatment for hypertension should include drug classes demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events in people with diabetes, and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are recommended first-line therapy for hypertension in people with diabetes and coronary artery disease; multiple-drug therapy is generally required to achieve blood pressure goals, and avoid combinations of ACE inhibitors and ARBs and combinations of ACE inhibitors or ARBs (including ARBs and neprilysin inhibitors) with direct renin inhibitors.

### Discharge use of angiotensin receptor blockers provides comparable effects with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on outcomes in patients hospitalized for heart failure [^113fd3FE]. Hypertension Research (2010). Low credibility.

Large-scale, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure (HF) caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). However, it is unknown whether ACE inhibitors and ARBs have similar effects on the long-term outcomes in HF patients encountered in routine clinical practice. The Japanese Cardiac Registry of Heart Failure in Cardiology enrolled HF patients hospitalized with worsening symptoms and they were followed during an average of 2.2 years. The outcome data were compared in patients with LVSD by echocardiography (ejection fraction, EF < 40%) according to the predischarge use of ACE inhibitors (n = 356) or ARBs (n = 372). The clinical characteristics were similar between patients with ACE inhibitor and ARB use, except for higher prevalence of hypertensive etiology and diabetes mellitus. There was no significant difference between ACE inhibitor and ARB use in all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.958, 95% confidence interval 0.601–1.527, P = 0.858) and rehospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.964, 95% confidence interval 0.683–1.362, P = 0.836). The effects of ACE inhibitor and ARB use on the outcomes were generally consistent across all clinically relevant subgroups examined, including age, sex, etiology, EF, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and beta-blocker use. Discharge use of ARBs provided comparable effects with ACE inhibitors on outcomes in patients hospitalized for HF. These findings provide further support for guideline recommendations that ARBs can be used in patients with HF and LVSD as an alternative of ACE inhibitors.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — For adults initiating antihypertensive drug therapy, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are recommended as first-line therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Modulating atherosclerosis through inhibition or blockade of angiotensin [^115xwMyk]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-convertng enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are well recognized for their benefits in treating hypertension and congestive heart failure and preventing postmyocardial infarction heart failure or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Recently, blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor was shown to reduce cardiovascular events in hypertensive subjects with LV hypertrophy. Several lines of evidence are now converging to show that ACE inhibitors may affect the atherosclerotic process itself. Emerging clinical data indicate that angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) may possibly modulate atherosclerosis as well. The antiatherogenic properties of ACE inhibitors and ARBs may derive from inhibition or blockade of angiotensin II, now recognized as an agent that increases oxidative stress. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin-receptor blockade also increase endothelial nitric oxide formation, which improves endothelial function. In contrast to the effects of ARBs, the vascular effects of ACE inhibitors may, in part, be mediated by an increase in bradykinin. This article reviews some of the biologic mechanisms whereby ACE inhibitors and ARBs may modulate atherosclerosis.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce albuminuria more than angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113Cfd6G]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This study retrospectively compared the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) versus angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as classes with respect to overall mortality and cardiovascular and renal events in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

An electronic database of medical records was reviewed. A total of 16,489 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled and divided into ACEI (n = 12,351) or ARB (n = 4,138) groups. Baseline patient characteristics were compared using univariable analysis. A chi-square test was used for categorical outcomes, and the propensity class was calculated using multivariable logistic regression. Survival analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of ACEIs/ARBs on overall survival, coronary artery disease (CAD), and renal events via Cox regression analysis, adjusting for propensity class and baseline variables. All statistical analyses were conducted using R 2.15.1 software.

Results

No significant differences in overall survival (P = 0.16) and CAD (P = 0.81) events were observed between groups. With respect to renal events, ARBs increased the risk of creatinine doubling compared with ACEIs, but the difference was not significant (hazard ratio [HR], 1.207; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.921–1.583; p = 0.173). Patients who received ARBs had a significantly higher rate of albuminuria than patients who received ACEIs (HR, 1.303; 95% CI, 1.053–1.612; p = 0.015).

Conclusion

The early effects of ACEIs and ARBs on albuminuria outcome seem to be different in type 2 diabetes, favoring the use of ACEIs. A well-designed prospective study is warranted to evaluate this finding.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112jpXUh]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers (ACE inhibitors and ARBs) — In hypertension, ACE inhibitors and ARBs appear effective in preventing or regressing hypertension‑mediated organ damage (HMOD) such as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and small artery remodelling, and both drugs reduce incident atrial fibrillation (AF); they are also indicated postmyocardial infarction and in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). ACE inhibitors carry a small increased risk of angioneurotic oedema, especially in people of black African origin, and in such patients, when RAS blockers are used, an ARB may be preferred.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Renin–angiotensin system blocker combinations and same-class antihypertensive use — high-quality randomized controlled trial reports demonstrate that simultaneous administration of renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] combined with an angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB] or an ACEi or ARB combined with aliskiren) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and hyperkalemia; drug combinations with similar mechanisms should be avoided, two drugs from the same class should not be administered together (for example, two different beta blockers, ACEi, or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [CCB]), and two drugs that target the same blood pressure control system (for example, ACEi and ARB) are less effective and potentially harmful when used together, with exceptions including concomitant use of thiazide-type and potassium-sparing diuretics and thiazide-type and loop diuretics, and dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine CCB can be combined for additional blood pressure lowering in selected patients.

### Combination inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: is more better? [^116iPGGy]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers are considered the standard of care for treatment of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Combination therapy with both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers effectively inhibits the renin-angiotensin system as well as potentiates the vasodilatory effects of bradykinin. It has been advocated that this dual blockade approach theoretically should result in improved clinical outcomes in both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Clinical trial evidence for the use of combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in cardiovascular disease has provided conflicting results in hypertension, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. Clinical trial evidence to support combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in chronic kidney disease has largely been based on proteinuria reduction as a surrogate marker for clinically meaningful outcomes. Recent large-scale randomized clinical trials have not been able to validate protection in halting progression in chronic kidney disease with a dual blockade approach. This review serves as an appraisal on the clinical evidence of combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockade in both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.

### Renin inhibitors versus angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for primary hypertension [^114ynicX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Renin inhibitors (RIs) reduce blood pressure more than placebo, with the magnitude of this effect thought to be similar to that for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, a drug's efficacy in lowering blood pressure cannot be considered as a definitive indicator of its effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity. The effectiveness and safety of RIs compared to ACE inhibitors in treating hypertension is unknown.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to August 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least four weeks follow-up in people with primary hypertension, which compared renin inhibitors with ACE inhibitors and reported morbidity, mortality, adverse events or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

We include 11 RCTs involving 13,627 participants, with a mean baseline age from 51.5 to 74.2 years. Follow-up duration ranged from four weeks to 36.6 months. There was no difference between RIs and ACE inhibitors for the outcomes: all-cause mortality: risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.18; 5 RCTs, 5962 participants; low-certainty evidence; total myocardial infarction: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.39; 2 RCTs, 957 participants; very low-certainty evidence; adverse events: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 10 RTCs, 6007 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; serious adverse events: RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.64; 10 RTCs, 6007 participants; low-certainty evidence; and withdrawal due to adverse effects: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.06; 10 RTCs, 6008 participants; low-certainty evidence. No data were available for total cardiovascular events, heart failure, stroke, end-stage renal disease or change in heart rate. Low-certainty evidence suggested that RIs reduced systolic blood pressure: mean difference (MD) -1.72, 95% CI -2.47 to -0.97; 9 RCTs, 5001 participants; and diastolic blood pressure: MD -1.18, 95% CI -1.65 to -0.72; 9 RCTs, 5001 participants, to a greater extent than ACE inhibitors, but we judged this to be more likely due to bias than a true effect. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of hypertension, we have low certainty that renin inhibitors (RI) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors do not differ for all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. We have low to moderate certainty that they do not differ for adverse events. Small reductions in blood pressure with renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors are of low certainty. More independent, large, long-term trials are needed to compare RIs with ACE inhibitors, particularly assessing morbidity and mortality outcomes, but also on blood pressure-lowering effect.

### Network meta-analysis comparing angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^116SAXjv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The superiority of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) has not been reassessed after the publication of recent trials that did not find clinical benefits. Therefore, we performed an updated network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of ARNI, ACE-I, ARB, and placebo in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. We included randomized clinical trials that compared ARNI, ARB, ACE-I, and placebo in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. We extracted prespecified efficacy end points and produced network estimates, p scores, and surface under the cumulative ranking curve scores using frequentist and Bayesian network meta-analysis approaches. A total of 28 randomized controlled trials including 47,407 patients were included. ARNI was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 to 0.96), cardiac death (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99), and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) but higher risk of hypotension (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.10) than ARB. ARNI was associated with lower risk of MACE (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.97), but higher risk of hypotension (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.24) compared with ACE-I. P scores and surface under the cumulative ranking curve scores demonstrated superiority of ARNI over ARB and ACE-I in all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MACE, and hospitalization for heart failure. In conclusion, ARNI was associated with improved clinical outcomes, except for higher risk of hypotension, compared with ARB and ACE-I.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Hypertension — prevention of heart failure (HF) is emphasized: optimal blood pressure control decreases the risk of new HF by approximately 50%, and the lifetime risk of developing hypertension in the United States exceeds 75%. In the Framingham Heart Study, hypertension accounted for 39% of HF cases in men and 59% in women, and among patients who have had a prior MI, benefits include an 81% reduction in the incidence of HF. Healthcare providers should lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in accordance with published guidelines, and target levels of blood pressure are lower in patients with associated major cardiovascular risk factors, especially those with diabetes mellitus. Diuretic-based antihypertensive therapy has repeatedly been shown to prevent HF; ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta-blockers are also effective in the prevention of HF, whereas calcium antagonists and alpha-blockers are less effective in preventing HF syndrome. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy, the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) losartan and irbesartan significantly reduced the incidence of HF.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus — obesity and insulin resistance are important risk factors for the development of heart failure (HF), and clinical diabetes mellitus markedly increases the likelihood of HF and adversely affects outcomes. In type 2 diabetes mellitus patients more than 50 years of age with urinary albumin greater than 20 mg per liter, 4% developed HF during the study period, of whom 36% died. A differential gender effect is noted: diabetes mellitus only modestly increases the risk of HF for men, but it increases the relative risk of HF more than 3-fold among women. Healthcare providers should make every effort to control hyperglycemia, although such control has not yet been shown to reduce the subsequent risk of HF. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can prevent end-organ disease and clinical events in diabetic patients, long-term ACEI or ARB therapy decreases the risk of renal disease, and prolonged ACEI therapy with ramipril lowers the likelihood of cardiovascular death, MI, and HF; ARBs in diabetes with hypertension or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) reduce first hospitalization for HF and have other beneficial renal effects.

### Meta-analysis of large outcome trials of angiotensin receptor blockers in hypertension [^116SDKni]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), also known as sartans, block the activation of angiotensin type 1 receptors and have a recognised role in the treatment of heart failure and nephropathy. Since 2002, there have been three major outcome trials of ARBs in hypertension. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of ARB on major outcomes. Randomised controlled trials of ARBs in hypertensive subjects with an average follow-up of at least 2 years and at least 100 major cardiovascular events were included. For each trial, the ARB used, number and characteristics of subjects, baseline and change in blood pressure, cardiovascular and noncardiovascular outcomes were recorded. Three trials involving 29 375 subjects were included in the meta-analysis. In Losartan Intervention For Endpoint (LIFE) and Study on Cognition and Prognosis in the Elderly (SCOPE) but not in Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation trial (VALUE), an ARB reduced the occurrence of the primary end point and stroke compared to control. Compared to other antihypertensive drugs, ARB treatment was associated with no significant change in all-cause mortality (relative risk ratio (RRR) 0.96, 95% CI: 0.88–1.06, P = 0.45). There was an increase in myocardial infarction (RRR, 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01–1.26, P = 0.041), but a decrease in new-onset diabetes mellitus (RRR, 0.80, 95% CI: 0.74–0.86, P < 0.0000001). In conclusion, the reduction in new-onset diabetes partly offsets any increase in the risk of myocardial infarction. Most hypertensive patients require more than one class of drugs. Small differences in treatment outcome should not over-ride the importance of good blood pressure control.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers and risk of myocardial infarction: systematic review [^111KJQX8]. BMJ (2005). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers on the risk of myocardial infarction in patients at risk for cardiovascular events.

Design

Systematic review of controlled trials of angiotensin receptor blockers.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, hand search, and contact with investigators.

Selection Of Studies

Predefined criteria were used to select controlled clinical trials comparing use of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or placebo in patients at risk for cardiovascular events. Data were extracted for patients' characteristics, interventions, quality of trials, and rates of myocardial infarction.

Results

19 studies with 31,569 patients were included in the analysis. Two studies investigated the use of angiotensin receptor blockers in hypertensive patients, four studies in patients with diabetes and nephropathy, 10 studies in patients with heart failure, and three in patients with recent myocardial infarction or ischaemic syndrome. 11 studies of 21,062 patients allowed for comparison between angiotensin receptor blockers and placebo; nine studies of 10,625 patients allowed for comparison between angiotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors. Use of angiotensin receptor blockers was not associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction compared with placebo (odds ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 1.16) nor with increased risk of myocardial infarction compared with ACE inhibitors (1.01, 0.87 to 1.16).

Conclusions

Treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers was not associated with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction. The 95% confidence intervals do, however, not exclude an increase of up to 16% in the risk of myocardial infarction or a reduction in risk of up to 25%. Until further information specifically dealing with this issue is available from large prospective trials, our findings may alleviate recent concerns over the safety of this class of medications.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112V7dMV]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Recommendations for the treatment of confirmed hypertension in nonpregnant people with diabetes — initial blood pressure (BP) determines the number of agents and stepwise escalation. Initial BP ≥ 130/80 and < 150/90 mmHg — start one agent, whereas initial BP ≥ 150/90 mmHg — start two agents. One‑agent options include start ACEi or ARB or CCB† or diuretic‡; for two‑drug initiation, options include start two drugs from ACEi or ARB, CCB† or diuretic‡ or start ACEi or ARB and CCB† or diuretic‡. Assess BP management and adverse effects; if not meeting goal, add agent from complementary drug class (ACEi or ARB; CCB†; Diuretic‡), and for adverse effects, consider change to alternative medication (ACEi or ARB; CCB†; Diuretic‡). If not meeting goal on two agents and then not meeting goal or adverse effects using a drug from each of three classes, consider addition of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and refer to specialist with expertise in BP management; an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is suggested for coronary artery disease (CAD) or urine albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio 30–299 mg/g creatinine and is strongly recommended for urine albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine.

### Effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality: 14-effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs in older and younger patients: overview and meta-analysis [^112xabTm]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The five major classes of blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs have all been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events when compared with placebo, and when directly (head-to-head) compared, no significant differences in their overall effectiveness have been detected, except for minor differences in cause-specific events. It is unknown, however, whether age-related differences exist and if some classes of drugs are differently effective in older or younger individuals. This clinically relevant question has been the object of a systematic search and meta-analysis of all available data.

Methods

Two databases we had previously identified [72 placebo-controlled BP-lowering randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in 260210 individuals and 50 RCTs head-to-head comparing treatments with BP-lowering drugs of different classes in 247006 individuals) were searched for separately reported data on patients older or younger than 65 years, and the data were further stratified according to the class of drug [diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers] compared with placebo or with other drug classes. Seven fatal and nonfatal outcomes were considered for benefits. Adverse events were investigated as permanent treatment discontinuations for adverse events. Risk ratios and absolute risk changes were calculated by a random effects model. Effects at older and younger ages were compared by heterogeneity test.

Results

We identified 20 placebo-controlled RCTs on 55645 older individuals and 21 on 99621 younger individuals, and 21 head-to-head drug comparison RCTs on 94228 older individuals and 27 on 100232 younger individuals (for a total of 349726 individuals). When compared with placebo, all five classes of BP-lowering drugs significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events or stroke, with no significant difference between older and younger patients. However, in head-to-head comparisons, no significant difference was found between older and younger patients in the effects of diuretics, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on all cardiovascular outcomes, whereas beta-blockers revealed an age-dependent effectiveness, being equally effective as the other agents at an age below 65 years, but less effective at an older age.

Conclusion

Most BP-lowering classes are equally effective in preventing risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events both in older and younger patients, whereas beta-blockers, though being equally effective as the other agents in patients younger than 65, loose some of their effectiveness at an older age.

Background

Contemporary guidelines recommend angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) for hypertensive patients with diabetes. However, there is limited data to evaluate the comparison between ACEi and ARB on end stage renal disease (ESRD) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), in Asian diabetic patients.

Methods

We used the Taiwan Longitudinal Cohort of Diabetes Patients Database to perform a population-based dynamic cohort study. The comparison between ACEi and ARB on ESRD and MACE in diabetic patients was examined using the propensity score weighting method. We followed these patients until the occurrence of first study outcomes or end date of the study, whichever came first.

Results

There were 6898 and 12,758 patients in ACEi and ARB groups, respectively. The mean follow-up period was about 3.5 years in ESRD and 2.5 years in MACE. The incidence of ESRD was 0.44% and 0.63% per person-years in the ACEi and ARB group, respectively. The risk of ESRD was lower in the ACEi group than the ARB group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54–0.88, P = 0.0025]. Among those without chronic kidney disease (CKD), the incidence of ESRD was 0.30% and 0.37% per person-years in the ACEi and ARB group, respectively. ACEi was similar to ARB in preventing ESRD for those without CKD (P = 0.11). Among those with CKD, the incidence of ESRD was 1.39% and 2.34% per person-years in the ACEi and ARB group, respectively. The ACEi group had a lower risk of ESRD than the ARB group (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.42–0.88, P = 0.008). The incidence of MACE was 9.33% and 9.62% per person-years in the ACEi and ARB group, respectively. There was no significant difference in the composite MACE outcome between the two groups (P = 0.42), but the ACEi group was associated with a higher risk of stroke than the ARB group (HR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02–1.24, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

ACEi compared with ARB was associated with a lower incidence of ESRD, especially in those with CKD. Though ACEi and ARB had a similar risk of composite MACE outcome, ACEi had a slightly higher incidence of stroke than ARB, among the Asian diabetic patients.

### Blood pressure in heart failure management and prevention [^1131i9rM]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a leading cause of heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases. Its role in the pathogenesis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) differs from that in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Moreover, rigorous blood pressure control may reduce the incidence of heart failure. However, once heart failure develops, prognosis is affected by blood pressure, which may differ between patients with and without heart failure. Therefore, the association between guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure and its uptitration must be considered for blood pressure management and should not be overlooked. Heart failure medications affect the blood pressure and efficacy per baseline blood pressure value. This review discusses the potential mechanisms by which hypertension leads to HFrEF or HFpEF, the impact of hypertension on incident heart failure, and the recommended approaches for blood pressure management in patients with heart failure. Comparison between patients with and without heart failure regarding blood pressure The association between CV events and SBP is linear in patients without heart failure; however, it becomes J-shaped or inverse linear in those with heart failure. The management of BP, including optimal BP or pharmacotherapy, differs between the two populations.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers after transcatheter aortic valve Replacement: a meta-analysis [^114oDQDT]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Persistent left ventricular hypertrophy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been associated with poor outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), due to their favorable effects on ventricular remodeling, have been hypothesized to improve outcomes post-TAVR, yet there are no recommendations regarding their use.

Objectives

This study aimed to compare the outcomes of patients receiving ACEIs/ARBs with those not receiving ACEIs/ARBs after TAVR.

Methods

We performed a literature search on PubMed and Cochrane Library until June 14, 2023, and included all studies comparing clinical outcomes between patients given ACEIs/ARBs and those not given ACEIs/ARBs after TAVR. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome. We used a random effects model with appropriate corrections to calculate relative risk (RR) and CIs, with all analyses carried out using R v4.0.3.

Results

We included ten studies on the use of ACEIs/ARBs post-TAVR. Patients on ACEIs/ARBs had lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65–0.86, I² = 62%, chi-square P < 0.01), cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56–0.88, I² = 0%, chi-square P = 0.54), and new-onset atrial fibrillation (RR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.52–0.96, I² = 0%, chi-square P = 0.59). Patients on ACEIs/ARBs had a similar risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, new permanent pacemaker implantation, acute kidney injury, major bleeding, vascular complications, aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation.

Conclusions

We found that patients receiving ACEIs/ARBs had a lower risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and new-onset atrial fibrillation. Risk of other outcomes was similar to patients not receiving ACEIs/ARBs. Randomized clinical trials are needed to explore the benefits of ACEIs/ARBs post-TAVR, so that definitive guidelines can be developed.

### State of the art: evaluation and medical management of nonobstructive coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113UqbxE]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Therapies based on imaging and physiologic studies — preventive pharmacotherapy for nonobstructive coronary artery disease (NOCA) notes that despite the absence of definitive trial evidence, there is strong pathophysiologic and observational support for lipid-lowering and other preventive therapies, and lowering LDL-C has consistently demonstrated risk reduction across coronary artery disease; therapies such as statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and β-blockers, have favorable effects, and it is reasonable to individualize preventive regimens for patients with NOCA — particularly those with elevated LDL-C, high-risk plaque features, or additional risk enhancers — while awaiting targeted trial data. The WARRIOR trial randomized women with stable symptoms and NOCA to intensive medical therapy including high-dose statins and ACEI/ARBs or usual medical care; the trial fell short of its 4422-participant goal, many were already on therapy (70% statins, ≥ 50% ACEI/ARBs, 40% β-blockers), and after 5 years ≈16% in both arms reached the primary composite end point with no differences in secondary outcomes or subgroups.

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor / angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^112U8U2v]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Blood pressure (BP) control and reduction of urinary protein excretion using agents that block the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system are the mainstay of therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Research has confirmed the benefits in mild CKD, but data on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use in advanced CKD are lacking. In the STOP-ACEi trial, we aim to confirm preliminary findings which suggest that withdrawal of ACEi/ARB treatment can stabilize or even improve renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD.

Methods

The STOP-ACEi trial (trial registration: current controlled trials, ISRCTN62869767) is an investigator-led multicentre open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial of 410 participants with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive CKD receiving ACEi, ARBs or both. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either discontinue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (experimental arm) or continue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (control arm). Patients will be followed up at 3 monthly intervals for 3 years. The primary outcome measure is eGFR at 3 years. Secondary outcome measures include the number of renal events, participant quality of life and physical functioning, hospitalization rates, BP and laboratory measures, including serum cystatin-C. Safety will be assessed to ensure that withdrawal of these treatments does not cause excess harm or increase mortality or cardiovascular events such as heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke.

Results

The rationale and trial design are presented here. The results of this trial will show whether discontinuation of ACEi/ARBs can improve or stabilize renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD. It will show whether this simple intervention can improve laboratory and clinical outcomes, including progression to end-stage renal disease, without causing an increase in cardiovascular events.

### Comparison of cardiovascular events among users of different classes of antihypertension medications: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112MMytN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Antihypertension medications have been associated with prevention of cardiovascular events, although less is known about the comparative effectiveness of different medication classes.

Objective

To compare contemporary aggregated first-in-trial cardiovascular events among patients with hypertension and no substantial comorbidities.

Data Sources

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for articles published between January 1, 1990, and October 24, 2017.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that tested commonly used antihypertension medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics) and that reported selected cardiovascular outcomes for at least 6 months of follow-up.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The analysis was conducted from October 2017 to December 2019. Two reviewers extracted the number of cardiovascular events at the end of treatment for all study groups. For each outcome, a frequentist network meta-analysis was used to compare risk reductions between medication classes (random-effects models weighted by the inverse variance). The dose-response association between a 10-mm Hg reduction of systolic blood pressure and a 5-mm Hg reduction of diastolic blood pressure and the risk of first-in-trial cardiovascular events was estimated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

First-in-trial cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization.

Results

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, data were pooled from 46 eligible clinical trials (248 887 total participants with a mean [SD] age of 65.6 [5.8] years; 52.8% men). In the network meta-analysis, compared with placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics were reported to be similarly effective in reducing overall cardiovascular events (25%), cardiovascular death (20%), and stroke (35%); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were reported to be the most effective in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction (28%); and diuretics were reported to be the most effective in reducing revascularization (33%). In the metaregression analyses, each 10-mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure and 5-mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure was significantly associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death, stroke, and overall cardiovascular events.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this network meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients with hypertension and no substantial comorbidities, different classes of antihypertension medications were associated with similar benefits in reducing cardiovascular events. Future studies should compare the effectiveness of combinations of antihypertension medications in reducing cardiovascular events.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^113xvfLh]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — preferred combination therapy and role of beta‑blockers: Three outcome trials compared combinations including a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) with other regimens; in ACCOMPLISH the ACE inhibitor–CCB combination was superior to the same ACE inhibitor with a thiazide diuretic despite no blood pressure (BP) difference, whereas COLM and COPE reported no significant differences and had insufficient statistical power. Based on outcome randomized controlled trials and meta‑analyses, all five major drug classes can, in principle, be combined with one another, except for ACE inhibitors and ARBs, whose concomitant use may lead to no additional benefit but increased adverse effects and is thus discouraged. We recommend that the treatment of hypertension should be preferentially based on combinations of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide‑like diuretic, and these combinations are now widely available in a single pill. Other combinations, such as CCB + diuretic, also have evidence from RCTs supporting their use, but these are much less widely available as SPCs and do not include blockade of the RAS. Beta‑blockers in combination should be preferentially used when there is a specific clinical indication for their use, including symptomatic angina, heart rate control, post‑myocardial infarction, chronic HFrEF, and as an alternative to ACE inhibitors or ARBs in younger hypertensive women planning pregnancy or of child‑bearing potential; SPCs of beta‑blockers with an ACE inhibitor, CCB, or diuretic are available.

### ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), COVID-19, and ACE inhibitor and ANG II (angiotensin II) receptor blocker use during the pandemic: the pediatric perspective [^114tNnfh]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Potential but unconfirmed risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults and children may include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, as well as the medications commonly prescribed for these conditions, ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, and Ang II (angiotensin II) receptor blockers. Coronavirus binding to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, underlies much of this concern. Children are uniquely impacted by the coronavirus, but the reasons are unclear. This review will highlight the relationship of COVID-19 with hypertension, use of ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers, and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease from the pediatric perspective. We briefly summarize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and comprehensively review the literature pertaining to the ACE 2/Ang-(1–7) pathway in children and the clinical evidence for how ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers affect this important pathway. Given the importance of the ACE 2/Ang-(1–7) pathway and the potential differences between adults and children, it is crucial that children are included in coronavirus-related research, as this may shed light on potential mechanisms for why children are at decreased risk of severe COVID-19.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors: An ARB may be used when an ARNI is contraindicated or unaffordable, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not considered a reasonable alternative due to lack of benefit with perindopril in PEP-CHF, which enrolled 850 older adults (aged ≥ 70 years) and LVEF > 40%. In CHARM-Preserved, 3,023 participants with LVEF ≥ 40% randomized to candesartan (target dose of 32 mg daily) versus placebo showed a borderline significant effect on the primary composite (adjusted HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74–1.00) and a moderate reduction in HF hospitalizations (adjusted HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.70–1.00). In I-PRESERVE, 4,128 participants aged ≥ 60 years with LVEF ≥ 45% randomized to irbesartan (target dose of 300 mg daily) versus placebo had no reduction in the primary composite of death or cardiovascular hospitalization (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.86–1.05); study drug discontinuation was 34% and background ACE inhibitor use was 40%.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — blood pressure (BP) targets and renin–angiotensin system therapy: The prevalence of hypertension is 67% to 92% among people with CKD, and in SPRINT intensive BP treatment with mean achieved SBP 121 mm Hg versus standard treatment with mean achieved SBP 136 mm Hg reduced the risk of CVD, including among those with CKD. The recommendation in this guideline is for a treatment goal SBP < 130 mm Hg. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended for initial treatment of hypertension in CKD when albuminuria is moderate or severe (≥ 30 mg/g) and may be considered for lower level albuminuria (< 30 mg/g) based on expert opinion; these recommendations refer to people with nondialysis-requiring CKD, and ACEI or ARB is also appropriate for less-severe CKD (stage 1 or 2) when moderate or severe albuminuria is present. Supporting data include an analysis of CKD patients from 4 trials finding an SBP target of < 130 mm Hg (versus < 140 mm Hg) decreased all-cause mortality and a meta-analysis of CKD subsets from 18 trials where more-intensive SBP (mean SBP 132 mm Hg) versus less-intensive SBP (mean SBP 140 mm Hg) control resulted in 14% reduction in all-cause mortality; while < 120 mm Hg is more effective at preventing CVD events, meta-analyses support SBP < 130 mm Hg to balance benefits and risks. With ACEI/ARB therapy, these agents reduce intraglomerular pressure and may cause a transient dip in eGFR up to 30%; this short-term decline is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEI or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEI or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of > 30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation; ACEI or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR < 30 mL/ min/1.73 m2, and the combined use of an ACEI and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

### Health outcomes associated with various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents: a network meta-analysis [^112WMsfz]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Establishing relative benefit or harm from specific antihypertensive agents is limited by the complex array of studies that compare treatments. Network meta-analysis combines direct and indirect evidence to better define risk or benefit.

Objective

To summarize the available clinical trial evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents and evaluated in terms of major cardiovascular disease end points and all-cause mortality.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We used previous meta-analyses, MEDLINE searches, and journal reviews from January 1995 through December 2002. We identified long-term randomized controlled trials that assessed major cardiovascular disease end points as an outcome. Eligible studies included both those with placebo-treated or untreated controls and those with actively treated controls.

Data Extraction

Network meta-analysis was used to combine direct within-trial between-drug comparisons with indirect evidence from the other trials. The indirect comparisons, which preserve the within-trial randomized findings, were constructed from trials that had one treatment in common.

Data Synthesis

Data were combined from 42 clinical trials that included 192 478 patients randomized to 7 major treatment strategies, including placebo. For all outcomes, low-dose diuretics were superior to placebo: coronary heart disease (CHD; RR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.92); congestive heart failure (CHF; RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42–0.62); stroke (RR, 0.71; 0.63–0.81); cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69–0.83); cardiovascular disease mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73–0.92); and total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.96). None of the first-line treatment strategies-beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), alpha-blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers-was significantly better than low-dose diuretics for any outcome. Compared with CCBs, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00) and CHF (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67–0.81). Compared with ACE inhibitors, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96), cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00), and stroke (RR, 0.86; 0.77–0.97). Compared with beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80–0.98). Compared with alpha-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43–0.60) and cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.93). Blood pressure changes were similar between comparison treatments.

Conclusions

Low-dose diuretics are the most effective first-line treatment for preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice and treatment guidelines should reflect this evidence, and future trials should use low-dose diuretics as the standard for clinically useful comparisons.

### The impact of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers on the development of new-onset type 2 diabetes [^112F6SzG]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Angiotensin II has been shown to increase hepatic glucose production and decrease insulin sensitivity. Patients who utilize either an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may experience a decreased incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Three reviewers conducted a systematic literature search of Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library (1966 to present) to extract a consensus of trial data involving an ACEI or ARB with an end point of new-onset type 2 diabetes. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials verses placebo/routine therapy. A random-effects model was utilized. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Results

Eleven trials were identified, including 66,608 patients. An ACEI or ARB prevented new-onset type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 0.78 [95% CI 0.73–0.83]). The influence of either an ACEI (six trials) or an ARB (five trials) alone on new-onset type 2 diabetes was similar (0.79 [0.71–0.89] and 0.76 [0.70–0.82], respectively). Regardless of indication for use, hypertension (seven trials), coronary artery disease (two trials), or heart failure (two trials), reductions in new-onset type 2 diabetes were maintained (0.79 [0.72–0.85], 0.76 [0.60–0.95], and 0.70 [0.50–0.96], respectively). No statistical heterogeneity was observed for any evaluation (P > 0.1 for all comparisons). ACEIs and ARBs did not reduce the odds of mortality, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular events versus control therapy among all of these studies combined or the hypertension trials. ACEIs and ARBs did reduce the odds of these outcomes among the coronary artery disease studies versus control therapy.

Conclusions

ACEIs or ARBs may decrease patients' odds of developing new-onset type 2 diabetes but does not reduce the odds of mortality, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular outcomes over the study follow-up periods among patients with hypertension.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115udNgw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological therapy for hypertension — core drug classes and rationale: Most patients will require drug therapy in addition to lifestyle measures to achieve optimal blood pressure control, and five major drug classes were recommended for the treatment of hypertension — ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, CCBs, and diuretics (thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics such as chlortalidone and indapamide) — based on proven ability to reduce BP, evidence from placebo-controlled studies that they reduce CV events, and evidence of broad equivalence on overall CV morbidity and mortality, with benefit predominantly deriving from BP lowering.
