## Question

MRI is preferred over CT (computed tomography) in all of the following scenarios, EXCEPT:

Answer Choices:
A. The detection of a small tumor
B. The detection of a skull fracture
C. The detection of acute cerebral infarct
D. The detection of white matter abnormalities

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which scenario is the exception where MRI is NOT preferred over CT, among small tumor detection, skull fracture detection, acute cerebral infarct detection, and white matter abnormality detection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the comparative strengths of MRI versus CT across these domains. Then, I should verify guideline-level recommendations and high-quality evidence for each option. Next, I will identify the single scenario where CT is actually preferred or at least equivalent in a time-critical context. Finally, I will double-check for any nuances that could change the answer before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the general principle: MRI generally offers superior soft-tissue contrast, multiplanar capability, and advanced sequences (DWI, FLAIR, susceptibility) that outperform CT for most neurodiagnostic tasks, but CT remains valuable for speed, accessibility, and certain specific findings, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize [^631ec962] [^5f4ddba0].

> Now, for Option A, small tumor detection, I should confirm whether MRI is indeed preferred. MRI provides higher sensitivity and specificity for small intra-axial and extra-axial tumors, posterior fossa lesions, and leptomeningeal disease, and is the modality of choice when tumor is suspected, so MRI is preferred here, not the exception [^5f4ddba0].

> For Option B, skull fracture detection, wait, let me verify the conventional teaching. CT is the first-line modality for acute head trauma because it is fast, widely available, and highly sensitive for calvarial and basilar skull fractures, whereas MRI is less sensitive for thin cortical bone and is not the initial test of choice for fracture detection in the emergency setting, so this is the likely exception where CT is preferred over MRI [^notfound].

> For Option C, acute cerebral infarct, I need to check the comparative sensitivity. MRI with DWI detects acute ischemia within minutes to hours and is far more sensitive than noncontrast CT for early infarction, so MRI is preferred when available and not delayed, even though CT is often used first due to speed and hemorrhage exclusion; thus, MRI is preferred here, not the exception [^db9cb9b9] [^631ec962].

> For Option D, white matter abnormalities, I should confirm MRI's superiority. MRI with T2/FLAIR and diffusion techniques is the gold standard for detecting and characterizing white matter disease, including demyelination, small vessel ischemia, leukodystrophies, and subtle microstructural changes, so MRI is clearly preferred here, not the exception [^7a996766] [^631ec962].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check that there isn't a scenario where MRI is contraindicated or markedly inferior for fractures. MRI can miss linear calvarial fractures and is less reliable for thin bone, whereas CT rapidly delineates fracture lines, intracranial air, and bony involvement, reinforcing that CT is the practical choice for suspected skull fracture in the acute setting, making Option B the correct exception [^notfound].

> Final answer: B. The detection of a skull fracture is the scenario where CT is preferred over MRI, whereas MRI is preferred for small tumor detection, acute cerebral infarct detection, and white matter abnormality detection [^notfound].

MRI is preferred over CT for detecting **small tumors** [^5f4ddba0], **acute cerebral infarcts** [^db9cb9b9], and **white matter abnormalities** [^631ec962] because of its superior soft-tissue contrast, early ischemia detection with DWI, and sensitivity to demyelination and microstructural changes [^e965d2f8]. CT is preferred for **skull fractures** because it rapidly and reliably detects cortical bone disruption and is the first-line modality in acute trauma [^notfound]. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. The detection of a skull fracture**.

---

## Detection of small tumors

MRI is superior to CT for detecting **small tumors** because it provides higher soft-tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging, allowing better visualization of subtle lesions, particularly in the posterior fossa, brainstem, and pituitary region [^5f4ddba0]. MRI can identify lesions as small as a few millimeters, whereas CT may miss lesions under 1 cm, especially if they are isodense or located in areas of complex anatomy [^notfound].

---

## Detection of acute cerebral infarct

MRI is the **gold standard** for detecting acute cerebral infarcts, particularly within the first few hours after symptom onset [^db9cb9b9]. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can detect ischemic injury within minutes, whereas CT typically shows no changes for 12–24 hours. MRI's superior sensitivity and specificity for acute ischemia make it the preferred modality in suspected stroke, especially when time-sensitive decisions are required [^db9cb9b9].

---

## Detection of white matter abnormalities

MRI is vastly superior to CT for detecting **white matter abnormalities**, including demyelinating diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis), leukodystrophies, and small vessel ischemic changes [^7a996766]. MRI's T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences reveal white matter lesions that are often invisible or nonspecific on CT, enabling earlier diagnosis and better characterization of disease burden [^631ec962].

---

## Detection of skull fractures

CT is the **preferred modality** for detecting skull fractures because it rapidly and accurately identifies cortical bone disruption, linear fractures, and depressed fractures [^notfound]. MRI is less sensitive for acute fractures due to its limited ability to visualize cortical bone and is not recommended as a first-line tool in acute trauma settings [^notfound].

---

## Summary of comparative advantages

| **Clinical scenario** | **Preferred modality** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Small tumor detection | MRI | Superior soft-tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging [^5f4ddba0] |
| Acute cerebral infarct | MRI | Early ischemia detection with DWI [^db9cb9b9] |
| White matter abnormalities | MRI | High sensitivity for demyelination and microstructural changes [^631ec962] |
| Skull fracture detection | CT | Rapid, accurate identification of cortical bone disruption [^notfound] |

---

MRI is preferred over CT for detecting small tumors, acute cerebral infarcts, and white matter abnormalities, whereas **CT is preferred for skull fractures**. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. The detection of a skull fracture**.

### Fast quantitative diffusion-tensor imaging of cerebral white matter from the neonatal period to adolescence [^3cd0aedd]. Neuroradiology (2004). Low credibility.

We investigated the isotropic diffusion coefficient (D') and fractional anisotropy (FA) in white matter (WM) during brain development, using an optimised diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) method with whole brain coverage in a clinically acceptable time. We images 52 children with no evident neurological abnormality (30 boys, 22 girls aged 1 day-16 years) using high-angle DTI with optimised temporal gradient performance. D' and FA were calculated in 10 regions of interest in white matter. We saw that the age-related reduction in D' and increase in FA follow a mono- or biexponential model in white matter, probably depending on the compactness and myelination rate of the fibre tracts. In contrast to other areas, in which adult values were reached during the third year, there is a trend to continuous increase in FA in all deep white-matter areas, suggesting continuing maturation and organisation of deep tracts not detected on conventional MRI.

This study examined along-tract abnormalities in the white matter and their associations with clinical symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. White matter abnormalities along tract trajectories were analyzed using the centerline tractometry method. The schizophrenia group was further divided into recent-onset and chronic subgroups to investigate the relationship between clinical symptoms and white matter abnormalities within each subgroup. We aimed to identify neuroimaging biomarkers for clinical symptoms in these patient groups by detecting localized white matter abnormalities that may be obscure when employing averaged diffusion indices in statistical analyses.

### MRI is more appropriate for initial evaluation of stroke… [^db9cb9b9]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

The ideal imaging tool for acute stroke should detect all forms of stroke and provide accurate and immediate results. Computed tomography is the modality most commonly used in the initial evaluation of acute stroke. Although it is sensitive for detecting intra-cranial bleeding, CT is less sensitive for other forms of stroke and has substantial inter-rater variability in interpretation. The advantages of magnetic resonance imaging include improved assessment of acute ischemic injury because of a variety of causes and better inter-rater reliability. Chalela and colleagues compared CT with MRI in the emergency assessment of acute stroke. Patients who did not have either CT or MRI performed were excluded from the analysis. If possible, MRI was performed first, and the second investigation was initiated within 120 minutes. Four experts, who were unaware of clinical information, independently interpreted each scan.

Initial imaging findings were correlated with the final neurologic diagnosis established for each patient. Results: The average age of the 356 participants was 76 years. The median time from symptom onset to testing was 367 minutes for MRI and 390 minutes for CT. MRI was performed before CT in 304 patients. Overall, 217 patients had a final diagnosis of acute stroke. Acute ischemic stroke was diagnosed in 190 patients, and acute intracranial hemorrhage was diagnosed in 27. The sensitivity of MRI was significantly higher than CT for all patients with acute stroke or acute ischemic stroke. Unlike MRI, CT did not detect any of the 17 percent of false-negative results for acute ischemic stroke. The two modalities were comparable for acute intracranial hemorrhage; however, MRI was superior at detecting chronic hemorrhage and all intraparenchymal hemorrhages, excluding chronic microbleeds.

The sensitivities of MRI and CT relative to the final diagnosis were 83 and 26 percent, respectively. Compared with the final diagnosis of acute stroke, the accuracy of MRI was 89 percent, and CT was 54 percent. Conclusion: MRI is more effective than CT in the initial diagnosis of acute stroke. Most of the superiority of MRI was attributed to its ability to detect acute ischemic stroke. The authors suggest that their results are widely generalizable because the study was performed in a community hospital. They recommend MRI as the initial imaging modality in suspected acute stroke, and they suggest that MRI should be rapidly available in more centers to prevent delay in the initiation of therapy for acute stroke.

### Invited article: an MRI-based approach to the diagnosis of white matter disorders [^6135aa36]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

There are many different white matter disorders, both inherited and acquired, and consequently the diagnostic process is difficult. Establishing a specific diagnosis is often delayed at great emotional and financial costs. The pattern of brain structures involved, as visualized by MRI, has proven to often have a high diagnostic specificity.

Methods

We developed a comprehensive practical algorithm that relies mainly on the characteristics of brain MRI.

Results

The initial decision point defines a hypomyelination pattern, in which the cerebral white matter is hyperintense (normal), isointense, or slightly hypointense relative to the cortex on T1-weighted images, vs other pathologies with more prominent hypointensity of the cerebral white matter on T1-weighted images. In all types of pathology, the affected white matter is hyperintense on T2-weighted images, but, as a rule, the T2 hyperintensity is less marked in hypomyelination than in other pathologies. Some hypomyelinating disorders are typically associated with peripheral nerve involvement, while others are not. Lesions in patients with pathologies other than hypomyelination can be either confluent or isolated and multifocal. Among the diseases with confluent lesions, the distribution of the abnormalities is of high diagnostic value. Additional MRI features, such as white matter rarefaction, the presence of cysts, contrast enhancement, and the presence of calcifications, further narrow the diagnostic possibilities.

Conclusion

Application of a systematic decision tree in MRI of white matter disorders facilitates the diagnosis of specific etiologic entities.

Table 1
Glossary of white matter injury of prematurity.

PWML punctate white matter lesions, DEHSI diffuse excessive high signal intensity.

CUS has the advantage of being a bedside tool that allows safe, reliable serial imaging. It enables assessment of the evolution of injury over time, as well as brain growth and maturation. – Therefore, CUS is the preferred modality for initial and sequential studies in preterm infants. CUS remains very useful for the detection of cystic WMI. Although MRI is superior to CUS for assessing more subtle WMI, in the past decades the quality of neonatal CUS has improved dramatically in terms of resolution and image processing speed. This has broadened the spectrum of preterm white matter abnormalities that can be detected by careful scanning with state-of-the-art CUS systems today. Several evaluation scores have been developed to classify the severity of preterm WMI on MRI. In contrast, for CUS the only widely used classification system describing the spectrum of WMI/PVL is the one published by de Vries et al. in 1992. As discussed above, cystic PLV is now uncommon and new high-resolution US machines allow to detect more subtle white matter changes on CUS. The aim of this article is to describe the spectrum of preterm white matter abnormalities that can be detected with modern-day CUS and to propose a novel structured CUS assessment of WMI that seeks to expand the existing classification, accounting for all CUS abnormalities associated with preterm WMI. This novel assessment system aims to improve disease description in both daily clinical routine and clinical studies.

### Evidence of supratentorial white matter injury prior to treatment in children with posterior fossa tumors using diffusion MRI [^71118ea9]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, diffusion MRI can be used to detect white matter abnormalities before treatment in posterior fossa brain tumor patients. This knowledge may contribute to disentangling the causes of white matter damage in the brain, either from the tumor, associated hydrocephalus, or from treatments such as radiotherapy. Furthermore, the one-against-many approach shows that pretreatment white matter changes are patient-dependent, which may have a bearing on the ultimate treatment response and neurocognitive outcomes of patients. This approach underlines the variation and individuality of white matter injury in children with a posterior fossa tumor and has the potential to define risk factors for irreversibility despite post-treatment reduction in ventricular size. This may have implications for understanding white matter vulnerability in individual children, tailoring adjuvant therapy to reduce risk and early planning of rehabilitation strategies. These white matter abnormalities may, therefore, need to be considered in treatment planning for individual patients to improve outcomes and prevent cumulative white matter damage.

### Voxel-based detection of white matter abnormalities in mild Alzheimer disease [^f70e2db5]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To detect white matter abnormalities in patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD) by diffusion tensor imaging and to determine their topographic relationship with gray matter atrophy.

Methods

Thirteen patients with mild AD and 16 normal age-matched volunteers underwent diffusion tensor imaging and three-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled sequence scanning. Voxel-based morphometry was conducted to detect regions of gray matter atrophy in the AD group relative to the control group. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were processed using SPM2 to make voxel-wise comparison of anisotropy in whole brain between the two groups. The relationship between locations of abnormalities in the white and gray matter was examined.

Results

Significant reductions in anisotropy were found in the white matter of both medial temporal lobes, bilateral temporal stems, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, bilateral internal capsules, and cerebral peduncles, as well as the white matter of left middle temporal gyrus and right superior parietal lobule, the body and genu of the corpus callosum, and the right lateral capsule in patients with AD. Although the decrease in FA was consistent with cortical volumetric reduction in both temporal lobes, the widespread involvement of bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi was dominant in these white matter findings.

Conclusions

Voxel-wise comparison of whole-brain anisotropy revealed widely distributed disintegration of white matter in mild Alzheimer disease (AD). The white matter shows a different pattern of degeneration from gray matter and may be an independent factor in the progress of AD.

### Implications of isolated white matter abnormalities on neonatal MRI in congenital CMV infection: a prospective single-centre study [^90177434]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the leading congenital infection worldwide, with a birth prevalence rate ranging from 0.2 to 2%. Infants born with CMV have a significant risk of developing long-term impairments, such as sensorineural hearing loss and neurodevelopmental abnormalities.

At birth, only 10% of children will show clinical signs of infection. Diagnosis in asymptomatic patients is often the result of screening for maternal seroconversion during pregnancy. Symptomatic newborns have a high risk of permanent sequelae (40%–58%); however, important impairments are also found in 13% of initially asymptomatic children.

cCMV infection is responsible for a wide spectrum of brain anomalies, the type of lesion being dependent on the gestational age at the time of infection. Since infection can persist over a relatively long period and different parts of the brain mature at different gestational ages, combinations of malformative and destructive lesions are often seen. White matter abnormalities are one of the most characteristic findings of cCMV, occurring in up to 75% of clinically symptomatic and 30% of asymptomatic newborns. These lesions are often seen in association with other brain abnormalities, however, they are also frequently observed as an isolated finding.

According to the European consensus, patients with neuroimaging consistent with cCMV are considered 'severely' symptomatic, and 6 months of antiviral therapy is recommended. Neonatal MRI has shown a lot of potential in addition to ultrasound in detecting cCMV-related lesions, however, there still is no European consensus for its role in screening infected newborns, especially in the absence of clinical symptoms.

While some brain abnormalities, like cortical malformations and hippocampal dysplasia, seem strong predictors of poor neurological outcome, the prognostic role of others, such as white matter abnormalities on MRI or lenticulostriate vasculopathy on ultrasound, are less well known.

Unlike for lenticulostriate vasculopathy, patients with 'white matter change' are considered severely symptomatic. MRI is better than ultrasound in detecting these lesions, but the prognostic impact, especially when detected as an isolated abnormality, remains unclear. Reported studies are often small and mainly limited to severely affected children. To our knowledge, no previous studies focused on white matter abnormalities alone.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether isolated white matter abnormalities — detected on neonatal brain MRI — were associated with neurodevelopmental issues in children with cCMV.

### White matter' potholes' in early-onset schizophrenia: a new approach to evaluate white matter microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging [^b38fb499]. Psychiatry Research (2009). Low credibility.

There is considerable evidence implicating white matter abnormalities in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Many of the recent studies examining white matter have utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using either region of interest (ROI) or voxel-based approaches. Both voxel-based and ROI approaches are based on the assumption that the abnormalities in white matter overlap spatially. However, this is an assumption that has not been tested, and it is possible that aberrations in white matter occur in non-overlapping regions. In order to test for the presence of non-overlapping regions of aberrant white matter, we developed a novel image processing technique that evaluates for white matter 'potholes', referring to within-subject clusters of white matter voxels that show a significant reduction in fractional anisotropy. We applied this algorithm to a group of children and adolescents with schizophrenia compared to controls and found an increased number of 'potholes' in the patient group. These results suggest that voxel-based and ROI approaches may be missing some white matter differences that do not overlap spatially. This algorithm may be also be well suited to detect white matter abnormalities in disorders such as substance abuse, head trauma, or specific neurological conditions affecting white matter.

### White matter involvement in sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^6d914840]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Visual assessment

Visual assessment on T 2 -weighted images in most subjects did not show any significant white matter changes, except for punctuate deep white matter and thin periventricular white matter abnormalities. A moderate degree of deep white matter T 2 changes, associated with smooth or confluent periventricular and deep white matter foci, were found only in two of 26 subjects. White matter abnormalities on T 2 -weighted images were characterized by increased mean diffusivity on attenuation coefficient and mean diffusivity maps and thus are not the cause of decreased mean diffusivity. Mean diffusivity white matter changes were only appreciable quantitatively, whereas by visual assessment of standard diffusion imaging (DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient map) these abnormalities are usually not detected. We found, however, that attenuation coefficient maps (an inverse of the mean diffusivity maps routinely used), with opposite contrast (Fig. 5) seem to facilitate detection of white matter abnormalities by visual assessment in sporadic CJD. The mild degree of white matter changes detected on visual assessment of T 2 sequences compared to the clear abnormalities on attenuation coefficient, suggests that white matter abnormalities occur on a microstructural level assessed by DTI.

We suggest that the infrequent T 2 abnormalities found on visual assessment in sporadic CJD are likely signs of chronic small vessel disease or, alternatively, initial signs of white matter secondary degeneration. A classic example of white matter secondary degeneration in sporadic CJD is likely represented in the rare panencephalitic form of CJD, reported mostly in Asian countries in which some patients have very long disease durations because the cultures support profound life-extending measures, such as feeding tubes and intubation. In cases with the panencephalitic form of CJD, there is usually significant global atrophy with status spongiosis in grey matter and extensive abnormalities in white matter, correlating with disease duration and severity of cortical atrophy. The panencephalitic form of CJD is probably not so much a specific subtype of CJD, but rather a more non-specific very late, end-stage of exceptionally prolonged cases of CJD, characterized by white matter secondary degeneration to the diffuse late stage neuronal loss.

### White matter disease derived from vascular and demyelinating origins [^553eda7b]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Damage or microstructural alterations of the white matter can cause dysfunction of the intrinsic neural networks in a condition termed as white matter disease (WMD). Frequently detected on brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans, WMD is commonly presented in inflammatory demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and vascular diseases such as cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Prevention of MS and CSVD progression requires early treatments with drastically different medications and approaches, as such, early and accurate diagnosis of WMD, derived from vascular or demyelinating etiologies, is of paramount importance. However, the clinical and imaging similarities between MS, especially during the early stage, and CSVD, pose a significant dilemma in differentiating these two conditions. In this review, we attempt to summarize and contrast the distinguishing features of MS and CSVD for aiding accurate diagnosis to ensure timely corresponding management in the early stages of MS and CSVD.

### Outlier detection in multimodal MRI identifies rare individual phenotypes among more than 15, 000 brains [^dc8da8d1]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.6 Secondary screening: Investigation of individual extreme outliers

The automatic quality control described in Section 2.3 excluded most data collection/processing errors. However, a small number of errors could remain in this large cohort. For example, potentially low quality T2w FLAIR images and potential segmentation errors of white matter lesions were not accounted for because of the lack of a well‐established tool for automatic assessment of the quality of T2w FLAIR images or white matter lesion segmentation. To capture potential data collection/processing errors that may occur in extreme outliers, for each remaining imaging phenotype, the extreme outlier subjects were first manually inspected and the ones with the errors were eliminated. For each VV extreme outlier subject, ventricle segmentation was visually inspected by overlaying the border of the segmented ventricle mask on the T1w image. For each WMLV extreme outlier subject, white matter lesion segmentation was visually inspected by overlaying the border of the segmented lesion mask on the T2w FLAIR image. The FA or MD extreme outlier subjects were visually checked for registration and field of view (FOV) coverage. For CTh extreme outlier subjects, their white/pial surface segmentation was visually checked via HCP pipeline structural quality control scenes (v1.4.0).

A subgroup (120 subjects) of the remaining non‐artifactual extreme outlier subjects were radiologically reviewed. This subgroup included all top‐ranked extreme outlier subjects and randomly sampled non‐top extreme outlier subjects to ensure a wide coverage (Figure S2). T1w MPRAGE and T2w FLAIR images, as well as the ages of these subjects, were provided to a board‐certified neuroradiologist (D. S. R.). The instructions to the neuroradiologist were to identify any major findings that might plausibly account for the extreme outlier score — not to identify subtle abnormalities that would have required dedicated review on clinical‐grade display systems. When the neuroradiologist was uncertain of the diagnosis, UKB health outcomes data (UKB Category 1712) were used in an attempt to determine the diagnosis. These data recorded the first occurrence of various diseases, including neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Based on the radiological review results, the subjects in the subgroup were further divided into two subgroups: a subgroup of the extreme outlier subjects with radiological findings (117 subjects), and another subgroup of the extreme outlier subjects which appeared normal to the neuroradiologist (3 subjects). The cases from these two subgroups that would be interesting for follow‐up were highlighted.

### Detecting white matter injury in sickle cell disease using voxel-based morphometry [^6ba23fa0]. Annals of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with cerebrovascular disease, cerebral infarction, and cognitive dysfunction. This study aimed to detect the presence and extent of white matter abnormalities in individuals with SCD using voxel-based morphometry (VBM).

Methods

Thirty-six children and adolescents with SCD (age range, 9–24 years) and 31 controls (8–25 years) underwent magnetic resonance investigations using T1- and T2-weighted protocols. White and gray matter density maps were obtained from three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets. Using VBM, we compared the maps between controls and SCD individuals with silent white matter infarct lesions (SCD+L; n = 16), and those without visible abnormality (SCD-L; n = 20).

Results

In comparison with controls, intelligence quotients (IQs) were lower in both SCD groups irrespective of presence of visible lesions. VBM showed widespread bilateral white matter abnormalities in the SCD+L group, extending beyond the regions of focal infarction in the deep anterior and posterior white matter borderzones. Bilateral white matter abnormalities were also observed in the SCD-L group, in locations similar to those in the SCD+L group.

Interpretation

VBM is sensitive to detection of widespread white matter injury in SCD patients in borderzones between arterial territories even in the absence of evidence of infarction. Those changes may contribute to cognitive deficits in this population.

### Strategic white matter injury associated with long-term information processing speed deficits in mild traumatic brain injury [^bcc1086e]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical assessment of this persisting cognitive deficit is challenging, especially when no gross abnormalities indicative of the cognitive or functional loss are detected on routine diagnostic imaging (e.g. structural MRI and CT). Only 4% of mild TBI have relevant or suspected pathological findings (Smith, 2012), leading to the larger proportion of patients receiving no medical attentions. It is suggested that abnormalities of selective swelling and disconnection of white matter axons following trauma can be better detected by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) than by conventional imaging (Niogi & Mukherjee, 2010; Shenton et al. 2012). However, heterogeneous and inconsistent conclusions have been drawn regarding to the direction of tissue water diffusivity abnormalities, including increased (Henry et al. 2011; Ling et al. 2012; Mayer et al. 2010), decreased during the initial diagnose (acute or semi‐acute stage) (Messe et al. 2012; Miles et al. 2008). Specially, this claim of traumatic axonal injury has been challenged by recent study reporting null changes in mild TBI (Ilvesmaki et al. 2014). Besides variability due to clinical factors, the analytical approach used for detecting white matter abnormalities may attribute to discrepancies in mild TBI DTI studies. In general, previous studies assumed that clinically heterogeneous patients have a homogenous (i.e. high degree of spatial overlap) pattern of white matter abnormalities. To address this question, we adopted a novel approach by measuring diffusion abnormalities through a metric similar to lesion‐load (White, Schmidt, & Karatekin, 2009). Specifically, clusters of abnormally high or low anisotropic diffusion were determined on a voxel‐wise basis and then summed to represent total burden of distributed pathology. Such bi‐directional changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) are also detected after early injury in the rodent controlled cortical impact (CCI) model (Harris, Verley, Gutman, & Sutton, 2016), as well as following subacute of mild TBI (Ling et al. 2012).

### New advances in fetal MR neuroimaging [^72fd4612]. Pediatric Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

MR is now routinely and widely used in fetal neuroimaging and has proven to be valuable in the detection of many cerebral lesions, either genetically determined or acquired in utero. However, its efficiency has certain limits in the detection of diffuse white-matter abnormalities, the evaluation of fibre development and the demonstration of metabolic disorders. Moreover, conventional fetal MR imaging provides only a morphological approach to the fetal brain. New techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, proton MR spectroscopy and functional MR imaging are developing. The majority of these are not used routinely. The principles, aims, technical problems and possible applications of these techniques for imaging the fetus are discussed.

### Diffusion tensor imaging of cerebral white matter: technique, anatomy, and pathologic patterns [^e965d2f8]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Diffusion tensor imaging is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that provides insight into the anatomy and integrity of white matter pathways in the brain. Further processing of these data can help map individual tracts, which can aid in surgical planning. Understanding the basics of this technique can improve characterization of white matter development and disorders.

### Microstructural white matter abnormalities and cognitive functioning in type 2 diabetes: a diffusion tensor imaging study [^aa64b0db]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with a twofold increased risk of dementia. The etiology is still largely unknown, which hampers the development of preventive treatment. Previous findings in nondemented patients with type 2 diabetes suggest that early changes in brain structure and function can contribute to the increased dementia risk. The first changes in cognitive functioning include slowing of information-processing speed and problems with attention, executive functioning, and verbal memory. Brain-imaging studies in patients with type 2 diabetes have demonstrated a higher prevalence of lacunar infarcts and increased white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume compared with control subjects, but results are not consistent. Moreover, these lesions are only modestly associated with the diabetes-related cognitive decrements, suggesting that other, possibly more subtle brain abnormalities play a role.

Recent brain autopsy studies report subtle microscopic vascular and nonvascular white matter abnormalities in patients with type 2 diabetes. These subtle abnormalities cannot be detected with conventional structural MRI but may be detected with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI is a noninvasive technique that is sensitive to subtle white matter pathology in the brain. Damage to white matter fibers, such as demyelination and axonal changes, may lead to changes in the diffusion of water molecules and therefore to a change in the DTI parameters. In addition, measurement of the directionality of the diffusion makes it possible to obtain maps of white matter tract anatomy and to study the connectivity between brain regions. Abnormalities in specific white matter tracts can lead to disruption in information transfer between brain areas resulting in deficits in cognitive functioning. Previous studies, not specifically addressing type 2 diabetes, have indeed demonstrated that DTI can provide information that is clearly complementary to the classical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of small vessel disease, such as WMH and lacunar infarcts.

The current study examined 1) whether type 2 diabetes is associated with microstructural abnormalities in specific white matter tracts and 2) whether these microstructural abnormalities are related to decrements in cognitive functioning in nondemented older individuals with type 2 diabetes.

### Diffusion tensor imaging detects areas of abnormal white matter microstructure in patients with partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency [^4f8f734a]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

OTCD, an X-linked disorder, is the most common of the UCDs. Neonatal onset is associated with uniformly poor outcome. Males with late-onset OTCD show deficits in executive function, motor planning, and working memory. A broad phenotype is observed in heterozygous females. A specific neurobehavioral phenotype with white matter dysfunction and impaired attention and working memory has been described. The extent to which the deficits involve specific pathways in the brain is unknown. We hypothesized that DTI would disclose white matter microstructure in OTCD correlating with cognitive deficits.

Materials and Methods

Nineteen adults with partial OTCD and 18 adult control subjects ages 19–59 years participated. MR imaging was performed by using a 3T whole-body scanner. Anisotropy was calculated from the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor by using the FA metric and was compared between the study and control groups.

Results

FA of the frontal white matter was significantly decreased in subjects, indicating changes in white matter microstructure. There was an inverse relationship between FA and disease severity, but not with age.

Conclusions

Findings of MR imaging in OTCD are often normal in patients with late-onset disease, heterozygotes, or in those not in hyperammonemic crisis. DTI was more sensitive than FSE T2-weighted imaging for detecting abnormalities in normal-appearing white matter. The extent of abnormality correlated with cognitive deficits. The location of the deficits in the frontal white matter is important because this area connects fibers that are vital to executive function, attention, and working memory.

### Apparent diffusion coefficient values of the white matter in magnetic resonance imaging of the neonatal brain may help predict outcome in congenital cytomegalovirus infection [^d5223f72]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection, being the leading type of congenital infection, causes a major health problem. Infected newborns have a significant risk of developing long-term impairments, mainly sensorineural hearing loss and neurodevelopmental problems.

At birth, only 10% of children show clinical signs of infection. Diagnosis in asymptomatic infants is often the result of testing for maternal seroconversion during pregnancy. Clinically symptomatic newborns have a very high risk of developing long-term sequelae (40–60%), although important developmental impairments are also seen in 10–15% of initially asymptomatic children.

Cytomegalovirus is a neurotropic virus. Infection in utero can cause a wide spectrum of brain anomalies, the type of lesion depending on the gestational age at the time of infection. White matter abnormalities are one of the most characteristic findings of cCMV, occurring in up to 75% of clinically symptomatic and 30% of asymptomatic newborns. These lesions are often seen in association with other brain abnormalities; however, they are also frequently noted as an isolated finding.

Despite the long-term impact of cCMV, evidence on which to base treatment decisions remains limited. According to the European consensus, patients with neuroimaging consistent with cCMV are considered "severely" symptomatic, and 6 months of antiviral therapy is recommended. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in newborns has shown a lot of promise complementary to ultrasound in detecting cCMV-related lesions, especially white matter abnormalities. Nevertheless, presently there is no consensus for its role in screening infected newborns, especially in the absence of clinical symptoms.

While some brain abnormalities, like cortical malformation, seem to be strong predictors of poor neurological outcome, the prognostic role of others, such as "white matter change", remains unclear. Reported studies are often small and limited to severely affected children.

Furthermore, grading of the white matter can be challenging in newborns. Mainly discrete or isolated lesions can be difficult to distinguish from normal variation in the unmyelinated white matter. At present, there is no written consensus on how to define "white matter" signal alterations as pathological, leaving the (subjective) decision up to the expertise of the radiologist.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether quantitative measurement of the white matter on brain MRI, by means of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, could be used to predict clinical outcome in newborns with cCMV infection.

### The clinical importance of white matter hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging: systematic review and meta-analysis [^d99b655d]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

As magnetic resonance imaging has become widely available and brain magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly being carried out in various clinical settings, clinicians often have to deal with the incidental discovery of white matter lesions, appearing as hyperintensities on T2 weighted images (fig 1). In the general population the prevalence of white matter hyperintensities ranges from 11–21% in adults aged around 64 to 94% at age 82. Pathological findings in regions of white matter hyperintensity include myelin pallor, tissue rarefaction associated with loss of myelin and axons, and mild gliosis. These lesions are located in the deep white matter, typically sparing subcortical U-fibres, and are often seen together with vessels affected by small vessel disease. The affected vessels are presumed to induce the lesions in deep white matter through chronic hypoperfusion of the white matter and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, leading to chronic leakage of plasma into the white matter. White matter hyperintensities are more common and extensive in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and symptomatic cerebrovascular disease. White matter hyperintensities can be measured quantitatively and non-invasively on large population samples and have been proposed as an intermediate marker, which could be used for the identification of new risk factors and potentially as a surrogate end point in clinical trials.

Fig 1 White matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging (axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequence) in two 80 year old patients: (left) minor white matter hyperintensities; (right) extensive white matter hyperintensities predominating in periventricular region. White matter lesions are considered present if hyperintense on T2 weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, and proton density images, without prominent hypointensity on T1 weighted images

Several studies have assessed the relation between white matter hyperintensities and risk of stroke, dementia, and death, with partly conflicting results. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed all published longitudinal studies that tested the association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke, dementia, and death, both in the general population and in a hospital based setting.

### Multivariate pattern analysis of DTI reveals differential white matter in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^dce7fd16]. Human Brain Mapping (2014). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study demonstrated that patients with OCD can be distinguished from healthy controls using FA images extracted from DTI data with high classification accuracy. This classification was driven by a distributed pattern of white matter alterations which included bilateral prefrontal and temporal white matter, inferior fronto‐occipital fasciculus, superior fronto‐parietal fasciculus, splenium of corpus callosum, and left middle cingulum bundle. Moreover, in OCD patients the distance from the optimal hyperplane positively correlated with the total Y‐BOCS scores, suggesting that the classification of these participants on the basis of white matter values was driven by OCD symptoms.

Multiple white matter microstructural abnormalities in OCD have been reported before [Li et al. 2011; Menzies et al. 2008b; Szeszko et al. 2005; Yoo et al. 2007]. However, previous studies used mass‐univariate analyses that tend to detect only a few isolated regions with abnormal FA at group level [Davatzikos, 2004; Soriano‐Mas and Pujol, 2007]. Here we used SVM to examine whether the whole‐brain pattern of white matter microstructural abnormalities could be used to discriminate between OD patients and healthy controls at the individual level. Unlike mass‐univariate analyses, SVM takes inter‐regional correlations into account, and provides numerical indicators for group membership without multiple comparison biases [Orrù et al. 2012]. Here a region's discriminative power depends not only on between‐group differences in its absolute values, but also on any between‐group differences in its structural correlations with other regions; this analytical approach may be particularly suited to the investigation of mental disorders such as OCD in which abnormalities are distributed across the whole brain [Abramowitz et al. 2009; Menzies et al. 2008a]. In the present study discrimination was based not only on frontal regions, cingulum bundle and corpus callosum but also on parts of the occipital and temporal white matter, areas not traditionally implicated in OCD; this demonstrates the ability of SVM to detect subtle and distributed white matter alterations.

### An imaging approach to diffuse white matter changes [^9ad69b21]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

White matter disorders represent a large, heterogeneous group of disorders that span the continuum of congenital metabolic disorders to acquired processes, such as chronic ischemic microvascular white matter disease.

### Don't perform CT imaging for headache when MRI is… [^5f4ddba0]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

When neuroimaging for headache is indicated, MRI is preferred over CT, except in emergency settings when hemorrhage, acute stroke, or head trauma are suspected. MRI is more sensitive than CT for the detection of neoplasm, vascular disease, posterior fossa and cervicomedullary lesions, and high and low intracranial pressure disorders. CT of the head is associated with substantial radiation exposure, which may elevate the risk of later cancers, while there are no known biologic risks from MRI.

### White matter abnormalities in HIV-1 infection: a diffusion tensor imaging study [^a5111f92]. Psychiatry Research (2001). Low credibility.

Diffuse white matter pallor is the most frequent neuropathological feature of HIV-1 infection and has been found to be particularly prominent in the advanced stages of the disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether subtle white matter abnormalities can be detected in medically stable, ambulatory HIV-1 patients, in vivo, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that is uniquely suited for the study of subtle white matter abnormalities. DTI was performed in six HIV-1 patients and nine controls. The two groups were similar in age. Abnormal fractional anisotropy was found in the white matter of the frontal lobes and internal capsules of the HIV-1 patients, in the absence of group differences in mean diffusivity, computed proton density, and computed T2. DTI may be more sensitive than conventional MRI methods for detecting subtle white matter disruptions in HIV-1 disease.

### Evidence of supratentorial white matter injury prior to treatment in children with posterior fossa tumors using diffusion MRI [^46fdcca3]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The ability to conduct the one-against-many analysis quickly — approximately 13 minutes for FA and an additional 6 minutes for other diffusivity parameters — makes it feasible to incorporate into clinical workflows. This has important implications confirming that brain injury can occur pretreatment and distant to the tumor location, as evidenced by the abnormal supratentorial white matter seen in childhood posterior fossa tumors. This may allow tailoring of future therapeutic or rehabilitation strategies, as white matter abnormalities detected early could inform adjustments in treatment plans to mitigate long-term neurocognitive deficits. Prior studies have used DTI (lower FA) to show that white matter abnormalities observed postsurgery but prior to adjuvant treatment correlate with later cognitive decline, and tumor size is associated with abnormalities (increased diffusivity) in specific white matter pathways, further highlighting the potential long-term impact of early white matter changes.

### Relationship between cognitive impairment and white-matter alteration in Parkinson's disease with dementia: tract-based spatial statistics and tract-specific analysis [^1555d07c]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

We previously reported reduced FA in the anterior cingulate fibre tracts in PD patients and a significant correlation between FA in the anterior cingulate fibre tracts and MMSE score by using tract-specific analysis in PDD patients. In the present study, we detected reduced FA bilaterally in the cingulate fibre tracts of PDD patients compared with in normal controls, but we did not detect any reduced FA in PD patients or a significant correlation between FA in the anterior cingulate fibre tracts and MMSE score when we used TBSS in PDD patients.

Compared with TSA, TBSS can influence the outcome by multiple comparisons, whereas TSA has the advantage of detecting abnormalities in specific white matter tracts. Therefore, our use of TBSS may have been the reason why we did not detect reduced FA in the anterior cingulate fibre tracts in PD patients.

The limitations of our study need to be addressed. Because the diagnoses of PD and PDD were not histopathologically confirmed, the possibility of misdiagnosis remains. However, the validity of the diagnoses is supported by the finding that, 24 months or more after undergoing imaging, all of the patients continued to respond satisfactorily to anti-parkinsonian therapy and remained free of atypical parkinsonism.

In conclusion, we consider that the finding of diffusion abnormalities in the cerebral white matter of PDD patients reflects structural changes resulting from Lewy abnormalities in the cerebral white matter. Our study also found a relationship between cognitive impairment and alteration of white matter adjacent to the prefrontal area and in the genu of the corpus callosum. These changes may be useful in assessing the onset of dementia in PD patients.

### White matter diffusion alterations precede symptom onset in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease [^53618c81]. Brain (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The major finding of the current study was the region-specific increase in mean diffusivity that emerged about 10 years before the estimated onset of dementia symptoms. These fibre tract alterations were not restricted to WMH areas, suggesting that subtle changes in the normal-appearing white matter were already present years before the onset of dementia symptoms. Higher mean diffusivity was associated with lower CSF amyloid-β 1–42, higher CSF tau and CSF soluble TREM2, suggesting that early white matter alterations were associated with primary Alzheimer's disease pathology and microglia activity.

Our current findings provide novel insights to clarify the question of whether white matter alterations precede the onset of dementia symptoms and if so which fibre tracts are affected first in the course of Alzheimer's disease. Our results revealed an abnormal increase in mean diffusivity in the forceps major (which projects into the posterior parietal and occipital cortex) a decade before the onset of dementia symptoms, with the forceps minor (which projects into the medial and lateral frontal cortex) and long-ranging projection fibres such as the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus all showing abnormal mean diffusivity several years before the expected onset of dementia symptoms. Anterior and posterior callosal fibres and fibres such as the inferior-fronto-occipital fasciculus provide major connections within the anterior and posterior components of the default mode network regions, a functional network showing reduced connectivity in early-stage Alzheimer's disease. Although any correlational data preclude a causative conclusion, our findings support the possibility that callosal white matter degeneration contribute to functional disruption of functional networks such as the default mode network. The hippocampal cingulum bundle showed alterations only after the expected onset of symptom. However, the cingulum bundle is only a thin white matter tract, which may render a region of interest approach less sensitive to detect diffusion alterations in that tract. It is important to note that current findings on DTI assessed white matter differences show where mean diffusivity alterations can be first detected, but not necessarily where they first occur. The sensitivity to detect white matter alterations via DTI may differ between fibre tracts. In addition to the regional change, we found abnormally increased levels of the PSMD marker of global white matter changes years before estimated symptom onset early. The PSMD is fully automated index is sensitive to regionally heterogeneous abnormal mean diffusivity values. The current findings suggest that PSMD was sensitive to the earliest white matter changes observed in the callosal fibres, and may thus be a candidate marker for early white matter changes such as occurring in Alzheimer's disease.

### Cerebral white matter integrity and resting-state functional connectivity in middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes [^a96f20d8]. Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Early detection of brain abnormalities at the preclinical stage can be useful for developing preventive interventions to abate cognitive decline. We examined whether middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients show reduced white matter integrity in fiber tracts important for cognition and whether this abnormality is related to preestablished altered resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN). Diabetic and nondiabetic participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive assessment. Multiple diffusion measures were calculated using streamline tractography, and correlations with DMN functional connectivity were determined. Diabetic patients showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) (a measure of white matter integrity) in the cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus. Control subjects showed stronger functional connectivity than patients between the posterior cingulate and both left fusiform and medial frontal gyri. FA of the cingulum bundle was correlated with functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus for combined groups. Thus, middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes show white matter abnormalities that correlate with disrupted functional connectivity in the DMN, suggesting that common mechanisms may underlie structural and functional connectivity. Detecting brain abnormalities in middle age enables implementation of therapies to slow progression of neuropathology.

### Prenatal assessment of brain malformations on neuroimaging: an expert panel review [^d775a3d3]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Advanced MR techniques: diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional MRI

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) assists with the qualification and quantification of the microstructural architecture of the developing fetal brain. In particular, the morphogenesis and integrity of major white matter tracts like sensorimotor and callosal pathways can be reconstructed and studied in three dimensions using fetal tractography. Moreover, standardized diffusion weighted imaging/DTI-based atlas segmentations of different fetal brain compartments are now available.DTI depicts anisotropic diffusion process along the non-myelinated fetal fibre tracts. If read in conjunction with structural sequences, DTI and fetal tractography hold the potential to further phenotype certain pathologic conditions. For instance, in callosal abnormalities, visualization of the Probst bundles confirms the diagnosis of complete or partial agenesis — which may be difficult, especially in cases of 'short' corpus callosum. In DTI, fractional anisotropy (in utero or post-mortem) is a marker of the degree of microstructural organization and maturation of the developing brain, which has relevance to impairment of cortical development. DTI captures a prominent zone of anisotropy of the developing telencephalic wall, which stems from the migrational coherence of neurons and radial glial fibres and, to a lesser extent, from the radial vasculature. The appearance of the telencephalic wall on fetal DTI correlates with the developmental timing of transient structures. The radial diffusion coherence is visible during 19–27 GW and disappears gradually to term gestation. The transient migrational pathways cross the emerging neuronal bundles, giving rise to periventricular crossroads, depicted by fetal DTI. The diffusion coherence is visible in utero using standard clinical sequences as early as the 22nd GW (Fig. 1A, B and D), while the telencephalic wall layers and migrational coherence are best depicted using high-field MRI (Fig. 1C and D).

### Early detection of white matter hyperintensities using SHIVA-WMH detector [^1102cb1e]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

The summary of subject‐by‐subject VL‐ and CL‐Dice scores across the range of WMH lesion sizes complements these findings in the cohort‐specific analyses: Overall, when subjects are burdened with large WMH lesions, as in the case for most MWC subjects, VL‐Dice scores are not very different across tools, but the advantage of SHIVA‐WMH is evident in subjects with only small WMH lesions (Supplemental Figure 3). At the level of lesion‐clusters, SHIVA‐WMH consistently shows higher CL‐Dice scores than the reference tools across the entire range of WMH burden (Supplemental Figure 3). It indicates the superior detection of individual lesion clusters by the SHIVA‐WMH compared to other tools even in subjects with the high WMH burden, and also highlights the dangers of focusing solely on VL‐Dice scores when assessing prediction quality in the presence of mixture of small and large lesions.

### Implications of isolated white matter abnormalities on neonatal MRI in congenital CMV infection: a prospective single-centre study [^8ec7a3c0]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Clinical findings

Median clinical follow-up was 12.0 months (IQR 12–27.7 months). Detailed information on reasons for cCMV testing, clinical findings at birth and during follow-up are provided in table 2.

Table 2
Relevant clinical findings at the time of neonatal brain MRI and during clinical follow-up

At birth, 13/207 patients (6.3%) were 'clinically' symptomatic: 5/27 patients (18.5%) with abnormal white matter, compared with 4/118 patients (3.4%) with normal and 4/62 patients (6.5%) with doubtful white matter (Fisher's exact p = 0.025).

Clinically detectable symptoms/signs at birth (physical examination) were present in 5/207 patients (2.4%): in 1/27 patients (3.7%) with abnormal, 2/118 patients (1.7%) with normal and 2/62 patients (3.2%) with doubtful white matter (Fisher's exact p = 0.523).

Figure 4 shows the clustered bar charts of white matter scores on neonatal brain MRI by several clinical findings, both at birth and during clinical follow-up. Results of the regression analyses are displayed in table 3.

Hearing

Neonatal hearing was abnormal in 6/207 patients (2.8%). In two of these patients, hearing returned to normal during follow-up. At follow-up, hearing was abnormal in 13/202 patients (6.2%): in 4 patients, this was due to persistence of neonatally detected hearing loss, while in 9 patients, late-onset hearing loss had occurred.

Neonatal hearing loss was seen in 4/27 patients (14.8%) with abnormal white matter, compared with 1/118 patients (0.8%) with normal and 1/62 patients (1.6%) with doubtful white matter (Fisher's exact p = 0.005). All nine patients with late-onset hearing loss had normal white matter on neonatal brain MRI.

### How to diagnose difficult white matter disorders [^dd60d628]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Genetic and acquired disorders of white matter comprise a diverse group of conditions, with often overlapping clinical and radiological findings. Patients present with a variable combination of cognitive impairment, ataxia, spasticity or movement disorders, among others. There are many genetic causes, and the route to diagnosis involves comprehensive clinical assessment, radiological expertise, metabolic investigations and finally genetic studies. It is essential not to miss the treatable acquired causes. In this review, we present a practical approach to investigating patients with acquired and genetic disorders of white matter, based on the experience of a large international referral centre. We present a guide for clinicians, including pitfalls of testing, clinical pearls and where to seek advice.

### Cerebral white matter degeneration in frontotemporal dementia detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging [^0d226c4a]. Academic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objective

Brain tissue damage in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has never been systematically studied using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). We studied FTD patients using DWI to determine whether microstructural changes in white matter can be detected in vivo.

Materials and Methods

Thirteen FTD patients and 15 aged healthy subjects were studied. Mean diffusivity (MD) abnormalities in 28 white matter regions were visually evaluated. In addition, MD values in 10 white matter regions relative to that in the ipsilateral postcentral gyrus were measured. The results were compared between healthy subjects and FTD patients.

Results

The visual rating resulted in a significant MD elevation in FTD patients in the bilateral high superior frontal gyri, right orbitofrontal gyrus, bilateral anterior temporal lobes, and left middle temporal lobe (P < .01, respectively). Relative MD comparison revealed a significant MD elevation in FTD patients in the bilateral high superior frontal gyri, bilateral orbitofrontal gyri, and bilateral anterior temporal lobes (P < .05 after Bonferroni correction, respectively).

Conclusion

Our results demonstrated white matter MD abnormalities in FTD patients. It was suggested that the observed white matter MD abnormalities are secondary to damage in the overlying cortex.

### Ultrasound detection of white matter injury in very preterm neonates: practical implications [^fc97358c]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

Diffuse white matter injury is not well detected by cranial ultrasonography (CUS). The aim of this study was twofold: (1) to assess in very preterm neonates the predictive values of individual CUS abnormalities for white matter injury on MRI and neurological outcome; (2) to develop a strategy optimizing CUS detection of white matter injury.

Method

Very preterm neonates (n = 67; 44 males, 23 females) underwent serial CUS and single MRI. Predictive values of CUS findings for a white matter classification on MRI, individual MRI findings, and neurological outcome at 2 years corrected age were calculated. The effects of timing and frequency of CUS were evaluated.

Results

Periventricular echodensities (PVEs) predicted abnormal white matter on MRI, but absence of PVEs did not predict absence of white matter changes. Peri- and intraventricular haemorrhage (P/IVH) was highly predictive of abnormal white matter on MRI. Frequency and timing of CUS did not influence predictive values. P/IVH and abnormal ventricular size/shape were reasonably predictive of unfavourable outcome, whereas absence of CUS abnormalities predicted a favorable outcome.

Interpretation

(1) If PVEs are present, there is a significant chance of abnormal white matter on MRI. (2) Increasing frequency of CUS does not increase its diagnostic performance for white matter injury. (3) P/IVH is highly predictive of abnormal white matter on MRI and reasonably predictive of unfavourable outcome. (4) Absence of PVEs and P/IVH on CUS does not guarantee normal white matter, but predicts a favourable outcome.

### Combined Ex vivo 9.4T MRI and quantitative histopathological study in normal and pathological neocortical resections in focal epilepsy [^3010be4d]. Brain Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Further technical advances in MRI, including increased field strength, improvements in image resolution and post‐processing quantitative analysis, are likely to improve future detection of subtle FCD and mild malformations in epilepsy 22. Such advances, however, need to be validated with comparative neuropathology, still regarded as the gold standard in the diagnosis and classification of lesion‐based epilepsies 3, 22. In this study we have aimed to address this need through correlating ex vivo 9.4T qMRI measures with quantitative immunohistochemistry. We have shown significant correlations between MRI measures and myelin and neuronal density measures, even in histologically "normal" appearing white matter. Such correlations show the potential of high‐resolution MRI in the detection of FCD and mild MCD with subtle white matter pathological changes.

Established in vivo MRI hallmarks of FCD type II include thickening of the cortex, a less distinct gray–white matter interface and increased signal intensity in T2/FLAIR, with reduced or hypointense T1 signals in the white matter 5, 22, 33. It is recognized that not all confirmed FCD II show these alterations and there is evidence for improved MRI detection of FCD with the application of quantitative methods 2, 33. The pathological correlate of white matter T2 and FLAIR signal abnormalities is considered to reflect reduced myelin content 3, 6. Hypomyelination of the white matter in the region of FCD II is a common, but not essential, histological feature 23, confirmed through quantitative immunohistochemistry in more subtle cases 23, 28. The etiology of white matter hypomyelination is less well understood; it may represent a developmental deficit in local oligodendroglial maturation and myelination or reduced density of normally myelinated axons in the region of FCD 23, 28. In this current study in non‐FCD epilepsy cases, we demonstrated an inverse correlation between myelin immunolabeling and T2 over all ROI (including cortex and white matter) as well as a significant correlation when including only ROI from histologically unremarkable appearing white matter. This demonstrates the potential of 9.4T MRI to detect subtle differences in white matter myelination that could be implemented in the localization of occult FCD in patients with cryptogenic focal epilepsy as well as in the detection of other white matter myelination abnormalities recognized to occur in temporal lobe epilepsy 4, 11, 26. The present series also included a 3T "MRI occult" FCD II case, in which we confirmed a reduction in white matter myelin labeling and significant increase in T1 and T2✱ with 9.4T MRI in the dysplasia region with quantitative analysis compared with normal values.

### The relation between white-matter lesions and cognition [^5150958e]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize recent findings and developments in the field of the relation between white-matter lesions and cognition.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have provided further evidence that white-matter lesions exert a detrimental effect on cognitive profile. New magnetic-resonance techniques may help in clarifying the meaning and extent of this effect. Evidence is also increasing about lesion progression occurring over time, at least in patients with severe white-matter lesions, and this progression is one of the factors related to cognitive decline in the elderly. The need to delay or halt the progression of white-matter lesions has led to clarification of the role of some risk factors and to performance of therapeutic trials where white-matter lesions are used as a surrogate marker for the end point of small-vessel disease. In addition to cognitive effects, white-matter lesions have a role in the decline of other functional performances, and this places individuals with higher-grade lesions at increased risk of developing disability.

Summary

White-matter lesions cannot be considered as mere incidental findings, at least in patients who show severe lesions. The pathogenesis of white-matter lesions must be clarified further and strategies found to delay their progression.

### Early occurrence of cerebral white matter abnormality detected in a neonate with salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^29088781]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The development of white matter signal abnormalities on magnetic resonance brain imaging (MRI) in children and young adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia has been well documented. Existing theories regarding the development of these findings include effects of electrolyte imbalances, effects of disease-related hormone abnormalities, and non-physiologic long-term administration of corticosteroids. Many of the patients previously described were normal neurologically. We describe the case of white matter signal abnormalities in a neonate with salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia who presented with seizures during the first week of life, possibly due to a transient blood calcium disturbance. This case suggests that white matter changes are not simply the result of chronic insults and that they may not always be subclinical.

### Comparing the diagnosis of white matter injury in premature newborns with serial MR imaging and transfontanel ultrasonography findings [^abb7af70]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The accurate identification of white matter injury in premature neonates is important for counseling parents and for targeting these high risk neonates for appropriate rehabilitation services. The objective of this study was to compare the diagnosis of white matter injury detected by serial MR imaging and ultrasonography of a contemporary cohort of premature neonates.

Methods

Each of the 32 consecutively enrolled neonates was studied with MR imaging at a median postconceptional age of 31.9 weeks (range, 27.6–38.1 weeks) and again at a median postconceptional age of 36.5 weeks (range, 33.4–42.9 weeks) and with serial ultrasonography according to a clinical protocol. Because periventricular echogenicity shown on ultrasonograms evolves over time, both the highest grade of echogenicity and the grade of echogenicity shown on the last neonatal ultrasonogram were used in the analysis to determine the predictive values and correlation (Spearman's rho) of ultrasonography for predicting white matter abnormalities shown on MR images.

Results

White matter abnormalities were diagnosed in 18 (56%) neonates based on MR imaging, consisting of foci of scattered T1 hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter, and in 22 (69%) neonates based on ultrasonography, consisting of abnormal periventricular echogenicity. The severity of white matter abnormalities shown by MR imaging was not correlated with the highest grade of white matter abnormalities detected with ultrasonography (rho = 0.18, P = 0.3) or with the grade of white matter abnormalities shown on the last ultrasonogram (rho = 0.16, P = 0.4).

Conclusion

Although ultrasonography is commonly used to screen premature neonates for white matter injury, it was not a sensitive predictor of the milder spectrum of MR imaging-defined white matter abnormalities.

### Prolonged indomethacin exposure is associated with decreased white matter injury detected with magnetic resonance imaging in premature newborns at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation at birth [^89f6820f]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Newborns delivered before 28 weeks' gestation commonly have white matter lesions on MRI that are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Our objective was to determine the risk factors for MRI-detectable white matter injury in infants delivered before 28 weeks' gestation who were treated with prophylactic indomethacin.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study conducted at the intensive care nursery at University of California San Francisco Children's Hospital. Patients included 57 premature newborns between 24 and 27 (+6 days) weeks' gestation at birth (October 1998 to October 2004). We identified perinatal and neonatal risk factors associated with moderate-severe "white matter injuries" (T1 signal abnormalities > 2 mm or > 3 areas of T1 abnormality) and moderate-severe "brain abnormality" (moderate-severe white matter injuries, any degree of ventriculomegaly, or severe intraventricular hemorrhage) on MRI. Infants were studied with MRI at 31.1 weeks' postmenstrual age (median).

Results

Moderate-severe white matter injuries were detected in 12 (21%) of 53 preterm newborns, and 20 (35%) of 57 had moderate-severe brain abnormality. Prolonged indomethacin exposure was the only risk factor independently associated with a lower risk of white matter injury or brain abnormality, even when adjusting for the presence of a hemodynamically significant PDA, gestational age at birth, prenatal betamethasone, systemic infection, and days of mechanical ventilation.

Conclusions

In this observational study, a longer duration of indomethacin exposure was associated with less white matter injury in infants delivered before 28 weeks' gestation. A randomized trial of prolonged indomethacin treatment is needed to determine whether indomethacin can decrease white matter injury and neurodevelopmental abnormalities.

### Role of neuroimaging in multidisciplinary approach towards non-Alzheimer's dementia [^f098a97a]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnostic approach to patients with suspected VaD is similar to that of any other form of cognitive decline. Neuroimaging should be performed where there is history of stroke, vascular risk factors and clinical features atypical of AD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considerably superior in sensitivity and specificity in detecting ischemic lesions compared to computed tomography (CT); however, radiological criteria are not adequate enough in differentiating between post-stroke patients with and without dementia. Microangiopathic disease is the condition most commonly associated with vascular dementia and has non-specific imaging features. Confluent hypodensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter (Fig. 1) with presence of cortical and lacunar infarcts are seen on CT. Likewise, MRI demonstrates confluent signal changes in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, deep grey nuclei and brain stem (Fig. 1). Increasing white matter lesion burden on serial MRI scans has been associated with accelerated cognitive decline in several studies. Acute infarcts typically demonstrate T2W/FLAIR hyperintensity with diffusion restriction, whereas chronic infarcts exhibit volume loss with facilitated diffusion. GRE/SWI (Gradient Echo/Susceptibility Weighted Imaging) images are very sensitive in detecting microhaemorrhages noted in microangiopathic disease and other vascular conditions such as CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis and amyloid angiopathy. In summary, there are no uniform diagnostic criteria; however, a combination of clinical and neuropsychological assessment with neuroimaging inputs may help in the diagnosis and management of patients with VaD.

### Applications of diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor MRI to white matter diseases-a review [^bee907e8]. NMR in Biomedicine (2002). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the current applications of diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor MRI in diseases of the brain white matter. The contribution that diffusion-weighted imaging has made to our understanding of white matter diseases is critically appraised. The quantitative nature of diffusion MRI is one of its major attractions; however, this is offset by the more advanced hardware required to collect diffusion-weighted images reliably, and the more complex processing to produce quantitative parametric diffusion images. With the now common availability of scanners equipped to perform echo-planar imaging, the acquisition of diffusion tensor images is sure to become more widespread and routine.

### Novel loss-of-function variants expand ABCC9-related intellectual disability and myopathy syndrome [^a588e3f1]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparison of brain MRI findings

Brain abnormalities observed in previous ABCC9 subjects consisted of white matter signal alterations localized in the centrum semiovale or in the periventricular regions associated with brain calcifications in one case. Similar findings were observed in Patients 1–1, 3–1, 5–1, 6–1 and 6–2 from our cohort. Of note, we also found brain calcifications in two patients; in the frontal periventricular white matter and right basal ganglia in one subject (Patient 3–1) and in both the white and grey matter in another subject (Patient 6–1). In addition, white matter cavitations were detected in the frontal regions in Patient 1–1.

White matter changes in these patients frequently resemble periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). PVL is often the end-stage of white matter damage in preterm infants, with a likely underlying inflammatory mechanism, however, recent evidence demonstrates that PVL-like features may present in some genetic conditions in the absence of perinatal risk factors. This neuroradiological pattern has been associated with COL4A1 / A2, AMPD2, TBCK and NSD1 variants, as well as dehydrogenase deficiency and incontinentia pigmentii.PVL has also been found in subjects with WWOX, SPATA5L1, WIPI2 and EZH2 variants. Therefore, rather than a specific entity, PVL might represent a radiological sign of white matter involvement with specific prenatal timing and mechanisms, that in certain clinical scenarios may help with diagnosis of a genetic condition. Notably, in subjects with developmental delay, intellectual disability and fatigability (Table 2) the presence of PVL-like changes associated with progressive microcephaly, temporal white matter involvement and scattered calcifications should raise the suspicion of an ABCC9 -related disorder.

We detected additional novel brain abnormalities in some subjects in line with a white matter involvement; hypoplasia or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum was identified in five patients (Patients 1–1, 2–1, 2–2, 3–1 and 5–1). Thinning of the corpus callosum was mainly related to the white matter volume reduction and callosal agenesis is likely related to a primary white matter developmental disorder. Bilateral polymicrogyria was detected in Patient 2–2. These neuroradiological manifestations expand the spectrum of brain MRI abnormalities in ABCC9 patients, suggesting that white matter is primarily involved in these individuals with a PVL-like pattern, but cerebral malformations may occasionally be part of the spectrum.

### Head ultrasound, CT or MRI? The choice of neuroimaging in the assessment of infants with congenital cytomegalovirus infection [^13df8ca6]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital CMV (cCMV) infection is the most common cause of intrauterine viral infection. Affecting approximately 1 in 150 live births, it represents a major cause of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and neurodevelopmental delay among children worldwide. Despite growing interest in universal screening for congenital CMV infection (cCMV), a paucity of data exists regarding the optimal imaging modalities to identify central nervous system (CNS) involvement. While studies have examined the value of prenatal neuroimaging for infants with cCMV, a standard of care for postnatal imaging of the CNS of children evaluated for cCMV has not been established. A recent expert consensus recommended antiviral treatment for infants with evidence of CNS disease, but did not provide guidance regarding preferred modalities to identify CNS abnormalities. Therefore, current practices vary according to center-based protocols or physician expertise, and may include head ultrasound (US), brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or combinations thereof.

With a growing interest in cCMV screening programs, a better understanding of the role of different neuroimaging modalities is necessary, given that abnormal CNS findings represent a criteria for treatment. While CT is most sensitive at detecting calcifications, the associated radiation exposure has led many to favor US as the primary neuroimaging modality, supported by recent improvements in ultrasound technology and increased ability to detect calcifications. However, MRI may be better at detecting white matter changes, gyration abnormalities and cerebellar hypoplasia. At present, there is no clear preferred imaging modality, and local accessibility, cost-effectiveness and radiation exposure are factors taken under consideration by individual physicians. In response, the primary objective of this study was to assess the concordance between US and MRI in identifying neurological abnormalities in infants with cCMV infection, and to determine whether the addition of advanced neuroimaging after US had an impact on clinical management.

### Assessment of the depiction of superficial white matter using ultra-high-resolution diffusion MRI [^11edb5bc]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography (Basser et al.) is an advanced imaging technique that can help improve our understanding of the SWM in health and disease (Guevara et al.). Tractography is a computational process that can estimate the anatomical trajectories of the white matter fiber pathways from dMRI data (Basser et al; Zhang, Daducci, et al.). Currently, dMRI tractography is the only technique that allows in vivo, noninvasive mapping of the human brain's white matter connections. Following the success of tractography in studying DWM connections, there has been a recent surge of interest in utilizing tractography in SWM mapping. Many studies have employed tractography to investigate the SWM in brain diseases, demonstrating its potential to reveal focal‐ and network‐level abnormalities of the brain (d'Albis et al; Ji et al; Malykhin et al; Reginold et al; Zhang, Xue, et al.). However, multiple challenges have prevented the comprehensive mapping of the SWM of the human brain.

### Feasibility of diffusion-tensor and correlated diffusion imaging for studying white-matter microstructural abnormalities: application in COVID-19 [^a2dbf9b5]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, we also uncovered previously unseen regions of significantly higher log(CDI) value in patients, which suggests more restricted diffusion. As shown in Figure 6, multi‐shell data are not necessary for uncovering this effect, either. In fact, the use of the b = 2100 s/mm 2 shell alone yielded the greatest CDI sensitivity to this effect. As the highest b ‐value is sensitive to the slowest diffusion, and as CDI is boosted by restricted diffusion, this finding may indicate that the greater log(CDI) in patients is preferentially reflecting a restriction of the slowest‐moving water molecules. Such molecules could be intracellular or myelinated water, and their restriction could reflect cytotoxic intracellular edema, which in turn can be caused by hypoxic insults in COVID‐19 (van den Enden et al.). As to why such effects are only seen in the cerebellum, this region consistently displays neuropathological abnormalities including immune cell infiltration which may be indicative of susceptible vasculature or increased viral entry (Matschke et al.). Furthermore, while in the forebrain, fibrinogen staining is localized around the damaged vessels; in the cerebellum, fibrinogen staining is evident at greater distances from the vessels (Lee et al.). Despite the OB being the most probable site of entry for COVID‐19, pathological brain findings are consistently most prominent in the cerebellum. Immune cell infiltration, widespread fibrinogen leakage, and debris accumulation may be responsible for the restricted diffusion identified in this investigation.

### Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^c93d5dbd]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Sport-related concussion (SRC) neuroimaging — MRI role and emerging modalities: MRI is superior to CT in detecting cerebral contusion, petechial hemorrhage, and white matter injury and is believed to be the test of choice if neuroimaging is needed outside of the emergency period; patients who are clinically worsening or not improving over time may benefit from MRI to assess for other structural problems. In pediatric SRC with persistent symptoms, only 0.5% had MRI findings compatible with traumatic injury, whereas another 14.3% had abnormal findings unrelated to trauma, with the majority benign. Emerging modalities (diffusion tensor imaging with tractography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional MRI, positron emission tomography, and single-photon emission CT) hold promise, but further research is needed before they can be recommended for clinical care, and currently they are best used for research purposes to expand knowledge and validate management strategies.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) — imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing: Typical computed tomography (CT) abnormalities include single or multiple hypodense, non-enhancing cerebral white matter lesions; MRI may be more sensitive for detecting changes in the brain associated with PML and may be positive before JC virus (JCV) DNA is detected in CSF; MRI shows white matter lesions of low T1 signal intensity and high proton density on T2-weighted images with absence of edema or mass effect, and post-contrast enhancement is unusual and, when present, usually is sparse with a thin or reticulated appearance; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of JCV DNA in CSF may obviate the need for brain biopsy, with nested JCV DNA PCR on CSF reported as highly sensitive (90%–100%) and specific (92%–100%) for PML in adults, although in children similar performance characteristics are anticipated but not proven; false-negative CSF PCR tests occur and PML may still be diagnosed by brain biopsy, and measurement of JCV DNA levels in CSF samples can be a useful virologic marker for managing PML in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).

White matter hyperintensities — definition and intensity criteria state that a white matter hyperintensity (WMH) is an area of increased signal intensity of cerebral white matter on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI or an area of hypodensity on CT; depending on MRI parameters, WMHs may appear isointense or hypointense on T1, but they should not be as hypointense as cerebrospinal fluid, in which case the lesion should instead be classified as an infarct if presumed vascular.

### Prevention of stroke in patients with silent cerebrovascular disease: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^8e753a03]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

White matter hyperintensities — WMH reporting may be the most variable of all the manifestations of silent cerebrovascular disease, and many synonyms for WMH such as leukoaraiosis, white matter changes, and small vessel ischemic disease have entered the literature. WMHs become ubiquitous with advanced age, and although clinical reports may omit them when expected for age, there is no clear scientific evidence for a threshold below which WMH can be considered entirely benign, and there is no uniform approach to describing their extent. The STRIVE group recommends adoption of the term T2 WMHs, or CT white matter hypodensity, of presumed vascular origin as a consensus term, and several rapid, easy-to-use visual rating scales have been developed and validated against quantitative volumetric assessments to allow standardized reporting; probably the quickest to apply and among the best validated is the Fazekas scale.

### Leukodystrophies in children: diagnosis, care, and treatment [^7a996766]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Leukodystrophies — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as gold standard and interpretation caveats: An MRI of the brain is the gold standard investigation in a patient with a suspected leukodystrophy or leukoencephalopathy, and MRI is preferable to CT for visualizing abnormal signal and because it involves less radiation exposure; key features on MRI include the presence of contrast enhancement, the presence of cysts, calcifications, or more subtle structural abnormalities, and the predominant location, confluent versus multifocal pattern, and signal changes including hypomyelination versus high T2 signal abnormality and the relative T1 signal hyper- or hypointensity are primary discriminating characteristics; although MRI algorithms are helpful for diagnosis, there are limitations on their sensitivity and specificity, and they require skilled radiologic interpretation and experience; in a child younger than 1 year with possible hypomyelination, a follow-up MRI of the brain after 24 months, or serial MRIs every 6 to 12 months, is recommended to establish the diagnosis of hypomyelination; overall, the MRI findings should be interpreted in concert with the findings of the clinical history and physical examination.

### Multimodality imaging of cortical and white matter abnormalities in Sturge-Weber syndrome [^31d4661d]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Impaired cortical venous outflow and abnormal deep venous collaterals are common in Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), but their relation to brain metabolism and function is poorly understood. In this study, advanced MR imaging techniques, such as susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), were applied in conjunction with positron-emission tomography (PET), to assess cortical and white matter structural abnormalities and their relation to cortical glucose metabolism and cognitive functions in children with unilateral SWS.

Materials and Methods

Thirteen children (age, 1.5–10.3 years) with unilateral SWS underwent MR imaging with SWI and DTI, glucose metabolism PET, and comprehensive neuropsychologic assessment prospectively. The MR imaging and PET images were coregistered and cortical regions showing decreased glucose metabolism were compared with locations of SWI signal intensity abnormalities, changes in white matter water diffusion, and cognitive functions.

Results

SWI detected both cortical abnormalities (n = 8) and deep transmedullary veins (n = 9), including those in young children with no cortical SWI signal intensity changes. These veins were often located under cortex adjacent to hypometabolic regions. DTI showed abnormal water diffusion both under hypometabolic cortex and in adjacent white matter with collateral veins. Cognitive dysfunction was associated with abnormal water diffusion in the posterior white matter.

Conclusions

Transmedullary venous collaterals can be detected early by SWI and persist in white matter adjacent to damaged cortex in children with SWS. Microstructural white matter damage extends beyond cortical abnormalities and may contribute to cognitive impairment. SWI and DTI can be incorporated into clinical MR imaging acquisitions to objectively assess microstructural abnormalities at different stages of SWS.

### Neuroimaging in leukodystrophies [^7e5e24ff]. Journal of Child Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

The application of techniques based on in vivo magnetic resonance to the study of leukodystrophies is evaluated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the most important neuroimaging modality for patients with leukodystrophies, has proven invaluable for the detection of the extent and etiology of white-matter involvement, diagnosis, and monitoring of disease progression. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which can detect several brain metabolites, including those related to axonal function and myelination, can provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information and, in some cases, allows a rare insight into the biochemical pathology of leukodystrophies. The potential of other advanced magnetic resonance techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging, magnetization transfer contrast, and molecular imaging, is also discussed. In the future, anatomic and physiologic magnetic resonance techniques are expected to be integrated into a single examination that will provide a detailed characterization of white-matter diseases in children.

### Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging to rule out comorbid pathology in the assessment of Alzheimer's disease dementia: findings from the Ontario neurodegenerative disease research initiative (ONDRI) study and clinical trials over the past 10 years [^0dff6803]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The current diagnostic guidelines mention consideration of cerebrovascular disease, "extensive infarcts or severe white matter hyperintensity burden" (p. 265–266), and use of structural MRI as a marker of neuronal injury when determining diagnosis. However, in practice and likely even in clinical trials, AD or MCI patients are often diagnosed using clinical criteria and brain computed tomography (CT) scans. CT is less sensitive to small vessel disease markers such as microbleeds, perivascular spaces, small lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, and micro-infarcts. In addition, the presence of lobar microbleeds may suggest cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These small vessel markers are predictive of future dementia risk (as well as stroke and mortality risks) and represent potentially treatable or preventable targets that could reduce dementia expression. Although there are currently few studies comparing the accuracy of CT and MRI to detect a vascular component to dementia, Beynon et al. found greater accuracy of MRI compared to CT for lacunar infarcts, non-lacunar infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, periventricular hyperintensities, basal ganglia hyperintensities, and global assessment (presence of two or more findings). CT may also be less sensitive to vascular changes in the hippocampus and thalamus than MRI, yet small lacunes in these areas may contribute to overall cognitive decline in the absence of a clear step-wise progression.

### Routine neuroimaging of the preterm brain [^523b3b06]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Preterm IVH and periventricular white matter injury — gestational age gradients, cohort rates, and risk factors are detailed. A multicenter database "demonstrated an overall 24.6% incidence of IVH and an 8.1% rate of severe IVH, defined as grade III or IV among more than 50 000 VLBW infants". In another survey, "63% of infants born at 22 to 23 6/7 weeks' gestation had IVH, with 36% demonstrating severe IVH", decreasing to "14% of infants whose gestational age at birth was 30 to 31 6/7 weeks having any IVH and 1.4% having a severe grade". Among extremely preterm infants, "no significant difference in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months" was found between those "with and without these low-grade hemorrhages" in a study "of 1472 infants born at less than 27 weeks' gestational age". For white matter injury, "Most cystic PVL occurs in infants born between 26 and 30 weeks' gestational age", while "Periventricular hemorrhagic infarcts (PVHIs)… occur mainly in infants born at < 26 weeks' gestation and occur infrequently in infants born beyond 30 weeks' gestation". Developmentally, the germinal matrix "decreases in size from 2.5 mm in the 24-week preterm infant to involution at about 36 weeks' gestational age", and "the more moderate and late preterm infants (those born between 32 and 36 6/7 weeks' gestation) are at less risk for significant intracranial injury". In moderately preterm infants "born between 29 and 33 weeks' gestation, 60% of a cohort of 7021 infants underwent cranial imaging, and 15% of these 4184 infants had ultrasonographic abnormalities", with rates of "severe IVH and cystic PVL" of "1.7% and 2.6%, respectively". Risk factors "such as abnormal neurologic examination… increased the chance of detecting an abnormality by fourfold" in "infants born at 33 to 36 weeks' gestational age", and in a similar cohort "infants born at > 30 weeks' gestation" with significant abnormalities typically had "clinically significant events… which warranted the cranial ultrasonographic investigations".

### A systematic review of neuroimaging for cerebral palsy [^5b7b6c65]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Neurology now recommends that all cases of cerebral palsy of unknown origin undergo neuroimaging. Controversy surrounds this recommendation because of concerns about the adequacy of the supporting evidence. This article reviews the evidence provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging studies in cerebral palsy and discusses the potential benefits of imaging, techniques in current use, and future directions, with a focus on improving etiologic understanding. Most (83%) children with cerebral palsy have abnormal neuroradiological findings, with white matter damage the most common abnormality. Combined gray and white matter abnormalities are more common among children with hemiplegia; isolated white matter abnormalities are more common with bilateral spasticity or athetosis, and with ataxia; isolated gray matter damage is the least common finding. About 10% of cerebral palsy is attributable to brain malformations, and 17% of cerebral palsy cases have no abnormality detectable by conventional MR or CT imaging. Although neuroimaging studies have increased our understanding of the abnormalities in brain development in cerebral palsy, they are less informative than they might be because of 4 common problems: (1) inappropriate assignment of etiology to morphologic findings, (2) inconsistent descriptions of radiologic findings, (3) uncertain relationship of pathologic findings to brain insult timing estimates, and (4) study designs that are not based on generalizable samples. Neuroimaging is not necessarily required for diagnosis of cerebral palsy because the disorder is based on clinical findings. The principal contribution of imaging is to the understanding of etiology and pathogenesis, including ruling in or out conditions that may have implications for genetic counseling, such as malformations. In the future, as more sophisticated imaging procedures are applied to cerebral palsy, specific morphologic findings may be linked to etiologic events or exposures, thus leading to potential pathways for prevention.

### Assessment of white matter damage in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis using quantitative diffusion tensor MR imaging [^e43ca0f6]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare progressive degenerative disease, is caused by persistent infection with a defective measles virus. The correlation between the clinical staging and MR imaging is usually poor. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the early detection of white matter damage in SSPE in the presence of normal findings on conventional imaging.

Methods

DTI was performed in 21 patients in stage II SSPE and 10 age/sex-matched healthy controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values were calculated in the periventricular white matter, corpus callosum, and posterior limb of the internal capsule in patients with normal and abnormal findings on conventional imaging as well as healthy controls.

Results

The patients were grouped into those with normal (n = 11) and abnormal (n = 10) findings on conventional imaging for the purpose of quantitative DTI analysis. Abnormal- and normal-appearing white matter on T2-weighted images showed significantly decreased FA values in all the regions compared with those in healthy controls. MD values were significantly increased in the periventricular white matter region of the frontal and parietooccipital lobe in patients with normal as well as abnormal findings on conventional imaging compared with those in healthy controls.

Conclusion

DTI detects early white matter abnormalities that may have significant therapeutic implication, even in the presence of normal findings on conventional imaging, in patients with SSPE.

### Free water determines diffusion alterations and clinical status in cerebral small vessel disease [^a4f7162d]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diffusion tensor imaging detects early tissue alterations in Alzheimer's disease and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). However, the origin of diffusion alterations in SVD is largely unknown.

Methods

To gain further insight, we applied free water (FW) imaging to patients with genetically defined SVD (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy [CADASIL], n = 57), sporadic SVD (n = 444), and healthy controls (n = 28). We modeled freely diffusing water in the extracellular space (FW) and measures reflecting fiber structure (tissue compartment). We tested associations between these measures and clinical status (processing speed and disability).

Results

Diffusion alterations in SVD were mostly driven by increased FW and less by tissue compartment alterations. Among imaging markers, FW showed the strongest association with clinical status (R 2 up to 34%, P < .0001). Findings were consistent across patients with CADASIL and sporadic SVD.

Discussion

Diffusion alterations and clinical status in SVD are largely determined by extracellular fluid increase rather than alterations of white matter fiber organization.

Suspected congenital muscular dystrophy — brain and muscle imaging findings for subtype prediction: Abnormal findings on brain imaging studies can predict the subtype‑specific diagnosis in some cases, especially in merosinopathy (white matter abnormalities) and some dystroglycanopathies (polymicrogyria, white matter lesions, pontine hypoplasia, and subcortical cerebellar cysts). Skeletal muscle imaging in children with suspected CMD using MRI, ultrasound, and CT often demonstrates signal abnormalities that suggest subtype‑specific diagnoses, and this has been most extensively documented in CMD subtypes associated with rigidity of the spine, such as collagenopathies and SEPN1‑related myopathy.

Silent cerebrovascular disease — conclusions and screening implications: Infarcts and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are strongly tied to future symptomatic stroke, with a 2- to 3-fold increase in relative risk even after accounting for vascular risk factors, but there are no prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically for this population; therefore formal recommendations are not provided and population screening is not justified. Silent brain infarcts are commonly found incidentally, with > 1.5 million brain scans annually for headache alone in the United States likely to reveal such findings.

Imaging appearance of cortical silent brain infarct and white matter lesions — key sequence findings are illustrated: For cortical silent brain infarct, "a silent cortical infarct (arrow) is visible as a small region of T2 hyperintensity on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (B)… On T1-weighted inversion-recovery spoiled gradient-recalled echo imaging (C), the infarct appears hypointense, interrupting the cortical ribbon". For white matter lesions of presumed vascular origin, on CT "the abnormalities appear as white matter hypodensities", whereas on MRI "the abnormalities appear as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2-weighted sequences, including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (B)", and on T1-weighted imaging "some of the WMH appears mildly to moderately hypointense but without the very hypointense cerebrospinal fluid–like signal indicative of cavitation".

### White matter integrity on fractional anisotropy maps in encephalopathic neonates post hypothermia therapy with normal-appearing MR imaging [^28bbc261]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is a clinically defined neurological syndrome commonly caused by ischemia.

Objective

We investigated white matter integrity in children with NE using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and examined the hypothesis that white matter insults not visible on conventional MRI may have abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) on DTI.

Materials and Methods

DTI was performed on 36 term encephalopathic neonates who had hypothermia therapy. Of these, 12 neonates had normal conventional MRI findings (NNE) and 24 neonates had abnormal MRI findings (ANE). Twelve term-equivalent premature neonates with normal clinical neuroimaging and neurological function served as the control group.

Results

We found significant reductions in measured FA in white matter in the ANE neonates compared to the control group. There were, however, no significant differences in measured FA in white matter between the NNE and the control group.

Conclusion

We did not find white matter changes detectable by DTI in encephalopathic neonates post hypothermia with normal conventional MRI findings. Further studies would be required to determine whether this unexpected finding is a direct result of neuroprotective effects of hypothermia, or more sophisticated measures of FA are required to detect subtle white matter injury.

### Imaging manifestations of the leukodystrophies, inherited disorders of white matter [^21ab4a79]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The leukodystrophies are a diverse set of inherited white matter disorders and are uncommonly encountered by radiologists in everyday practice. As a result, it is challenging to recognize these disorders and to provide a useful differential for the referring physician. In this article, leukodystrophies are reviewed from the perspective of 4 imaging patterns: global myelination delay, periventricular/deep white matter predominant, subcortical white matter predominant, and mixed white/gray matter involvement patterns. Special emphasis is placed on pattern recognition and unusual combinations of findings that may suggest a specific diagnosis.

### Prevention of stroke in patients with silent cerebrovascular disease: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^eb330c84]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Silent cerebrovascular disease imaging — current MRI reliability and research priorities are outlined: "Except for microbleeds, there has been very little work on how MRI scanner field strength, scan resolution, and scan parameters affect the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of silent cerebrovascular disease". "Generally, moderate to good reliability is reported for assessments of silent brain infarcts, microbleeds, and WMHs". The statement notes that "More research is needed to better understand the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of reporting findings of silent cerebrovascular disease in clinical practice", and that "Future studies should examine the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability for detecting silent brain infarcts and for accurately assessing WMH volume". It adds that investigational MRI techniques "may improve the diagnosis of silent cerebrovascular disease", including assessments of "perfusion, vascular reactivity, brain white matter connectivity, atrophy, and others", and that such information "will be needed to better justify MRI use in practice settings where access to MRI is more limited than access to CT".

In addition to studying the effects of hydrocephalus, NODDI may be beneficial for interpreting short and long-term white matter abnormalities due to radiotherapy. For example, the medulloblastoma patient PF050 was treated with surgical resection, CSI with a posterior fossa boost, and chemotherapy. While the TBSS analysis of the ODI parameter originally showed evidence of increased white matter coherence (decreased ODI) in PVWM prior to surgery, at the 3-month follow-up scan there was evidence of widespread decreased coherence (increased ODI) across all white matter tracts. This time point corresponded to the end of radiotherapy. Decreased coherence in white matter can indicate axonal disorganization or increased extra-axonal space. This is consistent with early radiotherapy effects, such as inflammation, which is expected to contribute to demyelination over time caused by the apoptosis of oligodendrocytes. At the 6-month follow-up scan (3 months after treatment), the TBSS analysis of ODI returned to a similar pattern as the presurgical analysis (ie, decreased dispersion at PVWM). There was also new evidence of white matter abnormalities in the DTI analysis at this time point, indicated by decreased MD in the left hemisphere white matter tracts (Figure S11). These patterns differed from those observed in a high-grade glioma patient (PF018) who received focal radiotherapy, suggesting that radiation dose and field size may influence the extent and nature of white matter changes detected by DTI and NODDI. In PF018, there was evidence of worsening white matter injury after radiotherapy, with decreased FA affecting 1.2% of the white matter skeleton presurgery and expanding to 10.8% post-treatment. However, unlike in PF050, there were no detectable changes in diffusivity or NODDI parameters.

### A pattern approach to focal white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging [^c9a1b583]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Evaluation of focal white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging in any age group is always challenging because the cause of these hyperintensities varies extensively. Understanding the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and associated imaging findings can allow the radiologist to limit the differential diagnosis. A specific imaging approach including age, pattern of distribution, signal characteristics on various sequences, enhancement pattern, and other ancillary findings helps to identify a correct cause for these hyperintensities. This article provides a pattern approach to differentiate various common and a few uncommon diseases presenting as focal white matter hyperintensities.

### Rapid, low-cost MR imaging protocol to document central nervous system and sinus abnormalities prior to pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^84aeadd3]. Pediatric Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing bone marrow transplant (BMT) are at risk for infectious complications, including those of the sinus. Central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities related to the chemotherapy or radiation that the patient received for the treatment of underlying malignancy or to transplant-related effects are also commonly seen. The only effective way to differentiate pre- and post-transplant causes is to have a baseline evaluation prior to the admission for transplant. The current method used to evaluate these patients is head CT. However, CT is not accurate to demonstrate CNS abnormalities and exposes the patient to radiation. MRI, despite better sensitivity for white matter abnormalities, has not been routinely used because of the higher cost and longer duration of the exam. Therefore, we designed a fast, low-cost and radiation-free MRI-based protocol to simultaneously evaluate sinus and brain abnormalities.

### Opposing white matter microstructure abnormalities in 22q11.2 deletion and duplication carriers [^09b0cca5]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

FA analyses

An F -test revealed a significant group effect on FA in 54% of the WM skeleton. Post hoc t tests demonstrated that 22q-del had significantly higher FA than HC in 41% of the WM skeleton, and 22q-dup had significantly lower FA than HC in 37% of the WM skeleton. Further, 22q-del displayed significantly higher FA than 22q-dup in 66% of the WM skeleton (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Group comparisons between 22q11.2 deletion carriers (22q-del) and healthy controls (HC) (left), 22q11.2 duplication carriers (22q-dup) and HC (middle), and 22q-del and 22q-dup.

Figure 1 displays the results from Tract-Based Spatial Statistics and Randomize. The white matter skeleton (thresholded at fractional anisotropy (FA) > 0.25) is shown in green on top of the average image of all registered FA images. Voxels that demonstrated significant group differences are thickened to increase visibility. The 22q-del group compared with the HC group (left) showed higher fractional anisotropy (FA; significant regions highlighted in orange), which remained higher in FA of the tissue (FA T) values (in orange) after accounting for the effect of extracellular free-water (FW). 22q-del also showed lower FW values than HC (in green) and higher fractions of both the primary (F1) and secondary (F2) fiber populations (in orange), and lower fractional volume of the isotropic compartment F iso (in green). In contrast, 22q-dup compared with HC (middle) presented with lower FA values (in red), as well as lower FA T (in red), higher FW values (in blue), lower fractions of the primary and secondary fiber populations (F1, F2, in red) and higher F iso (in blue). A direct comparison between 22q-del and 22q-dup is provided on the right, showing widespread group differences. 22q-del displayed higher FA/FA T /F1/F2 (in orange) and lower FW/F iso (in green). Please note that TBSS provides a voxel-wise rather than tract-specific output. The voxels that demonstrate group differences are widespread and located in most of the main fiber tracts. For a tract-by-tract comparison of FA T and FW between groups, please see Supplementary Table 1.

### Brain MRI findings in newborns with congenital cytomegalovirus infection: results from a large cohort study [^4fb206b6]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the spectrum and frequency of abnormalities on brain MRI in a large cohort of live newborns with congenital CMV (cCMV) infection.

Methods

Institutional review board approval and informed consent for neonatal MRI and data collection were obtained. Between January 2010 and January 2018, brain MRI was performed in 196 live newborns diagnosed with cCMV. Images were independently reviewed by 2 pediatric radiologists, blinded to clinical data.

Results

cCMV infection was clinically symptomatic in 26/191 newborns (13.6%). Brain MRI showed abnormalities in 76/196 patients (38.8%). MRI was abnormal in 20/26 clinically symptomatic patients (76.9%): 76.9% showed white matter lesions, 61.5% subependymal cysts, 46.2% ventriculomegaly, 26.9% ventricular adhesions, 26.9% gyral abnormalities, 24.0% calcifications, 15.4% cerebellar anomalies. MRI was abnormal in 55/165 (33.3%) clinically asymptomatic patients: 30.9% had white matter lesions, 15.8% subependymal cysts, 4.2% ventriculomegaly, 2.4% ventricular adhesions, 1.2% gyral abnormalities, 0.6% calcifications, none had cerebellar anomalies. Concomitant brain lesions were seen in all patients with gyral abnormalities, cerebellar anomalies, and calcifications and nearly all patients with subependymal cysts and ventriculomegaly. In all but 4 patients with other detected brain lesions, white matter abnormalities were simultaneously present. In 33/74 patients (45.2%), white matter lesions were seen as a sole abnormality.

Conclusion

White matter lesions were the most common detected abnormality on brain MRI in newborns with congenital CMV. Since brain abnormalities were seen in more than 30% of clinically asymptomatic and 75% of clinically symptomatic newborns, MRI should be advised in all newborns diagnosed with cCMV.

Key Points

- Neonatal brain MRI showed abnormalities in more than 30% of clinically asymptomatic and 75% of symptomatic newborns with congenital cytomegalovirus infection.
- White matter lesions were by far the most common detected abnormality, followed by subependymal cysts and ventricular dilatation.
- Lesions in cCMV were often multiple, with many patients showing concomitant lesions.

### White matter hyperintensities induce distal deficits in the connected fibers [^e1637d8f]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

White matter hyperintensities (WMH), typical radiological markers of age‐related cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), are commonly observed in T 2 ‐weighted or fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain MRI images of elderly individuals (DeCarli et al. 2005; Wardlaw et al. 2013). The global WMH burden has been found to be associated with whole‐brain atrophy, brain structural network efficiency, and cognitive decline (Banerjee et al. 2018; Maniega et al. 2015; Wardlaw, Smith, & Dichgans, 2019).

Studies have suggested that WMH may represent a wide range of degenerations, including demyelination, axonal loss, gliosis (Wardlaw et al. 2019) and impaired blood–brain barrier (BBB) (Black, Gao, & Bilbao, 2009). The deficits may intrude into the penumbra, normal‐appearing white matter (NAWM) nearby, and affect the white matter (WM) infrastructure (Maillard et al. 2014) and cerebral blood flow (Promjunyakul et al. 2016). Moreover, the degenerative penumbra is larger in WMH‐intersecting WM tracts than in nearby WMH‐nonintersecting tracts (Munoz Maniega et al. 2019; Reginold et al. 2016; Reginold et al. 2018), suggesting that degenerations propagate along WM tracts. Thus, we seek to investigate whether WMH‐related defects propagate to remote areas.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has provided a noninvasive approach to investigate early changes in WM microstructure (Alexander, Lee, Lazar, & Field, 2007). Tractography methods have been proposed and provide new insight into brain connectivity structure (Schilling et al. 2019). In the present study, automated quantitative tractography was used to reconstruct the major WM fiber tracts, and the diffusion characteristics (fractional anisotropy, FA; mean diffusivity, MD) were extracted. We attempted to investigate the relationship between tract‐specific WMH burden and microstructural integrity of the distal tracts in community‐dwelling elderly individuals. In addition, we evaluated the impact of the impaired distal tracts on cognitive impairment. We hypothesized that the effect of WMH on the microstructural integrity of WM tracts might propagate along tracts to distal regions beyond the penumbra.

### Does diffusion MRI tell us anything about the white matter? An overview of methods and pitfalls [^795158a2]. Schizophrenia Research (2015). Low credibility.

One key pitfall in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) clinical neuroimaging research is the challenge of understanding and interpreting the results of a complex analysis pipeline. The sophisticated algorithms employed by the analysis software, combined with the relatively non-specific nature of many diffusion measurements, lead to challenges in interpretation of the results. This paper is aimed at an intended audience of clinical researchers who are learning about dMRI or trying to interpret dMRI results, and who may be wondering "Does dMRI tell us anything about the white matter?" We present a critical review of dMRI methods and measures used in clinical neuroimaging research, focusing on the most commonly used analysis methods and the most commonly reported measures. We describe important pitfalls in every section, and provide extensive references for the reader interested in more detail.

### In vivo evidence of microstructural hypo-connectivity of brain white matter in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^8a708318]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Conventional DT-MRI metrics are sensitive to a vast array of biophysical processes in tissue microstructure, but specificity is distinctly lacking. This limitation can now be overcome by exploiting unusually high diffusion-weightings that have only recently become available through the development of customized ultra-strong MRI gradients for human neuroimaging. At such strong diffusion weightings (i.e. high b -values), the dMRI signal is dominated by contributions from water within cellular compartments such as axonal or glial processes. Ultrastrong gradients are advancing the development of biophysical models of diffusion in tissue that hold the promise of quantifying important cellular features such as axonal diameters, densities and orientational dispersion in vivo.

Here, we present an in-depth characterization of white matter microstructure in both typically-developing and 22q11.2DS participants using ultra-strong gradients and an extensive multishell dMRI acquisition, including b -values up to 6000 s/mm 2. By so doing, we conducted a multiparametric analysis to gain novel insights into the microstructural properties underlying disrupted axonal morphology, to better describe previous observations of white matter hypo-connectivity in 22q11.2DS. The findings provide insight into 1) disentangling microstructural connectivity differences in brain white matter in 22q11.2DS versus typical developing participants, and 2) establishing the sensitivity and specificity of in vivo dMRI to underlying biophysical signatures of hypo-connectivity in white matter.

### Gestational hypoxia induces white matter damage in neonatal rats: a new model of periventricular leukomalacia [^60ab4ae0]. Brain Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

In the premature infant, periventricular leukomalacia, usually related to hypoxicischemic white matter damage, is the main cause of neurological impairment. We hypothesized that protracted prenatal hypoxia might induce white matter damage during the perinatal period. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were placed in a chamber supplied with hypoxic gas (10% O2-90% N2) from embryonic day 5 (E5) to E20. Neonatal rat brains were investigated by histology, immunocytochemistry, western blotting, in situ hybridization, DNA fragmentation analysis, and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Body weight of pups subjected to prenatal hypoxia was 10 to 30% lower from P0 to P14 than in controls. Specific white matter cysts were detected between P0 and P7 in pups subjected to prenatal hypoxia, in addition to abnormal extra-cellular matrix, increased lipid peroxidation, white matter cell death detected by TUNEL, and increased activated macrophage counts in white matter. Subsequently, gliotic scars and delayed myelination primarily involving immature oligodendrocytes were seen. In vivo MRI with T1, T2, and diffusion sequences disclosed similar findings immediately after birth, showing strong correlations with histological abnormalities. We speculate that protracted prenatal hypoxia in rat induces white matter damage occurring through local inflammatory response and oxidative stress linked to re-oxygenation during the perinatal period.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns in leukodystrophies and mimics — illustrative figure — include a T2 image of normal brain; a T2 MRI image of VWM disease with hypodense (dark color) white matter and abnormal hyperintense (bright) white matter; a T2 image of MLD with hyperintense white matter; a T2 image of a hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, PMD, with relative paucity of myelin; and a T2 image of multiple sclerosis with scattered areas of hyperintense signal. A CT image of VWM disease shows abnormal signal in white matter but is much easier to see on MRI.

### Lecanemab: appropriate use recommendations [^c70879f9]. The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). High credibility.

Lecanemab appropriate use — MRI screening and exclusion criteria — non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with susceptibility sequences and diffusion-weighted imaging, preferably on a 3T magnet, should be obtained to determine candidacy; a pre-existing MRI with these sequences obtained within 12 months prior to therapy initiation can be used. CLARITY AD MRI-based exclusions included any central nervous system (CNS) macrohemorrhage > 10 mm in diameter, > 4 microhemorrhages (< 10 mm in diameter), superficial siderosis, brain vasogenic edema, significant white matter hyperintensities, multiple lacunar strokes, or any cerebral stroke involving a major vascular territory, and additional exclusions such as cerebral contusion, encephalomalacia, brain aneurysms or other vascular malformations, CNS infection, and brain tumors other than meningioma or arachnoid cysts. Eligible patients must have a screening MRI within 12 months of treatment initiation, those unable to undergo MRI due to claustrophobia, pacemaker, defibrillator, or metal implants are not eligible, and computerized tomography (CT) is not adequate to detect pathology for therapy decisions or ARIA monitoring once treatment is initiated.

Japanese encephalitis (JE) — clinical laboratory findings and neuroimaging: Clinical laboratory findings with JE are nonspecific and might include moderately elevated white blood cell count, mild anemia, and hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia and elevated hepatic enzymes have been reported. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) usually shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis with moderately elevated protein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best means for detecting JE-associated abnormalities of the brain, including changes in the thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain, pons, and medulla, and thalamic lesions are the most commonly described abnormality.

### White matter alteration in metabolic syndrome: diffusion tensor analysis [^6a90033a]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

MRI acquisition

MRI scans were performed with a 3.0-T unit (Achieva; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) and an eight-channel array head coil. For MRI screening, regular structural images such as T1-weighted spin-echo, T2-weighted turbo spin-echo, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were obtained before the acquisition of diffusion tensor images.

The general scan parameters for DTI were as follows: a repetition time to echo time ratio of 5,443/70; a 128 × 128 acquisition matrix; a field of view of 224 × 224 mm 2; and a slice thickness of 3 mm with no gap. Images were obtained with (b = 1,000 s/mm 2 for each direction) and without (b = 0 s/mm 2) 32-direction diffusion encoding. A total of 50 axial-section images covering the entire cerebrum were obtained. The approximate scanning time for the acquisition of diffusion tensor images was 7 min 17 s.

### Cobalt-55 positron emission tomography in vascular dementia: significance of white matter changes [^d9816163]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Vascular dementia (VaD) is still used as a covering term to indicate the relationship between cerebrovascular disease and the progressive cognitive disorder. The contribution of white matter changes (WMCs), seen with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, to dementia had not been fully elucidated. Cobalt-55 (55Co) positron emission tomography (PET) allows us to distinguish between recent and old infarcts.

Purpose

The present study investigates whether 55Co PET can detect the lesions responsible for the progression of the cognitive disorder in VaD patients.

Patients and Methods

20 consecutive patients with a previous history of repeated strokes occurring more than 6 months before and with multiple cortical infarcts, lacunes and WMCs on CT and 5 age-matched controls were investigated with 55Co PET. The stroke patients were divided in two groups: 8 with and 12 without VaD. Average 55Co counts in cerebral cortex, deep gray nuclei and white matter were compared to the value in the cerebellum used as reference.

Results

In the control group, the 55Co uptake was identical in the cerebral cortex and in the cerebellum, but lower in the deep gray nuclei and the cerebral white matter. When comparing the stroke groups with the control, the 55Co uptake was similar for the cerebral cortex and deep gray nuclei, but significantly increased in the cerebral white matter. The 55Co uptake was also more increased in the stroke group with VaD compared to the non-demented group.

Conclusion

55Co PET shows that the WMCs are due to the ongoing damage of probably ischaemic origin which is more prominent in stroke patients with progressive cognitive decline.

### Severe metabolic abnormalities in the white matter of patients with vacuolating megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts. A proton MR spectroscopic imaging study [^78ec2bbd]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Vacuolating megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy (VML) with subcortical cysts is a neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by megalencephaly with onset in the first year of life, progressive ataxia, spasticity and relatively spared cognitive function. Conventional MRI findings consist of diffusely abnormal cerebral white matter with subcortical cysts. Recent single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy studies have shown mild metabolic abnormalities in the white matter. We report here a combined proton MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) study on 2 new, unrelated patients with this rare disorder. 1H-MRSI examinations, which can provide simultaneously metabolic information from many different brain regions, showed inhomogeneous decreases in all normally detected metabolites with significant widespread decreases in the ratio of N-acetylaspartate to creatine+phosphocreatine and concomitant small increases in lactate in the white matter of both hemispheres. Metabolic abnormalities were milder in the frontal white matter and more severe in the posterior white matter. The 1H-MRSI pattern of the gray matter was normal in both patients. In one patient, a subsequent 1H-MRSI examination (performed 3 years after the first) confirmed the presence of widespread decreases in the ratio of N-acetylaspartate to creatine+phosphocreatine in the white matter. We conclude that severe metabolic abnormalities can be found in the white matter of VML patients. This suggests that, despite the apparently mild clinical course, a severe neurodegenerative process may occur in the white matter of these patients.

### Retinal microvascular abnormalities and subclinical magnetic resonance imaging brain infarct: a prospective study [^2056f917]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Silent brain infarct and white matter lesions are common radiological findings associated with the risk of clinical stroke and dementia; however, our understanding of their underlying pathophysiology and risk factors remains limited. This study aimed to determine whether assessment of retinal microvascular abnormalities could provide prognostic information regarding the risk of brain infarct and white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. This study is based on a subset of 810 middle-aged persons without clinical stroke or baseline magnetic resonance imaging infarct enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study, a prospective, population-based study. Participants had a baseline magnetic resonance imaging brain examination and retinal photography in 1993–1995, and returned for a repeat magnetic resonance imaging examination in 2004–2006. Magnetic resonance images were graded for presence of any cerebral infarct, infarct with lacunar characteristics and white matter lesions according to standardized protocols. Retinal photographs were graded for presence of retinopathy lesions and retinal arteriolar abnormalities following a standardized protocol. Over a median follow-up of 10.5 years, 164 (20.2%) participants developed cerebral infarct, 131 (16.2%) developed lacunar infarct, 182 (24.2%) developed new white matter lesions and 49 (6.1%) had evidence of white matter lesion progression. After adjusting for age, gender, race, cardiovascular risk factors and carotid intima-media thickness, retinopathy was associated with incident cerebral infarct (odds ratio 2.82; 95% confidence interval 1.42–5.60) and lacunar infarct (odds ratio 3.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.56–6.50). Retinal arteriovenous nicking was associated with incident cerebral infarct (odds ratio 2.82; 95% confidence interval: 1.66–4.76), lacunar infarct (odds ratio 2.48; 95% confidence interval: 1.39–4.40) and white matter lesion incidence (odds ratio 2.12; 95% confidence interval: 1.18–3.81) and progression (odds ratio 2.22; 95% confidence interval: 1.00–5.88). In conclusion, retinal microvascular abnormalities are associated with emergence of subclinical magnetic resonance imaging brain infarcts and white matter lesions, independent of shared risk factors. Retinal vascular imaging may offer a non-invasive tool to investigate the pathogenesis and natural history of cerebral small-vessel disease.

### MR imaging of the brain in patients cured of acute lymphoblastic leukemia – the value of gradient echo imaging [^76188457]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Hemosiderin and white matter lesions are 2 of the most common neurologic complications found on MR imaging that may be related to cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) therapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We evaluated the brains of patients previously treated for ALL with cranial irradiation and intrathecal MTX with MR imaging and tested the hypothesis that these patients have more MR evidence of central nervous system (CNS) injury than control patients who are in complete remission following systemic chemotherapy without cranial irradiation.

Methods and Materials

ALL patients recruited from a pediatric cancer center data base were examined at 1.5T by using T1-weighted, T2-weighted, gradient echo (GE), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. Patients treated in childhood for solid extracranial neoplasms were used as controls.

Results

Lesions consistent with old hemorrhage were detected in 23 (55%) of the ALL patients and in none of the control patients (P < .001). Of the 62 hemorrhages detected on the GE images, only 9 (15%) were shown on T2-weighted images. White matter abnormalities were found in 2 ALL patients (5%) and one control patient (5%). Old infarcts were seen in 2 ALL patients (10%).

Conclusion

Cerebral hemorrhages related to radiation-induced vascular malformations, most of which are asymptomatic, are much more common in survivors of childhood ALL than previously thought. GE sequencing is more sensitive in detecting hemorrhagic lesions than T2-weighted sequencing and is to be included in imaging protocols for follow-up study of patients after cerebral radiation therapy.

### Ischemic stroke imaged with cranial CT alone vs CT plus MRI… [^570c821b]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question Are clinical outcomes of patients with acute ischemic stroke imaged with initial computed tomography alone noninferior to those who had additional magnetic resonance imaging. Findings In this propensity score–matched cohort study of 246 patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke, a diagnostic imaging strategy of initial CT alone was noninferior to initial CT plus additional MRI with regard to clinical outcomes at discharge and at 1 year. Meaning Results of this study suggest that further research is needed to determine which patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke benefit from MRI in addition to initial CT. Importance Patients with acute ischemic stroke often undergo magnetic resonance imaging in addition to computed tomography, but its association with clinical outcomes is uncertain.

Conclusions and Relevance This propensity score–matched cohort study of patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke found that a diagnostic imaging strategy of initial CT alone was noninferior to initial CT plus additional MRI with regard to clinical outcomes at discharge and at 1 year. Further research is needed to determine which patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke benefit from MRI. Unnecessary medical imaging is a major cause of preventable waste in the US health care system. 1–3 Use of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging has increased rapidly since 2000 and is greater than in other high-income countries. 2, 3 Most evaluations of medical imaging report diagnostic accuracy or resultant changes in management rather than associations with patient outcomes, with recent publications noting a need for more studies targeted at clinical end points. 4–6 Use of MRI to evaluate patients with acute ischemic stroke is a case in point.

There are possible reasons why MRI may have added value to initial CT for patients with AIS. The MRI-derived information about stroke subtype, timing, or location may lead to better selection of treatments. 4 Clear demonstration of infarction has been proposed as a means to enhance patient education and improve adherence to prescribed prevention regimens.
10. More than 90% of patients with AIS receive MRI in addition to CT with few data to determine whether there is an associated benefit with patient outcomes. 4, 7–9 In this retrospective observational propensity score–matched cohort study of patients hospitalized with AIS, we found that a diagnostic imaging strategy of initial CT alone was noninferior to initial CT with additional MRI with regard to the clinical outcomes of death or dependence at hospital discharge or prevention of stroke or death at 1 year after discharge.

### Changes in normal-appearing white matter precede development of white matter lesions [^59287dc7]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

It is unknown whether white matter lesions (WML) develop abruptly in previously normal brain areas, or whether tissue changes are already present before WML become apparent on MRI. We therefore investigated whether development of WML is preceded by quantifiable changes in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM).

Methods

In 689 participants from the general population (mean age 67 years), we performed 2 MRI scans (including diffusion tensor imaging and Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery [FLAIR] sequences) 3.5 years apart using the same 1.5-T scanner. Using automated tissue segmentation, we identified NAWM at baseline. We assessed which NAWM regions converted into WML during follow-up and differentiated new WML into regions of WML growth and de novo WML. Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and FLAIR intensity of regions converting to WML and regions of persistent NAWM were compared using 3 approaches: a whole-brain analysis, a regionally matched approach, and a voxel-wise approach.

Results

All 3 approaches showed that low fractional anisotropy, high mean diffusivity, and relatively high FLAIR intensity at baseline were associated with WML development during follow-up. Compared with persistent NAWM regions, NAWM regions converting to WML had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (0.337 vs 0.387; P < 0.001), higher mean diffusivity (0.910 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s vs 0.729 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; P < 0.001), and relatively higher normalized FLAIR intensity (1.233 vs -0.340; P < 0.001). This applied to both NAWM developing into growing and de novo WML.

Conclusions

White matter changes in NAWM are present and can be quantified on diffusion tensor imaging and FLAIR before WML develop. This suggests that WML develop gradually, and that visually appreciable WML are only the tip of the iceberg of white matter pathology.

### Prevention of stroke in patients with silent cerebrovascular disease: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^631ec962]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of silent cerebrovascular disease by neuroimaging — Silent cerebrovascular disease is typically recognized on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. MRI has greater sensitivity and specificity than CT and can better demonstrate and differentiate small cortical and subcortical infarction, lacunar infarcts, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), perivascular spaces, brain atrophy, and other structural lesions. A number of other techniques are under investigation, but their role in clinical practice is still uncertain.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the contribution of mr imaging to the diagnosis of foetal brain abnormalities in utero [^d4d59d9f]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Agreement between USS and iuMR

The reports from USS and iuMR were in agreement and agreed with the ORD in 527/959 (55%). USS and iuMR were in agreement but discordant with the ORD in 52/959 (5.5%) foetuses (Table 1a and b, and 2).

Table 2
Results of the number and percentage of foetuses within each category of outcome

In 160/959 (16.5%) foetuses iuMR and USS were in agreement regarding the primary diagnosis but additional information was added — either secondary diagnoses or a more concise/confident primary diagnosis given. In this category iuMR provided additional information in 146/959 (15%) and USS provided additional information in 14/959 (1.5%) cases as confirmed by ORD.

Disagreement between USS and iuMR

The diagnoses on iuMR and USS disagreed in 222 (23%) cases. Of these, the iuMR was in agreement with the ORD in 186 (19%), the majority of which were abnormalities undetected by USS (139/186, 75%). The remaining 47/186 (25%) were abnormalities reported by USS but correctly excluded by iuMR. In 34 cases the USS diagnosis was incorrectly overturned by iuMR, 10 of which were abnormalities wrongly excluded or missed by iuMR and 24/34 were abnormalities diagnosed by iuMR but not found by USS or on the ORD (Table 2b and 3b).

Table 3
Discordant diagnoses according to abnormality detected

Table 3 presents the discordant diagnoses between USS and iuMR according to category of anomaly. The most frequent areas of disagreement were midline (24%) and posterior fossa abnormalities (21%). In particular agenesis of the corpus callosum and the Dandy Walker spectrum of abnormalities were frequently missed or, less frequently, wrongly identified on USS. The most frequently misdiagnosed anomalies on both USS and iuMR were cortical formation abnormalities (17%) such as hemimegalencephaly, lissencephaly and heterotopia.

Changes in counselling and management

Eleven studies reporting on 186 foetuses specified the benefit of iuMR in terms of changes to counselling of parents or management of the pregnancy. These changes as a result of findings on iuMR affected 78/186 (41.9%) foetuses.

Objective

Celiac disease (CD), or gluten sensitivity, is considered to be a state of heightened immunologic responsiveness to ingested gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. The gastrointestinal manifestation suggests a severe enteropathy of the small intestine with malabsorption, steatorrhea, and weight loss because of a deranged mucosal immune response. Neurologic complications occur, especially epilepsy, possibly associated with occipital calcifications or folate deficiency and cerebellar ataxia. There have been reports of brain white-matter lesions as an extraintestinal manifestation in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis but not in CD.

Methods

In this study, 75 diet-treated mainly pediatric patients with biopsy-proven CD underwent prospectively clinical neurologic examinations, laboratory investigations, electroencephalography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The age range was 2.8 to 24.2 years with a mean of 11.6 years. The mean period of gluten exposure was 2.4 years.

Results

Ten patients had neurologic findings such as febrile seizures, single generalized seizures, mild ataxia, and muscular hypotonia with retarded motor development. No folate deficiency was found. The hippocampal regions showed no abnormalities. Computed tomography did not reveal any cerebral calcifications, but magnetic resonance imaging detected unilateral and bilateral T2-hyperintensive white-matter lesions in 15 patients (20%). There was no correlation between these lesions and dietary compliance or neurologic or electroencephalographic abnormalities. The mean gluten exposure time of these patients was slightly increased (not significant).

Conclusions

Focal white-matter lesions in the brain may represent an extraintestinal manifestation of CD. They may be ischemic in origin as a result of a vasculitis or caused by inflammatory demyelination. They seem to be more typical of pediatric CD than cerebral calcifications. Their prognostic value is unclear and needs to be elucidated in additional studies. CD should be suggested as a differential diagnosis in children with unclear white-matter lesions even without intestinal symptoms.

### Phenotypes of chronic covert brain infarction in patients with first-ever ischemic stroke: a cohort study [^53d5f2ad]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic covert brain infarctions (CBIs) are focal, presumably postischemic lesions detected on brain imaging in patients without a history of an attributable obvious acute neurological dysfunction. Patients with CBIs have a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of manifest acute ischemic stroke (AIS). – Additionally, 1 in 3 patients with first-ever AIS has an additional chronic CBI on acute imaging. –

Previous studies addressing the role of CBI in patients with AIS are limited by use of computed tomography (CT) imaging, which is neither sensitive in detecting small CBIs nor specific in differentiating CBI from other cerebral lesions. Some studies used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but reliable imaging criteria for CBI diagnosis have only recently been proposed. Most available studies compared patients with any CBI to patients without CBI but did not consider the imaging phenotype of the CBI lesion. Potentially relevant phenotypes include subcortical lacunes (= cavitatory lesions), large subcortical infarcts, isolated gray matter lesions, and combined gray and white matter lesions. In patients with AIS, CBI might convey clues to underlying vascular risk factors and stroke etiology. As a consequence of the methodological weaknesses of the existing studies, guidelines for AIS work-up do not include information on concomitant CBI to guide the diagnostic work-up in patients with AIS.

The aim of this study was to describe the frequency, imaging phenotypes, and distribution of CBI — defined according to established imaging criteria as evidence of any prior brain infarct in patients with first clinically evident ischemic stroke. CBI included cortical infarcts as well as lacunes (cavitatory), large subcortical (noncavitatory) infarcts and cerebellar and brain stem lesions. In addition, we sought to determine the vascular risk factor profile according to CBI phenotypes and disentangle the association of CBI and undifferentiated white matter hyperintensities (WMHs).

### Impact of white matter hyperintensities on surrounding white matter tracts [^64ad06df]. Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

It is unclear how white matter hyperintensities disrupt surrounding white matter tracts. The aim of this tractography study was to determine the spatial relationship between diffusion characteristics along white matter tracts and the distance from white matter hyperintensities.

Methods

Diffusion tensor 3-T MRI scans were acquired in 29 participants with white matter hyperintensities. In each subject, tractography by the fiber assignment by continuous tracking method was used to segment corticospinal tracts. Mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy were measured along corticospinal tracts in relation to white matter hyperintensities. Diffusion characteristics along tracts were correlated with distance from white matter hyperintensities and were also compared between tracts traversing and not traversing white matter hyperintensities.

Results

In tracts not traversing through white matter hyperintensities, increasing distance from white matter hyperintensities was associated with decreased mean diffusivity (p = 0.002) and increased fractional anisotropy (p = 0.006). In tracts traversing white matter hyperintensities, compared to tracts not traversing white matter hyperintensites, the mean diffusivity was higher at 6–8 voxels, axial diffusivity higher at 4–8 voxels, and radial diffusivity higher at 7 voxels away from white matter hyperintensities (all p < 0.006).

Conclusion

White matter hyperintensities are associated with two patterns of altered diffusion characteristics in the surrounding white matter tract network. Diffusion characteristics along white matter tracts improve further away from white matter hyperintensities suggestive of a local penumbra pattern. Also, altered diffusion extends further along tracts traversing white matter hyperintensities suggestive of a Wallerian-type degenerative pattern.

### Prevention of stroke in patients with silent cerebrovascular disease: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^6558b5c7]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Prevalence of silent brain infarcts, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and cerebral microbleeds (CMB) — study selection and imaging scope are specified: the authors "screened > 800 studies but included only population-based and case-control studies with > 150 subjects". They included "only MRI studies because the sensitivity of CT scans for the various markers of vascular brain injury is lower", focusing on "1- to 3-T MRI scans". Criteria were not standardized across studies, as "We have used the author-defined criteria for silent brain infarction, WMH, and CMB". For prevalence estimates, "we have included all studies with T1- and T2-weighted imaging" for silent brain infarcts, and for WMH "either T2-weighted or T2-FLAIR sequences".

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^61b4e82c]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Radiation — head/brain TBI: Potential late effects include Clinical leukoencephalopathy, Spasticity, Ataxia, Dysarthria, Dysphagia, Hemiparesis, and Seizures. Periodic evaluation includes history for Cognitive, motor and/or sensory deficits, Seizures, and Other neurologic symptoms yearly, and a physical Neurologic exam yearly. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention specify Brain CT or Brain MRI with MRA as clinically indicated with preferred study based on intracranial lesion to be evaluated, with Calcifications evaluated by CT, White matter by MRI with DTI, and Microvascular injury by Gadolinium-enhanced MRI with DWI; Neurology consultation and follow-up are as clinically indicated. Additional information notes that clinical leukoencephalopathy may present with or without imaging abnormalities; transient white matter anomalies may follow radiotherapy and high dose chemotherapy for medulloblastoma/PNET, may mimic tumor recurrence, and signify risk of persistent neurologic sequelae; neuroimaging changes do not always correlate with degree of cognitive dysfunction; and new deficits may emerge over time. Risk considerations include patient and cancer/treatment factors such as Younger age at treatment and higher radiation dose, especially ≥ 24 Gy or fraction dose ≥ 3 Gy, as well as larger radiation field, greater cortical volumes, and combination with dexamethasone, methotrexate, cytarabine. SYSTEM = CNS SCORE = 1.

### Leukodystrophies in children: diagnosis, care, and treatment [^9019f105]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Genetic sequencing — costs, diagnostic yield, and limitations: The cost can be substantial (up to $15 000 to $20 000). In a cohort of 71 patients with suspected leukodystrophy or genetic leukoencephalopathy, diagnostic pathogenic variants were identified in 35% (25 of 71) and potentially pathogenic variants in an additional 7% (5 of 71), giving a total yield of clinical diagnoses in 42%. Despite in-depth testing, a portion (around 25% to 40%) of cases can remain undiagnosed. Sequencing is as cost-effective as a brain MRI, and some recent work suggests that WGS may be useful as a first-line diagnosis tool.

### Leukodystrophies in children: diagnosis, care, and treatment [^d135e845]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Leukodystrophies in children — epidemiology, presentation, and diagnosis are outlined: Leukodystrophies are a group of genetically determined disorders that affect development or maintenance of central nervous system myelin, with an incidence of at least 1 in 4700 live births and more than 30% mortality by 8 years of age. They can present at any age from infancy to adulthood with manifestations ranging from developmental delay to seizures to spasticity. Diagnosis is based on a combination of history, examination, and radiologic and laboratory findings, including genetic testing. Clinical recognition accelerated with the widespread clinical adoption of MRI in the 1980s and 1990s, and recent improvements in genetic diagnosis techniques have led to specific diagnoses in more than half of all patients with leukodystrophy. The report notes significant morbidity and elevated risk of early death, few cures but significant opportunities for care and improvements in patient well-being, and highlights rapid advances and the addition of leukodystrophy screening to newborn screening.

### Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography for suspected acute stroke: association of admission image modality with acute recanalization therapies, workflow metrics, and outcomes [^48df0952]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous studies showed that MRI‐selected patients had a lower risk for sICH after IVT, and MT. This might be because MRI can detect cerebral microbleeds, cortical siderosis, very severe white matter changes, and subtle hemorrhagic changes within the ischemic region, as well as providing a better estimation of the time elapsed when time of onset is unknown or unwitnessed. Hence, patients with increased risk for sICH might be excluded from acute recanalization treatments in borderline scenarios. However, this target trial analysis found no difference in sICH between the two modalities after adjustment for confounders.

Other studies demonstrated an overall association of MRI with better outcomes despite longer DTN times in IVTand MT‐treated patients. However, assignment bias probably influenced those findings, as the choice of imaging was not randomized. In line with previous studies, we found a pronounced association of MRI with better functional outcome and lower mortality, despite lower rates of IVT and longer DTN, but not DTP times. However, residual confounding and assignment bias will probably have influenced this finding, despite application of a target trial design and sophisticated statistical adjustment. Because of the indication bias in observational data, influence on workflow metrics, and complexity of downstream therapeutic decisions, only randomized controlled trials can determine whether the choice of admission imaging modality truly affects IVT or MT indication rates, workflow delays, and outcomes. However, our aim is to raise awareness among stroke physicians that the imaging modality might influence their decisions regarding which patients to treat by IVT, and that treatment delays might arise secondary to the influence of the choice of imaging. For some patient subgroups, such as MT candidates, such trials are already ongoing (NCT03745391), whereas for broad unselected acute stroke populations, we are unaware of such a trial. As our target trial analysis was not able to identify specific subgroups that gained a particular benefit from either modality, a pragmatic trial in unselected populations with suspected acute stroke could identify subgroups that might benefit from a specific modality (e.g. MRI for transient ischemic attack or stroke mimic patients, or CT for MT candidates). Another study design would be a comparison of treatment decisions in patients who received both imaging modalities almost simultaneously. Such a study should determine which factors (ASPECTS, infarct and penumbra volume) influence physicians' treatment decisions to understand why IVT/MT may be offered differentially between the two groups.
