Tinea co

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tinea corporis, specifically regarding its definition, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, treatment, special populations, and how to handle emerging resistance and mimics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining tinea corporis and its epidemiology. Then, I should verify the classic clinical features and key differentials. Next, I will review diagnostic confirmation, especially KOH microscopy and when to escalate to culture or molecular testing. After that, I need to outline evidence-based topical therapy, indications for systemic therapy, and antifungal stewardship. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like pediatric disease, immunocompromise, and emerging Trichophyton indotineae, and close with a practical algorithm and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope. Tinea corporis is a superficial dermatophyte infection of the glabrous skin of the trunk and extremities, typically caused by Trichophyton species, and it is one of the most common superficial fungal infections worldwide, with transmission via person-to-person, animal-to-person, or fomite contact, and a predilection for warm, moist environments and close-contact settings.

> I will now examine the classic clinical presentation. The hallmark is an annular, erythematous, scaly plaque with centrifugal expansion and central clearing, often pruritic, and ranging from 1 to 5 cm, though larger or confluent lesions can occur; atypical variants include minimally inflammatory plaques, pustular or bullous forms, and steroid-modified disease that can obscure the classic morphology, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion when the story does not fit the textbook [^1175sXpo] [^117KeEEW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; several entities can mimic tinea corporis. I should double-check the differential: pityriasis rosea, nummular eczema, psoriasis, granuloma annulare, erythema migrans, secondary syphilis, subacute cutaneous lupus, and even cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can present with annular lesions, so I need to correlate morphology, distribution, evolution, and risk factors before committing to a fungal diagnosis [^112AmniE] [^114b4Xih] [^113jmgF9].

> Next, I should review diagnostic confirmation. Clinical diagnosis alone is unreliable; in-office KOH preparation with direct microscopy is the first-line confirmatory test and should be performed when feasible, as it rapidly identifies hyphae and improves diagnostic accuracy; if KOH is negative but suspicion remains high, or if disease is extensive, recurrent, or refractory, I should send fungal culture or consider molecular identification, especially to detect emerging species like Trichophyton indotineae that are not reliably identified by conventional methods [^112QJyqZ] [^114ZNbs2] [^115535KA].

> Let me think about topical therapy. For limited, noninflammatory tinea corporis, a 2-week course of a topical antifungal without corticosteroid is first-line; allylamines such as terbinafine or butenafine are preferred for their fungicidal activity and shorter duration, though azoles remain reasonable alternatives; I should confirm that treatment extends at least 1 week beyond clinical clearing to reduce recurrence, and I must avoid combination antifungal-corticosteroid creams because they mask symptoms, promote steroid-modified tinea, and worsen outcomes [^115ZpJtP] [^117CnLbd] [^112KrRYk] [^1138Uspt].

> Wait, let me verify indications for systemic therapy. I should escalate to oral antifungals for extensive disease, immunocompromise, failure of appropriate topical therapy, or involvement of hair-bearing sites where topical agents cannot penetrate; first-line options include terbinafine, itraconazole, or fluconazole, with griseofulvin as an alternative, and I need to tailor the agent to the organism and patient factors; for example, terbinafine is often preferred for Trichophyton, whereas griseofulvin may be chosen for Microsporum, and I should ensure adequate duration, typically 2 to 4 weeks for tinea corporis, adjusting based on response and severity [^112TyTBH] [^113zajmk].

> I should confirm special considerations in children. Tinea corporis is common in pediatrics, and topical therapy suffices for most cases; however, if there is hair involvement or extensive disease, systemic therapy may be needed, and I must remember that tinea capitis requires oral therapy because topicals cannot reach the hair shaft; I also need to screen household contacts and treat carriers to interrupt transmission, and I should avoid systemic ketoconazole in children due to hepatotoxicity risks [^11658ib2] [^111xaX6e] [^113Mgc85].

> But wait, what if the infection is refractory or atypical. I need to consider emerging antifungal resistance, particularly Trichophyton indotineae, which presents with widespread, pruritic, often steroid-exacerbated plaques that fail standard terbinafine courses; in such cases, I should obtain culture with susceptibility testing and consider molecular identification, then treat with itraconazole 100 to 200 mg twice daily for 6 to 8 weeks, recognizing that higher doses or longer durations may be necessary and that griseofulvin and fluconazole have limited efficacy; I should also counsel patients to avoid topical corticosteroids and report travel or contacts from endemic regions [^115urRne] [^113GLHvg] [^115AJX6E].

> I need to ensure antifungal stewardship and prevention are addressed. Patients should keep affected areas clean and dry, avoid sharing towels or clothing, and treat concomitant tinea pedis or onychomycosis to prevent autoinoculation; I should reinforce that combination antifungal-corticosteroid creams are harmful and should be avoided, and I should schedule follow-up to confirm clinical response and, if response is suboptimal, reassess the diagnosis and consider alternative etiologies or resistance [^117CnLbd] [^115ZpJtP] [^111nSZ6L].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missing. Suspect tinea corporis in annular, scaly, expanding plaques; confirm with KOH microscopy when feasible; initiate a 2-week topical allylamine or azole course without steroid for limited disease; reassess at 2 weeks and extend or escalate to systemic therapy if there is inadequate response or if disease is extensive, immunocompromised, or hair-involved; in refractory or atypical cases, obtain culture and consider molecular testing for T. indotineae, then treat with itraconazole for 6 to 8 weeks and avoid corticosteroids; throughout, address mimics, reinforce hygiene, and treat coexisting tinea sites to reduce recurrence [^115ZpJtP] [^112QJyqZ].

---

Tinea corporis is a superficial dermatophyte infection of the skin, typically presenting as **annular, scaly plaques with central clearing** and a raised, erythematous border [^113QBoZe]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, with KOH microscopy confirming fungal elements when needed [^112QJyqZ]. First-line treatment is **topical antifungals** (terbinafine, butenafine, or azoles) for 2–4 weeks [^115ZpJtP]; use systemic therapy for extensive, refractory, or immunocompromised cases [^113QBoZe]. Avoid combination corticosteroid-antifungal creams due to risk of masking and worsening infection [^117CnLbd]. Recurrence is common without hygiene measures and treating close contacts or coexisting infections [^115iuH8W].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Lesion morphology**: Annular, erythematous, scaly plaques with central clearing and a raised, advancing border; may be single or multiple [^1175sXpo].
- **Symptoms**: Pruritus is common; lesions may burn or sting, especially with inflammation [^1175sXpo].
- **Distribution**: Trunk, extremities, and occasionally face; often exposed areas [^113QBoZe].
- **Variants**: Inflammatory, bullous, or tinea incognito (steroid-modified) forms can occur [^117KeEEW].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

- **Pathogens**: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, and Microsporum canis are common [^notfound].
- **Transmission**: Direct contact with infected humans or animals, or indirect contact via contaminated objects (clothing, towels, bedding) [^113eJgSZ].
- **Risk factors**: Warm, humid environments; occlusive clothing; immunosuppression; close-contact sports; diabetes; obesity [^notfound].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Based on characteristic appearance and history [^113QBoZe].
- **Confirmatory testing**: KOH preparation shows branching hyphae; culture or PCR if atypical, refractory, or epidemiologic clues suggest resistant species (e.g. T. indotineae) [^112QJyqZ] [^114ZNbs2].
- **Differential diagnosis**: Eczema, psoriasis, pityriasis rosea, granuloma annulare, secondary syphilis, erythema migrans, lupus, sarcoidosis, leprosy, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [^112AmniE] [^114b4Xih].

---

## Treatment

### Topical therapy (first-line for limited disease)

- **Agents**: Terbinafine 1% cream or butenafine 1% cream once daily for 2–4 weeks; azoles (clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole) are alternatives [^115ZpJtP] [^113xs1Nj].
- **Efficacy**: Allylamines are fungicidal and may achieve higher cure rates with shorter courses than azoles [^11658ib2].
- **Application**: Extend 1–2 cm beyond the visible lesion margin; treat for at least 1 week after clinical clearing [^1138Uspt].

---

### Systemic therapy (indicated for extensive, refractory, or immunocompromised cases)

- **First-line**: Oral terbinafine 250 mg daily for 2–4 weeks [^notfound].
- **Alternatives**: Itraconazole 200 mg daily for 2–4 weeks; fluconazole 150–200 mg weekly for 2–4 weeks; griseofulvin 500 mg daily for 2–4 weeks (less effective for T. rubrum) [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Baseline and periodic LFTs for systemic agents, especially in patients with liver disease or prolonged therapy [^113raPC7].

---

## Prevention and recurrence

Prevention focuses on **hygiene** — keeping skin dry, avoiding shared personal items, and laundering clothing and bedding — and on **treating coexisting infections** such as tinea pedis or onychomycosis to prevent autoinoculation [^114WZD29] [^111nSZ6L]. Recurrence is common without these measures and with immunosuppression or improper therapy [^115iuH8W].

---

## Complications

Complications include **secondary bacterial infection** (impetiginization), postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation (especially in darker skin), and chronic or recurrent disease in immunocompromised hosts [^113EiYVJ]. Misdiagnosis and inappropriate steroid use can lead to tinea incognito and treatment failure [^117KeEEW].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatrics**: Topical therapy is first-line; systemic agents (terbinafine, griseofulvin) are reserved for extensive or refractory disease, with weight-based dosing and safety monitoring [^11658ib2].
- **Pregnancy**: Topical azoles are preferred; avoid systemic therapy unless clearly indicated.
- **Resistant species**: T. indotineae may require higher-dose itraconazole (200 mg twice daily) for 6–8 weeks and molecular confirmation [^115538y2].

---

Tinea corporis is a common, superficial fungal infection with a characteristic annular morphology; **prompt recognition, confirmatory testing when needed, and appropriate topical or systemic therapy** — plus hygiene and contact management — are essential for cure and prevention of recurrence [^113QBoZe].

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections [^113QBoZe]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Tinea infections (often called ringworm) are caused by dermatophyte fungi and classified by the body site involved. Tinea corporis and tinea capitis are most common in prepubertal children, and tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (most common type of onychomycosis) are more likely in adolescents and adults. Clinical diagnosis without testing may be unreliable because other conditions can resemble tinea infections (eg, tinea corporis can be confused with eczema, and onychomycosis with dystrophic toenails from repeated low-level trauma or psoriasis). Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis generally respond to inexpensive topical antifungal agents, but oral antifungal agents may be indicated for patients with extensive disease, lack of response to topical treatment, immunocompromise, or hair follicle involvement (eg, tinea capitis). Oral terbinafine is considered first-line therapy for tinea capitis and onychomycosis because it is well tolerated, effective, and inexpensive. Emerging tinea infections may be more severe than classic tinea infections and generally do not improve with first-line topical or oral antifungals. These infections may require prolonged oral antifungal therapy and specialized diagnostic testing. Antifungal stewardship, including avoiding the use of combination antifungal-corticosteroids, should be emphasized to optimize outcomes and help prevent resistance.

### Tinea genitalis: a new entity of sexually transmitted infection? Case series and review of the literature [^114t1bcP]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tinea corporis, a superficial cutaneous dermatophyte infection of the trunk and extremities, occurs worldwide and is most common in tropical regions. Trichophyton interdigitale (former Trichophyton mentagrophytes) is the second most frequent pathogen worldwide. Contamination takes place by human-to-human and animal-to-human contact or soil-to-human spread. Recently, we repeatedly examined patients presenting with widespread dermatophytoses with T. interdigitale in the genital area. Dermatophytoses of the genital region are relatively rare compared with those involving the groin. Current literature only covers several cases of concomitant tinea genitalis in patients suffering from tinea inguinalis, tinea unguium, tinea pedis or tinea manum, where auto-inoculation is postulated. In one case, an animal source of infection was supposed. We report on seven patients with tinea genitalis with probable sexual transmission presenting in early 2014.

### Erythroderma and annular pustular plaques [^115EDR9A]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 29-year-old woman presented with fever and worsening chronic painful rash with new pustules on her back. She was previously treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and systemic steroids with minimal improvement. The patient was ill-appearing, febrile, and tachycardic. Skin examination was significant for erythroderma with non-follicular-based pustules coalescing into annular plaques with "sunflower-like" configuration on her back, chest, and legs (Fig 1 A/B). Labs were significant for leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance. Bacterial culture swabs taken prior to initiation of antibiotics were negative. Biopsies of lesional and perilesional skin were submitted for histopathological exam and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) (Fig 2). Serum was submitted for detection of autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (IIF) (Fig 2) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

### Tinea capitis: an update [^112Zvuy5]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Tinea capitis is an important superficial infection and affects children globally. A literature review was conducted to identify recent findings and the current understanding of this fungal infection. Here, we highlight updates on important aspects of tinea capitis including advances in dermatophyte detection and diagnosis and comparing these new methods to more traditional techniques. Additionally, aspects of treating tinea capitis are discussed, including the importance of mycological confirmation and current means of treatment, and the treatment of asymptomatic carriers are reviewed. This review also examines the subject of laboratory monitoring of patients undergoing treatment with systemic antifungals; we discuss the opinions of prominent researchers and currently accepted guidelines. Lastly, we provide answers to several common questions that practitioners may encounter when treating a child with tinea capitis.

### Identifying signs of tinea pedis: a key to understanding clinical variables [^115iuSpM]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Tinea pedis is a frequently encountered dermatophytosis affecting the superficial skin of the feet, primarily of adults. The prevalence of tinea pedis has increased over the last several decades due to an increase in multiple risk factors. Infection from dermatophytes is most common, but infection from other fungi can also result in tinea pedis. Four distinct clinical presentations occur: interdigital, moccasin, vesicular, and acute ulcerative types. A variety of physical exam findings can help the clinician identify patients with tinea pedis.

### Superficial fungal infections [^115cgnwJ]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis, tinea corporis, and pityriasis versicolor are common superficial fungal infections in the pediatric population.
- Tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection worldwide. In North America, the cause is almost exclusively T tonsurans. Diagnosis of tinea capitis usually can be made by clinical features alone, especially when occipital or postauricular lymphadenopathy is present. Skin scrapings prepared with potassium hydroxide for microscopic examination, or a cotton swab for fungal culture, usually are diagnostic.
- Treatment of tinea capitis requires systemic antifungal therapy. Terbinafine and griseofulvin are both effective against T tonsurans and are FDA-approved for this indication in children.
- Adjunctive topical therapy for the patient and household contacts decreases transmission of this infection.
- Topical antifungal therapy usually is effective for tinea corporis and pityriasis versicolor. However, recurrences of pityriasis versicolor are common.

### Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea nigra, and piedra [^114WZD29]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Tinea infections are among the most common dermatologic conditions throughout the world. To avoid a misdiagnosis, identification of dermatophyte infections requires both a fungal culture on Sabouraud's agar media, and a light microscopic mycologic examination from skin scrapings. Topical antifungals may be sufficient for treatment of tinea corporis and cruris and tinea nigra, and the shaving of hair infected by piedra may also be beneficial. Systemic therapy, however, may be required when the infected areas are large, macerated with a secondary infection, or in immunocompromised individuals. Preventative measures of tinea infections include practicing good personal hygiene; keeping the skin dry and cool at all times; and avoiding sharing towels, clothing, or hair accessories with infected individuals.

### Differential diagnosis of annular lesions [^114b4Xih]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Although most annular lesions will be typical of a dermatophytosis, physicians must consider other possible diagnoses. Tinea corporis can often be diagnosed on the basis of a positive potassium hydroxide examination. Topical and systemic antifungals are usually curative. Pityriasis rosea is characterized by small, fawn-colored lesions distributed along skin cleavage lines. Treatment is symptomatic. Granuloma annulare is characterized by nonscaly, annular plaques with indurated borders, typically on the extremities. One half of cases resolve spontaneously within two years. Sarcoidosis can present as annular, indurated plaques similar in appearance to the lesions of granuloma annulare. Diagnosis is based on histopathology and the involvement of other organ systems. Hansen's disease can mimic tinea corporis by presenting as one or more annular, sometimes scaly, plaques. Urticaria may affect 10 to 20 percent of the population. The annular plaques lack scale and are evanescent. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus can present in an annular form on sun-exposed surfaces or in a papulosquamous form. Erythema annulare centrifugum typically presents as annular patches with trailing scale inside erythematous borders.

### Image-based artificial intelligence in psoriasis assessment: the beginning of a new diagnostic era? [^114vhwkQ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

A major limitation of these reported results is the lack of external test sets with diverse patient populations in different clinical settings, which would provide more insight into the generalizability of algorithms and their potential for real-world clinical use. In addition to psoriasis subtypes, other differential diagnoses presenting with red, scaly plaques such as atopic dermatitis, tinea corporis, mycosis fungoides, pityriasis rosea, or cutaneous lupus erythematosus must be distinguished from psoriasis by AI. To make an accurate diagnosis, CNNs must be trained using large datasets containing these differential diagnoses to recognize subtle differences in appearance and distribution patterns. As dermatology training sets become larger and include more images of psoriasis subtypes, differential diagnoses, and diverse patient populations, future algorithms are expected to become more comprehensive. In addition to diagnostic applications, AI has great potential to facilitate the assessment of the extent and severity of psoriasis, as detailed in the following section.

Assessment of Disease Extent and Severity

Automated assessment of psoriasis disease extent and severity has the potential to significantly reduce physician workload while ensuring a high degree of standardization and reproducibility.

### Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the use of telemedicine on the diagnosis and treatment of tinea corporis: an experience of Southern Italy center [^1175sXpo]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Tinea corporis has a characteristic clinical presentation with the presence of an annular, red, centrifugally developing patch with a central area of resolution and active border. It can often be accompanied by itchy symptoms. Lesions may be single or multiple and the size generally ranges from 1 to 5 cm, however larger lesions and confluence of lesions can also occur. The diagnosis of tinea corporis is clinical but can be confirmed with a potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination of skin scrapings. Direct microscopic examination by 10%–20% KOH is rapid and inexpensive and helps greatly in some situations where there is a diagnostic suspicion of more than one disease.

We conducted a 2‐year data collection at our center where we evaluated the impact of covid‐19 on diagnosis and treatment of tinea corporis.

During the pandemic period caused by COVID‐19, to contain the rapid spread of the virus, the Italian government decided to introduce several measures to contain contagions such as lockdown and quarantine starting from March 10, 2020. These measures inevitably caused a longer latency between visits performed and a lower number of accesses to the mycology outpatient clinic of the University of Naples "Federico II". Patients were referred to us by dermatologists suspecting Tinea Corporis as a diagnosis. In the following work we analyzed the impact of these restrictions on the diagnosis and therapeutic response of patients affected by Tinea Corporis, comparing the pre‐pandemic year (March 2019–March 2020) with the following year during the pandemic (March 2020–March 2021). During the year between March 2019 and March 2020, both initial and follow‐up visits were being performed at our clinic. Instead, in the pandemic year between March 2020 and March 2021, all visits of first access for suspected Tinea corporis were made at our facility, while the 2 months follow‐up visits after diagnosis were made in Telemedicine. Therapeutic response was established with the resolution of manifestations clinically objectified in the pre‐pandemic year (March 2019–March 2020). Instead in the following year, therapeutic response was assessed in telemedicine by patients' anamnestic data and by photos sent.

### Chronic annular plaques with new peripheral follicular plugging [^1132eciP]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 57-year-old White man presented with a 15-year history of bilateral hand and left forearm plaques. Six months prior to presentation to dermatology, he developed dark bumps at the border of the lesion on the left forearm (Fig 1) and right dorsal hand. He experienced intermittent pruritus. The patient was a former smoker with a past medical history notable for insulin-dependent type II diabetes. The patient worked as a truck driver for 28 years, with significant sun exposure. A punch biopsy was performed on a representative sample from his left forearm (Figs 2 and 3).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa
B. Nevus comedonicus
C. Granuloma annulare (GA) with comedones
D. Cutaneous sarcoidosis
E. Tinea corporis

Answers:
A. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa – Incorrect. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa is a perforating disease with histology showing transepidermal elastin elimination, not palisading granulomas as seen in this patient.
B. Nevus comedonicus – Incorrect. This condition presents with grouped comedone-like keratinous plugs often in a linear, not annular, plaque. Also, it usually appears at birth or before age 10.
C. GA with comedones – Correct. This patient's erythematous annular plaques had multiple open comedones at the peripheral border. Biopsy demonstrated palisaded granulomatous dermatitis with adjacent comedonal cyst and increased mucin, the latter highlighted by colloidal iron. In addition, CD123 marked the palisaded histiocytes.
D. Cutaneous sarcoidosis – Incorrect. Sarcoidosis is a granuloma forming skin condition. However, mucin would not be present on histopathology as seen in this patient.
E. Tinea corporis – Incorrect. Tinea corporis is a fungal infection that presents with annular plaques. However, this patient's skin lesions do not have peripheral scale that is typically associated with this infection.

### Topical antifungal treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis [^112KrRYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea infections are fungal infections of the skin caused by dermatophytes. It is estimated that 10% to 20% of the world population is affected by fungal skin infections. Sites of infection vary according to geographical location, the organism involved, and environmental and cultural differences. Both tinea corporis, also referred to as 'ringworm' and tinea cruris or 'jock itch' are conditions frequently seen by primary care doctors and dermatologists. The diagnosis can be made on clinical appearance and can be confirmed by microscopy or culture. A wide range of topical antifungal drugs are used to treat these superficial dermatomycoses, but it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antifungal treatments in tinea cruris and tinea corporis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 13th August 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We handsearched the journal Mycoses from 1957 to 1990.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with proven dermatophyte infection of the body (tinea corporis) or groin (tinea cruris).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses.

Main Results

Of the 364 records identified, 129 studies with 18,086 participants met the inclusion criteria. Half of the studies were judged at high risk of bias with the remainder judged at unclear risk. A wide range of different comparisons were evaluated across the 129 studies, 92 in total, with azoles accounting for the majority of the interventions. Treatment duration varied from one week to two months, but in most studies this was two to four weeks. The length of follow-up varied from one week to six months. Sixty-three studies contained no usable or retrievable data mainly due to the lack of separate data for different tinea infections. Mycological and clinical cure were assessed in the majority of studies, along with adverse effects. Less than half of the studies assessed disease relapse, and hardly any of them assessed duration until clinical cure, or participant-judged cure. The quality of the body of evidence was rated as low to very low for the different outcomes. Data for several outcomes for two individual treatments were pooled. Across five studies, significantly higher clinical cure rates were seen in participants treated with terbinafine compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 4.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.10 to 6.56, number needed to treat (NNT) 3, 95% CI 2 to 4). The quality of evidence for this outcome was rated as low. Data for mycological cure for terbinafine could not be pooled due to substantial heterogeneity. Mycological cure rates favoured naftifine 1% compared to placebo across three studies (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.14, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 4) with the quality of evidence rated as low. In one study, naftifine 1% was more effective than placebo in achieving clinical cure (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.16, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 5) with the quality of evidence rated as low. Across two studies, mycological cure rates favoured clotrimazole 1% compared to placebo (RR 2.87, 95% CI 2.28 to 3.62, NNT 2, 95% CI 2 to 3). Data for several outcomes were pooled for three comparisons between different classes of treatment. There was no difference in mycological cure between azoles and benzylamines (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07). The quality of the evidence was rated as low for this comparison. Substantial heterogeneity precluded the pooling of data for mycological and clinical cure when comparing azoles and allylamines. Azoles were slightly less effective in achieving clinical cure compared to azole and steroid combination creams immediately at the end of treatment (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84, NNT 6, 95% CI 5 to 13), but there was no difference in mycological cure rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05). The quality of evidence for these two outcomes was rated as low for mycological cure and very low for clinical cure. All of the treatments that were examined appeared to be effective, but most comparisons were evaluated in single studies. There was no evidence for a difference in cure rates between tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Adverse effects were minimal - mainly irritation and burning; results were generally imprecise between active interventions and placebo, and between different classes of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled data suggest that the individual treatments terbinafine and naftifine are effective. Adverse effects were generally mild and reported infrequently. A substantial number of the studies were more than 20 years old and of unclear or high risk of bias; there is however, some evidence that other topical antifungal treatments also provide similar clinical and mycological cure rates, particularly azoles although most were evaluated in single studies. There is insufficient evidence to determine if Whitfield's ointment, a widely used agent is effective. Although combinations of topical steroids and antifungals are not currently recommended in any clinical guidelines, relevant studies included in this review reported higher clinical cure rates with similar mycological cure rates at the end of treatment, but the quality of evidence for these outcomes was rated very low due to imprecision, indirectness and risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to confidently assess relapse rates in the individual or combination treatments. Although there was little difference between different classes of treatment in achieving cure, some interventions may be more appealing as they require fewer applications and a shorter duration of treatment. Further, high quality, adequately powered trials focusing on patient-centred outcomes, such as patient satisfaction with treatment should be considered.

### Treatment and diagnostic challenges associated with the novel and rapidly emerging antifungal-resistant dermatophyte [^117KeEEW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

T. indotineae dermatophytosis can be severe, covering large areas of the body, and challenging to treat. They can present as extensive, pruritic plaques, minimally inflammatory, primarily affecting the trunk, extremities, and groin, causing tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea faciei, and tinea genitalis. Central clearing is often absent, and plaques may resemble eczema, and post-cure pruritus has frequently been reported. Dark-skinned individuals can present with prominent pigmentation. Lesions may present in various atypical morphologies, including erythematous, scaly concentric plaques with a "pseudoimbricata" appearance, papulosquamous, pustular, or steroid-modified tinea forms. Patients often report a history of ineffective treatment with topical or oral antifungals, including TRB, and some may have recently traveled to or been in contact with individuals from countries where T. indotineae infections are prevalent. However, domestic cases in patients without travel history are increasingly being documented. The use of topical corticosteroid products often for severe pruritus can exacerbate the condition by masking symptoms and altering lesion morphology, complicating diagnosis and treatment. T. indotineae has rarely been implicated in nail or hair infections. To date, only two cases of onychomycosis have been reported — one from Italy in a patient who immigrated from India and the other in a French man — both involving toenails and associated with extensive tinea corporis, presenting with proximal erosion of the nail plate. The reasons for the limited involvement of T. indotineae in hair and nail infections as compared to other Trichophyton species remain unknown. Pavlovic et al. have suggested that poor keratolytic activity of T. indotineae may be the reason for rare nail infections. Some other possibilities may include its lack of lipolytic activity or it may have just been underreported.

### Scurvy and tinea corporis simulating leukocytoclastic vasculitis [^11672F7o]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is a small vessel inflammatory condition considered to be caused by circulating immune complexes and often occurs after an acute infection or exposure to a new medication, although it may be associated with an underlying systemic disease or be idiopathic in nature. It is important to determine the etiology, identify the extent of the disease for early intervention and appropriate management, and treat and/or eliminate the underlying cause. Here, we report cases of scurvy and tinea corporis that presented with histopathologic features of LCV and had significant clinical improvement with treatment of the underlying etiologies. These cases emphasize that histopathologic features of early evolving LCV may be seen in other settings including scurvy and tinea corporis. Appropriate treatment of the underlying condition is important for optimized patient management.

### Terbinafine used safely in autoimmune hepatitis for treatment of tinea corporis [^113raPC7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Terbinafine is often considered contraindicated in those with liver disease, as one of the known side effects is hepatotoxicity. We report the first case documenting the safe use of oral terbinafine in a 77-year-old woman with stable autoimmune hepatitis presenting with extensive tinea corporis. Precautions were carried out to minimise the risk of worsening hepatotoxicity, including consultation with the patient's hepatologist, limiting terbinafine exposure to less than 6 weeks, monitoring of liver function tests, and patient education. The patient's fungal infection cleared without any signs or symptoms of worsening liver disease. The rash had not recurred 6months after treatment. When terbinafine must be used in a patient with pre-existing liver disease, we recommend considering a short course of oral terbinafine after consultation with their hepatologist, obtaining baseline liver function tests with consideration of further monitoring during treatment course, and patient education on the signs and symptoms of liver injury.

### Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the use of telemedicine on the diagnosis and treatment of tinea corporis: an experience of Southern Italy center [^115rdmF6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The first finding was the decrease in the number of visits performed (Table 1), probably because many visits were deferred due to COVID‐19 and to the restrictions implemented by the Italian government on 10 March 2020. The average age of the patients who were visited was of 40 ± 2.7 standard deviation (SD) (March 2019–March 2020) versus 45 ± 3.2 SD (March 2020–March 2021). Moreover, in the period March 2020–2021, we observed a significant decrease in percentage of mycologically confirmed positive cases of Tinea Corporis (Table 1) compared with the percentage of positive patients in the period March 2019–2020 (77.6% vs. 59.8%, p < 0.01). The average duration in months of Tinea Corporis was of 2 ± 1.2 SD in the pre‐pandemic year, whereas in the year during the pandemic was of 3 ± 1.8 SD. We have also identified a significant decrease of resolution of manifestations at the 2 months follow‐up visit in the period 2020–2021, compared to the previous year (90.9% vs. 66.3%, p < 0.01) A chi‐squared test was used to test our hypothesis.

TABLE 1
Epidemiological and clinical features of patients

What emerges from this data is that the pandemic period had a significant impact on both diagnosis and responsiveness to therapies of patients affected by Tinea Corporis. In fact, patients, during the pandemic year (March 2020–March 2021), accessing with a greater latency to the first visit to our facility, had delayed diagnoses often complicated by home treatments.

We believe that the measures taken during the pandemic may have also affected the therapeutic response of patients, as it is known that dermatophytes have a marked tendency to develop resistance to antifungal agents in inveterate cases. Confirming this in our study at follow‐up visits after 2 months performed in telemedicine during March 2020–2021, more treatment failures were found comparing to the previous year. In addition, the mean duration of clinical manifestations was significantly longer in the pandemic year.

### Oxiconazole nitrate [^113xs1Nj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Oxiconazole nitrate cream should be applied to affected and immediately surrounding areas once to twice daily in patients with tinea pedis, tinea corporis, or tinea cruris. Oxiconazole nitrate cream should be applied once daily in the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor should be treated for 2 weeks and tinea pedis for 1 month to reduce the possibility of recurrence. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be reviewed.

Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk that may extend to the neck, arms, and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora.

### Evidence-based topical treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis: a summary of a cochrane systematic review [^112bMr62]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Tinea cruris and tinea corporis are common fungal infections. Most can be treated with a variety of topical antifungals. This review aimed to assess the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of topical treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Searches included the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, LILACS and ongoing trials registries (August 2013). One hundred and twenty-nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 18 086 participants evaluated a range of interventions - mostly azoles. Pooling of data for several outcomes was only possible for two individual treatments. In five studies, terbinafine showed a statistically significant higher clinical cure rate compared with placebo [risk ratio (RR) 4.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.10–6.56]. Data for mycological cure could not be pooled owing to substantial heterogeneity. Across three studies, mycological cure rates favoured naftifine (1%) compared with placebo (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.80–3.14) but the quality of the evidence was low. Combinations of azoles with corticosteroids were slightly more effective than azoles for clinical cure, but there was no statistically significant difference with regard to mycological cure. Sixty-five studies were assessed as 'unclear' and 64 as being at 'high risk' of bias; many were over 20 years old, and most were poorly designed and inadequately reported. Although most active interventions showed sufficient therapeutic effect, this review highlights the need for further, high-quality, adequately powered RCTs to evaluate the effects of these interventions, which can ultimately provide reliable evidence to inform clinical decision making.

### Topical treatment of common superficial tinea infections [^1138Uspt]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Tinea infections are superficial fungal infections caused by three species of fungi collectively known as dermatophytes. Commonly these infections are named for the body part affected, including tinea corporis (general skin), tinea cruris (groin), and tinea pedis (feet). Accurate diagnosis is necessary for effective treatment. Diagnosis is usually based on history and clinical appearance plus direct microscopy of a potassium hydroxide preparation. Culture or histologic examination is rarely required for diagnosis. Treatment requires attention to exacerbating factors such as skin moisture and choosing an appropriate antifungal agent. Topical therapy is generally successful unless the infection covers an extensive area or is resistant to initial therapy. In these cases, systemic therapy may be required. Tinea corporis and cruris infections are usually treated for two weeks, while tinea pedis is treated for four weeks with an azole or for one to two weeks with allylamine medication. Treatment should continue for at least one week after clinical clearing of infection. Newer medications require fewer applications and a shorter duration of use. The presence of inflammation may necessitate the use of an agent with inherent anti-inflammatory properties or the use of a combination antifungal/steroid agent. The latter agents should be used with caution because of their potential for causing atrophy and other steroid-associated complications.

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^111qw2Ps]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recurrent PR episodes often resemble the initial rash in appearance and distribution. However, they can differ in duration, severity, and pattern of distribution to be more localized or involve different anatomic areas. For some patients, recurrent episodes are shorter, while others may experience longer durations compared with the initial episode. The interval between episodes can vary significantly, ranging from a few months to several years. Some studies suggest that recurrent episodes tend to be milder, with less body surface involvement and fewer systemic symptoms. However, this is not always the case, as some patients report equally or even more severe symptoms during recurrences.

Before diagnosing recurrent PR, it is crucial to rule out other conditions that may mimic the rash, particularly if the presentation differs from the typical PR pattern. Conditions such as tinea corporis, secondary syphilis, and drug-induced rashes should be initially excluded. A thorough history, including details about recent drug use, sexual history, and infections, is essential in the diagnostic workup. Serological testing for syphilis and other infections should be performed, especially if the patient is at high risk or the rash appears atypical. If the diagnosis remains uncertain, a skin biopsy may be useful. However, because PR is rarely biopsied, many cases labeled as recurrences may not be true PR recurrences. This diagnostic uncertainty is further complicated by the self-limiting nature of PR, which often resolves without intervention, making it less likely for clinicians to pursue biopsy in recurrent or atypical cases. Thus, caution should be exercised when diagnosing recurrences without biopsy confirmation. Histopathological examination can help distinguish PR from other mimicking conditions. If a drug-induced cause is suspected, discontinuing the offending medication and considering alternative treatments is recommended.

### Bilateral sole hyperkeratosis and nonhealing foot mass [^1113tr7f]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 1: What is the diagnosis?
A. Tinea pedis
B. HIV
C. Psoriasis
D. Syphilis
E. Mal de meleda
Answers:
A. Tinea pedis – Incorrect. Tinea pedis with Trichophyton rubrum can present with involvement on the bilateral soles in a moccasin distribution with fine scale and can have palmar involvement — so-called "two foot one hand".
B. HIV – Incorrect. HIV can cause varied cutaneous eruptions with many associated infections and malignancies but on its own does not typically present with palmoplantar keratoderma.
C. Psoriasis – Incorrect. Psoriasis can present with confluent erythematous scaly plaques on the palms and soles. It is helpful to examine the remainder of the skin for any psoriasiform plaques in a characteristic distribution and the nails for any changes concerning for psoriasis. This patient had one lesion on his ankle but otherwise his skin was clear, and he did not have nail findings. Skin biopsy is helpful in excluding this diagnosis.
D. Syphilis – Correct. Syphilis is the correct diagnosis for this patient with rapidly progressive painful, hyperkeratotic plaques on the soles with erythematous thin scaly plaque on the hand. Syphilis is a chronic bacterial infection with Treponema pallidum sub. pallidum, a slow-growing spirochete. Primary syphilis refers to the initial lesion that occurs at the site of inoculation, commonly a painless chancre, that lasts for 3 to 6 weeks. Secondary syphilis is the longest stage and cutaneous manifestations range widely. After resolution of the cutaneous manifestations of secondary syphilis, patients enter latent-stage syphilis. Patients may get additional cutaneous manifestations while in this stage, which can make them contagious. Complications of latent syphilis include neurosyphilis, cardiovascular syphilis, or gummatous syphilis. On histology, patients may show slender rete ridges with plasma cell inflammation (Fig 3) and actual spirochetes with a treponemal immunohistochemical stain (Fig 4). In this case, the patient presented with skin findings and a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) concerning for secondary syphilis.
E. Mal de meleda – Incorrect. Mal de meleda is an autosomal recessive form of painful palmoplantar keratoderma caused by mutation in Ly-6/uPar–related protein. It is most commonly seen in patients from the island of Meleda. Patients can present with hyperhidrosis, malodor, and perioral erythema.

4.2.6 Candidiasis

In nappy eczema, the diagnosis may include AD, ACD but also Candida, which often also acts as a cofactor. Of note is congenital candida, which has burn‐like manifestations, with desquamation, which can make diagnosis difficult.

4.2.7 Tinea corporis and capitis

Although the classic appearance of tinea corporis is an erythematous ring‐shaped plaque with central resolution, atypical morphology is not uncommon and may lead to suspicion of AD, ND or pityriasis rosea. Tinea capitis, on the other hand, when presenting with fine non‐inflamed plaques, may resemble ISD or AD. However, the presence of alopecia, pustules, lymphadenopathy, and broken hair may help the diagnosis. Microscopic examination is a useful tool, but the presence of hyphae does not necessarily exclude AD.,

4.2.8 Scabies

Because of the severe itching and eczematous dermatitis involved, scabies is among the differential diagnoses of AD. However, scabies itching is localized mainly to the armpits and groin in children, as well as to the interdigital spaces, which are not typical sites for eczema. A positive history of itching, especially nocturnal itching, in other family members helps the diagnosis. The dermoscopic examination looking for the mite and the burrow confirms the diagnosis.

### Treatment and diagnostic challenges associated with the novel and rapidly emerging antifungal-resistant dermatophyte [^114ZNbs2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSIS AND CHALLENGES IN THE LABORATORY DETECTION OF T. INDOTINEAE

Clinical diagnosis of tinea infections is challenging due to their resemblance to other conditions with similar lesions. For instance, eczema can mimic tinea corporis, and alopecia areata can mimic tinea capitis (TC), and nail dystrophy caused by repeated minor trauma can mimic onychomycosis. Both resemblance to other lesions and alteration in the appearance of the lesion due to prior treatment with steroids and antifungal agents can lead to misdiagnosis. Accurate diagnosis of dermatophytosis is essential for timely treatment and preventing transmission.

Microscopy and culture

While the gold standard for dermatophyte identification remains microscopic examination of clinical samples, followed by culture to determine the specific fungal species, these methods cannot reliably identify T. indotineae. Morphological identification is particularly challenging due to overlapping microscopic and macroscopic features between T. indotineae and its related species T. mentagrophytes/T. interdigitale.

Physiological tests such as the urea slant test and HPT are helpful in differentiating T. mentagrophytes from T. indotineae. However, these tests require prolonged incubation, are not routinely performed in routine mycology laboratories, and cannot decisively identify to the species level. Overall, the culture method and subsequent identification process are quite lengthy, making it unsuitable as a routine diagnostic test for dermatophytosis caused by T. indotineae.

### Dermatophyte infection presenting as flat topped / lichenoid papules: an unusual presentation [^115VSEUi]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dermatophytosis are superficial fungal infections of the skin, hair, or nails caused by the filamentous fungi known as ringworm or tineas. The clinical features of dermatophyte infection depend on the causative organism and the host immunity; they can last for months or years, and infected individuals can be asymptomatic or have solely pruritus. Tinea corporis, also called ringworm of the body, has a characteristic morphology, which is well defined round annular pink patches with raised edges and central clearing. Atypical presentations of tinea corporis reported in the literature include: targetoid bullous lesions over the neck, trunk and forearm, subcutaneous nodules/abscesses over the lower extremities and erythematous papules/plaques over the back and posterior arms of a neonate.

We present a 14-month old boy with unusual numerous dermatophytic lichenoid-like papules over the back.

### Annular lesions: diagnosis and treatment [^112AmniE]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Annular lesions can present in a variety of diseases. Knowledge of the physical appearance and history of presentation of these skin findings can help in the diagnosis. A pruritic, annular, erythematous patch that grows centrifugally should prompt evaluation for tinea corporis. Tinea corporis may be diagnosed through potassium hydroxide examination of scrapings. Recognizing erythema migrans is important in making the diagnosis of Lyme disease so that antibiotics can be initiated promptly. Plaque psoriasis generally presents with sharply demarcated, erythematous silver plaques. Erythema multiforme, which is due to a hypersensitivity reaction, presents with annular, raised lesions with central clearing. Lichen planus characteristically appears as planar, purple, polygonal, pruritic papules and plaques. Nummular eczema presents as a rash composed of coin-shaped papulovesicular erythematous lesions. Treatment is aimed at reducing skin dryness. Pityriasis rosea presents with multiple erythematous lesions with raised, scaly borders, and is generally self-limited. Urticaria results from the release of histamines and appears as well-circumscribed, erythematous lesions with raised borders and blanched centers. Annular lesions occur less commonly in persons with fixed drug eruptions, leprosy, immunoglobulin A vasculitis, secondary syphilis, sarcoidosis, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and granuloma annulare.

### Ketoconazole cream, 2% (ketoconazole) [^111howM7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Cutaneous candidiasis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor: It is recommended that Ketoconazole Cream, 2% be applied once daily to cover the affected and immediate surrounding area. Clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks in order to reduce thepossibility of recurrence. Patients with tinea versicolor usually require two weeks of treatment. Patients with tinea pedis require six weeks of treatment.

Seborrheic dermatitis: Ketoconazole cream, 2% should be applied to the affected area twice daily for four weeks or until no clinical clearing.

If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be redetermined.

### Miconazole nitrate (Monistat-derm) [^114j2aUY]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Dosage and Administration:

Sufficient MONISTAT-DERM Cream should be applied to cover affected areas twice daily (morning and evening) in patients with tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, and cutaneous candidiasis, and once daily in patients with tinea versicolor. If MONISTAT-DERM Cream is used in intertriginous areas, it should be applied sparingly and smoothed in well to avoid maceration effects.

Early relief of symptoms (2 to 3 days) is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, Candida infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks and tinea pedis for one month in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after a month of treatment, the diagnosis should be redetermined. Patients with tinea versicolor usually exhibit clinical and mycological clearing after two weeks of treatment.

### Treatments of tinea pedis [^112FBpH2]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

The severity of tinea pedis infection determines the course of treatment required. Mild infections may be resolved using a topical agent. More severe presentations (eg, dermatophytosis complex) may require treatment that eliminates the bacterial and fungal infection. Some topical monotherapies may exhibit both antifungal and antibacterial activity. In other instances, it may be necessary to combine an antifungal agent with an antibacterial agent. If inflammation is present, an agent with known anti-inflammatory action may need to be used. The chronic presentation of tinea pedis (dry type) sometimes does not respond well to topical therapy. In such instances, systemic antifungal therapy is required to ensure that adequate concentrations of the therapeutic agent are present at the site of infection.

### Tinea capitis mimicking cicatricial alopecia: what host and dermatophyte factors lead to this unusual clinical presentation? [^1178V31c]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection in children. The clinical presentation varies from subtle asymptomatic scaling to inflammatory suppurative nodules and draining tracks. Both chronic and acute inflammatory infections may damage the hair follicle leading to secondary cicatricial alopecia. In rare instances, the initial presentation can mimic a primary cicatricial alopecia. We present three cases of tinea capitis in children masquerading as cicatricial alopecia and discuss the possible host immune and fungal antigenic factors that may influence the course of disease and its clinical presentation. An understanding of the clinical morphology of tinea capitis in the context of both host and fungal factors may improve treatment strategies and direct future paradigms of therapy.

### Tinea corporis, tinea cruris… [^113ztYje]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

The term tinea means fungal infection, whereas dermatophyte refers to the fungal organisms that cause tinea. Tinea is usually followed by a Latin term that designates the involved site, such as tinea corporis and tinea pedis. Tinea versicolor is not caused by dermatophytes but rather by yeasts of the genus Malassezia. Tinea unguium is more commonly known as onychomycosis. Dermatophytes are usually limited to involvement of hair, nails, and stratum corneum, which are inhospitable to other infectious agents. Dermatophytes include three genera: Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. MANAGEMENT Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis are generally responsive to topical creams such as terbinafine and butenafine, but oral antifungal agents may be indicated for extensive disease, failed topical treatment, immunocompromised patients, or severe moccasin-type tinea pedis.

Patients with chronic or recurrent tinea pedis may benefit from wide shoes, drying between the toes after bathing, and placing lamb's wool between the toes. |Do not use topical clotrimazole or miconazole to treat tinea because topical butenafine and terbinafine have better effectiveness and similar cost. |. 4 There are three types of tinea capitis: gray patch, black dot, and favus. Black dot, caused by Trichophyton tonsurans, is most common in the United States. Early disease can be limited to itching and scaling, but the more classic presentation involves one or more scaly patches of alopecia with hairs broken at the skin line and crusting. 2, 7, 8 The most common mimics include seborrheic dermatitis and alopecia areata. 2, 3 In atypical cases, a KOH preparation can be performed by scraping the black dots and looking for fungal spores. The spores of T.

tonsurans will be contained within the hair shaft, but for the less common Microsporum canis, the spores will coat the outside of the hair shaft.

### Emergence of difficult-to-treat tinea corporis caused by trichophyton mentagrophytes complex isolates, paris, France [^113YQPsD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Dermatophytes are filamentous keratinophilic fungi responsible for superficial fungal diseases involving the skin, hair, or nails. On the basis of the site of the lesions, conditions are called tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea capitis, tinea pedis, or tinea unguium. Since the mid-2010s, difficult-to-treat cases of tinea corporis and tinea cruris have emerged in India; molecular analysis revealed that this clinical presentation was caused by a unique clade related to the Trichophyton mentagrophytes complex. Since 2018, we have observed several cases of clinically resistant tinea corporis with extensive lesions that do not respond to terbinafine, the preferred first-line treatment. We investigated the microbiological origin of this resistance by looking for mutations in the squalene epoxidase (SQLE) gene, which terbinafine targets, and determining the MICs of antifungal drugs.

### Persistent annular dermatosis: unraveling the cause of a 2-year rash [^113cTPYA]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Annular sarcoidosis – Incorrect. Sarcoidosis can also demonstrate annular plaques with a violaceous or brownish hue. Histology reveals noncaseating granulomas, often with systemic involvement.
B. Annular psoriasis – Incorrect. Annular psoriasis typically has well-defined, raised, plaques with silvery scale and central clearing, while the most well-described variant of lichen planus appears as flat-topped, purple, polygonal papules or plaques.
C. Annular lichen planus – Correct. Annular lichen planus is a rare morphological subtype of lichen planus, characterized by ring-shaped, violaceous, or hyperpigmented plaques with slightly raised nonscaly borders. It commonly affects the male genitalia, groin, axillae, and extremities. The etiology remains unclear but is thought to involve genetic predisposition, stress, skin trauma, and infections. Lichen planus has also been associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, with studies suggesting a higher prevalence of HCV in patients with cutaneous lichen planus, particularly in endemic regions. Annular lesions are typically isolated, and histopathological examination reveals classic features of lichen planus in the active edge of the lesion. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but histopathology can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment includes topical corticosteroids, systemic immunosuppressants, and phototherapy. Prognosis is variable, with some cases resolving spontaneously and others persisting or recurring.
D. Mycosis fungoides – Incorrect. Mycosis fungoides is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which evolves slowly with patch and plaque formation with/without erythroderma, with histology showing abnormal T-cell infiltration.
E. Tinea corporis – Incorrect. Tinea corporis presents with scaly ring-shaped lesions and may be confirmed by potassium hydroxide prep showing fungal hyphae.

### Notes from the field: first reported U.S. cases of tinea caused by trichophyton indotineae-new york city, December 2021-March 2023 [^1145iQp9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Tinea is a common, highly contagious, superficial infection of the skin, hair, or nails caused by dermatophyte molds. * During the past decade, an epidemic of severe, antifungal-resistant tinea has emerged in South Asia because of the rapid spread of Trichophyton indotineae, † a novel dermatophyte species; the epidemic has likely been driven by misuse and overuse of topical antifungals and corticosteroids §. T. indotineae infections are highly transmissible and characterized by widespread, inflamed, pruritic plaques on the body (tinea corporis), the crural fold, pubic region, and adjacent thigh (tinea cruris), or the face (tinea faciei). T. indotineae isolates are frequently resistant to terbinafine, a mainstay of tinea treatment. T. indotineae infections have been reported throughout Asia and in Europe and Canada but have not previously been described in the United States.

On February 28, 2023, a New York City dermatologist notified public health officials of two patients who had severe tinea that did not improve with oral terbinafine treatment, raising concern for potential T. indotineae infection; these patients shared no epidemiologic links. Skin culture isolates from each patient were previously identified by a clinical laboratory as Trichophyton mentagrophytes and were subsequently forwarded to the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, for further review and analysis. Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal gene, followed by phylogenetic analysis performed during March 2023, identified the isolates as T. indotineae (Supplementary Figure;). Activity related to this investigation was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

### Common tinea infections in children [^11658ib2]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

The common dermatophyte genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton are major causes of superficial fungal infections in children. These infections (e.g., tinea corporis, pedis, cruris, and unguium) are typically acquired directly from contact with infected humans or animals or indirectly from exposure to contaminated soil or fomites. A diagnosis usually can be made with a focused history, physical examination, and potassium hydroxide microscopy. Occasionally, Wood's lamp examination, fungal culture, or histologic tissue examination is required. Most tinea infections can be managed with topical therapies; oral treatment is reserved for tinea capitis, severe tinea pedis, and tinea unguium. Topical therapy with fungicidal allylamines may have slightly higher cure rates and shorter treatment courses than with fungistatic azoles. Although oral griseofulvin has been the standard treatment for tinea capitis, newer oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole are effective, safe, and have shorter treatment courses.

### Clinical course, antifungal susceptibility, and genomic sequencing of trichophyton indotineae [^113GLHvg]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

The median (range) time from tinea onset to diagnosis was 10 (3 [patient H] to 42 [patient K]) months. All patients had lesions affecting multiple body sites, most commonly the trunk, extremities, buttocks, and groin; 2 patients (patients F and G) had facial involvement. Nine patients reported pruritus. Six patients received medium- to high-potency topical corticosteroids before tinea diagnosis; 2 patients received the topical corticosteroid as part of combination corticosteroid-antifungal creams obtained in Bangladesh. All patients received at least 1 topical antifungal medication, none of which was effective as monotherapy. Duration of topical and oral antifungal therapy and adherence to therapy abroad before presentation were unknown. Ten of the patients received multiple topical antifungal agents. All patients demonstrated incomplete responses to typical doses and duration of oral antifungal therapy for tinea corporis/cruris (Figure 1).

The patient was treated with 6 weeks of itraconazole, 100 mg twice daily.

Seven patients (patients A, B, D, F, G, J, and K) received a course of terbinafine without resolution of infection. Terbinafine doses were universally 250 mg daily and ranged from 14 days (patients B, J, and K) to 28 days (patients D and F) to 42 days (patient A). The dose and duration of terbinafine for 1 patient (patient G) was unknown. Seven patients' isolates had elevated terbinafine MIC values (range, 0.5 to > 128 μg/mL). AFST data and terbinafine MIC values were unavailable for patient A, as this patient's isolate was not saved. Three patients (patients C, E, and I) who did not receive oral terbinafine treatment had isolates with terbinafine MIC values of 0.0039 μg/mL or lower.

### Tinea corporis with acute inflammation caused by trichophyton tonsurans [^111HBqnK]. The Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

A 13-year-old Japanese boy presented with acute skin inflammation on the extremities. He belonged to a judo club of a junior high school in which club tinea capitis and tinea corporis seemed to be prevalent. Vesicles and pustules appeared on his right forearm and right leg. They increased in numbers and formed annular lesions. Pruritic erythema appeared surrounding these lesions. Direct microscopic examination of the lesions detected hyphae, and culture for the fungi yielded yellowish colonies. The result of culture from pustules revealed Staphylococcus aureus. At first, a topical antifungal drug and systemic antibiotics seemed to cure annular lesions, but pustules arose again. A large surrounding erythema was cured by topical treatment with a steroid agent. A biopsy specimen from a pustule showed hyphae of fungi within a hair shaft and in the bulb. The restriction fragment length polymorphism in the internal transcribed spacer regions of the ribosomal gene (polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism) revealed a banding pattern compatible with Trichophyton tonsurans. Treatment with systemic itraconazole was begun and lesions disappeared immediately. Systemic antifungal therapy was needed in our case. Tinea corporis with inflammation necessitates systemic antifungal therapy.

### Annular lupus vulgaris: a case report [^116oNdjh]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

The absolute criteria for cutaneous TB diagnosis is the demonstration of M tuberculosis either in tissue culture or by polymerase chain reaction. The relative criteria consist of the following: (1) the presence of characteristic clinical features for cutaneous TB; (2) proven TB infection elsewhere in the body; (3) the presence of acid-fast bacilli on lesional skin; (4) a positive reaction on tuberculin skin test; (5) the presence of typical histopathologic features; and (6) good response to the antituberculosis drug. The diagnosis of LV in our patient was established according to 2 relative criteria: characteristic histopathologic findings and a good response after antituberculosis treatment.

Histopathology is a valuable diagnostic modality in LV. The most prominent histologic features of LV are well-formed granulomas with scanty or absent central caseation. The granulomas are composed of Langhans giant cells and mature epithelioid cells with dense lymphocytic infiltrates. The histopathologic result in our patient supported the diagnosis of LV. Agarwal et alreported that among the 19 patients diagnosed with LV, positive culture were only found in 1 case, whereas positive polymerase chain reaction was found in 3 cases. In contrast, histopathology features supportive of LV was found in all 19 cases. Based on this findings, histopathology is suggested as the first diagnostic modality to be performed in establishing LV diagnosis. Furthermore, study by Sharquie et alshowed that 3 out of 72 cutaneous patients with TB were diagnosed based on the responsiveness to antituberculosis treatment.

The wide range of LV clinical presentations can resemble various other dermatoses, making diagnosis challenging. Furthermore, LV presenting with annular morphology is frequently mistaken for other dermatoses because of its atypical presentation, as shown in Table I. Our patient had attempted multiple treatments using topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. She had also received antifungal treatment likely under the diagnosis of tinea corporis, without significant improvement, making a total time of 3 years to LV diagnosis.

Table I
Studies reporting annular lupus vulgaris

LV is treated with standard antituberculosis therapy for extrapulmonary TB based on the national TB Control Program guidelines in Indonesia. In our patient, improvement in skin lesions was observed after 8 weeks of treatment, and a 6-month course of treatment was planned.

### Ketoconazole 2% and urea 20% (podiatrole) [^116tK3Zb]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Cutaneous candidiasis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor

It is recommended that ketoconazole cream, 2% be applied once daily to cover the affected and immediate surrounding area. Clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence.

Patients with tinea versicolor usually require two weeks of treatment. Patients with tinea pedis require six weeks of treatment.

Seborrheic dermatitis

Ketoconazole cream, 2% should be applied to the affected area twice daily for four weeks or until clinical clearing.

If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be redetermined.

### Griseofulvin [^112TyTBH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of tinea pedis, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as dermatophytes. Griseofulvin tablets, USP will not eradicate these associated bacterial or yeast infections.

ADULTS: 0.5 g daily (125 mg q.i.d., 250 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg/day). Patients with less severe or 300 extensive infections may require less, whereas those with widespread lesions may require a starting dose of 0.75 g to 1 g/day. This may be reduced gradually to 0.5 g or less after a response has been noted. In all cases, the dosage should be individualized.

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (older than 2 years): A dosage of 10 mg/kg daily is usually adequate (pediatric patients from 30 to 50 lb, 125 mg to 250 mg daily; pediatric patients over 50 lb, 250 mg to 500 mg daily, in divided doses). Dosage should be individualized, as with adults. Clinical relapse will occur if the medication is not continued until the infecting organism is eradicated.

Safety is not established at higher doses than recommended.

### Response to Gu et al's "Treatment-resistant dermatophytosis: a representative case highlighting an emerging public health threat" [^113EiYVJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: A complementary case to Gu et al'scase identifying treatment-resistant dermatophytosis as an emerging public health threat has been identified. Recent literature indicates a global rise in resistance of Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, known causes of tinea infections, to terbinafine. Gu et aldemonstrated a case of resistant T. rubrum in the United States, but to the authors' knowledge, resistance of T. mentagrophytes has not been reported. Resistance poses an alarming challenge due to the limited availability of systemic antifungals. Additionally, a potential long-term consequence of untreated tinea infections is postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, particularly in patients with darker Fitzpatrick skin types. We describe a case of terbinafine-resistant tinea corporis caused by T. mentagrophytes.

A 50-year-old man, Fitzpatrick skin type IV, with no pertinent past medical history, presented with annular, scaling plaques on the upper and lower extremities and was clinically diagnosed with tinea corporis. Oral terbinafine 250-mg daily was prescribed. After a 2-month course of terbinafine, he returned to the clinic with a worsening clinical presentation (Fig 1). Biopsy of a right arm plaque was obtained, and cultures revealed T. mentagrophytes; PAS stain identified fungal elements consistent with tinea corporis. Second-line treatment, itraconazole 200-mg daily for 2 weeks in addition to topical ciclopirox, was then prescribed. He was contacted 3 weeks following the initiation of this regimen, and he reported complete resolution of all lesions. However, he noted extensive dark patches in previous lesional areas, consistent with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.

### Tinea capitis mimicking favus in rural Washington state [^114tRhwK]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Favus is a chronic inflammatory dermatophyte infection of the scalp. This condition occurs more commonly in impoverished countries and is associated with poor sanitation. The responsible organism is typically T schoenleinii, with T rubrum cited as the cause less than 1% of the time. T rubrum infections most commonly present as tinea pedis, tinea unguium, tinea corporis, or tinea cruris. T rubrum causing scrotal favus has been observed in immunocompromised patients. Cases of tinea capitis caused by T rubrum have been reported in pediatric as well as adult patients in developed countries.

Classical favus begins with folliculocentric erythema of the scalp followed by formation of the pathognomonic scutulum. Severe presentations involve more than one-third of the scalp, extensive hair loss, atrophy, and scarring. Affected skin may have an unpleasant "cheesy" or "mousy", odor and secondary bacterial infections can occur. Favus may also have a honeycomb appearance, as our patient's scalp demonstrated.

The scutula of favus are concave, cup-shaped yellow keratotic crusts on the scalp that contain fungal hyphae. Despite our patient's presentation with extreme heaped up crusts and abundance of fungal forms, the lack of scutula and atypical causative organism suggest the possibility of tinea capitis mimicking favus, rather than a classic favus case. Tinea capitis mimicking favus caused by T rubrum has been reported previously in an elderly woman with dementia. Additionally, favus is unusual in developed countries, and this patient lives in a private home.

We suspect this patient's skin condition was caused by the combination of unsanitary living environment and delay to treatment. The patient's living conditions and access to care resembled that of a resource-poor region where favus typically presents. Our case report supports the rare but potential occurrence of tinea capitis mimicking favus in developed countries such as the United States in this setting. It also highlights an alternate fungus, T rubrum, as a less commonly encountered organism capable of causing an exuberant cutaneous fungal infection.

### Cutaneous infections dermatophytosis, onychomycosis, and tinea versicolor [^115iuH8W]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Cutaneous fungal infections cause significant morbidity for healthy and ill patients. The incidence of some dermatomycoses is increasing, despite availability of newer and better topical and systemic treatments. Fungal remnants last months to years under the ideal conditions, allowing continued spread of infection. Mycoses treated in one area may recur because of organism travel from concomitant areas of infection. Failure of patients and physicians to recognize a fungal etiology early may lead to more extensive, severe, or difficult-to-treat infections. Finally, a patient's concurrent illnesses may play a part in susceptibility and ability to manage fungal infections. For these reasons, scientists have studied and developed newer antifungal agents with better efficacy and greater convenience in dosing. These drugs, however, still have side effects and medication interactions that may limit their use in some patients. Better efforts to educate patients and physicians alike may aid in faster recognition and treatment of dermatophytoses. More research is needed to continue to develop drugs suitable for use in a broader range of patients and diagnostic tests that may be quicker or more specific than conventional ones.

Tinea (recalcitrant infections and corticosteroid combinations) — when a returned traveler has a recalcitrant fungal infection, consider obtaining culture for species identification; a longer course of high-dose oral antifungals might be needed to treat severe or recurrent infections caused by emerging drug-resistant Trichophyton species, such as Trichophyton indotineae, detected in travelers returning from South and Southeast Asia; topical medications that combine an antifungal agent with a potent corticosteroid are available in many countries, and clinicians should caution travelers against their use because adverse events include longer-lasting infections, more extensive spread over large areas of the body, invasion into deeper skin layers, unusual presentation making diagnosis more challenging, and severe redness and burning.

### Treatment-resistant dermatophytosis: a representative case highlighting an emerging public health threat [^117Wjso3]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Superficial dermatophytoses are among the most common conditions prompting patients to seek dermatologic evaluation. The dermatophyte, T rubrum, is the most frequent cause of onychomycosis and cutaneous infection in the United States. Despite its prevalence, microbiologically proven drug resistance is rare and most patients improve with oral terbinafine. However, we have recently seen numerous cases of extensive tinea corporis from T rubrum that was initially resistant to terbinafine or recurred rapidly after a brief interval improvement. Although uncommon, these cases have been increasing in frequency, and we have seen several patients in our clinic with widespread cutaneous disease that persisted despite prolonged treatment with oral terbinafine or second-line systemic therapies (oral fluconazole or itraconazole). Treatment-resistant dermatophytosis has emerged as a public health threat in endemic areas like India. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no such cases of treatment-resistant dermatophytosis reported in the United States.

We have treated several cases of extensive and resistant T rubrum tinea corporis in otherwise healthy patients with no risk factors predisposing them to recurrent fungal infections including recent steroid use. Several patients did report a remote history of onychomycosis although most had no active nail involvement upon their initial presentation. A subset of patients initially responded to oral terbinafine and reported clearance within 2 weeks, although all noted recurrent and persistent lesions shortly after discontinuing treatment. Several patients, however, had no initial improvement with progressive disease while on therapy (Fig 1, A and B). Cultures from skin scrapings, in several cases, surprisingly resulted within a few days and showed T rubrum. Despite absence of clinical improvement, only some patients demonstrated terbinafine resistance on broth microdilution antifungal susceptibility testing (MIC > 0.5 μg/mL). Further workup including biopsies were unrevealing for inflammatory or alternative etiologies. Patients were switched to oral fluconazole or itraconazole in combination with topical agents. Most patients had partial improvement, although several had no clinical response despite continuous treatment on this alternative regimen.

### Tinea capitis in adult women masquerading as bacterial pyoderma [^113rhBZ8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis is generally thought to be a common disease in children but not in adults. Adults with tinea capitis generally present with scale and alopecia. We report 3 adults with inflammatory tinea capitis caused by Trichophyton tonsurans that resembled a bacterial infection. Of these patients, 2 were initially given a diagnosis of bacterial pyoderma. All patients were successfully treated with oral antifungal agents. One patient had significant eosinophilia that resolved with treatment. We conclude that tinea capitis should remain in the differential diagnosis of adults with alopecia and pyoderma-like presentations. A biopsy specimen was helpful in making the diagnosis in 2 of the 3 patients, but fungal culture confirmed the diagnosis in all cases.

### Refractory erythema annulare centrifugum treated with apremilast [^115LfoLt]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A woman in her 30s presented with 2 years of pruritic arcuate scaling plaques on the arms, chest, and back and was evaluated via teledermatology. She had previously been diagnosed with scalp psoriasis and was prescribed topical clobetasol and ketoconazole 2% shampoo for the scalp but had not used any treatments for the rest of her body. The submitted images showed few erythematous arcuate thin plaques with trailing light white scale on the right upper lateral to the anterior arm and left posterior shoulder to the upper back. The lesions did not appear consistent with psoriasis. Given the initial concern for tinea corporis, a potassium hydroxide scraping was recommended as well as a trial of topical terbinafine cream twice daily for 3 weeks.

At follow-up evaluation 4 weeks later via teledermatology, she had tried terbinafine without response and had new areas of involvement on her left arm. EAC was suspected given the chronicity and previous history of multiple unsuccessful treatments with antifungal creams, and in-person evaluation was recommended. At her in-person visit 4 weeks later, her examination revealed large annular pink patches with a trailing scale on the bilateral upper extremities and back. The presentation and history were determined to be most consistent with EAC. A potassium hydroxide preparation was negative, and a punch biopsy of the right arm was performed. Histologic examination demonstrated parakeratosis, mild acanthosis, spongiosis, and superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils "cuffed" around superficial dermal vessels, consistent with EAC (Fig 1).

### Clinical course, antifungal susceptibility, and genomic sequencing of trichophyton indotineae [^115535KA]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this case series is the largest US cohort describing T indotineae infections and highlights several important points. Patients experienced extensive, prolonged pruritic lesions that generally failed monotherapy with topical antifungals and showed inadequate response to typical doses and durations of oral antifungal medications, including prolonged terbinafine therapy at standard doses, consistent with findings from international reports. Diagnostic delays were common, and most patients did not have immunocompromising conditions that might predispose them to severe dermatophytosis. These findings, in addition to others (eg, recent travel to a high-prevalence region and/or initial laboratory culture identification of T mentagrophytes or T interdigitale in patients with compatible physical examination findings and history) should prompt consideration of T indotineae, which requires molecular-based techniques for definitive diagnosis. Because T indotineae identification was retrospective in most cases described in this report, treating dermatologists were often unaware of T indotineae diagnosis at the time of treatment, likely leading to the selection of ineffective or suboptimal antifungal treatment. Data highlight that 100-mg or 200-mg daily dosing of itraconazole for 6 to 8 weeks is the current preferred therapy, yet longer durations and higher doses may be required with reported relapse occurring. Terbinafine at higher than standard doses (500 mg daily) may be effective for some patients. Griseofulvin and fluconazole show limited efficacy.

### Spread of antifungal-resistant trichophyton indotineae, United kingdom, 2017–2024 [^113XGzek]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we show that T. indotineae was introduced into the United Kingdom from endemic areas and is spreading substantially. On the basis of current trends, we predict T. indotineae will rapidly become the predominant cause of tinea corporis in the United Kingdom. Clinicians and microbiology laboratorians should recognize this fungus as a predominant cause of tinea corporis.

### Bilateral sole hyperkeratosis and nonhealing foot mass [^111vCUgC]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 2: What would be the first step in your workup of this patient?
A. Wound culture
B. RPR
C. Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL)
D. HIV antibodies
E. Potassium hydroxide preparation
Answers:
A. Wound culture – Incorrect. Spirochetes are not identified on wound culture.
B. RPR – Correct. RPR is considered a nontreponemal test and is used as a screening test for syphilis, which is the correct answer. If the result is positive, it requires secondary testing to confirm the diagnosis. VDRL is another nontreponemal test. These tests result as antibody titers with a positive result being greater than 1:32. Titers can be followed after therapy to identify response to treatment.
C. VDRL – Incorrect. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) is a treponemal test and is generally reserved as a confirmatory test after a patient has had a positive screening nontreponemal test result. Some laboratories have a cost-effective and efficient test allowing it to be first line. Examples of treponemal tests include FTA-ABS, microhemagglutination test for antibodies to T pallidum, and T pallidum particle agglutination assay.
D. HIV antibodies – Incorrect. There is a growing cohort of patients who are presenting with co-infection of HIV and syphilis making HIV an important adjuvant test, but it would not lead to the primary diagnosis in this case.
E. Potassium hydroxide preparation – Incorrect. The patient does not have tinea pedis, and, as such, a potassium hydroxide preparation will not lead you to the diagnosis.

### Real world analysis of response rate and efficacy of oral ketoconazole in patients with recalcitrant tinea corporis and cruris [^116zaRSv]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Recalcitrant dermatophytosis has had an alarming rise in India with concomitant decreased effectiveness of conventional antifungal agents. This has prompted the use of second-line agents for treatment. In this retrospective study, we aimed to analyze the response rate, efficacy, relapse rate, and side effects of oral ketoconazole (KZ) in the treatment of recalcitrant tinea corporis and cruris. Institutional records were reviewed for patients presenting with tinea cruris or corporis who had failed treatment with conventional antifungal drugs and treated with oral KZ. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) findings, culture reports, and response to treatment was noted based on the percentage improvement in lesions and reduction in itching compared with baseline. Fourty-three patients (mean age 31.3 years) with tinea corporis/cruris who had taken prior treatment with antifungals were recruited in the study. KOH mount and culture were positive in 76.7% patients. Trichophyton mentagrophytes was the commonest species, isolated in 62.8% of patients. Ketoconazole showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration on antifungal susceptibility tests with various antifungals. With a dose of 400 mg daily, 67.4% of patients were cured of disease with mean duration of 9.4 weeks. Patients having less than 40% clearance at 2 weeks had a 68.9% less probability of getting cured of disease. Of the 29 patients cured, 37.9% relapsed because of various predisposing factors. Two patients developed increase in liver enzymes on treatment. Our analysis suggests that KZ can be used as alternative drug in cases with failure to conventional antifungal drugs. Though there are relapses, these can be partially explained by various predisposing factors that support fungal survival and transmission.

### Unusual presentation of tinea corporis associated with the use of a microneedling device [^1125EMEN]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 3.
Posterior aspect of both forearms (A) and anterior aspect of both thighs (B) of the same patient 3 weeks after starting the treatment with terbinafine 250 mg per os daily and topical sertaconazol twice daily. Great improvement was observed. The patient continued terbinafine for one more week, and topical sertaconazol until complete resolution.

Considering the patient's anamnesis and this unusual pattern of tinea corporis, with simultaneously arising lesions in the sites where the microneedling device was applied, we can consider that the disruption of the epidermis by the microneedles facilitated the infection of multiple sites when in contact with the infected cat and/or bed linen. Microneedling dramatically increases the skin's permeability to therapeutic and cosmeceutical substances by creating reversible microchannels in the skin. This enhanced permeability was shown to be optimal at 5 minutes after microneedling with 1 mm long needles, and drastically reduced after 30 minutes. Similarly, while open, these microchannels may facilitate the access of microorganisms or deleterious substances. The exact depth of needle penetration and the effects on skin permeability with the device used by the patient may differ from those results due to a higher density of shorter needles and variations in the pressure used. Nevertheless, in superficial mycoses, fungi invade keratinized tissues, so even if the depth of the microchannels is eventually smaller, the disruption of the stratum corneum is sufficient to facilitate a fungal infection. As the procedure was performed by the patient, a less rigorous pre- and postprocedural care with the device cannot be excluded, and might be an important additional factor.

Microneedling is a minimally invasive procedure, with a low risk of complications. However, even if it remains relatively intact, the epidermis is indeed disrupted, and this may predispose to cutaneous infections. This case report emphasizes the critical need for standardized protocols for safe microneedling techniques, specific regulatory guidelines for home vs medical usage, and avoidance of inadvertent exposure to infectious agents in the treatment environment. We strongly advise that patients be informed of the appropriate care with homecare rollers and to avoid undue exposure to contaminants during the critical period for reestablishment of the skin's barrier system. These concerns should apply equally to motorized devices and treatments in medical facilities. Although microneedling is usually a safe procedure, technical expertise during the procedure and vigilant proactive aftercare are essential to obtain successful outcomes and should be mandatory.

### Pityriasis rosea: diagnosis and treatment [^1158uASm]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a common self-limiting rash that usually starts with a herald patch on the trunk and progresses along the Langer lines to a generalized rash over the trunk and limbs. The diagnosis is based on clinical and physical examination findings. The herald patch is an erythematous lesion with an elevated border and depressed center. The generalized rash usually presents two weeks after the herald patch. Patients can develop general malaise, fatigue, nausea, headaches, joint pain, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and sore throat before or during the course of the rash. The differential diagnosis includes secondary syphilis, seborrheic dermatitis, nummular eczema, pityriasis lichenoides chronica, tinea corporis, viral exanthems, lichen planus, and pityriasis rosea-like eruption associated with certain medications. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms and consists of corticosteroids or antihistamines. In some cases, acyclovir can be used to treat symptoms and reduce the length of disease.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of tinea pedis, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as dermatophytes. Griseofulvin tablets, USP will not eradicate these associated bacterial or yeast infections.

ADULTS: 0.5 g daily (125 mg q.i.d., 250 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg/day). Patients with less severe or 300 extensive infections may require less, whereas those with widespread lesions may require a starting dose of 0.75 g to 1 g/day. This may be reduced gradually to 0.5 g or less after a response has been noted. In all cases, the dosage should be individualized.

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (older than 2 years): A dosage of 10 mg/kg daily is usually adequate (pediatric patients from 30 to 50 lb, 125 mg to 250 mg daily; pediatric patients over 50 lb, 250 mg to 500 mg daily, in divided doses). Dosage should be individualized, as with adults. Clinical relapse will occur if the medication is not continued until the infecting organism is eradicated.

Safety is not established at higher doses than recommended.

### Treatment and diagnostic challenges associated with the novel and rapidly emerging antifungal-resistant dermatophyte [^113eJgSZ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dermatophytosis is a superficial mycosis of the skin, hair, and nails caused by dermatophytes, which are keratinophilic fungi. Trichophyton species causes the majority of dermatophyte infections. Infections are acquired through contact with infected humans, animals, soil, or contaminated fomites. Dermatophyte infections have generally responded well to first-line oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine (TRB), griseofulvin, and azoles. However, since 2016, Indian dermatologists started reporting widespread, chronic dermatophytosis resistant to first-line antifungal treatment, notably TRB. These isolates were negative for both urease and hair perforation tests (HPTs). Subsequently, these isolates were identified as Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VIII. In 2020, based on clinical, mycological, and molecular features, this TRB-resistant Trichophyton species belonging to T. mentagrophytes genotype VIII was described as a novel species and designated as Trichophyton indotineae to indicate the country (India) from where it was first reported. However, in a recent publication, the appropriateness of the name T. indotineae has been questioned, with two major concerns: the pejorative connotation of the term indotineae and inadequate information regarding the origin of this novel dermatophyte.

Over the past decade, India has experienced an alarming rise in T. indotineae infections.

A recent survey revealed that 78% of dermatophyte cases in the country are caused by T. indotineae. It is hypothesized that widespread availability and misuse of topical corticosteroid creams and antifungal agents in India contributed to the emergence of this infection. T. indotineae causes extensive, recalcitrant tinea cruris and tinea corporis, including atypical locations such as genitalia. Now endemic to both India and Iran, T. indotineae has also been identified in imported cases worldwide, with occasional reports of limited local transmission, highlighting the risk of epidemic spread to more countries in the near future. The rapid emergence and importation of this drug-resistant dermatophyte to many countries present a significant public health problem, highlighting the urgent need for better diagnostic tools and methods for the detection of T. indotineae and better treatment options.

### Inadequate diagnostic testing and systemic antifungal prescribing for tinea capitis in an observational cohort study of 3.9 million children, United States [^1168sWsf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, 75.9% of patients were prescribed any antifungal, 61.2% were prescribed an oral antifungal (most frequently griseofulvin [52.7%]), and 14.7% were prescribed topical antifungal therapy alone. Patients prescribed topical therapy alone were more often diagnosed by family practitioners (22.1%) than by dermatologists (17.5%) or pediatricians (10.1%) (P < .01).

Most patients diagnosed with TC received no confirmatory laboratory testing, which is concerning because visual inspection alone of suspected cutaneous fungal infections can lead to diagnostic errors and unnecessary antifungal use. Low testing rates might be due to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments restrictions, long turnaround times, and low reimbursement rates. Guidelines recommend against using topical antifungals alone, due to lack of hair shaft penetration. Since 38.8% of patients with TC were either prescribed topical treatment alone or not prescribed antifungals, there might be lack of knowledge about appropriate TC treatment, diagnostic uncertainty, and reluctance to prescribe systemic antifungals to children. The higher TC incidence among prepubescent and male children is consistent with previous studies.

Study limitations include lack of information on race/ethnicity and non-commercial insurance types. Further, administrative data are subject to potential disease misclassification and undercoding, which might particularly affect reporting of diagnostic tests with low reimbursement rates (eg, direct microscopy). While dermatologists' use of diagnostic testing for TC exceeded other specialties, our study highlights important opportunities across all specialties to increase testing and ensure effective treatment for children with TC.

### What is new in fungal pharmacotherapeutics? [^112CJ9jv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Approximately 20–25% of the population worldwide is affected by superficial cutaneous mycoses (SCM). SCM are cutaneous fungal infections with a wide array of systemic and topical treatment options. However, successful therapeutic outcomes are limited by patient non-adherence, medication side effects, potential drug interactions, antifungal resistance and disease recurrence. Advances in formulation technology have allowed for the development of more effective and safer therapies. In this article we will review several new and emerging pharmacotherapeutics for onychomycosis and tinea pedis.

Introduction

Treatment-resistant dermatophytosis caused by Trichophyton rubrum has emerged as a global public health threat, particularly in endemic areas like India. However, few, if any such cases, have been reported in the United States. We report a representative case and discuss our experience treating several patients with extensive T rubrum tinea corporis that persisted despite prolonged treatment with systemic and topical agents, including oral terbinafine. We have witnessed an increasing number of treatment-resistant cases in our clinic over the last 5 years, but to our knowledge, there are no reported cases in the United States.

5 Conclusion

This review identified dermatophytes, primarily T. rubrum, as the predominant etiological agent. However, the included studies exhibited heterogeneity, such as the absence of standardized diagnostic methods and insufficient documentation of other comorbidities, including onychomycosis. More comprehensive and standardized research is necessary to determine the exact prevalence of tinea pedis in the pediatric population. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals should remain vigilant in recognizing pediatric tinea pedis to improve prevention and treatment strategies.

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^113jmgF9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

Several conditions may mimic PR and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Below is a list of common differentials with brief descriptions of why they need to be ruled out:
Secondary syphilis: Often presents with a generalized rash, including on palms and soles, which can resemble PR but usually lacks a herald patch and has a different distribution, and lymphadenopathy is almost always found in secondary syphilis but usually never in PR. A rapid plasma reagin test is essential to rule out this condition.
Tinea corporis: Fungal infections can present with annular, scaly lesions that may mimic PR. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can confirm the diagnosis by revealing fungal elements.
Erythema multiforme: This condition can present with targetoid lesions and mucosal involvement, which is not typical of PR. A detailed history and clinical examination help distinguish between the two, as erythema multiforme is often related to herpes simplex infection.
Guttate psoriasis: Characterized by small, rain-drop pattern, scaly papules, guttate psoriasis may resemble PR but often has a history of sore throat and psoriasis, scales are thicker and silvery-white, and it lacks the typical herald patch.
Pityriasis lichenoides chronica: Chronic, scaly, red–brown papules that may resemble PR, but lesions persist longer, the herald patch is lacking, and papules are in different stages of evolution, one or more of them showing a darker center and have a more varied appearance. Histopathology is often needed for differentiation.
Pityriasis alba: Hypopigmented, scaly patches usually seen in children with a history of eczema. The absence of a herald patch and the chronic nature of the condition help differentiate it from PR.
Lichen planus: Pruritic, purple, polygonal papules often involving the wrists, lumbar spinal region, glans penis, and oral mucosa. The chronicity and distribution help differentiate it from PR.
Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus: Erythematous, annular, or polycyclic lesions that may mimic PR but often have photosensitivity and systemic symptoms, and histology shows epidermal atrophy and basal layer degeneration.
Nummular eczema: Coin-shaped, scaly patches that may resemble PR. The chronic, relapsing nature, intense pruritus, and shin and dorsal hand localizations, rarely found in PR, are key differentiators.
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Early stages may resemble PR, as the initial patch does not respond to topical steroids mimicking PR. However, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma typically has a chronic course and does not respond to standard PR treatments. Multiple serial biopsies are essential for diagnosis.
Kaposi sarcoma: Can present with red, purple, or brown plaques and nodules. Unlike PR, Kaposi sarcoma is associated with immunosuppression and has a more progressive course.

### Management of onychomycosis and co-existing tinea pedis [^111nSZ6L]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common nail infection that often co-exists with tinea pedis. Surveys have suggested the diseases co-exist in at least one third of patients, although actual numbers may be a lot higher due to significant under-reporting. The importance of evaluating and treating both diseases is being increasingly recognized, however, data on improved outcomes, and the potential to minimize re-infection are limited. We review a recent post hoc analysis of two large studies treating mild to moderate onychomycosis with efinaconazole topical solution, 10%, demonstrating that complete cure rates of onychomycosis are significantly improved when any co-existing tinea pedis is also treated.

Discussion

Correct diagnosis – Borderline tuberculoid leprosy.

Leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, presents with a wide variation in clinical manifestations that correlate with the host's immunological status. Both innate and adaptive immunity play roles in its pathogenesis — the former affecting host susceptibility or resistance, and the latter having a significant effect on disease presentation. Borderline tuberculoid (BT) leprosy is part of the borderline spectrum and is associated with relatively good immunity. It is characterized by few, ill- to well-defined lesions with irregular borders, pseudopods, and satellite lesions. In contrast, solitary plaques are more common in tuberculoid (TT) leprosy, where cell-mediated immunity is strongest; the lesion is typically well-circumscribed, erythematous, and annular. Both subtypes exhibit early and prominent asymmetric nerve involvement, and associated lesions show profound sensory loss and alopecia. As the cell-mediated immunity is stronger in TT, nerve damage and resulting anesthesia are also more pronounced compared to BT. Histopathologically, granulomas in TT leprosy are larger and well-defined with abundant lymphocytes forming a mantle around the granuloma and multinucleated giant cells, often obscuring the subepidermal clear zone. In contrast, our case demonstrated granulomas that were less well-defined with fewer lymphocytes at the periphery and in clusters inside the granuloma, along with a clear subepidermal zone.

The patient in this case displayed an unusual presentation of BT leprosy with a solitary plaque, a finding usually suggestive of TT. However, the lesional morphology with pseudopods and scattered satellite lesions, as well as the findings on histopathology mentioned previously, was indispensable in reaching the correct diagnosis. A possible explanation for this presentation is that the patient initially developed TT leprosy, which then downgraded to BT leprosy due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Various conditions may mimic leprosy, and it is important to keep the differentials in mind, especially in regions where the disease is not endemic. Unsuspecting clinicians might overlook key features, leading to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis and poor outcomes. Tinea corporis presenting with annular plaque and central clearing is a common misdiagnosis, especially in tuberculoid leprosy. Sarcoidosis can closely resemble leprosy both clinically and on histopathology, evident by previously reported instances of misdiagnosed BT leprosy. Molecular diagnostic techniques can be crucial in making the correct diagnosis in such cases. Cutaneous tuberculosis is another important differential to be considered, especially in endemic areas. Although a rare phenomenon, its coexistence with leprosy has also been previously reported.

### Common tinea infections in children… [^11458Aq5]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

TREATMENT Tinea capitis must be treated with oral agents to penetrate the affected hair shafts. Although griseofulvin is often considered the treatment of choice for children, other agents are increasingly more cost-effective and may be more convenient. 8 If griseofulvin is used, micronized oral griseofulvin is recommended at a dosage of 20 mg per kg per day for at least eight weeks. The long duration of treatment and the adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, and photosensitivity often negatively affect patient compliance. Tinea Corporis DIAGNOSIS Tinea corporis is most commonly caused by Trichophyton species. Patients typically present with an annular patch or plaque with an advancing, raised, scaling border and central clearing. The differential diagnosis includes other annular skin lesions. Most patients with tinea corporis are diagnosed clinically. KOH microscopy of a skin scraping can determine if hyphae are present.

Culture confirmation is usually not required. Data show that newer butenafine and terbinafine therapies are more effective than older miconazole and clotrimazole therapies, primarily because of the fungicidal properties of the newer agents compared with the fungistatic action of the older agents. 17, 18 Combination antifungal/corticosteroid preparations are not recommended because of a greater risk of adverse effects, primarily from the higher-potency steroid component. 19 Cure rates are lower and the cost is higher with combination therapy than with antifungal creams alone. Topical therapy is usually a sufficient treatment for tinea cruris. Therapies include terbinafine cream or spray applied once daily for one week and butenafine 1% cream applied once daily for two weeks. TREATMENT Topical antifungal agents such as terbinafine applied once daily for one week or butenafine 1% applied once daily for two weeks are effective for most forms of tinea pedis.

The therapies can be applied directly to the web spaces and other affected areas. As with treatment of tinea cruris, these therapies are more effective than clotrimazole and miconazole. Tinea Unguium DIAGNOSIS Tinea unguium is an infection of the finger- or toenails.

### Erythroderma in the elderly [^114Fkiny]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 CLINICAL FEATURES

Erythroderma presents with diffuse coalesced reddish or brownish erythemas involving > 90% of the body surface areas of the trunk and extremities. The characteristic features are erythemas sparing the skin folds and creases of the trunk (i.e. abdomen or chest) and extremities (elbow fossa), as well as cobblestone‐like grouping prurigo (Figure 1a–c), but such features are not always apparent. Patients presenting with erythroderma frequently develop inguinal lymphadenopathy, chills, and mild fever. During the chronic course, the skin color becomes brownish, and nodular lesions, palmoplantar keratoderma, nail changes (thickening), hair loss of the scalp and pubis, and lower leg edema can be observed (Figure 2a–d). Furthermore, patients often develop dermal and subcutaneous infections (Figure 2e). The erythemas can be either well‐circumscribed or ill‐circumscribed, depending on the underlying conditions. Patients complain of severe itching; however, topical corticosteroids are usually ineffective. The diagnosis is easy based on clinical appearance, but after the diagnosis of erythroderma is made, exploration of the possible triggers, causes, and underlying disorders is important. When we encounter erythroderma patients, a number of investigations are required, including a detailed check of the patients' drug intake, lymphadenopathy, laboratory examination, skin biopsy, examination of internal malignancy, and others. Because erythroderma can be a non‐bullous form of bullous pemphigoid, biopsied skin samples should be cryopreserved, and sera also should be preserved. There are a number of cutaneous diseases which induce erythrodermic conditions, including eczema, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, drug eruption, lymphoma, lichen planus, pityriasis rubra pilaris, autoimmune bullous diseases (pemphigus foliaceus, bullous pemphigoid), graft‐versus‐host disease, thymoma‐associated multiorgan autoimmunity, dermatomyositis, internal malignancy, chronic actinic dermatitis, Hailey‐Hailey disease, tinea corporis, scabies, COVID‐19 infection, and others (Figure 3). By contrast, no underlying conditions related to erythroderma may not be detected even after thorough investigations. For such cases in which precipitating factors are undetermined, the term "idiopathic erythroderma" may be proposed. However, this should be regarded as a tentative diagnosis, and careful follow‐up is required to check for any potential underlying diseases that may emerge later because erythroderma is always secondary to other disorders.

### A practical guide to curing onychomycosis: how to maximize cure at the patient, organism, treatment, and environmental level [^115iwWKy]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts. Treatment of this infection can be difficult, with relapse likely to occur within 2.5 years of cure. The objective of this article is to review factors that can impact cure and to suggest practical techniques that physicians can use to maximize cure rates. Co-morbidities, as well as disease severity and duration, are among the many patient factors that could influence the efficacy of antifungal therapies. Furthermore, organism, treatment, and environmental factors that may hinder cure include point mutations, biofilms, affinity for non-target enzymes, and exposure to fungal reservoirs. To address patient-related factors, physicians are encouraged to conduct confirmatory testing and treat co-morbidities such as tinea pedis early and completely. To combat organism-focused factors, it is recommended that disruption of biofilms is considered, and drugs with multiple routes of delivery and unique mechanisms of action are prescribed when traditional agents are not effective. Extending follow-up periods, using combination treatments, and considering pulse regimens may also be of benefit. Through these practical techniques, physicians can maximize cure and limit the risk of relapse and re-infection.

### Skin disorders, including pyoderma, scabies, and tinea infections [^115F47Qf]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Pyoderma, scabies, and tinea are common childhood skin disorders too often considered to be merely of nuisance value. More than 111 million children are believed to have pyoderma, with many also co-infected with scabies, tinea, or both. These skin disorders cannot be differentiated by ethnicity or socioeconomic status but, in high-prevalence areas, poverty and overcrowded living conditions are important underlying social determinants. Each is transmitted primarily through direct skin-to-skin contact. For many Indigenous children, these skin conditions are part of everyday life. Although rarely directly resulting in hospitalization or death, there is a high and largely unmet demand for effective management at the primary health-care level, particularly for pyoderma and scabies. Despite particularly high prevalence in some settings, treatment is not sought for many children, and when sought, the clinical benefit from such consultations is variable. The lack of standard, evidence-based recommendations is of much concern. The current evidence base for clinical diagnosis and treatment of these common childhood skin disorders is highlighted.

### A case report of tinea capitis in infant in first year of life [^111xaX6e]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Epidemiology of TC can be related to geographical location and social, cultural and nutritional factors: in infants, across Europe and the Mediterranean basin, M. canis remains the most common organism responsible for TC, with prevalence ranges between 0.23 and 2.6%. Trichophyton tonsurans is reported as accounting for 50–90% of dermatophyte scalp isolates in the UK and the USA. In addition, T. tonsurans has spread to both South America and West Africa. T.violaceum is the most common in Greece and Belgium.

Tinea capitis in infants likely is more common than is reported and recent literature demonstrates a significant increase. Although the incidence is low, sometimes TC is misdiagnosed and underreported, and differential diagnosis may include seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, neonatal lupus, Langerhans cell histiocytosis and syphilis. TC should be suspected in a child with alopecia, pruritus and/or persistent desquamation and thinning hair, and the scalp lesion should be investigated from a mycological point of view.

The drug of choice for the treatment of TC is griseofulvin in children. Six to twelve weeks therapy is recommended or until the patient tests negative for fungi (light microscopy and culture). However, the long period of treatment required with this antifungal drug is a significant disadvantage and leads to reduced compliance. Other oral antifungals, specifically fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and terbinafine are available and give the advantage of good safety and efficacy profiles, and shorter required duration of treatment of TC caused by Tricophyton and Microsporum. Fremerey and Nenoff reported a case of TC in a newborn caused by T. soudanense. The patient was initially treated with intravenous fluconazole and topical clotrimazole and octenidine therapy; after one week of treatment, the lesions were resolving. Oral terbinafine, which is often administered in dermatophytosis, is FDA approved only for treatment of TC in children four years of age or older. Oral ketoconazole has been suggested for treatment of dermatophyte infections where griseofulvin is not tolerated. However, Michaels et al. do not consider oral ketoconazole to be as prudent an alternative due to the higher risk of hepatotoxicity.
