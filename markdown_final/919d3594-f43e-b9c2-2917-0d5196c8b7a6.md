## Question

Isolated dry gangrene of individual fingers

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about isolated dry gangrene of individual fingers, including how to define it, what causes it, how to evaluate it, and how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and pathophysiology. Then, I should categorize etiologies by mechanism. Next, I will outline a focused diagnostic workup. After that, I will detail management principles, including when to favor autoamputation versus surgical amputation. Finally, I will consider special scenarios and synthesize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, making sure I verify each claim against the best available sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel the condition. Isolated dry gangrene of individual fingers refers to mummified, desiccated necrosis of one or more digits without spreading infection, typically with a clear line of demarcation and without systemic sepsis, which distinguishes it from wet gangrene and from symmetrical peripheral gangrene that involves multiple acral sites and is often linked to DIC and vasopressors [^9b5fe58f] [^2e70619b].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. Dry gangrene reflects chronic ischemia with superimposed vasculopathy, vasospasm, or microthrombosis, leading to coagulative necrosis and mummification; in contrast, wet gangrene implies superinfection and liquefactive necrosis. In systemic sclerosis and related vasculopathies, structural and functional microvascular disease plus Raynaud physiology drive distal ischemia and tissue loss, which explains why gangrene can occur even when large arteries are patent [^62836841] [^40003d51].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causes; I should categorize etiologies by mechanism to guide workup. Mechanistic buckets include vasospastic and vasculitic disorders such as systemic sclerosis, SLE with or without antiphospholipid syndrome, and Buerger's disease; hematologic and hypercoagulable states including cryoglobulinemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and catastrophic APS; infectious triggers like scrub typhus and sepsis with DIC; iatrogenic and toxic causes such as vasopressors and ergot alkaloids; endocrine and renal disease including diabetes and ESRD with distal microvascular disease; and traumatic or embolic phenomena including radial artery injury and pseudoaneurysm with distal embolization [^a142804f] [^0f93cf38] [^615df239] [^72673936] [^2e70619b] [^6329099f] [^1590adae] [^2559dae8] [^42b153b6].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach so I don't miss reversible drivers. A focused history should cover Raynaud's, tobacco use, medication exposures including ergots and vasopressors, recent infections, travel, and trauma; the exam should document demarcation, moisture, infection, pulses, and nailfold capillaroscopy if scleroderma is suspected; labs should include CBC, metabolic panel, inflammatory markers, autoantibodies (ANA, anti-centromere, anti-topoisomerase, aPL), cryoglobulins, hepatitis C, and a hypercoagulable panel when indicated; imaging with digital pressures, duplex, and angiography helps distinguish large-vessel disease from microvascular disease and guides revascularization decisions [^62836841] [^40003d51] [^0f93cf38] [^4090c918].

> I should double-check the management principles before recommending anything. The cornerstone is to address the underlying cause while protecting viable tissue and preventing conversion to wet gangrene; conservative care with warmth, analgesia, infection surveillance, and meticulous local wound care is preferred initially; in systemic sclerosis and vasculitides, systemic vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers, PDE5 inhibitors, and endothelin receptor antagonists reduce ischemia and new ulcers, and immunosuppression is used when inflammation is active; for dry gangrene, autoamputation with spontaneous separation is often favored over immediate surgical amputation to preserve length and avoid stump complications, though this requires close follow-up and patient counseling [^40003d51] [^9f67bdf5] [^a142804f] [^db815069].

> But wait, what if the gangrene is already demarcated and the patient prefers expedited recovery? I need to ensure I weigh risks and benefits. Surgical amputation is reasonable when there is progression, pain, functional compromise, or patient preference, yet in SSc-associated disease, aggressive surgery can precipitate proximal extension and new ulcers; thus, if surgery is chosen, it should be conservative, at the most distal viable level, and timed after optimization of perfusion and disease control to minimize stump ischemia and recurrence [^db815069] [^5af87819].

> Let me consider special scenarios so I don't overlook nuances. In ESRD with an ipsilateral AV fistula, distal ischemia and gangrene may reflect steal physiology; staging hand ischemia and considering fistula revision or staged procedures can be decisive. In vasopressor-associated symmetrical peripheral gangrene, prevention hinges on early recognition of ischemia and DIC management; once dry gangrene is established, autoamputation remains acceptable if demarcation is clear. In frostbite, rapid rewarming and thrombolysis in select cases can salvage tissue, and the Cauchy classification helps prognosticate amputation risk. In diabetic hand infections, early surgical drainage and debridement are critical when infection is present, whereas isolated dry gangrene without infection may still be observed for autoamputation [^22affbb4] [^9b5fe58f] [^ea4792a4] [^85910e1c].

> I should confirm the key takeaways so the plan is actionable. Isolated dry gangrene of individual fingers is a distal ischemic necrosis with clear demarcation and no spreading infection; prioritize identifying and treating the underlying cause, conserve tissue with conservative care, and reserve amputation for selected cases after demarcation or when pain, function, or patient preference dictate; in systemic sclerosis and vasculitides, avoid unnecessary surgery because of high risks of stump breakdown and recurrence, and coordinate multidisciplinary care to optimize perfusion and disease control [^a142804f] [^db815069] [^40003d51].

---

Isolated dry gangrene of individual fingers is most often due to **microvascular disease** from systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's, or antiphospholipid syndrome, with diabetes, Buerger's, and vasopressors as additional causes [^a142804f] [^fc44a19f] [^0f93cf38] [^615df239] [^2e70619b]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical appearance** (dry, black, mummified tissue with clear demarcation) plus targeted labs and imaging to identify the cause and exclude infection or large-vessel disease [^40003d51] [^4090c918]. Management is **conservative**: keep the digit dry, protect it, and allow autoamputation; surgery is reserved for infection, pain, or functional loss, and amputation should be minimized to avoid stump ulcers and further tissue loss [^a142804f] [^db815069]. Prognosis depends on the underlying disease and perfusion; with good control, many digits autoamputate without surgery, but recurrence is common in vasculopathies [^b0dfb39b] [^40003d51].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Isolated dry gangrene of individual fingers arises from **impaired microvascular perfusion**; causes include:

- **Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)**: digital vasculopathy with Raynaud's and ischemic ulcers is common; gangrene can occur without large-vessel occlusion [^a142804f] [^40003d51].

- **Raynaud's phenomenon**: primary or secondary to connective tissue disease; severe vasospasm can cause ischemic necrosis [^fc44a19f].

- **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: thrombotic microangiopathy causing digital ischemia and gangrene, sometimes as the first manifestation [^0f93cf38].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: microvascular disease and infection risk contribute to digital gangrene [^notfound].

- **Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease)**: segmental small-artery occlusions in young male smokers [^615df239].

- **Vasopressor use**: norepinephrine and dopamine can cause severe vasoconstriction and digital ischemia in shock states [^2e70619b].

- **Trauma or embolic events**: radial artery injury or emboli can cause focal digital ischemia [^2559dae8] [^42b153b6].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Appearance**: dry, black, mummified tissue with a clear line of demarcation from viable tissue.

- **Sensation**: usually painless due to loss of sensory innervation.

- **Systemic signs**: absent unless there is underlying sepsis or systemic disease.

- **Distribution**: single or multiple fingers, often distal phalanges.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with tests to identify the cause and exclude infection or large-vessel disease:

| **Diagnostic modality** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Clinical examination | Confirm dry gangrene, assess perfusion, look for Raynaud's, ulcers, or systemic signs [^40003d51] |
| Laboratory tests | CBC, ESR/CRP, autoantibodies (ANA, ACA, anti-Scl-70, aPL), ANCA, cryoglobulins, hepatitis C, coagulation profile [^notfound] |
| Vascular imaging | Doppler ultrasound, angiography to exclude large-vessel occlusion or embolic disease [^4090c918] |
| Infection workup | Cultures if infection is suspected to distinguish dry from wet gangrene [^notfound] |

---

## Management strategies

Management is **conservative** unless infection or functional compromise is present:

- **Conservative care**: keep the digit dry, protect with dressings, avoid trauma, and allow autoamputation; this preserves length and reduces stump complications [^a142804f] [^db815069].

- **Pain control**: acetaminophen or NSAIDs; opioids if needed.

- **Treat underlying disease**: immunosuppression for vasculitis, vasodilators for Raynaud's, anticoagulation for APS, smoking cessation for Buerger's [^9f67bdf5] [^615df239].

- **Surgical intervention**: indicated for infection, intractable pain, or functional impairment; amputation should be conservative to minimize stump ulcers and recurrence [^db815069] [^5af87819].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies with the underlying disease and perfusion. Many digits **autoamputate without surgery**, but recurrence is common in vasculopathies. Complications include infection, persistent pain, functional impairment, and psychological distress [^40003d51] [^85910e1c].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on **risk-factor modification** and early intervention:

- **Smoking cessation**: critical in Buerger's and vasculopathies [^615df239].

- **Glycemic control**: reduces microvascular complications in diabetes.

- **Vasodilator therapy**: calcium channel blockers, PDE5 inhibitors, and prostacyclin analogs for Raynaud's and SSc [^9f67bdf5].

- **Patient education**: on hand protection, warmth, and early reporting of ischemic symptoms [^40003d51].

---

Isolated dry gangrene of individual fingers reflects **microvascular failure** from systemic disease or vasoconstriction; **conservative care with disease-specific therapy** is first-line, reserving surgery for infection or functional loss, and outcomes hinge on the cause and perfusion status.

Digital dry gangrene is commonly seen in cases of connective tissue disease such as systemic sclerosis. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) digital gangrene is rare. As initial manifestation, it is again a rare phenomenon because it occurs late in the course of disease. Here we are reporting the case of a woman who was having extensive cutaneous gangrene of her fingers and toes, as a first and foremost presentation without any other typical signs and symptoms of SLE. Her serology was positive for SLE. The patient was treated conservatively and responded well.

Mode of presentation of hand lesions

Twenty-nine ulcers in hands were identified, including dry gangrene in two patients, abscess (Fig. 1a) in seven, osteomyelitis in nine, and superficial ulcers in eight. Ten patients (58.8%) had evidence of concomitant infection in 16 ulcers. Bacterial and fungal cultures were performed in only 12 patients, and the organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3; 25%), streptococcus group D (n = 1), colon bacillus (n = 1), corynebacterium (n = 1) and fungus (n = 2). One patient had a mixed infection with Staphylococcus aureus and fungus. No organism was cultured from the ulcers in five patients.

Location and causes of the hand ulcers

The left hand was involved in nine patients and the right hand in 10 subjects. Two patients had bilateral hand involvement. Twenty-one ulcers were located on the fingers (16 ulcers were on the third, fourth and fifth fingers), two ulcers were on the dorsal surface of the hand and six were on the palms of the hands.

Only seven patients could describe the possible causes of the ulcers, which included stab wounds, injury caused by clipping nails, local eczema, chilblain and scald.

2.2.1 SSc‐associated skin ulcers

SSc exhibits fibrosis of the skin and various organs and vasculopathy as primary manifestations and is a frequent cause of skin ulcers/gangrene in connective tissue diseases. Existing ulcer/gangrene and resulting functional impairments markedly affect patient quality of life (QOL). In patients with SSc, ulcers often develop at the finger/toe tips resulting from peripheral circulatory insufficiency. They are likely to occur on the dorsal aspects of the finger joints accompanying skin sclerosis and flexion contractures. They are also frequently observed at the heel and internal and external malleoli. While ulcers at the finger/toe tips occur more frequently in winter, they are perennial in some patients. Gangrene may develop suddenly. It is not uncommon for small injuries to develop into intractable ulcers, and surgical wounds are no exception. Many patients judged to have sufficient preoperative blood flow experience ulceration of surgical wounds. Ulcers developing due to spontaneous collapse of subcutaneous calcium deposits and those due to infection of corns or their inappropriate treatment (particularly self‐treatment) are often encountered. SSc may be complicated by other connective tissue diseases/vasculitis, and attention to APS is necessary. Moreover, as even patients who do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria of SSc (e.g. those who are positive for anticentromere antibody and exhibit Reynaud phenomenon but have no finger/toe sclerosis) may develop ulcers/gangrene, they should be managed without excessive devotion to the diagnostic criteria.

For treating ulcers in SSc patients, it is necessary to keep the affected areas stationary and warm and attempt various combinations of topical and systemic drug therapies while eliminating endogenous and exogenous exacerbating factors. In surgical treatment, because local procedures, such as excessive debridement may enlarge ulcers, sufficient caution is needed. Similarly, finger/toe amputation for gangrene often invites further proximal extension of the wound from the stump. It is extremely important to give priority to conservative treatments and avoid unnecessary surgical stress when treating ulcers/gangrenes of SSc, and waiting for drying and spontaneous separation (autoamputation) of gangrenous tissue is often recommended.

While few individual systemic drug therapies have been shown to be useful for treating ulcers alone, this does not imply that they lack utility. Clinical experience shows that combinations of multiple drugs can be effective. This is also the case with topical treatments, and drugs must be selected according to wound condition. PGE1 ointments and trafermin sprays are frequently used.

5.2.2 Digital amputation for SSc‐associated skin ulcers lead to complications such as finger shortening and stump ulcers. Furthermore, of SSc‐associated skin ulcers may be repeatedly observed. For this reason, digital amputation should not be readily performed, except in unavoidable cases

There is one case series study on digital amputation for SSc‐associated skin ulcers.
There are reports of digital amputation for SSc‐associated skin ulcers with advanced gangrenes, osteomyelitis, or purulent arthritis. Surgical amputation for gangrenes may induce new stump ulcers, requiring additional surgical amputation. In patients with gangrene, spontaneous falling is the most appropriate for finger preservation.
According to a case series study performed by Bogoch et al.an average of 45% of patients with SSc had experienced digital ulcers during the course of their disease. Although the healing of these ulcers is often delayed and dry gangrene is frequent, spontaneous falling of the ulcer is considered the first choice from the viewpoint of finger shortening prevention. On the other hand, surgical amputation is primarily indicated for moist gangrene and osteomyelitis‐related articular destruction, which are difficult to relieve by conservative treatment. However, in such cases, minimally invasive surgical treatment should be initially considered before amputation so that fingers/toes may be preserved and the risk of stump ulcers after amputation be avoided.

### Digital gangrene… [^b7181b58]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The development of tissue necrosis of the tips of fingers and toes suggests Raynaud disease or Raynaud phenomenon. The latter is sometimes the signal manifestation in varied diseases, including scleroderma, pneumatic hammer disease, scalenus anticus syndrome, cervical rib, shoulder-hand syndrome, peripheral arterial disease, drug poisoning, and several hematologic disorders in which exposure to cold causes sludging of blood. Three recent reports in publications of the American Medical Association present other causes for consideration.

In the current issue of Archives of Internal Medicine, Gipstein and his colleagues describe 11 patients with chronic renal insufficiency owing to various causes, who, while under treatment by long-term hemodialysis or by functioning homotransplants, developed livedo reticularis and painful ischemic ulcers of the fingers or toes or both. In some cases, cutaneous necrosis also appeared in other areas of the lower extremities. Hussey HH. Digital Gangrene. JAMA. 1976;

Materials and Methods

Patients

After receiving approval from the Washington University School of Medicine institutional review board, CPT and ICD-9/10 databases were queried to identify patients with diabetes mellitus who underwent incision and drainage, debridement, arthrotomy, or amputation for treatment of a hand infection between December 2010 and December 2020. Inclusion in this retrospective cohort study required a diagnosis of type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, upper extremity infection clearly involving at least 1 digit, and surgical management of the infection in the operating room by a hand surgeon. Both inpatient and outpatient cases were included. Given our interest in examining factors associated with digit preservation or amputation, we excluded 7 patients with a history of dry gangrene that was non-viable even prior to the development of an infection. Furthermore, patients with upper extremity infections that did not critically involve a digit were also excluded. This was determined by documented involvement of the anatomic structures of a digit based on detailed review of the operative notes and radiographs by a single reviewer (E.G.). The senior author (M. A.P.) reviewed the relevant records if there was any ambiguity. A diagram of enrollment flow is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3.
Patient enrollment flow diagram.

Electronic medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, comorbidities, laboratory values, type and etiology of infection, pathogenic organisms, duration of infection prior to presentation, surgical treatment, and clinical course. Body mass index (BMI) calculations were omitted for patients with a previous major extremity amputation, and creatinine was omitted for patients on dialysis. Type of hand infection was classified as a felon, paronychia, osteomyelitis, pyarthrosis, superficial abscess, deep space abscess, or necrotizing soft tissue infection. Deep space abscess was defined as involvement of the thenar, hypothenar, midpalmar, dorsal subaponeurotic, or Parona's space as documented in the operative report. The comorbidity of vascular disease was defined by the documented history of cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, or peripheral arterial disease. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) was defined by the patient being on dialysis at the time of the infection.

Home address was used to determine area deprivation index (ADI), a measure of socioeconomic status in which higher scores represent greater social deprivation. If a patient underwent multiple episodes of treatment for multiple distinct and unrelated hand infections, only the first episode was included.

### Symmetrical peripheral gangrene of bilateral feet and unilateral hand after administration of vasopressors during septic shock [^9b5fe58f]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The development of gangrene is the final stage of SPG. Dry gangrene becomes apparent within the first 12–24 hours after onset of ischaemic changes and progresses proximally with a line of demarcation developing in approximately 2 weeks. Arteries supplying the gangrenous areas of the extremities are difficult to palpate but the large vessels are often spared. However, one case reported a 70-year-old woman who, after treatment with vasopressors, developed gangrene in all her fingers and toes of the right foot. Her left foot was spared because the patient's left external iliac artery was occluded. Our patient developed gangrene of his bilateral feet and only his left hand. Sparing of his right hand is currently undetermined.

The only definitive treatment that has been established for gangrene is amputation of the necrotic digits after development of a clear line of demarcation. While awaiting demarcation, autoamputation of the gangrenous digits may occur. In the meantime, local wound care should consist of interdigital padding to protect the gangrenous or ischaemic extremities, antiseptic dressings, debridement and antibiotics. After demarcation, our patient's left hand digits 1, 4 and 5 were amputated, and transmetatarsal amputations were done on both feet with subsequent wound VAC placement and skin grafting.

### The registry of the German network for systemic scleroderma: frequency of disease subsets and patterns of organ involvement [^8850577b]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Organ involvement was defined as follows: RP was characterized by recurrent spasms of small digital arterioles/arteries at fingers and toes, usually triggered by cold and emotional stress. Clinically a sudden pallor of individual digits was followed by reactive hyperaemia, in severe cases also by cyanosis. Age at RP onset was considered to be the age at which this symptom appears. We defined the first non-RP onset as the time/age when the first skin changes (puffy fingers, sclerodactily, truncal scleroderma) developed and the second non-RP onset as the time/age at which first organ lesions occurred. All registered patients were asked for the date/age when RP, skin changes and organ manifestations were noticed/diagnosed.

Skin involvement was evaluated using the Rodnan skin score that assesses the skin thickness by clinical palpation of 17 body areas on a scale of 0–3. Thickening and fibrosis of the skin as one of the first recognized phenomenon in SSc still forms the basis of most classification criteria and proposed subsets of the disease. With respect to these symptoms the participants of the centres were trained several times by meetings of the network or EUSTAR-organized Rodnan skin score courses (Budapest, January 2005; Bad Nauheim, January 2007) to ensure standardized and correct performance of skin scoring within the network.

Digital tip ischaemia was associated with digital pitting scars, ulcerations or gangrene, or both.

Pulmonary manifestation was established, when pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and/or isolated pulmonary hypertension were found. Isolated pulmonary hypertension was defined as clinical evidence of right heart failure and/or increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAPm > 25 mmHg at rest or PAPm > 30 mmHg during exercise) as determined by right heart catheterization. In addition, an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) > 40 mmHg as determined by echocardiography was used to define likely PAH. Patients with dyspnoea [New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II and upwards] show often isolated impairments of carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLCO) with < 75% of the predictive values with the forced vital capacity < 80%. Pulmonary interstitial fibrosis was defined as SSc associated, when other possible causes of lung fibrosis were excluded and bilateral fibrosis confirmed by chest X-ray, high-resolution CT scan and/or restrictive pulmonary abnormalities on pulmonary function tests (TLC < 80%) were found.

### Delusional infestation complicated by gangrene and osteomyelitis requiring finger amputation [^8e330368]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delusional infestation (DI) is an uncommon entity defined by an individual's belief of microbiological infestation despite absence of evidence. The presumed infestation could be that of a living or inanimate pathogen, and the cardinal symptom is dysesthesia. The disease frequently drives patients to seek various interventions and leads to impaired quality of life.

The delusions may be of primary or secondary origin. The secondary causes include neurogical diseases, psychiatric disorders, nutritional deficiencies, medications, infections, intoxication, neoplasms, and metabolic imbalances. The mechanism underlying the development of DI is not well understood. Many authors propose it to be of psychiatric origin. However, others hypothesize it to be a type of immune-related pruritic dermatosis or an infection.

Herein, we describe the case of a man with cutaneous dysesthesias due to what he presumed to be a parasitic infestation. The disease led him to self-mutilate his left second finger until the development of osteomyelitis, which required amputation.

### Case report: multiple strokes and digital ischemia in a young COVID-19 patient [^b9be2e6e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
A portable chest X-ray shows a normal cardiac silhouette. There is no focal consolidation or effusion. Costophrenic angles are present. Trachea is midline.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (A) shows confluent diffusion-weighted imaging hyperintensities of the right frontal temporal lobe, right temporal parietal, and frontal lobe with panel (B) MRI showing corresponding fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities.

Multiple strokes in a young female prompted further hypercoagulable workup which revealed positive LA screen with elevated dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVT) at 63.9 seconds (36.1–50.8 seconds), DRVVT screen/confirm ratio 1.31 (0.97–1.22) with normal levels of beta-2 glycoprotein I Ab IgM, IgG, and IgA. Multiple days after surgery, her course was complicated by the slow development of right-hand swelling, for which the arterial duplex showed radial artery occlusion and monophasic flow in the ulnar artery. Computed tomographic angiography of the right upper extremity showed poor to non-opacification of the radial, ulnar, and palmar arch vessels and irregularities of the brachial arteries, suggesting mural thrombus. Despite therapeutic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UH), her right-hand swelling worsened to dry gangrene of right digits (Figure 3). Initially, there was no acute surgical intervention performed for dry gangrene and eventually was managed with therapeutic dosing of LMWH. She was scheduled for eventual amputation of the ischemic fingers but later suffered a pulseless electrical activity arrest (PEA) and was not able to be resuscitated despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We suspect the leading differential for her PEA is pulmonary embolism, given her hypercoagulable state.

### Isolated lower limb medium-vessel vasculitis: a new entity? [^edabcf36]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

A 47-year-old female was referred with bilateral ischaemic lesions affecting her toes with associated gangrene. Systemic examination was normal and her medical history was unremarkable. Close examination of the hands revealed splinter haemorrhages. Her feet were dusky in colour and the toes were dark and weeping, each becoming gangrenous, with erythema around the metatarsal phalangeal joint. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were intact with strong Doppler signals. Investigations for surgical pathology and malignancy were all negative as were routine blood tests and tests for autoimmune and viral markers. Vasculitis was diagnosed when her toes showed improvement with steroids, however, attempts to reduce the steroid dose were unsuccessful and azathioprine was introduced. Despite immunosuppression and immunomodulators, her toes deteriorated and were amputated. Histology revealed findings consistent with a medium-vessel vasculitis which antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody was negative. A similar vasculitis has not been formally reported in the literature.

### Limb-threatening and life-threatening diabetic extremities: clinical patterns and outcomes in 56 patients [^b9f3043b]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Limb- and life-threatening hand and foot infections in diabetic patients account for a large proportion of amputations and a substantial number of deaths. Between August 2006 and the end of July 2008, we conducted a prospective cohort study of consecutive diabetic patients with serious hand or foot infections, in an effort to identify clinical patterns and outcomes related to the treatment of these infections. Infections were categorized as dry, gas, and wet gangrene; necrotizing fasciitis or cellulitis; acute extensive osteomyelitis; and any of these infections involving the hand. All of the patients underwent a standard examination and treatment protocol, although none of the patients received vascular surgical care. End points included healing following debridement or minor amputation, major (transtibial or more proximal) amputation, or death. A total of 56 patients were included in the final analyses, and their mean age was 70 (range 51 to 86) years. Of the patients, 17 (30.36%) had necrotizing cellulitis, 12 (21.43%) had wet gangrene, 9 (16.07%) had acute extensive osteomyelitis, 5 (8.93%) had dry gangrene, 5 (8.93%) had gas gangrene, 4 (7.14%) had necrotizing fasciitis, and 4 (7.14) had diffuse hand infections. Five (8.93%) patients died (2 after prior amputation), 26 (46.43%) underwent debridement and/or minor amputation, and 27 (48.21%) required major amputations. Based on our findings, we concluded that 7 patterns of serious limb- or life-threatening infection were identified and, in the absence of vascular surgical intervention, mortality can be reduced at the expense of more amputations.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome was successful septic shock hemodynamic stabilization within 6 h. This outcome was defined as maintaining a MAP of at least 65 mmHg with a total catecholamine requirement below 0.2 mcg/kg/min. The total catecholamine dose was calculated by summing the norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and dobutamine doses (mcg/kg/min), with the dopamine and dobutamine doses each divided by 100. The formula was as follows:

The secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality. Additional endpoints included MAP monitoring for up to 72 h, the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, the proportion requiring renal replacement therapy, and the number of organ support − free days through day 28. Organ support — free days were calculated based on the method described by Russell and colleagues.

For safety outcomes, we recorded the new onset of cardiac arrhythmias and organ ischemia events, including intestinal ischemia, digital ischemia, digital gangrene, and acute myocardial infarction. Digital ischemia was defined as reduced blood flow to the fingers or toes, characterized by pallor, coolness, or cyanosis. Digital gangrene was defined as irreversible tissue necrosis of the fingers or toes, presenting with dark discoloration, dry or mummified tissue, and loss of sensation. We also recorded the rate of recurrent shock, defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65 mmHg lasting longer than 30 min within 48 h after discontinuation of the study drug and open-label vasopressors. These events were adjudicated by the attending physician according to prespecified definitions, with day-by-day assessments. No changes were made to trial outcomes once the trial began.

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a well defined clinical syndrome characterized by recurrent episodes of digital vasospasm triggered by exposure to physical/chemical or emotional stress. RP has been classified as primary or secondary, depending on whether it occurs as an isolated condition (pRP) or is associated to an underlying disease, mainly a connective tissue disease (CTD-RP). In both cases, it manifests with unique "triple" (pallor, cyanosis and erythema), or "double" color changes. pRP is usually a benign condition, while sRP can evolve and be complicated by acral digital ulcers and gangrene, which may require surgical treatment. The pathogenesis of RP has not yet been entirely clarified, nor is it known whether autoantibodies have a role in RP. Even so, recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology have highlighted novel potential therapeutic targets. The aim of this review is to discuss the etiology, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, recently disclosed pathogenic mechanisms underlying RP and their correlation with the available therapeutic options, focusing primarily on pRP and CTD-RP.

### Uncommon phenotypes of-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia [^13612bf4]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic variant of BCR::ABL1 -positive chronic myelogenous leukemia

Rarely, BCR::ABL1 -positive CML presents with an isolated or pronounced eosinophilia that may clinically resemble other reactive or neoplastic eosinophilic disorders. In a review of five patients with the eosinophilic variant of BCR::ABL1 -positive CML, all were male and three were diagnosed before the age of 35 years. Clinical and laboratory features of these patients at the time of initial diagnosis are summarized in Table 4. All five patients presented with unusual and disabling findings. These included peripheral vasculitis progressing to digital gangrene, superficial thrombophlebitis, recurrent episodes of fever and painful mucocutaneous ulcers, a liver mass composed of an extensive eosinophilic infiltrateand dry gangrene of the toes. Recognizing the eosinophilic variant of BCR::ABL1 -positive CML is important so patients can be treated with TKI therapy to minimize, and potentially reverse, tissue damage caused by direct infiltration by eosinophils and/or the systemic release of eosinophilic granules into the blood.

Fig. 1
(Panel a and b). This picture was taken four weeks after her second Ipilimumab infusion (week 26 on timeline). Physical exam reveals acrocyanosis of all digits with small ulcers of the right second and fourth fingertips

Fig. 2
Conventional angiogram of the left arm was performed five weeks after her second Ipilimumab infusion (end of week 26 on timeline). There is severely diminished flow in the digital arteries of the left hand beyond the level of all proximal interphalangeal joints (black arrow), consistent with small vessel occlusive disease

After the four cycles of Rituximab, we believe that the vasculitic process and additional damage were halted, as she did not develop further proximal digital ischemia or other systemic symptoms. The exam appeared worse with dry gangrene of the fingertips, consistent with the natural evolution of skin changes with distal digital ischemia, as shown in Fig. 3a & b (Taken 5 weeks after Fig. 1), likely reflecting consequences of the initial injury. She did ultimately require distal digit amputations. See Table 2 for the chronological outline of the case presentation.

### Sepsis-induced digital ischaemia in a professional pianist, in the absence of vasopressors [^5b2e8d7a]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Peripheral limb ischaemia and gangrene are devastating complications of pneumococcal sepsis. We report a 43-year-old professional pianist who presented with early sepsis and rapid development of this syndrome. No vasopressor medication was ever administered. We urgently reviewed the medical literature on a range of therapies recommended by consulting teams, to ensure he received optimal care. Based on our review and on feedback from the patient himself, we gained valuable insights into this illness and the merits of selected treatment options. His fingers ultimately recovered their function, intact, although several toes were later amputated. More recently published reviews postulate that imbalances in coagulation factors and natural anticoagulants occur as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and 'shock liver' in the sepsis syndrome, leading to microcirculatory thromboses. We submit this report as we believe it supports this hypothesis and adds further valuable information. We hope our observations will assist other critical care clinicians confronting this serious condition.

### The scleroderma hand: manifestations of disease and approach to management [^c95d88be]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Scleroderma is a rare autoimmune connective tissue disorder that often affects the hands. Manifestations in the hands include calcium deposits within the soft tissues that cause pain and may ulcerate through the skin, digital ischemia resulting in chronic wounds and digital gangrene, and joint contracture. Because of the underlying disease, patients with scleroderma have poorly vascularized tissue and a deficient soft tissue envelope, which make surgery particularly challenging. However, when undertaken with care, surgical intervention is often the best option for addressing the disabling hand conditions that so often accompany this disease.

### Acute symmetric peripheral gangrene following a long-standinginfection: a very rare kinship [^6b75381c]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Symmetric peripheral gangrene is a clinical entity characterized by symmetric distal ischemic damage in 2 or more sites in the absence of major vascular occlusive disease. In his original description in 1891, Hutchinsondescribed the first case of symmetric peripheral gangrene in a 37-year-old man who had septic shock and gangrene of fingers, toes, and ear borders. The term purpura fulminans is reserved for cases in which there is additional or predominant nonacral necrosis. The postulated etiopathogenesis of symmetric peripheral gangrene includes vasoconstriction, hypotension, vascular obstruction, and endothelial damage. A low-flow state along with disseminated intravascular coagulation is often present. We present a case of symmetric peripheral gangrene after a long-standing infection caused by Mycobacterium malmoense in the absence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. To our knowledge, our case is the first one of symmetric peripheral gangrene associated with disseminated M malmoense.

### Relationship of hemodialysis access to finger gangrene in patients with end-stage renal disease [^1590adae]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

We report a comprehensive review of our patients on hemodialysis with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with finger gangrene to determine etiology, natural history, and prognosis of this condition.

Methods

Patients with ESRD with finger gangrene were identified from our computerized vascular registry. Presence of an ipsilateral arteriovenous fistula was determined, and patients were compared with a group of patients with ESRD without finger gangrene. Management consisted of arteriography, selective arteriovenous fistula management, and finger amputation. A multivariate analysis to determine risk factors associated with finger gangrene was performed. Repeat finger amputation and survival rates were determined with life-table analysis.

Results

Twenty-three patients (mean age at start of dialysis, 53 years) with finger gangrene were identified, with 48% (n = 11) having a functional ipsilateral arteriovenous fistula. Arteriography was consistent with diffuse atherosclerosis involving the radial, ulnar, palmar, and digital arteries precluding attempts at distal arterial bypass. Repeat finger amputations were necessitated in 52% of patients (n = 12), and bilateral finger gangrene developed in 61% of patients (n = 14). Starting dialysis at age less than 55 years (P = 0.0004), diabetes (P = 0.001), coronary artery disease (P = 0.0212), and lower extremity arterial occlusive disease (P < .0001) were significantly associated with finger gangrene.

Conclusion

The young diabetic patient with diffuse vascular disease and ESRD is at high risk for the development of finger gangrene on chronic hemodialysis. Finger gangrene is the result of distal atherosclerosis and is not primarily related to dialysis access.

### Benign surgical emphysema of the hand and upper limb: gas is not always gangrene – a report of two cases [^e79e22ef]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Subcutaneous emphysema of the hand can result from benign causes. Differentiating this from emphysema caused by gas-forming organisms is essential in the acute stages of presentation as the management differs considerably. We present two cases of benign surgical emphysema and highlight the importance of distinguishing between this and gas gangrene. A considered history and the absence of systemic features associated with benign causes of subcutaneous air will prevent unnecessary surgical exploration.

### Does the clinical context improve the reliability of rheumatologists grading digital ulcers in systemic sclerosis? [^26f00279]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study design and participants

Eighty clinical images of a range of digital lesions (location of lesion [number]: fingertip = 34, extensor = 32, and other = 14) were prospectively collected from 36 patients with SSc‐spectrum disorders (the majority of whom had SSc) either at their routine clinic attendance or during an episode of hospitalization. Digital lesions were selected by 2 individuals (MH and ALH) to represent a spectrum of lesions representative of those encountered in patients with SSc. Since the definition of gangrene as ulceration is controversial, one example of gangrene was included 9. A trained medical photographer took all the images, placing a small graded scale (length of 1 cm) in close proximity to the digital lesion to give raters an indication of the size of the lesion. For each digital lesion the following clinical contextual information was collected (exemplified in Figure 1): the pain associated with the lesion on a visual analog scale (100 being most severe) and the temporal relationship (whether the pain was less, the same or worse than a week previously), the duration of the lesion (patient reported), and the presence of discharge (both patient reported and clinician observed). Patient and digital lesion characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 1 (available on the Arthritis Care & Research web site at). The study was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee East of England, Hatfield, and all patients provided signed informed consent.

### Treatment of gangrenous digit-threatening paraneoplastic acrocyanosis with vasodilator therapy [^91c71cb1]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A man in his 70s, with a recent diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, reported a 2-month history of discolouration, pain and paraesthesia affecting his fingers. Clinical assessment noted peripheral acrocyanosis with areas of digital ulceration and gangrene. Following further work-up to evaluate potential causes, he was diagnosed with paraneoplastic acrocyanosis. He proceeded to undergo robotic cystoprostatectomy and received adjuvant chemotherapy for the management of his cancer. In parallel to the chemotherapy, vasodilatory therapy was administered as two courses of intravenous synthetic prostacyclin analogue iloprost along with sildenafil. This resulted in a significant improvement in digital pain and gangrene with healing of ulceration.

### Symmetrical peripheral gangrene of bilateral feet and unilateral hand after administration of vasopressors during septic shock [^936efaeb]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The three stages leading up to SPG are sepsis, ischaemia and gangrene. Treatment can be administered at each stage to prevent, slow or reverse the course to SPG. Septic shock, the first stage, results in low perfusion to the peripheral circulatory system and must be aggressively managed. Treatment includes resuscitation with fluids, intravenous antibiotics, anticoagulants and vasopressors.

The vasopressors recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines are either dopamine or norepinephrine as the initial vasopressor of choice, and vasopressin can supplement norepinephrine. However, it has been noted that dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine can cause digital gangrene at recommended or curative dosage levels, especially in patients with DIC and hypovolaemia. For example, renal and mesenteric bed vasodilatation occurs in low-dose dopamine (< 5 µg/kg/min), cardiac contractions can occur at moderate doses (5–10 µg/kg/min), and vasoconstriction can occur at higher doses of 10–20 µg/kg/min.

Peripheral gangrene attributed to the vasospastic action of dopamine was first reported in 1973. Since then, one article has cited additional cases reported in the medical literature. The patients in these cases clinically presented with either distal gangrene of multiple extremities or gangrene surrounding the area of intravenous filtration. The infusion rate of dopamine varied in these cases from 1.5 to 66 µg/kg/min, and the average maximum dose given was 10 µg /kg/min. Our patient developed SPG after receiving low to moderate doses of dopamine, ranging from 2 to 20 µg/kg/min for 2 days, norepinephrine doses ranging from 1 to 30 µg/min for 7 days, and vasopressin 2.4 units/hour for 3 days.

The second stage leading to SPG is the onset of digital ischaemia, and there is a small window of time before it appears. The initial sign is erythematous, cold extremities, followed by dusky discolouration of the skin with pain. If appropriate care is not given at this time, cyanosis and haemorrhagic bullae or blisters may develop in a symmetrical acral distribution over the fingers and toes. Our patient's left fingernail beds and all of his toenail beds were noted to be cyanotic 2 days after administration of vasopressors. Select SPG cases with the day of the initial appearance of ischaemia after vasopressor use are highlighted in table 1.

### Wound, pressure ulcer, and burn guidelines (2023)-4: guidelines for the management of connective tissue disease / vasculitis-associated skin ulcers, third edition [^5af87819]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1.4 Surgical treatment for skin ulcers

Some comments about surgical treatments should also be made. Connective tissue disease–associated ulcers differ from other ulcers in that their condition changes readily depending on primary disease activity. For example, in fingertip ulcers in patients with SSc, wound bed preparation can be achieved by relieving circulatory disturbances and ulcers may be controlled by conservative treatment. On the other hand, circulatory disorders may recur readily at sites of resolved ulcers, resulting in their repeated reactivation. Considering these pathologies, as aggressive surgical treatments, such as finger/toe amputation, may lead to more extensive successive amputations, their indications must be evaluated carefully. Because tissues on the verge of necrosis may be saved by patient repetition of conservative treatments, maximum tissue conservation should also be achieved using debridement unless the tissue is clearly gangrenous. For bedside wound treatment, although the removal of marked necrotic tissue is necessary, the ischemic basement tissue should be preserved whenever possible. Removing marked necrotic tissue without injuring the ischemic tissue of a skin ulcer with forceps can reduce patient pain during wound treatment. When treating connective tissue disease/vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers, the patient's unique progress must be considered. Priority should be given to persistent conservative treatments, with surgical therapy progressing from skin grafting to bone curettage (exposure of bone marrow), and, if necessary, to finger/toe amputation, adhering to the principle of conservation or minimally invasive treatment. As a general rule, surgical therapy should be indicated on the condition that the primary disease is adequately controlled, with the exception of infections that require urgent treatment such as necrotizing fasciitis and gas gangrene.

### Awaiting autoamputation: a primary management strategy for toe gangrene in diabetic foot disease [^b0dfb39b]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Successful autoamputation occurred in six subjects (55%). In one, minor trauma caused the residual necrotic tissue to snap off, resulting in successful autoamputation; in none was it necessary to resect denuded protruberant bone. Median (interquartile range) time to autoamputation was 5 (2–6) months. Nine had subsequent infections requiring further antibiotics, and four failed to respond and required surgical amputation (two Ray and two transmetatarsal). Time to surgical amputation was 4.5 (3–6.5) months. Two subjects died — one after successful Ray amputation and another while awaiting autoamputation, both from coronary heart disease considered unrelated to their foot pathology. Significant pain occurred in three subjects: one proceeded to successful autoamputation and two to surgical amputation for infection. Age, duration of diabetes, sex, type of diabetes, proportion with end-stage renal failure, proportion on immunosuppressant therapy, HbA 1c, and the proportion with only the distal part of a toe necrotic were not statistically significantly different in those that achieved successful autoamputation.

Aside from two case reports, this is the first description of a cohort of subjects in whom autoamputation was assessed as the primary management strategy for toe gangrene. Of note, 82% required renal replacement therapy; digital gangrene is recognized in end-stage renal disease, but reports tend to involve fingers. A previous report suggested that acute septic vasculitis is an important etiological factor. The four subjects in whom the strategy failed may have had higher level amputations than would have been necessary if surgical amputation had been the primary interventional strategy. However, minor surgical amputation as a primary management strategy can also result in failure to heal and a higher level amputation, particularly in the absence of revascularization options. A randomized controlled trial comparing the two strategies is required.

### Digital ulcers as presenting symptom of secondary antiphospholipid syndrome [^0f93cf38]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although common in connective tissue disorders, digital ulcers are rarely seen in SLE, with studies reporting < 1% prevalence. The main etiology is attributed to APS. APS is a systemic autoimmune disease of hypercoagulation characterized by recurrent venous and/or arterial thrombosis in the presence of aPL antibodies, namely anticardiolipin, anti-beta-2-glycoprotein I, and LA. APS can present as primary or secondary to other autoimmune disorders, most commonly SLE: approximately 40% of patients with SLE eventually develop APS.

Up to 50% of patients with APS will present with cutaneous manifestations as the first indication of disease. The most frequent skin finding, livedo reticularis, has been reported in 20% to 40% of all patients with APS. In contrast, digital ulcerations as the presenting symptom in APS are observed in only 1.3% to 1.9% of population. A PubMed literature review focusing on the past 15 years was conducted using search terms "digit, finger, ulcer or necrosis, antiphospholipid". A total of 62 articles were retrieved. Each article was analyzed for the presence of digital ulcerations and the appropriate clinical context. Most of the results involved ulcers in the context of other conditions such as infections, malignancies, autoimmune, or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis. A total of 16 publications referenced digital ulcers in the setting of SLE and/or APS. These 16 cases were stratified based on SLE and APL status, with 7 positives for both. Four of the 7 articles presented necrosis and/or gangrene of different body parts, without digital ulcers. In the end, only 2 articles in the past 15 years have described digit ulcerations as the presenting symptom of APS in patients with established SLE. The low number of presentations correlates with studies describing this symptomatology in less than 2% of patients. A breakdown of the literature review is presented in Fig 3.

### Eosinophilic variant of chronic myeloid leukemia with vascular complications [^e04e8ad9]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2003). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic variant of CML (eoCML) is a unique disease with a poor prognosis. Like the hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), eoCML has no clinically identifiable reason for an increased eosinophil count in the peripheral blood. In contrast to HES, eoCML patients carry a distinct chromosomal abnormality. The bcr/abl fusion gene (Philadelphia chromosome) is the genetic basis of this clonal disease. Recently, eoCML has been separated from HES. Patients with eoCML frequently suffer organ damage including the heart and lungs. This damage is related to the release of eosinophilic granules in the blood, which results in fibrosis of the endothelial lining. We report a case of a peripheral vasculitis complicated by gangrene of the fingers in a patient with eoCML. Despite an almost complete response to CML treatment with Gleevac, combined with prednisone, aspirin and coumadin the patient sustained irreversible damage to the vascular lining of the distal arteries of the upper extremities.

Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a nonatherosclerotic segmental inflammatory disease of small- and medium-sized arteries of the distal extremities of predominantly young male tobacco users. Early symptoms may include episodic pain and coldness in fingers, and late findings may present as intermittent claudication, skin ulcers, or gangrene requiring eventual amputation. Tobacco cessation is the cornerstone of treatment. Other modalities of reducing pain or avoiding amputation have not been as successful. This review summarizes in tabular form the types of treatment that have been used, including therapeutic angiogenesis.

### A practical approach to the management of digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis: a narrative review [^40003d51]. JAMA Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Digital ulcers (DUs) occurring on the fingers in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) are associated with substantial pain and disability and are often challenging to treat. However, careful clinical assessment and prompt intervention (wound bed management and systemic pharmacologic treatment) may modify the clinical course.

Objectives

To provide a practical approach to the assessment and management of SSc-DUs and highlight unmet needs and research priorities.

Evidence Review

A narrative review of the extant literature was undertaken to provide a broad overview of current knowledge and augmented by expert opinion.

Findings

Half of the patients with SSc have a history of DUs, and there is a point of prevalence of approximately 10%. Digital ulcers are often very painful and affect all aspects of physical, social, and family life as well as occupation. Digital ulcers are associated with a severe disease course. Systemic sclerosis DUs, particularly those occurring on the fingertips, represent a vascular ischemic complication, although other etiopathogenic factors play an important role. To guide management, a structured clinical approach is required, including DU definition, classification, and categorization. Digital ulcers require a multidisciplinary approach with close cooperation between physicians and specialist nursing and other allied health professionals to guarantee the appropriate treatment and provide patient education. Local wound bed management is necessary for all DUs and is combined with systemic (pharmacologic) treatments. When treating a DU, the clinician should actively review the therapeutic strategy to prevent further DUs, including the level of systemic disease control, and monitor closely for the development of DU complications, including infection and progression to gangrene. Despite a wide available therapeutic armory, a number of unmet needs and challenges remain that that require resolution to optimize DU management.

Conclusions and Relevance

A practical approach to DU management, including local wound bed management and systemic treatments, is useful. Digital ulcers are of interest to a broad range of dermatologists, rheumatologists, and other physicians providing care for patients with SSc. Careful clinical assessment and prompt intervention can substantially modify the clinical course of DUs in SSc.

### Digital gangrene associated with scrub typhus: a case series [^72673936]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Rickettsial diseases cover a broad spectrum of illnesses. Scrub typhus is present worldwide, and Orientia tsutsugamushi is the causative agent of this chigger mite-borne infectious illness. Infections exhibit a range of severity, from mild illness to the more severe manifestation of multiorgan failure. We report three cases of scrub fever (55-year-old female, 63-year-old female, and 29-year-old male), all cases developed focal or pan-digital gangrene. All cases were successfully treated by administering doxycycline and additional supportive measures. Digital gangrene is uncommon in scrub typhus. Clinical suspension for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may avoid further complications.

### Symmetrical peripheral gangrene due to plasmodium falciparum malaria [^93271bb7]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 45-year-old man presented with a 4-day history of high-grade fever with rigours and a 2-day history of painful bluish black discolouration of extremities (acrocyanosis). He was haemodynamically stable and all peripheral pulses palpable, but the extremities were cold with gangrene involving bilateral fingers and toes. Mild splenomegaly was present on abdominal examination but rest of the physical examinations were normal. On investigating he was found to have anaemia, thrombocytopaenia with gametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum on peripheral blood smear. His blood was uncoagulable during performance of prothrombin time with a raised D-dimer. Oxygen saturation was normal and the arterial Doppler test showed reduced blood flow to the extremities. A diagnosis of complicated P. falciparum malaria with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) leading to symmetrical peripheral gangrene was performed. Artemisinin combination therapy was started and heparin was given for DIC. A final line of demarcation of gangrene started forming by 12th day.

### Symmetrical peripheral gangrene of bilateral feet and unilateral hand after administration of vasopressors during septic shock [^2e70619b]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

SPG is an infrequent clinical manifestation of an acute onset of ischaemia in two or more extremities without obstruction of the arteries that supply the extremity. Fingers and toes are most commonly affected, and the least affected are the nose, earlobes and scrotum. Hutchinson first described SPG in 1891 in a 37-year-old man who developed gangrene of the fingers, toes and earlobes after shock. Since then, single case reports and small case series have been reported in the medical literature.

SPG has been linked to infective and non-infective aetiologies and can develop in any age or sex. Acute conditions are Gram-negative and Gram-positive septicaemia, low-output states and vasopressor use. Some chronic conditions include essential thrombocythaemia, polycythaemia rubra vera, Raynaud's syndrome, diabetes and small vessel obstruction. However, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been found widespread and is probably the last cause of microvascular injury resulting in SPG. Strossel and Levy first described the association between DIC and SPG in 1970.

Septicaemia is commonly associated with clinical DIC and occurs in approximately 30%–50% of patients with SPG. The majority of SPG cases we reviewed attributed SPG to treatment for cardiogenic shock or septic shock with DIC. The pathomechanics of DIC associated with SPG is primarily driven by a disordered clotting pathway. This dysfunction may lead to inappropriate thrombin activation resulting in increased fibrin breakdown products and intravascular microthromboses. Furthermore, the additional use of vasoconstrictive drugs exacerbates tissue hypoperfusion and ischaemia, leading to eventual tissue necrosis and gangrene.

Also septic shock can be associated with high lactate. One article reported that very high serum lactate levels may be detected just prior to the onset of SPG. Our patient's lactate was significantly elevated on the same day vasopressors were initiated and remained elevated for the next few days.

### Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis following a minor dog bite to the finger: case report [^9a9e32ed]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative bacillus present in the oral cavities of 22% to 74% of healthy dogs. Capnocytophaga canimorsus has unique virulence factors that enable it to evade the human immune system and cause life-threatening sepsis following a dog bite. We report a previously well 68-year-old woman who presented with septic shock and multiorgan failure following a seemingly minor dog bite to the finger. The patient required intensive care treatment, intravenous antibiotic therapy, and multiple surgical procedures including amputation of the affected finger. The septicemia and coagulopathy that ensued resulted in gangrene and amputation of additional fingers and toes. The purpose of this report is to raise awareness of this organism among hand surgeons when faced with a patient presenting in septic shock and minimal signs at the site of a dog bite.

### Case report: extensive gangrene: a rare presentation of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [^26a5d38c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

The child was given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 2 g/kg. He also received steroids at 20 mg/kg for 5 days and then a low-dose steroid taper. The child was given therapeutic anticoagulation with enoxaparin (day 3 of admission) and was given 5 mg/kg/day of aspirin (day 13 of admission). During the hospital stay, the gangrenous changes over the pinnae became clearly demarcated. Also, the patient developed new gangrenous changes over the toes (day 8 of admission) and fingers (day 11 of admission). He had a reduced volume in the left radial pulse and ulnar pulse when he developed gangrenous changes in his fingers. Doppler ultrasound showed partial thrombosis of the left proximal two thirds of the ulnar artery and distal one third of the radial artery. The rest of the limb vessels were normal. Because the patient had progressive skin lesions and very high levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, with the possibility of direct organ injury resulting from the antibodies, a skin biopsy was tested and found to be positive for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. With a partial response to immune modulation, three cycles of plasmapheresis were done. Gradually, the skin lesions started to improve. There were clearly demarcated gangrenous changes of the bilateral pinnae, all toes of the right leg, four toes on the left leg except for the second toe, all fingers on the left hand, and all fingers on the right hand except for the ring finger (Figure 1C – F). A repeat antibody test to SARS-CoV-2 revealed a level of 12.5 U/mL. Repeat inflammatory markers improved (Table 1). Later, anticoagulation was switched to warfarin, with a target international normalized ratio of 2 to 3, and aspirin was continued. The patient was discharged with improving skin lesions after 19 days in the hospital (Figure 3). Two months after discharge, skin lesions over the face, upper limbs, lower limbs, and buttocks improved. The plan is to continue rehabilitation, and undergo cardiac surgery and cosmetic reconstruction at a later stage.

### Diagnosis and management of scleroderma peripheral vascular disease [^62836841]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The manifestations of peripheral vascular disease in patients who have systemic sclerosis (SSc) range from episodic Raynaud's phenomenon to irreversible tissue injury with ulceration and gangrene. Structural and functional changes may occur in the microvessels, digital arteries, and sometimes more proximal vessels. This article discusses the assessment of patients who have Raynaud's phenomenon in whom an underlying scleroderma-spectrum disorder is suspected and patients who have SSc with critical digital ischemia/ulceration. Different imaging techniques, including capillaroscopy and angiography, complement the history and examination, and developments in vascular imaging should facilitate future studies of pathogenesis and treatment response. New vasoactive treatments are currently being researched and older treatments revisited; therefore new approaches to therapy will likely be developed over the next 5 to 10 years.

### Acrocyanosis secondary to esophageal cancer [^0fa33264]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A 76-year-old man presented with a 1-day history of discoloration of fingers and a 1-week history of cough and sore throat. Physical examination revealed purple discolorations on fingers (Fig. 1A) and toes (Fig. 1B). Computed tomography of the chest, looking for causes of the symptoms, showed esophageal wall thickening and possible findings of metastatic cancer. Upper endoscopy revealed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's discolored fingers were diagnosed as acrocyanosis based on its appearance and the history.

Acrocyanosis is characterized by persistent cyanosis mainly in the peripheral extremities. It is generally painless but may be accompanied by moist skin and aggravated by cold exposure. It is difficult to distinguish primary (no known cause) acrocyanosis to secondary by appearance alone. Secondary acrocyanosis relates to many conditions including malignancies, hemopathy, neurologic disorders, psychiatric disorders, and medications. He was diagnosed with secondary acrocyanosis due to esophageal cancer. Acrocyanosis secondary to malignancy can also be classified as a paraneoplastic vascular syndrome which may manifest with acrocyanosis, gangrene, and/or Raynaud's phenomenon. Clinicians should consider conducting a survey for secondary causes if acrocyanosis is observed.

### Digital necrosis following combined liquid nitrogen and Candida antigen therapy for digital warts [^60267f9d]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig 1
View of the Ln2 and Candida antigen-treated finger immediately post-treatment.

Within 24 hours of treatment, the patient presented with cyanosis, balloon-like edema in the finger, erythema, and pain at the injection site, in addition to unusual red streaking patterns up the volar forearm, though no hematoma was reported (Fig 2). By the end of the calendar day, the patient visited the ER for pain relief and was treated with morphine. One week later, necrosis was observed surrounding the injection site, yet the treating physician maintained some optimism that the wound would resolve without sequelae. Due to the appearance of necrosis, the patient was referred to a hand surgeon for further evaluation.

Three weeks from the date the initial necrosis was observed, the patient presented to the hand surgeon's office with dry gangrene of the distal half of the distal phalanx. The patient elected to proceed with revision amputation on the right index finger, mid-distal phalanx with a volar V-Y advancement flap (Fig 3).

### Peripheral gangrene in children with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [^3ee0abdf]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a thrombotic microangiopathy with severe clinical manifestation, frequent recurrence, and poor long-term prognosis. It is usually caused by abnormalities in complement regulation. We report 2 cases of children affected by a catastrophic extrarenal complication. A 4-year-old Indian girl developed gangrene of the finger tips 2 days after initial presentation of aHUS. Factor H autoantibodies were identified. Renal function continued to decline despite daily plasma exchanges, and she was started on peritoneal dialysis 5 days after admission. The distal tips of the left hand remained gangrenous with a line of demarcation. Three weeks later, she did not return for follow-up and died at home because of dialysis-related complications. An Arabic girl developed end-stage renal disease due to aHUS in the fourth month after birth. A de novo activating C3 mutation was found. At age 9 months, she suddenly developed ischemic changes in fingers of both hands and several toes. The lesions progressed, and several finger tips became gangrenous despite intense plasma exchange therapy. The decision was made to administer complement blocking therapy with the C5 antibody eculizumab. All nonnecrotic digits rapidly regained perfusion. The 3 already gangrenous fingers healed with loss of the end phalanges. During maintenance, eculizumab aHUS activity subsided completely and some late recovery of renal function was observed. aHUS may present by thrombotic macroangiopathy of small peripheral arteries. Eculizumab appears effective in preserving tissue viability if administered before gangrene occurs and should be considered as first-line rescue therapy in such cases.

### Nontropical diabetic hand syndrome: a troubling new entity [^10955901]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

The nontropical diabetic hand syndrome merits recognition as a serious hand infection and diabetic complication. Initially recognized in the tropics and called tropical diabetic hand syndrome, this entity has not been previously delineated in temperate regions. Due in part to its unremarkable initial presentation, nontropical diabetic hand syndrome is neglected in temperate zones of the world yet it can result in severe morbidity and mortality among diabetic patients. It is poorly understood, needs recognition, and mandates expedited treatment since its clinical presentation is often overlooked until serious consequences occur. Inner city diabetic patients with poor glycemic control appear to be particularly susceptible to developing nontropical diabetic hand syndrome. We review this new entity and differentiate it into three clinical presentations: (Stage I) superficial erosion and ulceration; (Stage II) cellulitis and necrosis; and (Stage III) gangrene. The treatment of this new diabetic syndrome involves aggressive glycemic control and possible surgical intervention. We stress the importance of recognizing the diabetic hand syndrome as a potentially disabling and life-threatening disorder in diabetics worldwide.

### Practical management of common skin injuries, lacerations, wounds, trigger fingers, and burns [^2da6dbd6]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary care clinicians encounter many conditions during their day-to-day visits with patients. A few of these common presentations include burns, lacerations, trauma to the hand, and wounds, some of which do not require an evaluation by a specialist and can be managed outpatient by primary care clinicians. In this article, we share evidence-based tips to avoid common pitfalls in primary care recognition and management of such presentations as well as guide them to manage many of these conditions themselves. We also provide guidance in the decision to refer the patient to a plastic surgeon or other specialists.

### Digital anesthesia with epinephrine: an old myth revisited [^407bdb02]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The prohibition against the use epinephrine with local anesthetics for digital blocks or infiltrative anesthesia is an established dogma in dermatologic surgery. Major textbooks reinforce this teaching suggesting that there is substantial risk of digital gangrene caused by local anesthesia containing epinephrine.

Objective

To provide a comprehensive literature review of the cases of digital necrosis associated with the use of local anesthesia containing epinephrine.

Methods

A PubMed search of the National Library of Medicine database using the terms "lidocaine" and "epinephrine" and "finger" with no specified limits was performed.

Results

A total of 16 papers were referenced and only 6 papers dealt with digital anesthesia. A total of 50 cases of digital gangrene were reported, mostly in the early part of the 20th century. In 21 cases digital gangrene was associated with anesthetic mixed with epinephrine. Actual concentration of epinephrine was known in only 4 cases. Careful analysis of all cases of necrosis did not support epinephrine itself as a cause. Other contributing factors including older compounds (cocaine, eukaine, and procaine), non-standardized inaccurate methods of mixing epinephrine with lidocaine, inappropriate use of a tourniquet, postoperative hot soaks, infection, or large anesthetic volume were also present. None of the reported cases were associated with the use of a commercial lidocaine-epinephrine mixture.

Conclusion

A literature review failed to provide evidence to support the dogma that block or infiltrative anesthesia with lidocaine and epinephrine produces digital necrosis. Proper injection technique and adequate selection of patients (absence of thrombotic, vasospastic conditions, or uncontrolled hypertension) are mandatory to minimize complications. The addition of epinephrine, in fact, reduces the need for the use of tourniquets and large volumes of anesthetic and provides better and longer pain control during digital procedures.

### Repetitive blunt trauma and arterial injury in the hand [^847a618f]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction/Purpose

Arterial injury in the hand is most often due to repetitive blunt trauma. Although not always associated with significant impairment, it may cause serious ischemic damage or considerable disability. As a cause of digital ischemia, the frequency of this disorder is widely under appreciated. This study reviews the clinical and angiographic features of this condition.

Materials/Methods

An extensive literature review combined with the authors experience with arterial injury in the hand due to repetitive blunt hand trauma is summarized with emphasis on mechanisms of injury and pathologic changes to explain the angiographic findings and clinical presentations.

Results

Angiographic findings are related to severity of injury and underlying changes in the arterial wall. The clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic to digital necrosis and gangrene, related to severity of arterial injury, collateral circulation, and the highly variable arterial anatomy in the hand.

Conclusion

Early recognition is important because compared to many other causes of digital ischemia in the upper extremities, traumatic arterial injury is frequently readily treatable. Angiographic findings and clinical presentation are often characteristic. The diagnosis should not be based on a clear history of repetitive hand trauma since the patient may be unaware of this occurrence.

### Imaging features of pseudoaneurysms of the hand in children and adults [^42b153b6]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to review the imaging features of pseudoaneurysms of the hand in 25 patients. The patients presented with a mass, peripheral paresthesia, or ischemia. Pseudoaneurysm of the hand is a rare and often clinically unsuspected diagnosis. Correct diagnosis is important because there are risks for distal embolic disease with ischemia or gangrene of the fingers, ulnar or digital nerve dysfunction, rupture, or bone erosion and joint destruction. Scant reports appear in the world literature, and this report is the first review, to our knowledge, of the imaging features. The cause may be a history of a single direct trauma or chronic trauma, as seen in patients with hypothenar or thenar hammer syndrome.

Conclusion

Awareness of the specific imaging appearances of pseudoaneurysms of the hand and their complications may improve the accuracy of radiologic diagnosis, advance the preoperative workup, and prevent possible clinical complications such as digital gangrene, nerve dysfunction, and aneurysm rupture.

3.12 Scientific basis

Systemic steroid administration is inexpensive, effective, and fast‐acting; therefore, it is ranked as a first‐choice drug for the treatment of vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers, and routinely used. According to a study presented by Daoud et al.in which 39 patients with cutaneous arteritis (conventionally termed "cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa") with skin ulcers and 40 without skin ulcers were retrospectively investigated, the duration of disease was slightly prolonged in the former, and the incidence of concomitant neuropathy was high. Furthermore, prednisolone administration at 60 to 80 mg/day reduced pain, subcutaneous nodes, and skin ulcers in most patients with skin ulcers, but dose reduction led to recurrence in most patients. Combination therapy with immunosuppressants was attempted. Kumar et al.reported eight patients with childhood cutaneous arteritis and terminal gangrenes. Systemic steroid administration resulted in remission in all patients, but recurrence was noted in four patients and spontaneous falling of the fingers or toes in six, leading to amputation of the right leg in one patient. In addition, there are many case reports on polyarteritis nodosa, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitisin which a combination of systemic steroid administration and immunosuppressants reduced skin ulcers.

Fig 3
Digital ulcers in a patient with SLE and positive antiphospholipid antibodies. Results of literature review for the past 15 years. PubMed search terms included: "digit, finger, ulceration or necrosis, antiphospholipid". Results were filtered for language (English) and animal species (human). A total of 62 articles were obtained. Of the 62, only 16 mentioned any digital manifestation in the setting of APL or SLE. These were then categorized by the presence or absence of APL and SLE, yielding 7 (+) SLE and (+) APL. The breakdown of these 7 revealed only 2 articles that described digital ulcers as a presenting symptom of APL in patients with SLE. The remaining 5 involved either gangrene or necrosis as the presenting symptom. Breakdown of the other 46 articles was as followed: 14 articles involved ischemia/necrosis in the setting of other conditions (2 cardiopulmonary, 2 malignancy, 10 autoimmune connective tissue diseases). There were 9 cases related to antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis, 5 due to infections, 4 triggered by medications, and 4 cases not involving the digits.

### Management of pulse oximeter probe-induced finger injuries in children: report of two consecutive cases and review of the literature [^d802bc2d]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Pulse oximetry is a standard noninvasive procedure for monitoring arterial oxygen saturation. Finger injuries related to pulse oximeter use have been reported as chemical or thermal burns, sun-tanning, pressure erosion, sensory loss, and gangrene. The mechanisms of these complications have not been definitively explained; but pressure ischemia, prolonged use, overheating of the probe, inappropriate use of the probe, and short circuiting are considered to be the main factors. We describe 2 cases of pulse oximeter probe-induced finger injuries, propose the possible mechanisms and factors related to the injury, and discuss the management.

### Delusional infestation complicated by gangrene and osteomyelitis requiring finger amputation [^e7d22010]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig 1
The patient developed erosions and a nonhealing ulcer on his left second finger that was worsening and concerning for osteomyelitis.

Fig 2
The patient consulted with his amputated finger in a specimen container. The amputation site was through the metacarpal phalangeal joint with a smooth resection margin of subchondral bone. The finger was covered by white-tan skin. 2 ulcers with necrotic borders were present at the level of the tip and ventral aspect of the proximal phalanx. The first ulcer extended to the remaining proximal third of the distal phalanx.

Histopathology of the amputated digit revealed lichen simplex chronicus prurigo nodularis, ulceration, cellulitis, and acute and chronic osteomyelitis (Figs 3 and 4). Periodic acid-Schiff, Grocott methenamine-silver, and Warthin-Starry stains were all negative.

### Incomplete superficial palmar arch and gangrene in the hand in a neonate with DOCK6 mutation [^f0b2c3e1]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

The superficial palmar arch, formed by the branches of radial and ulnar arteries, supplies the blood to the hand. In cases of incomplete superficial palmar arch, the radial and ulnar branches fail to join. Any compromise to the ulnar blood supply in an incomplete superficial palmar arch can lead to subsequent gangrene. This baby presented with blackish discolouration and gangrene on the left hand, primarily affecting the little, ring, middle and index fingers. Timely intervention with antibiotics and heparinisation led to salvage of the ring, middle and index fingers, while the little finger underwent auto-amputation. On clinical exome sequencing, the baby was found to have DOCK6 mutation. This case highlights the importance of vascular involvement in DOCK6 mutation and the need for careful evaluation and management in cases of incomplete superficial palmar arch.

Frostbite background — frostbite is a condition that results from the freezing of skin and, in severe cases, underlying tissues, in which the formation of ice crystals within the cells causes cellular and tissue damage. The extremities — fingers, toes, nose, and ears — are particularly susceptible to frostbite, and the severity ranges from superficial frostbite affecting only the outer layers of the skin to more severe cases involving deeper tissues. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, pain, and changes in skin color, and in extreme cases frostbite can cause tissue necrosis leading to digit or limb loss.

### Digital ulcers: overt vascular disease in systemic sclerosis [^034a8b27]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

RP is an almost universal manifestation of SSc, with 95% of all patients being affected, and resulting in digital ulcers (DUs) in approximately 30% of the patients each year. DUs are a major clinical problem, being associated with substantial morbidity (reduced quality of life, pain, disability and disfigurement) that can escalate to gangrene and amputation. Ideally, the treatment of DUs would improve tissue integrity and viability, promote ulcer healing and reduce the formation of new ulcers. Treatments that have shown potential include calcium channel blockers, prostacyclin analogues and endothelin receptor antagonists. However, until recently, management was based on empirical experience. The recent approval (in Europe) of the dual endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan, to reduce the number of new DUs in patients with SSc and ongoing DU disease, means that there is now an approved therapy — and new hope — for the treatment of DUs in these severely afflicted patients.

### Pythiosis presenting with digital gangrene and subcutaneous nodules mimicking medium vessel vasculitis [^c6d5d921]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pythiosis is an infectious disease caused by microorganisms of the Pythium genus, a form of funguslike oomycetes living in water-rich habitats. Human pythiosis is an emerging disease with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Early recognition and management is crucial for successful treatment and outcomes. Because identifying the pathogen can be challenging, pythiosis might be easily misdiagnosed. Here we report a case of vascular pythiosis, the manifestation of which mimics medium-sized vasculitis.

### Multiple digital gangrene after a radial artery penetrating injury: a case report [^2559dae8]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a young female patient who sustained a radial artery penetration injury from broken glass after falling and was managed only by external compression without arterial repair. Although the patient did not have any reported predisposing factors and the radial artery was normal as well as patent in the angiographic examination, she developed progressive multiple digital ischemia and required subsequent amputation of the gangrenous fingers. The possible mechanism might be an occlusion of the digital arteries originating from the injured radial artery by dispersion of thrombembolic particles distally during the injury as there was sparing of involvement of the ring finger, which wore a ring that restricted the thromboembolic particles from passing distally during the accident. This case revealed that particular attention should be paid to those patients with a radial artery penetration injury to facilitate early detection and implementation of therapy for possible finger ischemia and subsequent gangrene.

### Necrotizing infections of the hand and wrist: diagnosis and treatment options [^35532a72]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing infections of the hand and wrist are important clinical entities because of their rapidly progressive and potentially lethal nature. These infections encompass a spectrum of diseases with overlapping signs and symptoms, which can be subtle and nonspecific. If the brief prodromal period of these infections goes unrecognized, a local area of devitalized tissue can evolve into fulminant infection, multiorgan failure, and potentially death. Early recognition and treatment including administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical débridement are paramount to improving patient outcomes.

### The 2024 British Society for Rheumatology guideline for management of systemic sclerosis [^9f67bdf5]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Digital vasculopathy

Digital vasculopathy leads to Raynaud's and digital ischaemia with development of complications of severe vasculopathy including gangrene, ulceration and infection of superficial and deep tissues. Management of Raynaud's is central to the symptomatic treatment of SSc. Since 2015 there have been several studies exploring new treatments, but these have not led to new approved therapies. The challenge of outcome assessment in RP is recognized and new outcome measures are currently being validated. Digital ulceration almost always reflects vasculopathy even when there are other contributory factors such as calcinosis or trauma. Treatment in adults is supported by clinical trial evidence including two robust trials showing significant benefit for the non-selective endothelin antagonist bosentan in reducing the number of new DU in adults with SSc. Digital ulcers and severe ischaemia require urgent prioritized management and establishment of 'hot clinics' analogous to those for giant cell arteritis may be considered. Benefit from the selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE5i) tadalafil is considered by experts to be similar to sildenafil and may be considered as an alternative in those who are having difficulty with sildenafil. Experts agree that PDE5i and bosentan may be used in combination in severe cases, especially those being considered for intravenous prostanoids. Despite a lack of paediatric-specific trials, in children and adolescents similar approaches are used and are recommended by international paediatric consensus. However, it is important to consider the availability of paediatric dosing and safety data for specific therapies, e.g. currently available for sildenafil but not for tadalafil.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum of the hand: a case series and review of the literature [^430f07fc]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rapidly developing cutaneous ulcer that is rare in the hand and may mimic a fulminating infection. The correct treatment is nonsurgical; surgery may actually incite a pathergic response worsening the condition. Misdiagnosis results in inappropriate treatment, unnecessary surgery, and even amputations. The records of 7 patients with pyoderma gangrenosum of the hand treated at 2 large academic medical centers between 1992 and 1999 were reviewed. There were 4 men and 3 women with an average age of 58 years (range, 32–81 years). Five patients had bilateral involvement. Minor trauma preceded the appearance of the lesions. An associated systemic disease was found in all patients with ulcerative colitis being the most common (3 patients). All patients initially had a misdiagnosis of infection. Thirteen misdiagnoses (range, 1–3/patient) resulted in 16 unnecessary surgeries (mean, 2.2/patient) including 4 amputations and 2 failed skin grafts. No surgical procedure resulted in clinical improvement. All cultures were negative. Several physicians (mean, 5; range, 3–7) examined each patient before the final diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum, which was made by, or in conjunction with, a dermatologist in all cases. The average time to clinical improvement after correct medical treatment was initiated was 5 days.

### Cryoglobulinemia: a rare cause of digital gangrene after elective foot surgery [^065453ed]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The development of gangrene after elective digital surgery is a rare complication. We present a case of a patient with normal preoperative vascular examination findings and a history significant for untreated hepatitis C. The patient underwent revisional second toe arthrodesis and plantar plate repair with pin fixation. After surgery, she developed gangrene and ultimately required partial digital amputation. The wound at the amputation site worsened postoperatively, warranting a rheumatologic evaluation that revealed previously undiagnosed cryoglobulinemia. Cryoglobulinemia is defined as the presence of abnormal proteins in the blood that crystallize when cooled. It can cause systemic vasculitis and is often associated with hepatitis C infection. The hyperviscosity of the immunoglobulins and an intravascular inflammatory response can lead to thrombosis and ischemic tissue loss. In the absence of peripheral arterial disease, patients undergoing digital surgery who develop digital infarcts should be screened for cryoglobulinemia as a potential cause for digital necrosis, especially if the patient has a history of hepatitis C. We describe a case of an unusual presentation of gangrene after elective digital surgery and highlight the need for a rheumatologic evaluation in cases in which vasculitis is suspected.

### Ergotamine tartrate (Ergomar) [^6329099f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Although signs and symptoms of ergotism rarely develop even after long term intermittent use of the drug, care should be exercised to remain within the limits of recommended dosage. Ergotism is manifested by intense arterial vasoconstriction, producing signs and symptoms of peripheral vascular ischemia. Ergotamine induces vasoconstriction by a direct action on vascular smooth muscle. In chronic intoxication with ergot derivatives, headache, intermittent claudication, muscle pains, numbness, coldness and pallor of the digits may occur. If the condition is allowed to progress untreated, gangrene can result. While most cases of ergotism associated with ergotamine treatment result from frank overdosage, some cases have involved apparent hypersensitivity. There are few reports of ergotism among patients taking doses within the recommended limits or for brief periods of time. In rare instances, patients, particularly those who have used the medication indiscriminately over long periods of time, may display withdrawal symptoms consisting of rebound headache upon discontinuation of the drug.

Information for Patients

Patients should be advised that one Ergomar®Sublingual Tablet should be taken at the first sign of a migraine headache. No more than 2 tablets should be taken for any single migraine attack. No more than 5 tablets should be taken during any 7-day period. Administration of Ergomar®Sublingual Tablets should not exceed the dosing guidelines and should not be used for chronic daily administration (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Ergomar®Sublingual Tablets should be used only for migraine headaches. It is not effective for other types of headaches and it lacks analgesic properties. Patients should be advised to report to the physician immediately any of the following: numbness or tingling in the fingers and toes, muscle pain in the arms and legs, weakness in the legs, pain in the chest or temporary speeding or slowing of the heart rate, swelling or itching.

Frostbite scenario 1 (no active thawing) — dressings: no evidence supports applying a dressing to a frostbitten part intended to remain frozen until rewarming can safely be achieved; if this is considered, it should only be done if practical and will not interfere with mobility, and bulky, clean, and dry gauze or sterile cotton dressings should be applied to the frozen part and between the toes and fingers. Recommendation: Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence.

Differential diagnosis

Purpura associated with clinical signs of shock is strongly suggestive of sepsis, but can also occur in conditions causing acute haemolysis such as haemolytic uraemic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura. Our patient had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with a borderline low haptoglobin (table 1), but other markers of haemolysis, including blood film examination and reticulocyte count, were not impressive, and thrombocytopaenia was only mild. Toxic neutrophilia with marked left shift was the predominant finding, consistent with bacterial infection.

Other conditions that may be responsible for purpura fulminans and symmetrical peripheral gangrene (SPG) include myeloproliferative disorders, lymphoproliferative disorders, vasculitides, uncontrolled proinflammatory disorders and antiphospholipid syndrome. These were all screened for in a barrage of initial tests. An isolated monoclonal IgG kappa immunoglobulin was detected by serum electrophoresis and was followed up after ICU discharge. Bone marrow trephine and extended light chain analysis confirmed previously undiagnosed multiple myeloma. Given that the SPG had dissipated by this time, we do not believe it was the fundamental cause of the presentation, although we acknowledge it could have been a contributing factor. He has subsequently undergone chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation with an encouraging response.

Whether his hereditary spherocytosis also contributed to the syndrome, or not, is unclear. The condition is known to affect the transit of red cells through the microcirculation. Splenectomy increases susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria, such as pneumococcus, and it may also have preserved his platelet levels and masked the severity of his DIC.

### Buerger's disease in the 21st century: diagnosis, clinical features, and therapy [^615df239]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans or TAO) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the development of segmental thrombotic occlusions of the medium and small arteries of the extremities. It is clinically and pathologically distinguishable from arteriosclerosis and necrotizing arteritis. Afflicted patients are mostly young, male, inveterate tobacco smokers who present with distal extremity ischemia, ischemic ulcers, or frank gangrene of the toes or fingers. Large arteries are typically spared, as are the coronary, cerebral, and visceral circulations. While mortality is not increased, patients with Buerger's disease often suffer from severe ischemic pain and tissue loss culminating in minor and major limb amputation. Clinical diagnostic criteria generally include the following: (1) history of smoking or tobacco abuse; (2) age of onset less than 45 to 50 years; (3) infrapopliteal, segmental arterial occlusions with sparing of the proximal vasculature; (4) frequent distal upper extremity arterial involvement (Raynaud's syndrome or digital ulceration); (5) superficial phlebitis; and (6) exclusion of arteriosclerosis, diabetes, true arteritis, proximal embolic source, and hypercoagulable states. Typical arteriographic patterns have been described that are suggestive, but not pathognomonic. While the cause of Buerger's disease remains unknown, the disease onset and clinical course are inextricably linked to tobacco abuse. Acute Buerger's disease is characterized histopathologically by intensely cellular vessel wall inflammation, giant cell foci, and hypercellular thrombi, but with preservation of the elastic lamina and the overall vascular wall architecture. Most investigators feel that Buerger's disease is an immune-mediated endarteritis; recent immunocytochemical studies have identified the linear deposition of immunoglobulins and complement factors along the elastic lamina. The inciting antigen has not been discovered. Tobacco abstinence generally results in disease quiescence and remains the mainstay of treatment.

### Limb salvage after gas gangrene: a case report and review of the literature [^06c337c1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Even though cases with aggressive infection presenting with systemic complications due to gas gangrene of the limb are more likely to have more advanced local infection which precludes limb salvage, there is no evidence that amputation controls infection better than adequate wide surgical debridement. Therefore, in our patient the treatment decision for limb salvage was not influenced by the presence of systemic complications. It was rather based on the estimation of what is left behind after an adequate resection of all devitalized tissue. If limb salvage is attempted, one must take into account that postoperative daily surgical exploration might be necessary for several days until all necrotic tissue is removed. In cases of limb salvage after gas gangrene reported in the literature, serial debridement following initial surgery was necessary only in four patients including our case. This might indicate a more adequate initial operation in cases with limb preservation or a less aggressive form of disease in these patients.

Even though gas gangrene of the limb is an extremely emergency surgical condition individual patients' preferences after thorough information should be taken into account. First a decision is taken whether the limb can be saved. If the limb can be preserved the decision whether it should be saved should come in concert with the patient. The tradeoffs involved with protracted treatment course of limb salvage versus immediate amputation and prosthetic fitting should be made clear to the patient. Saving the limb, often comes at a great cost. Multiple operations to obtain bony reunion and soft tissue coverage are often necessary. Chronic pain and drug addiction also are common problems of limb salvage because patients endure multiple hospital admissions and surgery, isolation from their family and friends, and unemployment. In the end, despite heroic efforts the limb ultimately could require an amputation or a "successfully salvaged limb may be chronically painful or functionless. The worst case scenario occurs when a limb must be amputated after the patient has endured multiple operations of an unsuccessful salvage or after years of pain following a "successful" salvage. On the other hand, early amputation and prosthetic fitting has been shown to be associated with decreased morbidity, fewer operations, shorter hospital course, decreased hospital costs, shorter rehabilitation in cases of traumatic limb injury. Thus, it is important to present all information from the very beginning so that the patient is able to make educated decisions regarding which course to follow. The subjective importance of body image for the patient, the possibility of prolonged hospitalization, financial burden and possible social isolation should be discussed with the patient in order to help them make real informed decisions.

### Salvage of the hand with a free flap in a hemodialysis patient with finger gangrene and ipsilateral arteriovenous fistula: a case report [^17d77cfd]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a female with end-stage renal disease who developed a left ischemic hand and index finger gangrene 2 years after commencement of hemodialysis. Ray amputation was performed, however, the surgical wound was complicated by progressive soft tissue necrosis and metacarpal bones exposure. To avoid amputation at a higher level, we repaired the defect successfully with a free anterolateral thigh perforator flap. A radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula, the dialysis access, was divided to provide the recipient vessels. Reconstruction with this method has the advantage of a staged arteriovenous fistula, which can increase the free-flap success rate, and has the potential to improve perfusion of the distal ischemic hand.

### Ergotamine tartrate and caffeine (Migergot) [^73a470ef]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Although signs and symptoms of ergotism rarely develop even after long term intermittent use of the rectally administered drug, care should be exercised to remain within the limits of recommended dosage.

Ergotism is manifested by intense arterial vasoconstriction, producing signs and symptoms of peripheral vascular ischemia. Ergotamine induces vasoconstriction by a direct action on vascular smooth muscle. In chronic intoxication with ergot derivatives, headache, intermittent claudication, muscle pains, numbness, coldness and pallor of the digits may occur. If the condition is allowed to progress untreated, gangrene can result.

While most cases of ergotism associated with ergotamine treatment result from frank overdosage, some cases have involved apparent hypersensitivity. There are few reports of ergotism among patients taking doses within the recommended limits or for brief periods of time. In rare instances, patients, particularly those who have used the medication indiscriminately over long periods of time, may display withdrawal symptoms consisting of rebound headache upon discontinuation of the drug.

Rare cases of a solitary rectal or anal ulcer have occurred from abuse of ergotamine suppositories usually in higher than recommended doses or with continual use at the recommended dose for many years. Spontaneous healing occurs within usually 4–8 weeks after drug withdrawal.

### Bacteriology of naja atra snakebite wound and its implications for antibiotic therapy [^d3d4a485]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

A total of 112 cases of Naja atra envenomation were examined at two referring hospitals: Taichung Veterans General Hospital in central Taiwan and Taipei Veterans General Hospital (VGH-TP) in northern Taiwan. Overall, 77% (86/112) of cases developed clinically suspected wound infections and 54% (61/112) required surgery secondary to tissue necrosis, finger or toe gangrene, and/or necrotizing fasciitis. Morganella morganii was the most abundant gram-negative bacterial strain isolated from bite wounds, followed by Proteus spp. Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Providencia spp. in descending order; Enterococcus spp. were the most common gram-positive bacteria and Bacteroides spp. were the only anaerobic bacteria. A few episodes of bacteremia were caused by Bacteroides and Shewanella spp. There were no significant variations in the distribution of bacterial species between these two hospitals except for a higher incidence of M. morganii, Enterococcus spp., and polymicrobial infection observed at VGH-TP, which may have been related to variations in the fecal flora of prey and oral flora of individual snakes in different geographic areas in Taiwan. According to the susceptibility test involving various pathogens, first-line drug options for the management of N. atra snakebite wound infections may include monotherapy with ureidopenicillin or combination therapy with aminopenicillin and a third-generation cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone. A prospective evaluation of empiric antibiotic therapy for the management of N. atra snakebite should be considered.

As coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) continues to cause an immense burden on the global health care systems, it is crucial to understand the breadth of this disease process. Recent reports identified hypercoagulability in a subset of critically ill patients and extremity ischemia in an even smaller cohort. Because abnormal coagulation parameters and extremity ischemia have been shown to correlate with poor disease prognosis, understanding how to treat these patients is crucial. To better describe the identification and management of this phenomenon, we present 2 cases of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who developed fingertip ischemia while in the intensive care unit.

### A clinical analysis of diabetic patients with hand ulcer in a diabetic foot centre [^49e5b4b3]. Diabetic Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Because of its high amputation and mortality rate, diabetic foot is receiving more and more attention as one of the severe diabetes-related complications. However, diabetic hand is less well recognized and usually overlooked by clinicians. In fact, diabetic hand has, to date, not been considered as a specific complication of diabetes and no precise definition for it can be found in the literature. Papanas and Maltezos suggested that it could be defined as a syndrome of musculoskeletal manifestations of the hand in diabetic patients. Although limited joint mobility, Dupuytren's contraction and trigger fingers are the most commonly published conditions of the diabetic hand, hand ulcer with infection can cause more serious complications such as gangrene, amputation or even death. Hand ulcer with infection in diabetic patients was first described in the USA in 1977. However, since 1983, the subsequent majority of reports were from African countries, and hand ulcer with infection was also termed the tropical diabetic hand syndrome. Excluding a few case reports, there has been no analysis of the clinical characteristics of hand ulcer in Chinese diabetic patients. To understand the clinical features and risk factors of hand ulcers in hospitalized patients with diabetes, we studied diabetic inpatients with hand ulcer in a diabetic foot care centre over a period of 5.75 years.

### Recent advances in the study of gangrene of the extremities… [^99ff9996]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Experimental and clinical research into the etiology of gangrene of the extremities occupies an increasingly important place in modern medicine. In this research the study of the larger vessels by morphologic methods has proved inadequate. Thus Herrman and Reid1 have concluded that neither arteriographic examination nor morphologic studies of the large vessels can furnish a satisfactory explanation of the clinical manifestations. Rabinowitz2 says: "While an outstanding lesion in thrombo-angiitis obliterans is a thrombotic closure of both large and small vessels, many clinical features of the disease cannot be attributed solely to this lesion. " And now recent work by Popoff3 throws new light on the limitation and inadequacy of morphologic research confined mainly to the state of the large vessels of the extremities.

In his studies on the digital vascular system, Popoff pays particular attention to the peripheral arteriovenous anastomosis in inflammation, arteriosclerotic gangrene, diabetic gangrene, obliterating thrombo-angiitis RECENT ADVANCES IN THE STUDY OF GANGRENE OF THE EXTREMITIES.

### Clinical mimickers misdiagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum [^97f3ac55]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, ulcerative, neutrophilic dermatosis that can be challenging to diagnose. Diagnosis of PG is clinical due to a lack of specific histopathologic, immunologic, or imaging findings associated with the disease, although several clinical frameworks exist to guide diagnosis. However, misdiagnosis of PG is frequent and leads to increased patient morbidity and mortality. This article highlights common mimickers of PG and offers clinical pearls to aid in accurate diagnosis with the goal of decreasing diagnostic delay and misdiagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

### Predictors of digital amputation in diabetic patients with surgically treated finger infections [^85910e1c]. Hand (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is a well-established risk factor for infections. Due to impaired wound healing and defects in cell-mediated immunity, patients have an increased susceptibility to infection and often present with more severe infections than patients without diabetes. - While less common than diabetic foot infections, hand infections can also have devastating consequences causing long-term disability, ranging from chronic pain to stiffness and joint contractures to amputation. Compared with patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes who present with hand infections are more likely to require repeat debridement or amputation for adequate infectious control. In the most severe cases, diabetic patients with hand infections present with sepsis requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and extensive resuscitative efforts in addition to prompt surgical treatment.

In diabetic hand infections limited to cellulitis alone, medical treatment with antibiotics is often curative. However, in the presence of devascularized tissue, abscess, tenosynovitis, osteomyelitis, or other deep infection, surgical treatment is indicated. This may entail digit preserving drainage/debridement with or without soft tissue reconstruction (Figure 1), or amputation of the affected digit (Figure 2). In some cases, either surgical strategy is feasible, and the surgeon and patient can engage in shared decision-making to decide which option is best. In other cases, amputation is necessary due to extensive tissue necrosis or infection, which is uncontrollable by other means. The functional consequences of even minor amputations are significant: Studies of patients who have undergone digital amputation reveal they have poorer motor function and impaired activities of daily living. In a study of 127 patients who had 1 or more digits amputated proximal to the distal interphalangeal joint, one-quarter stated they had to change their jobs. Furthermore, amputation puts patients at risk of painful neuroma, which can also substantially decrease quality of life.

### Purpura fulminans and severe sepsis due to Pasteurella multocida infection in an immunocompetent patient [^575dca67]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 75-year-old woman was admitted into the intensive care unit, with severe sepsis and renal failure. She developed purpura fulminans (PF) of bilateral upper and lower extremities along with gangrene on the tips of her fingers and toes. Blood cultures confirmed Pasteurella multocida as the causative organism. Despite aggressive supportive measures, the patient remained dependent on high doses of vasopressors and the gangrene progressed. She ultimately succumbed to her underlying severe sepsis. PF is a rare and fatal dermatological emergency commonly seen in children, but it also occurs in adults. Acute infectious PF occurs secondary to severe sepsis and P. multocida is a rare cause of PF. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of PF due to P. multocida in an adult.
