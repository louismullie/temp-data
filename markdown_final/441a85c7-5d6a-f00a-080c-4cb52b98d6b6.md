## Question

How to treat newly diagnosed diabetes with hyperglycemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat newly diagnosed diabetes with hyperglycemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing type 1 from type 2 diabetes. Then, I should assess severity and whether there is metabolic decompensation. Next, I will align treatment intensity with severity, including when to use insulin, metformin, or combination therapy. After that, I need to outline dosing, titration, and monitoring. Finally, I should consider special populations, education, and follow-up, and I will double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and phenotype before jumping to treatment, because misclassification changes management. I should verify that the patient meets ADA diagnostic criteria for diabetes and then assess for type 1 diabetes features such as age, BMI, family history, ketonuria or DKA, and autoantibodies when indicated, since ketosis or uncertainty mandates initial insulin regardless of type 1 suspicion [^507df339] [^bd39955d].

> Next, I should review severity markers to triage therapy. I need to check for symptomatic hyperglycemia, catabolic features like weight loss, and labs including random glucose, A1C, and ketones, because these determine whether to start insulin immediately or whether metformin-based therapy is appropriate. Thresholds such as A1C ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL with symptoms push toward insulin, whereas A1C 7.5–9.0% without catabolism may allow metformin-first strategies with close follow-up [^e60d4ce8] [^0b118f06] [^947165e3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about insulin for everyone with high A1C. I should verify the evidence base. Observational data in patients with A1C ≥ 12% suggested non-insulin regimens could perform as well as insulin in some newly diagnosed patients, but these were retrospective and confounded, so I should not over-interpret them against guideline-directed care and newer randomized data supporting early insulin in appropriate patients [^e95d679d] [^0f372d4d] [^56d0dec1].

> For severe hyperglycemia with symptoms or catabolism, I will now examine the role of short-term intensive insulin. The rationale is to rapidly reverse glucotoxicity and potentially improve beta-cell function; guidelines endorse basal insulin with or without prandial coverage when A1C > 10% or glucose > 300 mg/dL with symptoms, and a recent randomized trial supports a simplified strategy after short-term insulin to maintain control, which I should consider in shared decision-making [^e60d4ce8] [^233c8bc9].

> For dosing basal insulin, let me think about a practical starting point. A reasonable estimate is 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, with titration every few days to a fasting glucose target around 80–130 mg/dL, and I should remember that many patients can be taught to self-titrate with clinician oversight to improve outcomes and reduce inertia [^a33af794] [^a0cd4a96].

> For moderate hyperglycemia without catabolism, I should confirm that metformin remains first-line unless contraindicated. I need to ensure renal function is adequate, start low to mitigate GI effects, and titrate to 2,000 mg/day if tolerated, while also initiating lifestyle therapy and arranging timely follow-up to avoid clinical inertia [^209f8081] [^f887ff34] [^81361103].

> But wait, what if the A1C is markedly above goal at diagnosis, such as ≥ 9.0–10.0%? I should double-check whether combination therapy is indicated. Contemporary guidelines support early combination therapy in drug-naïve patients with A1C ≥ 9.0% or ≥ 1.5% above target, often metformin plus a second agent chosen for comorbidity, hypoglycemia risk, weight, and cost, and this approach can expedite control and may better preserve beta-cell function than sequential monotherapy [^0b118f06] [^947165e3] [^3aa90611].

> I need to ensure I tailor agent selection to comorbidities and patient preferences. If ASCVD or high risk is present, a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit is prioritized. If heart failure or CKD is present, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. If weight loss is a priority, agents like semaglutide or tirzepatide offer high glycemic and weight efficacy, and I should explicitly discuss hypoglycemia risk, cost, and access [^1ad67f23] [^96eba04e].

> For pediatrics, I should confirm different thresholds. In youth with T2D, metformin is first-line if metabolically stable, but marked hyperglycemia or ketosis warrants initial long-acting insulin with metformin, and DKA requires inpatient insulin and fluids. I need to check for type 1 features and autoantibodies when the phenotype is uncertain to avoid mismanagement [^497960d9] [^5ca0d804] [^bd39955d].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up cadence. I will obtain A1C every 3 months until at target, then every 6 months, and I will arrange frequent contact early on to titrate therapy, reinforce education, and screen for complications. I should also remember that early worsening of retinopathy can occur with rapid glycemic improvement, so if retinopathy is present, I will monitor closely and counsel accordingly [^cef07ab2] [^dc000467].

> I will now examine non-pharmacologic foundations that must accompany medication. Diabetes self-management education and support, nutrition therapy emphasizing fiber and caloric balance, and at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity are essential and should be embedded from the outset, with periodic reinforcement to sustain behavior change and improve outcomes [^81361103] [^2c45728d].

> Let me reconsider the conflicting observational signal about insulin versus non-insulin in severe hyperglycemia. While some retrospective data suggested non-insulin regimens could succeed in newly diagnosed patients, these findings are limited by confounding and selection bias; given stronger guideline consensus and randomized data on early insulin strategies, I should prioritize guideline-concordant therapy while individualizing based on patient values, access, and follow-up capacity [^e95d679d] [^e60d4ce8] [^56d0dec1].

> In summary, I should confirm diagnosis and phenotype, assess severity and catabolism, start insulin for severe symptomatic hyperglycemia or ketosis, otherwise begin metformin with lifestyle and escalate to combination therapy if A1C is ≥ 9.0% or remains above goal, titrate aggressively with close follow-up, and tailor agent selection to comorbidities and patient preferences, recognizing that early, structured intervention in newly diagnosed patients yields the largest glycemic gains and may modify disease trajectory [^e60d4ce8] [^0b118f06] [^233c8bc9].

For newly diagnosed diabetes with hyperglycemia, **start metformin unless contraindicated** [^209f8081] and initiate **basal insulin if A1C ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL** [^e60d4ce8] or if symptomatic [^c918b5ca]. Use a **patient-centered approach** [^1ad67f23] that incorporates lifestyle changes, diabetes education, and shared decision-making [^81361103]. Titrate therapy every 3 months [^cef07ab2] to reach an A1C < 7% if safe, and individualize targets for older adults or those with comorbidities [^4dab2e7f]. Monitor for hypoglycemia, weight changes, and adverse effects, and adjust therapy based on response and patient preferences [^df06bb0d].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnostic confirmation

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Use ADA criteria (A1C ≥ 6.5%, fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, 2-hour OGTT ≥ 200 mg/dL, or random glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL with symptoms) [^notfound].

- **Classify diabetes**: Distinguish type 1 (autoimmune, ketosis-prone) from type 2 (insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome) [^bd39955d].

- **Assess severity**: Evaluate symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss), glucose levels, A1C, and ketones [^e60d4ce8].

---

## General principles of management

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Foundation of therapy; include medical nutrition therapy, physical activity, and weight management [^81361103] [^2c45728d].

- **Patient education**: Essential for adherence and self-management; provide diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) [^59a81e10].

- **Shared decision-making**: Align treatment with patient preferences, comorbidities, and goals [^1ad67f23].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

### First-line pharmacologic therapy

Metformin is **first-line** unless contraindicated (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or intolerance) [^209f8081] [^9b450c04]. Start at 500 mg twice daily with meals and titrate to 2,000 mg/day as tolerated [^f887ff34].

---

### Indications for initial insulin therapy

Initiate insulin when **A1C ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL** [^e60d4ce8] or if symptomatic (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss) [^c918b5ca]. Basal insulin (e.g. glargine, degludec) is preferred initially, starting at 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day and titrating to fasting glucose 80–130 mg/dL [^a33af794] [^b028ba70].

---

### Combination therapy

Consider **early combination therapy** when A1C is ≥ 1.5% above target (e.g. metformin plus a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor) [^0b118f06] [^947165e3]. Choose agents based on comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, weight effects, and patient preferences [^1ad67f23].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)**: For patients on insulin or at risk of hypoglycemia; frequency individualized [^982d2eab].

- **A1C monitoring**: Every 3 months until at target, then every 6 months [^notfound].

- **Hypoglycemia assessment**: At each visit, especially if using insulin or sulfonylureas [^df06bb0d].

---

## Individualized A1C targets

Aim for **A1C < 7%** for most nonpregnant adults if safely achievable [^4dab2e7f]. Use more stringent targets (6.0–6.5%) in selected patients (young, long life expectancy, no significant CVD) [^4dab2e7f]. Less stringent targets (7.5–8.0%) are appropriate for older adults, limited life expectancy, or high hypoglycemia risk [^4dab2e7f].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Individualize targets; prioritize avoiding hypoglycemia and functional decline [^4dab2e7f].

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Adjust metformin dose; prefer SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs with renal benefits [^1ad67f23].

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Prioritize GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefits [^1ad67f23].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of intensive glycemic control

Benefits include reduced microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) [^45952f73], whereas risks include hypoglycemia, weight gain, and limited cardiovascular benefit in some trials [^4e1bf6f1]. Balance risks and benefits using a patient-centered approach [^d8d47519].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended initial therapy** |
|-|-|
| A1C < 10%, asymptomatic | Metformin + lifestyle [^209f8081] [^8ddbf273] |
| A1C ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL, symptomatic | Basal insulin + metformin + lifestyle [^e60d4ce8] [^c918b5ca] |
| A1C ≥ 1.5% above target | Early combination therapy (metformin + GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor) [^0b118f06] [^947165e3] |

---

Initial management of newly diagnosed diabetes with hyperglycemia centers on **metformin unless contraindicated**, with **insulin added for severe hyperglycemia or symptoms** [^e60d4ce8]. Use a patient-centered approach with lifestyle change, education, and shared decision-making, and titrate therapy every 3 months to individualized A1C targets [^1ad67f23] [^cef07ab2].

### Initial management of severe hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: an observational study [^ae6359c3]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes affects 25.8 million people (8.3%) in the USA. There were 1.9 million new cases diagnosed in 2010 alone. While the diagnostic threshold for diabetes is an A1C ≥ 6.5%, patients can present with severe hyperglycemia with A1C values reaching higher than 14%. Severe hyperglycemia may warrant specific and immediate treatment considerations to prevent acute complications, alleviate symptoms, and preserve beta cell function. However, literature regarding the effectiveness of different treatment approaches to manage patients with non-emergent, severe hyperglycemia is limited.

The American Diabetes Association's (ADA) position statement on a patient-centered approach to the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes recommends that "if a patient presents with significant hyperglycemic symptoms and/or has dramatically elevated plasma glucose concentrations (> 300–350 mg/dL), or an A1C ≥ 10–12%, insulin therapy should be strongly considered from the outset". After symptoms are relieved and glucose levels are decreased, oral agents can be added and it may be possible to withdraw insulin, if preferred. This recommendation makes no distinction between newly diagnosed or drug-naïve patients and treated or established patients, and does not provide references or level of evidence.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) algorithm for glycemic control recommends insulin therapy ± other agents for patients who present with an A1C > 9%. The recommendations state that "for drug naïve patients with A1C levels > 9%, it is unlikely that 1, 2, or even 3 agents (other than insulin) will achieve the A1C goal". The algorithm does, however, suggest that treatment with combination non-insulin agents in drug-naïve patients who do not have symptoms may be sufficient. References or levels of evidence are not provided.

Although consensus statements suggest initiating insulin therapy, this is challenging in real-world practice. Successful insulin initiation requires time, resources, knowledge, proper dose titration, significant patient education and training, self-monitoring of blood glucose, and frequent follow-up. In the primary care setting, many barriers exist, including time restraints, patient resistance, and lack of available resources and trained staff that make it difficult to initiate insulin therapy in a safe and effective manner.

### Initial management of severe hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: an observational study [^e95d679d]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The results from this retrospective study show that a new diagnosis of diabetes, more visits with a certified diabetes educator, and fewer days to first follow-up A1C were predictors of success in achieving an A1C ≤ 9%, whereas insulin therapy was not. Furthermore, it was observed that insulin therapy did not lead to better A1C reductions or higher odds of achieving an A1C ≤ 9% compared to non-insulin regimens, regardless if the patient was newly diagnosed or had an established diagnosis. A new diagnosis of diabetes was a confounding variable. Meaningful glucose reductions were much more likely in newly diagnosed patients than those with established diabetes regardless of the treatment approach. Despite limitations, this study suggests that patients with T2D and severe hyperglycemia, particularly those newly diagnosed, may be able to be managed with non-insulin therapy. Further randomized prospective studies are warranted to confirm this.

### Initial management of severe hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: an observational study [^5da4eb05]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

The lack of sufficient evidence and the practical challenges posed by initiating insulin therapy support the need for further evaluation of treatment approaches to severe hyperglycemia in T2D patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to (1) describe the patient characteristics and initial management strategies of patients with T2D who presented with A1C values ≥ 12%, (2) compare the changes in A1C from baseline to 12 months between patients prescribed insulin-based treatment versus patients prescribed non-insulin-based treatment, and (3) identify which initial treatments, interventions, or patient characteristics correlated with clinically meaningful glycemic response.

Initial drug therapy.

It is generally agreed that metformin, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, is the preferred and most cost-effective first agent (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.). It is initiated at, or soon after, diagnosis, especially in patients in whom lifestyle intervention alone has not achieved, or is unlikely to achieve, HbA 1c goals. Because of frequent gastrointestinal side effects, it should be started at a low dose with gradual titration. Patients with a high baseline HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 9.0%) have a low probability of achieving a near-normal target with monotherapy. It may therefore be justified to start directly with a combination of two noninsulin agents or with insulin itself in this circumstance. If a patient presents with significant hyperglycemic symptoms and/or has dramatically elevated plasma glucose concentrations (e.g. > 16.7–19.4 mmol/L [> 300–350 mg/dL]) or HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 10.0–12.0%), insulin therapy should be strongly considered from the outset. Such treatment is mandatory when catabolic features are exhibited or, of course, if ketonuria is demonstrated, the latter reflecting profound insulin deficiency. Importantly, unless there is evidence of type 1 diabetes, once symptoms are relieved, glucotoxicity resolved, and the metabolic state stabilized, it may be possible to taper insulin partially or entirely, transferring to noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents, perhaps in combination.

Discussion

This study revealed that, although clinical guidelines recommend insulin therapy for patients with T2D presenting with severe hyperglycemia, only about two-thirds of patients in this study were initiated on an insulin-based regimen. Over one-third of patients were treated with non-insulin medications with 17.5% starting on a single non-insulin medication. Regardless of adherence to guideline recommendations, 50.8% of the total population (n = 58) achieved an A1C ≤ 9% by the end of the year. No correlation was found between any specific medication regimen and meaningful glucose response.

The current study provides useful insight into real-world use of insulin therapy in this patient population. Overall, insulin use in the responder group was lower than anticipated with only about half initiating insulin-based therapy. In addition, patients treated with insulin were actually less likely to achieve an A1C ≤ 9% and had less reduction in A1C from baseline compared to non-insulin-treated patients. Possible explanations for this lack of effect with insulin include inadequate dose titration or sub-optimal adherence. Patients prescribed insulin could be more challenging to treat or more likely to have experienced past treatment failures.

This analysis did determine that more visits with a CDE was a predictor of successful glycemic response. This finding is consistent with current clinical evidence and ADA and AACE consensus statements that emphasize diabetes self-management education as a vital component of diabetes care. Responders also had fewer days to their first follow-up A1C compared to non-responders (120.0 vs. 154.7 days). While this difference suggests that close follow-up is an important component of glycemic control, our results show that even in this high-risk population, follow-up A1C monitoring is routinely delayed past the recommended 3 months.

A new diagnosis of diabetes was a confounding variable in our analysis. Patients who were newly diagnosed were much more likely to experience success than patients with an established diagnosis of T2D. Many newly diagnosed patients experienced success despite the fact that they were more likely to start a single non-insulin medication and less likely to use insulin at any point. This finding suggests that the time of diagnosis status (i.e. new versus established diagnosis) may be a key consideration when determining treatment approaches in addition to the severity of hyperglycemia. Prospective studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of non-insulin treatment options in newly diagnosed patients with severe hyperglycemia are warranted.

### Newly diagnosed diabetes / hyperglycemia in hospitals: what should we do? [^b2e4d0b1]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the clinical problem of newly diagnosed diabetes/hyperglycemia in hospitals, and to develop a management strategy.

Methods

A review of the literature on outcomes and management of such patients.

Results

There are very few published papers on this subject, the majority being in patients with cardiovascular disease. However, there is recognition that the problem is common. No randomized clinic trials have been carried out on therapeutic strategies in such patients. The limited data available suggest that patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and hyperglycemia tend to have a poor prognosis.

Conclusion

Newly diagnosed diabetes/hyperglycemia in hospital is a common problem and is associated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, it seems appropriate that such patients be managed the same way as patients with established diabetes. Following discharge, appropriate diagnostic testing is needed to establish the presence or absence of diabetes so that long-term treatment plans can be initiated.

### Initial management of severe hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: an observational study [^0f372d4d]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 242 patients were identified who presented to a UCH outpatient clinic with an A1C ≥ 12% during the study period. After excluding patients primarily due to type 1 diabetes diagnosis or lack of follow-up A1C, a sample of 114 patients was included in the final analysis. The average age of the patient population was 53 years, 64 (47.4%) were male, and 84 (73.7%) were non-Hispanic. The average baseline A1C was 13.1%, average weight was 91.9 kg, and average duration of diabetes was 10 years. Twenty-four patients (21.1%) did not have a previous diagnosis of T2D at the time of presenting with an A1C ≥ 12%. Initial treatment strategies are shown in Table 1. Within 1 month of baseline, 43 patients (37.7%) started one or more non-insulin medications rather than initiating insulin. Of those, 20 started a single non-insulin medication, the majority of which was metformin. Seventy-one patients (62.3%) initially started an insulin-based regimen.

Table 1
Initial management strategies

Of the 114 patients, 58 (50.8%) were classified as responders (i.e. achieved an A1C ≤ 9% within 1 year) and 56 (49.1%) were classified as non-responders. Comparisons between responders and non-responders are in Table 2. Responders were slightly older (54.7 vs 50.7 years, p = 0.032) and more likely to be newly diagnosed with T2D compared to non-responders (36.2% vs 5.4%, p < 0.001). Responders were less likely to initiate therapy with insulin (51.7% vs 73.2%, p = 0.019) and more likely to be initiated on a single non-insulin medication (25.9% vs 8.9%, p = 0.014). Responders were found to have significantly more visits with a CDE (1.2 ± 1.5 vs 0.4 ± 1, p = 0.002) and more likely to have fewer days to the first follow-up A1C (120 ± 72.6 vs. 154.7 ± 97.5, p = 0.033). Significantly more patients received insulin at some point in the year in the non-responder group compared to the responder group (82.1% vs 58.6%, p = 0.006).

Tier 1: well-validated core therapies

These interventions represent the best established and most effective and cost-effective therapeutic strategy for achieving the target glycemic goals. The tier one algorithm is the preferred route of therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Step 1: lifestyle intervention and metformin.

Based on the numerous demonstrated short- and long-term benefits that accrue when weight loss and increased levels of activity are achieved and maintained, as well as the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions when they succeed, the consensus is that lifestyle interventions should be initiated as the first step in treating new-onset type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2). These interventions should be implemented by health care professionals with appropriate training — usually registered dietitians experienced in behavioral modification — and be sensitive to ethnic and cultural differences among populations. Moreover, lifestyle interventions to improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, and to promote weight loss or at least avoid weight gain, should remain an underlying theme throughout the management of type 2 diabetes, even after medications are used. For the 10–20% of patients with type 2 diabetes who are not obese or overweight, modification of dietary composition and activity levels may play a supporting role, but medications are still generally required early in the course of diabetes (seebelow).

The authors recognize that for most individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle interventions fail to achieve or maintain the metabolic goals either because of failure to lose weight, weight regain, progressive disease, or a combination of factors. Therefore, our consensus is that metformin therapy should be initiated concurrently with lifestyle intervention at diagnosis. Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy, in the absence of specific contraindications, for its effect on glycemia, absence of weight gain or hypoglycemia, generally low level of side effects, high level of acceptance, and relatively low cost. Metformin treatment should be titrated to its maximally effective dose over 1–2 months, as tolerated (see text box, entitled Titration of Metformin). Rapid addition of other glucose-lowering medications should be considered in the setting of persistent symptomatic hyperglycemia.

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^e60d4ce8]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

AACE 2023 symptomatic hyperglycemia — initial insulin indications: Basal with or without prandial insulin treatment may be needed as initial therapy if the A1C is > 10% and/or glucose values are > 300 mg/dL combined with catabolic symptoms, such as weight loss. If symptomatic hyperglycemia is present, a GLP-1 RA alone is not recommended as it requires titration and may delay glucose control. The goal of initial intensive insulin therapy for symptomatic hyperglycemia is to reduce glucose levels safely and promptly. After improved glycemic control is achieved with short-term insulin therapy, especially with a new diagnosis of DM, a role for noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents could be considered.

### Initial management of severe hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: an observational study [^6487e92c]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current guidelines recommend insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and severe hyperglycemia, but this recommendation lacks sufficient evidence and poses practical challenges. It is unclear whether non-insulin treatments are effective in this setting. The objective of this study was to describe treatment strategies of T2D patients with severe hyperglycemia and identify which initial treatments, interventions, or patient characteristics correlated with successful glucose lowering.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of 114 patients with T2D and a glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) ≥ 12%. Changes in A1C were compared between patients started on non-insulin medications versus insulin-based regimens. Regression analysis was performed to assess predictors of success in achieving A1C ≤ 9% within 1 year. The main outcomes measures were change in A1C from baseline and predictors of success in achieving A1C ≤ 9% within 1 year.

Results

At baseline, 43 patients (37.7%) started one or more non-insulin medications; 71 (62.3%) started insulin. Fifty-eight patients (50.8%) achieved an A1C ≤ 9%. Predictors of success were newly diagnosed T2D, certified diabetes educator (CDE) visits, and less time to follow-up A1C; insulin therapy was not. Change in A1C was significantly better in the non-insulin cohort compared to the insulin cohort (-4.5% vs. -2.8%, p = 0.001). Newly diagnosed patients were less likely to start insulin therapy (20.8% vs. 73.3%, p < 0.001), less likely to use insulin at any point (29.2% vs 81.1%, p < 0.001), and more likely to achieve an A1C ≤ 9% compared to patients with established T2D (87.5% vs 41.1%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Insulin therapy was used in roughly two-thirds of patients with severe hyperglycemia, but did not result in better glycemic control compared to non-insulin regimens. Rapid follow-up, more CDE visits, and a new diabetes diagnosis were predictors of successful glucose lowering. Patients with T2D and severe hyperglycemia, particularly those newly diagnosed, may be managed with non-insulin therapy.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^24fd2f2b]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 10- to 18-year-old patients makes recommendations for situations in which either insulin or metformin is the preferred first-line treatment of children and adolescents with T2DM, and the recommendations suggest integrating lifestyle modifications (ie, diet and exercise) in concert with medication rather than as an isolated initial treatment approach. Guidelines for frequency of monitoring hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and finger-stick blood glucose (BG) concentrations are presented. Providers should consult experts trained in the care of children and adolescents with T2DM when treatment goals are not met or when therapy with insulin is initiated, and at any point at which a clinician feels he or she is not adequately trained in or is uncertain about treatment, a referral to a pediatric medical subspecialist should be made; if a diagnosis of T2DM is made by a pediatric medical subspecialist, the primary care clinician should develop a comanagement strategy with the subspecialist to ensure that the child continues to receive appropriate care consistent with a medical home model.

American Academy of Pediatrics — initial pharmacologic therapy and lifestyle notes that the writing group for these guidelines continues to recommend metformin as first-line therapy in this age group but with close monitoring for glycemic deterioration and the early addition of insulin or another pharmacologic agent if needed, and that metformin is a safe and effective agent for use at the time of diagnosis in conjunction with lifestyle changes.

Algorithm

The algorithm (Fig. 2) takes into account the characteristics of the individual interventions, their synergies, and expense. The goal is to achieve and maintain A1C levels of < 7% and to change interventions at as rapid a pace as titration of medications allows when target glycemic goals are not being achieved. Mounting evidence suggests that aggressive lowering of glycemia, especially with insulin therapy, in newly diagnosed diabetes can result in sustained remissions, i.e. normoglycemia without need for glucose-lowering medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, and patients should be informed that they are likely to require the addition of glucose-lowering medications over time.

The amylin agonists, α-glucosidase inhibitors, glinides, and DPP-4 inhibitors are not included in the two tiers of preferred agents in this algorithm, owing to their lower or equivalent overall glucose-lowering effectiveness compared with the first- and second-tier agents and/or to their limited clinical data or relative expense (Table 1). However, they may be appropriate choices in selected patients.

A new diagnosis of T2D at the time of presenting with an A1C ≥ 12% was found to be a confounding variable in the regression analysis. Therefore, additional post hoc analyses were performed to evaluate results between newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed patients. There were significantly greater reductions in A1C in newly diagnosed patients compared to patients with established diabetes (−6.3% vs. −2.7%, p = 0.001, Table 5), with A1C differences emerging within 3–5 months from baseline (Fig. 1). Twenty-one out of 24 newly diagnosed patients (87.5%) were classified as responders, achieving an A1C ≤ 9%, which was significantly higher than the 41.1% of patients with established diabetes (p < 0.001). In addition, 17 (70.9%) of the newly diagnosed population achieved the ADA-recommended goal A1C of ≤ 7% as opposed to 12 (13.3%) of previously diagnosed patients. This occurred despite the fact that newly diagnosed patients were less likely to be initially treated with insulin (20.8% vs. 73.3%, p < 0.001) or receive insulin at any point throughout the year (29.2% vs. 81.1%, p < 0.001). Of note, 16 of the 24 patients (67%) started a single non-insulin medication; 14 of those achieved an A1C ≤ 9% and 10 of those achieved the ADA-recommended A1C of ≤ 7% within a year. Details regarding the other initial treatment regimens of newly diagnosed patients are shown in Table 6.

### Management of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^79cbd1be]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Incretin Mimetics and Incretin Enhancers Incretin hormones stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion, decrease glucagon secretion, slow gastric emptying, and decrease appetite. 11 Exenatide lowers blood glucose levels and stimulates weight loss, perhaps by slowing gastric emptying and producing satiety. 11, 22 Sitagliptin has no effect on body weight. 23 There are no data on the effects of these medications on cardiovascular events.
17. Amylin Analogues Pramlintide is an amylin analogue indicated for use in patients with type 1 diabetes; it is rarely used to manage type 2 diabetes. 11 When pramlintide is initiated, the insulin dosage should be reduced by 50 percent to avoid potentially severe hypoglycemia. There is insufficient evidence to make conclusions about the effects of pramlintide on cardiovascular disease.
17. 14,
24. 7, 14, 24 The goal is to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible without risking significant hypoglycemia.

The American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C goal of less than 7 percent. 7 Glycemic control requires the patient to have cognitive, visual, and motor skills to monitor and manage blood glucose levels, and identifying and minimizing barriers for effective self-management is an important first step to setting individualized goals. INITIAL MANAGEMENT The first step in managing type 2 diabetes is to normalize fasting glucose levels, with weekly or monthly adjustments in the regimen. 14 Metformin is a first-line consideration. Gastrointestinal symptoms associated with its use can be minimized by beginning with a low dose and titrating slowly. Additional agents include sulfonylureas, nonsulfonylurea secretagogues, thiazolidinediones, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Any of these agents can be combined with another.

Once fasting blood glucose approaches near-normal levels, postprandial glucose is addressed by increasing the dose of the current medications or by adding additional agents. Once maximal benefit is achieved from first-line medications, other agents, such as exenatide and sitagliptin, can be considered. INITIATING INSULIN THERAPY Less than 40 percent of patients with diabetes successfully achieve an A1C level of less than 7 percent. 24 One reason for this is the reluctance of patients and physicians to start insulin therapy, perceiving it as a treatment failure. However, progressive failure of the beta cells often occurs even with proper diet, exercise, and oral medications, so patients should be counseled that insulin is simply another management tool.

Although insulin is typically introduced when glucose control is no longer possible with oral agents, it can also be used when contraindications to oral medications exist. Newly diagnosed patients also can benefit from acute insulin use. Prolonged hyperglycemia can cause glucose toxicity, a potentially reversible impairment in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This can be corrected with aggressive insulin therapy, then oral medications can be added as insulin is tapered or discontinued. Expert opinion suggests that insulin therapy should be initiated if the fasting blood glucose level is consistently greater than 250 mg per dL, or if random testing shows levels greater than 300 mg per dL 24. When adding insulin to an oral medication regimen, oral agents should initially be continued. Long-acting insulin should be used initially, typically at a dosage of 10 units per day or 0. 17 to 0.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^086bd5c9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes in adolescents — initial pharmacologic therapy and insulin indications: Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacologic agent in adolescents presenting with mild hyperglycemia and without ketonuria or severe hyperglycemia. If the diagnosis is unclear (for example, an obese youth with ketosis), the adolescent must be treated with insulin until the T2DM diagnosis is confirmed, and the presence of either ketosis or ketoacidosis dictates an absolute initial requirement for insulin replacement. Children with more modest hyperglycemia (random blood glucose [BG] of 200–249 mg/dL) or asymptomatic T2DM present additional therapeutic choices, and in such cases, metformin alone, insulin alone, or metformin with insulin all represent reasonable options. Although metformin and insulin are the only antidiabetic agents currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children, both thiazolidinediones and incretins are occasionally used in adolescents younger than 18 years.

Step 2: addition of a second medication.

If lifestyle intervention and the maximal tolerated dose of metformin fail to achieve or sustain the glycemic goals, another medication should be added within 2–3 months of the initiation of therapy or at any time when the target A1C level is not achieved. Another medication may also be necessary if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. The consensus regarding the second medication added to metformin was to choose either insulin or a sulfonylurea (Fig. 2). As discussed above, the A1C level will determine in part which agent is selected next, with consideration given to the more effective glycemia-lowering agent, insulin, for patients with an A1C level of > 8.5% or with symptoms secondary to ehyperglycemia. Insulin can be initiated with a basal (intermediate- or long-acting) insulin (see Fig. 1 for suggested initial insulin regimens). However, many newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients will usually respond to oral medications, even if symptoms of ehyperglycemia are present.

Step 3: further adjustments.

If lifestyle, metformin, and sulfonylurea or basal insulin do not result in achievement of target glycemia, the next step should be to start, or intensify, insulin therapy (Fig. 1). Intensification of insulin therapy usually consists of additional injections that might include a short- or rapid-acting insulin given before selected meals to reduce postprandial glucose excursions (Fig. 1). When insulin injections are started, insulin secretagogues (sulfonylurea or glinides) should be discontinued, or tapered and then discontinued, since they are not considered to be synergistic. Although addition of a third oral agent can be considered, especially if the A1C level is close to target (A1C < 8.0%), this approach is usually not preferred, as it is no more effective in lowering glycemia, and is more costly, than initiating or intensifying insulin.

### Shifting the disease management paradigm from glucose: what are the cons? [^7121cc86]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Recent evidence from pathophysiology, extensive clinical experience, and a number of well-controlled prospective studies clearly prove that hyperglycemia is a key risk factor for diabetes-related complications and a driving force for deterioration of β-cell function and cardiovascular disease resulting in a significant reduction of life expectancy. Therefore, early intervention to keep the glucotriad and A1C in a near-normal range should remain a high priority to protect our patients, together with integrated treatment of comorbidities, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypercoagulation. Shifting to a better form of individualized disease management does not imply that diabetologists should not maintain confidence in their well-established treatment strategies based on sound evidence and good clinical practice.

Discussion

According to the latest Consensus Statement by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology in 2020 and the American Diabetes Association guidelines in 2020, the optimal diabetes control target would be an HbA1c level of ≤ 6.5%, given if it can be achieved in a safe and affordable manner. It was believed that HbA1c level of ≤ 6.5% can reduce the lifetime risk of micro- and macrovascular complications in adults with recent T2DM onset and no clinically significant atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). If a HbA1c target of ≤ 6.5% cannot be achieved, a level of 7% would be considered appropriate for most nonpregnant adults. The HbA1c target should be individualized and be less stringent according to numerous factors, such as advanced age, limited life expectancy, comorbidities (especially ASCVD), longer duration of diabetes and higher risk of hypoglycemia.

A stepwise approach should be implemented based on the level of hyperglycemia according to the current guideline. For patients with newly diagnosed T2DM or mild hyperglycemia (HbA1c < 7.5%), lifestyle modification and antihyperglycemic monotherapy (preferably with metformin) are recommended. Patients with an HbA1c > 7.5% should be started initially on metformin plus another antihyperglycemic agent apart from lifestyle modification. Symptomatic patients with A1C > 9.0% would likely require insulin therapy for maximized relief and control.

The studies included in our review are consistent with the current guidelines on diabetes management that intensive therapy should be implemented to achieve an optimal HbA1c of 6.5%. The findings in DCCT strongly support the implementation of early intensive therapy for an extended period. It was expected that a prolonged period of nearly normoglycemia can minimize the risk of complications in patients with T1DM. Risk reduction in the development of severe diabetic retinopathy, including severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, neovascularization, clinically significant macular edema and loss of vision, was observed in the intensively treated group. DCCT also advised ophthalmologists to closely monitor intensively treated patients' retinopathy status for early worsening during the first year of treatment, especially those initially present with proliferative or severe non-proliferative retinopathy. Despite having an increased risk of early worsening with intensive therapy, many of these patients can recover from it. It is also important to note that apart from insulin used in DCCT, some other antihyperglycemic agents, such as semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist), may cause early worsening of diabetic retinopathy if used to reduce HbA1c intensively.

### Clinical considerations for use of initial combination therapy in type 2 diabetes [^dc073238]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disorder characterized by increasing hyperglycemia and the need to gradually intensify therapy in order to achieve and maintain glycemic control. Early initiation of combination therapy has been proposed as an approach to achieve glycemic goals earlier and delay the deterioration of glycemic control and with possible better preservation of β-cell function. We discuss in this article the pros and cons of this approach, focusing on individuals with HbA1c at diagnosis of 7.5–9.0%, where difference of opinion still exists on management. Initial combination therapy is proposed to lead to better and faster achievement of glycemic targets versus monotherapy and to impede clinical inertia and may possibly slow the deterioration of β-cell function. However, treating patients with sequential therapy is proposed to allow one to fully assess the efficacy and risk-to-benefit ratio of each drug as it is added. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support that rapid addition and titration of medications according to the glycemic profile achieved are inferior to initial combination therapy if glycemic targets are attained in a timely manner. Initial combination therapy is argued to postpone clinical inertia to the next decision point but does not eliminate it. Additionally, it may have been the agents chosen and not the timing of their initiation that led to improved β-cell function in the studies of initial combination therapy, and there are no data currently comparing use of the same drugs initiated simultaneously or sequentially. Heightened awareness of providers, individualization of therapy and setting, and reaching glycemic targets remain the mainstays of care.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes is epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. Although new classes of medications and numerous combinations have been demonstrated to lower glycemia, current-day management has failed to achieve and maintain the glycemic levels most likely to provide optimal healthcare status for people with diabetes.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^e45d1b7b]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

Antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy for persons with type 2 diabetes — treatment escalation thresholds specify that for some recently diagnosed individuals with T2D and more severe hyperglycemia (A1C ≥ 7.5%), early combination pharmacotherapy should be considered, usually to include metformin plus another agent that does not cause hypoglycemia; for newly diagnosed persons with T2D and an entry A1C > 9.0% and/or ≥ 1.5% above target, clinicians should initiate dual- or possibly triple-combination pharmacotherapy usually including metformin, and basal insulin along with noninsulin therapy is recommended if there are significant signs or symptoms of hyperglycemia, especially including catabolism or a very high A1C > 10% (86 mmol/mol) or BG levels ≥ 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L); persons with T2D initially treated with monotherapy who do not achieve or maintain glycemic targets should progress to dual-combination therapy and then triple-combination therapy, if needed, and use a basal insulin to adequately obtain and maintain control.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Diabetes: how are we diagnosing and initially managing it? [^7d3d6bcb]. Annals of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We undertook this study to examine the symptoms, clinical events, and types of health care encounters that preceded the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in adults, and to examine changes in glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors in the first year after a diabetes diagnosis.

Methods

We conducted a historical cohort study of patients in a large multispecialty medical group in Minnesota. Among 55,121 adults who were continuously enrolled in the health plan and receiving care at the study medical group from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 1996, we identified 504 who received a new diagnosis of diabetes in 1995 or 1996. Our main outcome measures were the type of symptoms at diagnosis; the clinical circumstances and type of encounter that led to diabetes diagnosis; and changes in glycemic control (assessed by hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] value), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, blood pressure (BP), aspirin use, and body weight in the first year after diagnosis, ascertained from a detailed review of medical records.

Results

Almost one third (32.3%) of adults with newly diagnosed diabetes had symptoms of hyperglycemia at initial diagnosis. Compared with patients who did not have hyperglycemia symptoms at diagnosis, those who did were younger and more often male, and had lower comorbidity scores and higher HbA1c values (9.9% vs 8.1%) at diagnosis (P < .01 for each comparison). In the 12 months after diagnosis, the group as a whole had significant improvements (P < .001) in HbA1c values (from 8.8% to 7.1%), systolic blood pressure (137.5 to 133.2 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (80.7 to 77.3 mm Hg), weight (207.7 to 201.1 lb), and aspirin use (15.3% to 26.1%). Improvements were seen in all patient subgroups, including those defined by symptoms at diagnosis and by visit type at diagnosis.

Conclusions

Primary care practices may improve detection of undiagnosed diabetes in primary care and improve 1-year outcomes by being vigilant for symptoms of diabetes, by evaluating those at high risk for this disorder, and by instituting appropriate treatments at the time of diagnosis.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of insulin plus oral medications versus oral anti-diabetes therapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with very high HbA1c and acute coronary syndrome [^b5aa6896]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the leading chronic diseases in the world, affecting around 422 million people worldwide and being directly responsible for up to 1.5 million deaths per year. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the most common cause of morbidity and reduced life expectancy in patients with T2DM, affecting 32.2% of patients. The relative risk of myocardial infarction (MI) is 50% higher in men with diabetes and 150% higher in women with diabetes. Furthermore, there is an increased risk of recurrence of MI (40%) in patients with T2DM.

A significant number of patients remain undiagnosed with T2DM and are diagnosed only at the time of hospital encounter for some other indication. Ding et al. reported the prevalence of newly diagnosed DM to be 14.3% in patients diagnosed with acute MI. Another study by Umar et al. noted that 29.6% of patients admitted with acute MI were newly diagnosed with DM. Management of T2DM involves a stepwise approach, starting with initiating oral antihyperglycemic drugs, especially metformin, as the first‐line option. Adding insulin therapy is considered as an augmentation therapy if glycaemic targets are not met. However, in certain situations, the addition of insulin as a first‐line antihyperglycemic treatment should be considered. In the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) comprehensive T2DM 2017 management algorithm, insulin is recommended for T2DM patients presenting with symptoms of hyperglycaemia and an HbA1c > 9.0%. A position statement by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) also recommended the use of short‐term intensive insulin (STII) for the initial management of individuals with newly diagnosed T2DM if blood glucose is more than 300 mg/dL and/or HbA1c is more than 10%–12%, especially if the patient has symptoms of hyperglycaemia (polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia) or catabolic state (weight loss or ketosis). The use of STII in these patients has been associated with the early achievement of glycaemic control and improvement of pancreatic beta‐cell function. It has been reported that up to 23% of patients have an HbA1c of more than 9% at the time of initial diagnosis. Nevertheless, the treatment options should also consider important patient‐related factors such as the level of education, patient willingness to use insulin, ease of use, and affordability to ensure patient compliance. A significant number of patients are reluctant to use insulin. A study from Iran reported that up to 60.2% of the patients were reluctant to use insulin for DM management. The most common reasons include financial constraints, fear of needles/pain and fear of dependency on insulin use.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to insulin therapy, indications, DC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate insulin, with or without metformin, as the initial pharmacologic therapy in patients with metabolic decompensation (such as marked hyperglycemia, ketosis, hyperosmolar state, or unintentional weight loss related to hyperglycemia) and/or severe symptomatic hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, visual blurring). Consider tapering or discontinuing insulin and replacing it with other agents once metabolic stability is achieved.

### Emergency department management of uncomplicated hyperglycemia in patients without history of diabetes [^507df339]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemia is a common finding in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Recommendations addressing uncomplicated hyperglycemia in the ED are limited, and the management of those without a prior diagnosis of diabetes presents a challenge.

Objective

This narrative review will discuss the ED evaluation and management of hyperglycemic adult patients without a history of diabetes who do not have evidence of a hyperglycemic crisis, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

Discussion

Many adults who present to the ED have risk factors for diabetes and meet American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for diabetes screening. A new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes can be established in the ED by the ADA criteria in patients with a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) and symptoms of hyperglycemia. The diagnosis should be considered in patients with an elevation in random blood glucose > 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). Treatment may begin in the ED and varies depending on the presenting severity of hyperglycemia. Treatment options include metformin, long-acting insulin, or deferring for close outpatient management.

Conclusions

Emergency clinician knowledge of the evaluation and management of new-onset hyperglycemia and diabetes is important to prevent long-term complications.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^6b3ade39]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Process

The guidelines and algorithm that follow are derived from two sources. One source is the clinical trials that address the effectiveness and safety of the different modalities of therapy. Here, the writing group reviewed a wide variety of studies related to the use of drugs as monotherapy or in combination to lower glycemia. Unfortunately, the paucity of high-quality evidence in the form of well-controlled clinical trials that directly compare different diabetes treatment regimens remains a major impediment to recommending one class of drugs, or a particular combination of therapies, over another.

The second source of material that informed our recommendations was clinical judgement, that is, our collective knowledge and clinical experience, which takes into account benefits, risks, and costs in the treatment of diabetes. As in all clinical decision making, an evidence-based review of the literature must also be supplemented by value judgements, where the benefits of treatment are weighed against risks and costs in a subjective fashion. While we realize that others may have different judgements, we believe that the recommendations made in this new iteration of our treatment algorithm will guide therapy and result in improved glycemic control and health status over time.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^45952f73]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The epidemic of type 2 diabetes and the recognition that achieving specific glycemic goals can substantially reduce morbidity have made the effective treatment of hyperglycemia a top priority. While the management of hyperglycemia, the hallmark metabolic abnormality associated with type 2 diabetes, has historically taken center stage in the treatment of diabetes, therapies directed at other coincident features, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, hypercoagulability, obesity, and insulin resistance, have also been a major focus of research and therapy. Maintaining glycemic levels as close to the nondiabetic range as possible has been demonstrated to have a powerful beneficial effect on diabetes-specific microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, in the setting of type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, more intensive treatment strategies have likewise been demonstrated to reduce microvascular complications. Intensive glycemic management resulting in lower A1C levels has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications in type 1 diabetes; however, current studies have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of intensive diabetes therapy on CVD in type 2 diabetes.

The development of new classes of blood glucose–lowering medications to supplement the older therapies, such as lifestyle-directed interventions, insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin, has increased the number of treatment options available for type 2 diabetes. Whether used alone or in combination with other blood glucose–lowering interventions, the increased number of choices available to practitioners and patients has heightened uncertainty regarding the most appropriate means of treating this widespread disease. Although numerous reviews on the management of type 2 diabetes have been published in recent years, practitioners are often left without a clear pathway of therapy to follow. We developed the following consensus approach to the management of hyperglycemia in the nonpregnant adult to help guide health care providers in choosing the most appropriate interventions for their patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Guideline approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^331b5da4]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Most leading guidelines suggest adding one of several antihyperglycemic drugs when lifestyle and metformin fail to keep A1C at target unrelated to these questions. The previous American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus statement suggested a preferable order of drugs, while the AACE/ACE Diabetes Algorithm for Glycemic Control suggested starting treatment with combination therapy in naïve patients with A1C > 7.6%. The Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines suggested adding one of several second drugs after metformin in patients with A1C > 7%. Similarly, the recently published ADA/EASD position statement suggested leaving the decision of which drug to add to the treating physician. The above-mentioned guidelines are mainly based on drug efficacy and safety and do not necessarily address the various pathophysiology defects leading to hyperglycemia and increased risk for CVD in these patients. The case for initiating combination therapy that addresses the different pathophysiological faults in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients in order to preserve near-normal glycemic durability is presented in this issue by DeFronzo, Eldor, and Abdul-Ghani. I will present the case for guidelines while referring and critiquing the approach of DeFronzo, Eldor, and Abdul-Ghani and suggest another option for a middle-of-the-road treatment method.

### Personalized management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^f9cd4299]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The upcoming GRADE (Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study) trial will address some of these points. In addition, studies on how best to combine the various agents, as well as the optimal timing (early combination therapy vs. the traditional step-wise approach), are urgently needed.

Furthermore, even the most carefully considered set of guidelines is based on averages — average A1C-lowering effect, average efficacy, average risk of adverse effects — without adequate consideration of the confidence intervals around those averages. Averages fail to identify subpopulations that respond better and have better tolerance to specific agents, and without these data, evidence-based personalized advice cannot be provided. For now, all HCPs, whether in specialty or primary care settings, should test the efficacy and weigh the safety risks of any given drug in each patient, ideally trying options over a period of months to see how well they work at the individual level.

Children and adolescents — initial pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes: In individuals with incidentally diagnosed or metabolically stable diabetes (A1C < 8.5% [< 69 mmol/mol] and asymptomatic), metformin is the initial pharmacologic treatment of choice if kidney function is normal (A). Youth with marked hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL [≥ 13.9 mmol/L] A1C ≥ 8.5% [≥ 69 mmol/mol]) without acidosis at diagnosis who are symptomatic with polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and/or weight loss should be treated initially with long-acting insulin while metformin is initiated and titrated (B). Initiate subcutaneous or intravenous insulin treatment in individuals with ketoacidosis to rapidly correct the hyperglycemia and the metabolic derangement, and once acidosis is resolved, metformin should be initiated while subcutaneous insulin therapy is continued (A). In individuals presenting with severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL [≥ 33.3 mmol/L]), consider assessment for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (A).

Medications

The characteristics of currently available glucose-lowering interventions, when used as monotherapy, are summarized in Table 1. The glucose-lowering effectiveness of individual therapies and combinations demonstrated in clinical trials is predicated not only on the intrinsic characteristics of the intervention but also on the duration of diabetes, baseline glycemia, previous therapy, and other factors. A major factor in selecting a class of drugs, or a specific medication within a class, to initiate therapy or when changing therapy, is the ambient level of glycemic control. When levels of glycemia are high (e.g. A1C > 8.5%), classes with greater and more rapid glucose-lowering effectiveness, or potentially earlier initiation of combination therapy, are recommended; however, patients with recent-onset diabetes often respond adequately to less intensive interventions than those with longer-term disease. When glycemic levels are closer to the target levels (e.g. A1C < 7.5%), medications with lesser potential to lower glycemia and/or a slower onset of action may be considered.

Obviously, the choice of glycemic goals and the medications used to achieve them must be individualized for each patient, balancing the potential for lowering A1C and anticipated long-term benefit with specific safety issues, as well as other characteristics of regimens, including side effects, tolerability, ease of use, long-term adherence, expense, and the nonglycemic effects of the medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by worsening glycemia; higher doses and additional medications are required over time if treatment goals are to be met.

### Intense simplified strategy for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in patients with severe hyperglycaemia: multicentre, open label, randomised trial [^233c8bc9]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

As estimated by the International Diabetes Federation, the global prevalence of diabetes has reached 537 million. Exposure to hyperglycaemia, even in the first year after diagnosis, is a primary risk factor for chronic complications of diabetes and even death. These effects can persist for decades and are known as the legacy effect. As discovered recently by the 24 year follow-up of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, early intensive glycaemic control provides a near lifelong reduction in the risk of death and of microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, despite various glucose lowering treatments, more than half of the patients had inadequate glycaemic control, indicating that traditional treatment strategies that escalate treatment intensity in a stepwise manner to overcome deteriorating hyperglycaemia are unable to delay β cell failure and progression of diabetes.

Significant hyperglycaemia is common in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Owing to the limited efficacy of monotherapy, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend that combination therapy should be used when the glycated haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) levels exceed treatment targets by 1.5% (≥ 8.5% for most patients), with insulin therapy needed if HbA 1c exceeds 10% (evidence level E; expert consensus or clinical experience). Nevertheless, standardised treatment pathways for these patients remain unclear.

Emerging evidence has shown that the progression of type 2 diabetes is not irreversible, especially in the early stages. Short term intensive insulin therapy (SIIT) has shown immediate and substantial benefits in early type 2 diabetes. Two to three weeks of SIIT significantly improves β cell function and insulin sensitivity by eliminating glucotoxicity, inducing remission of diabetes for longer than a year in more than 50% of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. In most studies of SIIT, benefits were observed in patients with significant hyperglycaemia (mean HbA 1c ≥ 10%) and mild overweight (mean body mass index approximately 25). Nevertheless, the remission rate declined over time, from 70% immediately after SIIT to roughly 50% at the end of the first year and around 40% at the end of the second year. This provides a rationale for investigating whether simplified oral regimens subsequent to SIIT could help to maintain the good glycaemic control induced by SIIT by persistently avoiding the detrimental effects of glucotoxicity and circumventing the disadvantages of intricate glucose lowering regimens.

New onset diabetes triage — type 2 diabetes pathway and initial therapy specify that after the BMI check "BMI > 95%ile?", patients on this branch are to "Treat as T2D unless suspicion for T1D high" with listed type 1 diabetes risk factors ("Autoimmunity history", "Lack of FHx of T2D or gestational diabetes", and "Presence of ketones or DKA"), and "If ≥ 2 of these T1D risk factors are present, treat with insulin". Initial treatment is then determined by "HbA1c ≥ 8.5% or ketosis present": if present, start "• Start LA insulin 0.5 units/kg
- Start metformin titration"; if not present, start "Start metformin titration to 2000 mg daily".

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^f4fce45f]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The key messages from dozens of comparative insulin trials in type 2 diabetes include the following:
1 Any insulin will lower glucose and HbA 1c.
2 All insulins are associated with some weight gain and some risk of hypoglycemia.
3 The larger the doses and the more aggressive the titration, the lower the HbA 1c, but often with a greater likelihood of adverse effects.
4 Generally, long-acting insulin analogs reduce the incidence of overnight hypoglycemia, and rapid-acting insulin analogs reduce postprandial glucose excursions as compared with corresponding human insulins (NPH, Regular), but they generally do not result in clinically significantly lower HbA 1c.

Metformin is often continued when basal insulin is added, with studies demonstrating less weight gain when the two are used together. Insulin secretagogues do not seem to provide for additional HbA 1c reduction or prevention of hypoglycemia or weight gain after insulin is started, especially after the dose is titrated and stabilized. When basal insulin is used, continuing the secretagogue may minimize initial deterioration of glycemic control. However, secretagogues should be avoided once prandial insulin regimens are employed. TZDs should be reduced in dose (or stopped) to avoid edema and excessive weight gain, although in certain individuals with large insulin requirements from severe insulin resistance, these insulin sensitizers may be very helpful in lowering HbA 1c and minimizing the required insulin dose. Data concerning the glycemic benefits of incretin-based therapy combined with basal insulin are accumulating; combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists may be helpful in some patients. Once again, the costs of these more elaborate combined regimens must be carefully considered.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^98766ad9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis management and short-term insulin use — Of adolescents in whom T2DM is subsequently diagnosed, 5% to 25% present with ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis must be treated with insulin and fluid and electrolyte replacement, and patients in whom ketoacidosis is diagnosed require immediate treatment with insulin and fluid replacement in an inpatient setting under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in treating this complication. Youth and adolescents with T2DM and poor glycemic control (BG concentrations ≥ 250 mg/dl or HbA1c > 9%) but lacking evidence of ketosis or ketoacidosis may also benefit from initial treatment with insulin, at least on a short-term basis, and many patients with T2DM can be weaned gradually from insulin therapy and subsequently managed with metformin and lifestyle modification. When diabetes type is uncertain, these patients are best managed initially with insulin therapy while appropriate tests are performed to differentiate between T1DM and T2DM, and the care of such patients should be supervised by a physician experienced in treating diabetic patients with insulin.

### Physician reasons for nonpharmacologic treatment of hyperglycemia in older patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^8242df30]. Diabetes Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. The survey was developed and approved by experts, but no external validation was performed. To limit selection bias, physicians were instructed to select a patient on the basis of a randomly assigned last name initial and to provide information on the first patient with this initial who met entry criteria. However, because of the online nature of the survey, it could not be verified whether the physicians adhered to this specific protocol for patient selection. All reported laboratory measures closest to diagnosis were included in the analysis, regardless of the timing of the measurement. The question regarding the physician's intent to treat a patient within the next month may have produced responses biased in favor of treatment. The results pertain to a sample of US primary care physicians and may not be generalizable to all primary care physicians or to endocrinologists and other diabetes specialists. Although nearly one-third of invited physicians accessed the survey invitation link, the final response rate could affect the generalizability of the results. Lastly, participating physicians may have been more confident in their management of T2DM in older patients than nonparticipating physicians. Thus, the present findings may underestimate the issue of non-treatment in the general population.

In conclusion, in this survey study of physicians, two-thirds of patients had appropriate glycemic control (i.e. HbA 1c < 7.0%) and selection of reasons for non-treatment with antihyperglycemic agents related to this appears to be an appropriate clinical decision for many of these patients. The data from the present study also indicate that, in the group of physicians surveyed, there is substantial inertia related to the initiation of pharmacological therapy in older patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. Physician-reported reasons for non-treatment suggest that there are substantial barriers to drug use in clinical practice, including physicians' perceptions of "mild" hyperglycemia and the HbA 1c threshold for the use of antihyperglycemic agents. One-third of the patients had an HbA 1c above goal (with HbA 1c 7.0–7.4% in 21.0% of patients and HbA 1c ≥ 7.5% in 12.0%), and many of these patients already had cardiovascular or microvascular complications and risk factors. The timing of initiation of drug therapy for T2DM in the older population is an issue requiring further clarification. The present study suggests the need for more explicit guidelines for physicians who treat such patients.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. While lifestyle interventions such as medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed physical activity remain cornerstones of disease prevention and treatment, most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require pharmacotherapy for glycemic control. Fortunately, many of these patients are able to achieve desired glycemic targets with the use of currently available antihyperglycemic agents. Both not-for-profit disease-specific organizations and healthcare specialty societies have provided guidance about the appropriate selection of these therapies. Type 2 diabetes treatment guidelines and algorithms have been developed, taking into account a combination of evidence-based information and expert opinions, with various groups offering diverse glucose goals and approaches to hyperglycemia management. Virtually all recognize that type 2 diabetes is a multifaceted disease, necessitating an integrated yet individualized approach to patient care.

### Personalized management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^bc857304]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In June 2012, 13 thought leaders convened in a Diabetes Care Editors' Expert Forum to discuss the concept of personalized medicine in the wake of a recently published American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes position statement calling for a patient-centered approach to hyperglycemia management in type 2 diabetes. This article, an outgrowth of that forum, offers a clinical translation of the underlying issues that need to be considered for effectively personalizing diabetes care. The medical management of type 2 diabetes has become increasingly complex, and its complications remain a great burden to individual patients and the larger society. The burgeoning armamentarium of pharmacological agents for hyperglycemia management should aid clinicians in providing early treatment to delay or prevent these complications. However, trial evidence is limited for the optimal use of these agents, especially in dual or triple combinations. In the distant future, genotyping and testing for metabolomic markers may help us to better phenotype patients and predict their responses to antihyperglycemic drugs. For now, a personalized ("n of 1") approach in which drugs are tested in a trial-and-error manner in each patient may be the most practical strategy for achieving therapeutic targets. Patient-centered care and standardized algorithmic management are conflicting approaches, but they can be made more compatible by recognizing instances in which personalized A1C targets are warranted and clinical circumstances that may call for comanagement by primary care and specialty clinicians.

### Insulin-based versus triple oral therapy for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: which is better? [^49456d4c]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Given the progressive decline in β-cell function seen in type 2 diabetes, a treatment option that has the potential to preserve β-cell function is optimal. There is mounting evidence that early treatment with insulin may preserve β-cell function in these patients. In light of these findings, in addition to the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability shown in our study, we propose that an insulin-metformin regimen be considered as an initial treatment option in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. We continue to follow our volunteers to assess their long-term changes in β-cell function, results that we expect within the next 2 years.

Commonly cited reasons for avoiding insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes include fear of hypoglycemia, weight gain, and a lack of patient acceptance. Our study demonstrated that treatment with insulin and metformin can be used to obtain tight glycemic control in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes without side effects in excess of those seen with traditional triple oral hypoglycemic therapy. This study provides increasing evidence to persuade physicians that insulin is a viable medical option for patients with type 2 diabetes and should not be viewed as a treatment of last resort.

### Glycemic and non-glycemic benefits of initial triple therapy versus sequential add-on therapy in patients with new-onset diabetes: results from the EDICT study [^f76aa6ce]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Because of the pivotal role of hyperglycemia in the development of diabetic microvascular (eye, kidney, nerve) complications, reducing the plasma glucose concentration has become the focus of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment in order to reduce the risk of these devastating complications. However, reducing the Glycated hemoglubin (HbA1c) has, at best, modest benefit on decreasing other T2DM complications, for example, myocardial infarction, stroke, and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), which are major causes of mortality and morbidity in patients with T2DM.

Cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcome trialshave demonstrated that some, but not all, glucose-lowering agents, for example, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RA, and pioglitazone, reduce the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, CV death (MACE) and liver fat content in patients with T2DM. Further, the reduction in MACE by these agents was evident only in patients with T2DM with established CV disease (CVD), that is, secondary prevention. Although these findings signal a new era in the management of patients with T2DM, approximately 70%–80% of T2DM individuals, especially newly diagnosed patients with T2DM, have no clinical evidence of CVD or renal disease. Because these CV and renal outcome trials are less directly applicable to this large group of patients with T2DM who are free of CV and renal complications, the recent American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendation for glycemic management in newly diagnosed patients with T2DM without established CVD or renal disease is to (1) initiate metformin followed by sequential addition of other glucose-lowering agents to maintain the HbA1c at the treatment goal (eg, HbA1c < 7.0%) or (2) combination therapy that provides adequate efficacy to achieve and maintain treatment goals. The aim of the present study was to examine the non-glycemic benefits of each approach in newly diagnosed newly diagnosed patients with T2DM achieving optimal glycemic control. To achieve this goal, we compared the effect of initiating metformin followed by sequentially adding sulfonylurea and insulin vs initiating metformin plus pioglitazone plus exenatide on liver fat content and carotid intima–media thickness (cIMT) in participants of the Efficacy and Durability of Initial Combination Therapy for Type 2 Diabetes (EDICT) studywho maintained optimal glycemic control, that is, HbA1c < 6.5% through the entire study duration (6 years). MASLD (liver fat and fibrosis) and vascular disease (cIMT thickening) represent major end-organ complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Lifestyle.

Interventions designed to impact an individual's physical activity levels and food intake are critical parts of type 2 diabetes management. All patients should receive standardized general diabetes education (individual or group, preferably using an approved curriculum), with a specific focus on dietary interventions and the importance of increasing physical activity. While encouraging therapeutic lifestyle change is important at diagnosis, periodic counseling should also be integrated into the treatment program.

Weight reduction, achieved through dietary means alone or with adjunctive medical or surgical intervention, improves glycemic control and other cardiovascular risk factors. Modest weight loss (5–10%) contributes meaningfully to achieving improved glucose control. Accordingly, establishing a goal of weight reduction, or at least weight maintenance, is recommended.

Dietary advice must be personalized. Patients should be encouraged to eat healthy foods that are consistent with the prevailing population-wide dietary recommendations and with an individual's preferences and culture. Foods high in fiber (such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes), low-fat dairy products, and fresh fish should be emphasized. High-energy foods, including those rich in saturated fats, and sweet desserts and snacks should be eaten less frequently and in lower amounts. Patients who eventually lose and keep weight off usually do so after numerous cycles of weight loss and relapse. The health care team should remain nonjudgmental but persistent, revisiting and encouraging therapeutic lifestyle changes frequently, if needed.

As much physical activity as possible should be promoted, ideally aiming for at least 150 min/week of moderate activity including aerobic, resistance, and flexibility training. In older individuals, or those with mobility challenges, so long as tolerated from a cardiovascular standpoint, any increase in activity level is advantageous.

At diagnosis, highly motivated patients with HbA 1c already near target (e.g. < 7.5%) could be given the opportunity to engage in lifestyle change for a period of 3–6 months before embarking on pharmacotherapy (usually metformin). Those with moderate hyperglycemia or in whom lifestyle changes are anticipated to be unsuccessful should be promptly started on an antihyperglycemic agent (also usually metformin) at diagnosis, which can later be modified or possibly discontinued if lifestyle changes are successful.

Type 2 diabetes with ASCVD/high-risk — A1C targets and treatment thresholds: A target A1C of < 6.5% in most nonpregnant adults can be used if safely achieved, whereas less stringent A1C goals (> 7%) should be adopted in specified situations. If further lowering is needed and renal function is eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², metformin should be considered. If the initial A1C is ≥ 7.5%, early combination therapy with 2 agents may be needed, and with initial A1C > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, 2 or 3 antihyperglycemic agents should be initiated concomitantly. If there is symptomatic hyperglycemia, an A1C > 10% and/or BG > 300 mg/dL, basal insulin should be initiated; in this scenario, a combination basal insulin with a GLP-1 RA can also be considered.

### Designing and implementing an outpatient management pathway for patients with newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [^02df65e2]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is one of the most common chronic illnesses in childhood. At the time of diagnosis, a significant amount of education is needed to equip children and their parents with the knowledge and skills necessary for managing diabetes. Historically paediatric patients with newly diagnosed T1DM have been hospitalized to receive this education, and prior to discharge, the family was required to demonstrate the ability to check blood sugars, give insulin and know what to do in the case of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia.

In our setting, the floor nurse assigned to the child with newly diagnosed diabetes typically provided this critical education at the bedside. We observed that education content and format were not always consistent from nurse to nurse and often required re‐education at the follow‐up outpatient visits. In addition, we noted significant family and patient emotional and psychological stress associated with the hospitalization process itself. As a result, we evaluated our approach to teaching diabetes management skills in the inpatient setting and determined that we needed to make improvements to enhance the quality of our programme.

Reports in the literature from institutions that transitioned their paediatric T1DM management education programme to the outpatient setting identified that outpatient education programmes are as effective as inpatient education programmes at preventing short‐term diabetes‐related problems, as well as promoting knowledge, family functioning and quality of life for children and their families. 1 In addition, these institutions found no differences in long‐term glycemic control and studies suggest that the outpatient model may empower patient autonomy and lead to faster transition to insulin pump therapy for diabetes management. 2, 3

Given the literature support for the overall safety of an outpatient education model for patients with newly diagnosed T1DM, and our desire to reduce variation and avoid unnecessary hospitalization and psychological stress, we implemented an improvement initiative on November 1, 2016. Our target population was comprised of patients with newly diagnosed T1DM ages 3 and older who presented without diabetic ketoacidosis or nausea/vomiting. Eligible patients had no communication barriers that would impede outpatient education, no behavioural issues that would make outpatient diabetes education difficult and no transportation issues that would preclude a family from making it to their scheduled appointment.

### Physician reasons for nonpharmacologic treatment of hyperglycemia in older patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^dc385e22]. Diabetes Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The number of people aged ≥ 65 years is increasing, and currently represents approximately 13.0% of the US population. At the same time, the incidence and prevalence of diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among adults aged ≥ 65 years have increased to values of 2.7% annually and 24.8%, respectively. Persons aged ≥ 65 years diagnosed with T2DM in the US have morbidity and mortality rates far in excess of their counterparts without diabetes, including microvascular complications and cardiovascular disease. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Studies, treatment with antihyperglycemic therapies reduced the risk of microvascular and, in the metformin arm, macrovascular disease endpoints among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. Importantly, this early treatment led to sustained benefits related to the development and progression of microvascular disease as well as to emergent risk reduction in macrovascular disease and all-cause mortality. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend initiating treatment with metformin, in combination with lifestyle changes, immediately after the diabetes diagnosis, with a target hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) value of < 7.0% for adults. The American Geriatrics Society also recommends a target HbA 1c of ≤ 7.0% for relatively healthy, older adults. However, specific glycemic targets may need to be re-evaluated for higher-risk patients with T2DM in light of the increased mortality observed in patients aggressively treated with antihyperglycemic agents to achieve intensive glucose lowering glycemic targets.

However, many patients aged ≥ 65 years are not prescribed antihyperglycemic agents after diagnosis of T2DM. In a US employer-based health insurance data set, 44.0% of individuals aged ≥ 65 years received no antihyperglycemic therapy in the 12-month period following T2DM diagnosis. Similarly, in a retrospective US cohort study, older patients (age ≥ 65 years) with newly diagnosed T2DM were less likely to have oral antihyperglycemic therapy initiated following diagnosis than younger patients. Among patients who showed disease progression in a 1-year follow-up period (defined as a HbA 1c increase from < 7.0 to ≥ 7.0%), the likelihood of initiating antihyperglycemic therapy decreased by 40.0% with every decade increase in age.

### Management of patients with newly diagnosed diabetic mellitus: ophthalmologic outcomes in intensive versus conventional glycemic control [^dc000467]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Diabetic retinopathy, a microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus, is one of the most important causes of visual loss in developed countries. Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of intensive versus conventional glycemic control of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in terms of ophthalmologic outcome, pathogenesis of the early worsening of diabetic retinopathy, risk factors for early worsening and diabetic retinopathy progression.

Methods

A literature search on publications concerning glycaemic control in diabetic retinopathy and management of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus by intensive versus conventional glycaemic control.

Results

A total of 22 articles were reviewed after curation by the authors for relevance. Nineteen articles are randomized control trial, 2 articles are observational studies and 1 is clinical trial. Fifteen articles investigated the glycaemic control in T1DM-related diabetic retinopathy and 8 on T2DM-related diabetic retinopathy. The level of glycemia (in terms of HbA1c level) is significantly related to the diabetic retinopathy progression in both T1DM and T2DM. Intensive glycemic control was found to reduce the development of severe diabetic retinopathy, including severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, neovascularization, clinically significant macular edema and loss of vision. Early worsening of diabetic retinopathy commonly occurs during the first year of intensive treatment, especially those initially present with proliferative or severe non-proliferative retinopathy. However, most patients with early worsening can recover and their long-term ophthalmologic outcomes are better when compared to conventional glycemic control.

Conclusion

The current guideline on HbA1c level is considered sufficient for the minimization of diabetic retinopathy progression. More frequent monitoring for early worsening should be recommended for newly diagnosed diabetes cases already presenting with retinopathy.

Module A: T2DM management — The algorithm begins with a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and first asks whether there is an urgent or emergent care need (e.g., symptomatic hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, concurrent medical issue); if yes, treat and/or refer for acute care, and if no, assess barriers to success (e.g., psychosocial needs, navigating health care, health literacy/numeracy, patient/provider inertia, social determinants of health [e.g., transportation, economic or food insecurity]). The next step is to develop an individualized treatment plan reviewing non‑pharmacologic therapies (Medical Nutrition Therapy including weight management; Diabetes Self‑Management Education and Support; exercise), and if pharmacologic therapy is indicated, begin metformin unless contraindicated. The algorithm then evaluates whether the patient has any of the following: established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or high ASCVD risk, diabetic neuropathy, or heart failure; if yes, consider GLP‑1 RA or SGLT‑2 inhibitor if indicated, and if no, assess whether the glycemic target has been achieved (A1C 7.0–8.5% for most patients or alternative range based on individualization). If the target has not been achieved, consider additional medications until the target A1C range is achieved and select the agent based on efficacy and risk‑benefit ration; if the target has been achieved, review the treatment plan to minimize or treat complications and/or comorbidities.

The consensus algorithm for the medical management of type 2 diabetes was published in August 2006 with the expectation that it would be updated, based on the availability of new interventions and new evidence to establish their clinical role. The authors continue to endorse the principles used to develop the algorithm and its major features. We are sensitive to the risks of changing the algorithm cavalierly or too frequently, without compelling new information. An update to the consensus algorithm published in January 2008 specifically addressed safety issues surrounding the thiazolidinediones. In this revision, we focus on the new classes of medications that now have more clinical data and experience.

Regarding medical management for in-hospital hyperglycemia, more specifically with respect to insulin therapy, ES 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering initial therapy with correctional insulin or scheduled insulin therapy to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) in adult patients with diabetes treated with diet or non-insulin diabetes medications before admission. Consider adding scheduled insulin therapy in hospitalized adult patients started on correctional insulin alone and with persistent hyperglycemia (≥ 2 point-of-care blood glucose measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL in a 24-hour period). Consider administering scheduled insulin therapy in patients with confirmed admission blood glucose ≥ 180 mg/dL.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^a33af794]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes — Many adults with type 2 diabetes eventually require and benefit from insulin therapy, and clinicians should frame this as part of the disease's progression while avoiding stigmatizing messages. Instruction on self-titration of insulin doses based on glucose monitoring improves glycemic management. Basal insulin alone is the most convenient initial insulin treatment and can be added to noninsulin agents; starting doses can be estimated by body weight at 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day with individualized titration.

ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC THERAPY

Glycemic targets

The ADA's "Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes" recommends lowering HbA 1c to < 7.0% in most patients to reduce the incidence of microvascular disease. This can be achieved with a mean plasma glucose of ∼8.3–8.9 mmol/L (∼150–160 mg/dL); ideally, fasting and premeal glucose should be maintained at < 7.2 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL) and the postprandial glucose at < 10 mmol/L (< 180 mg/dL). More stringent HbA 1c targets (e.g. 6.0–6.5%) might be considered in selected patients (with short disease duration, long life expectancy, no significant CVD) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Conversely, less stringent HbA 1c goals — e.g. 7.5–8.0% or even slightly higher — are appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced complications, extensive comorbid conditions and those in whom the target is difficult to attain despite intensive self-management education, repeated counseling, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents, including insulin.

The accumulated results from the aforementioned type 2 diabetes cardiovascular trials suggest that not everyone benefits from aggressive glucose management. It follows that it is important to individualize treatment targets (,–). The elements that may guide the clinician in choosing an HbA 1c target for a specific patient are shown in Fig. 1. As mentioned earlier, the desires and values of the patient should also be considered, since the achievement of any degree of glucose control requires active participation and commitment. Indeed, any target could reflect an agreement between patient and clinician. An important related concept is that the ease with which more intensive targets are reached influences treatment decisions; logically, lower targets are attractive if they can be achieved with less complex regimens and no or minimal adverse effects. Importantly, utilizing the percentage of diabetic patients who are achieving an HbA 1c < 7.0% as a quality indicator, as promulgated by various health care organizations, is inconsistent with the emphasis on individualization of treatment goals.

Regarding medical management for in-hospital hyperglycemia, more specifically with respect to insulin therapy, ES 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering initial therapy with correctional insulin over scheduled insulin therapy (defined as basal or basal/bolus insulin) to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) in adult patients with no prior history of diabetes hospitalized for a non-critical illness and experiencing hyperglycemia (defined as blood glucose > 140 mg/dL; 7.8 mmol/L) during hospitalization. Consider adding scheduled insulin therapy in patients with persistent hyperglycemia (≥ 2 point-of-care blood glucose measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL in a 24-hour period on correctional insulin alone).

Although extensive dosing instructions for insulin are beyond the scope of this statement, most patients can be taught to uptitrate their own insulin dose based on several algorithms, each essentially involving the addition of a small dose increase if hyperglycemia persists. For example, the addition of 1–2 units (or, in those already on higher doses, increments of 5–10%) to the daily dose once or twice weekly if the fasting glucose levels are above the preagreed target is a reasonable approach. As the target is neared, dosage adjustments should be more modest and occur less frequently. Downward adjustment is advisable if any hypoglycemia occurs. During self-titration, frequent contact (telephone, e-mail) with the clinician may be necessary. Practitioners themselves can, of course, also titrate basal insulin, but this would involve more intensive contact with the patient than typically available in routine clinical practice. Daily self-monitoring of blood glucose is of obvious importance during this phase. After the insulin dose is stabilized, the frequency of monitoring should be reviewed.

Consideration should be given to the addition of prandial or mealtime insulin coverage when significant postprandial glucose excursions (e.g. to > 10.0 mmol/L [> 180 mg/dL]) occur. This is suggested when the fasting glucose is at target but the HbA 1c remains above goal after 3–6 months of basal insulin titration. The same would apply if large drops in glucose occur during overnight hours or in between meals, as the basal insulin dose is increased. In this scenario, the basal insulin dose would obviously need to be simultaneously decreased as prandial insulin is initiated. Although basal insulin is titrated primarily against the fasting glucose, generally irrespective of the total dose, practitioners should be aware that the need for prandial insulin therapy will become likely the more the daily dose exceeds 0.5 U kg −1 day −1, especially as it approaches 1 U kg −1 day −1. The aim with mealtime insulin is to blunt postprandial glycemic excursions, which can be extreme in some individuals, resulting in poor control during the day. Such coverage may be provided by one of two methods.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, general principles, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to use a person-centered shared decision-making approach to guide the choice of glucose-lowering medications in adult patients with T2DM. Use medications providing sufficient effectiveness to achieve and maintain intended treatment goals with consideration of the effects on cardiovascular, kidney, weight, and other relevant comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, cost and access, risk for adverse reactions and tolerability, and individual preferences:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Glycemic management (listed by glucose-lowering efficacy)|- Very high. Dulaglutide (high-dose), semaglutide, tirzepatide, insulin, oral combination therapy, injectable combination therapy (GLP-1 receptor agonist/insulin) < br > - High. GLP-1 receptor agonist (not listed above), metformin, pioglitazone, SGLT-2 inhibitor, sulfonylurea < br > - Intermediate. DPP4 inhibitor|
|Weight management (listed by weight loss efficacy, consider choosing a regimen with high-to-very-high dual glucose and weight efficacy)|- Very high. Semaglutide, tirzepatide < br > - High. Dulaglutide, liraglutide < br > - Intermediate. GLP-1 receptor agonist (not listed above), SGLT-2 inhibitor < br > - Neutral. Metformin, DPP4 inhibitor|
|ASCVD or indicators of high risk|- GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven CVD benefit or SGLT-2 inhibitor with proven CVD benefit < br > - If HbA1c is above target, consider adding an SGLT-2 inhibitor with proven CVD benefit in patients on a GLP-1 receptor agonist, or vice versa, or pioglitazone|
|HF|- SGLT-2 inhibitor with proven HF benefit|
|CKD|- SGLT-2 inhibitor with primary evidence of reducing CKD progression < br > - GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven CVD benefit if SGLT-2 inhibitors are not tolerated or contraindicated < br > - If HbA1c is above target, consider adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist in patients on an SGLT-2 inhibitor, or vice versa.|

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus: what is the optimal treatment regimen? [^d814d312]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment options for type 2 diabetes mellitus currently consist of insulin sensitizers, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, secretagogues, and insulin. However, the emphasis on initial therapy has been shifting from secretagogues and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors to insulin sensitizers such as metformin and the thiazolidinediones (TZDs). This article outlines the benefits of treatment with sensitizers vis à vis alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and secretagogues as part of a comprehensive treatment algorithm for type 2 diabetes. Secretagogues and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors effectively lower plasma glucose levels only, whereas insulin sensitizers reduce several important cardiac risk factors in addition to reducing plasma glucose levels. TZDs, in particular, are also beneficial for their ability to preserve or even rejuvenate pancreatic beta-cell function. The treatment algorithm has a layered approach, beginning with a combination of insulin-sensitizer therapy and incrementally progressing to triple oral therapy with the addition of secretagogues and, if necessary, the addition of subcutaneous insulin to maintain glycemic control.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^605bb99c]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics key action statements — management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents: Clinicians must ensure that insulin therapy is initiated for children and adolescents with T2DM who are ketotic or in diabetic ketoacidosis and in whom the distinction between types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus is unclear and, in usual cases, should initiate insulin therapy for patients who have random venous or plasma BG concentrations ≥ 250 mg/dL or whose HbA1c is > 9%. In all other instances, clinicians should initiate a lifestyle modification program, including nutrition and physical activity, and start metformin as first-line therapy for children and adolescents at the time of diagnosis of T2DM. The committee suggests that clinicians monitor HbA1c concentrations every 3 months and intensify treatment if treatment goals for finger-stick BG and HbA1c concentrations are not being met. The committee suggests that clinicians advise patients to monitor finger-stick BG in patients who are taking insulin or other medications with a risk of hypoglycemia; or are initiating or changing their diabetes treatment regimen; or have not met treatment goals; or have intercurrent illnesses. The committee suggests that clinicians incorporate the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Pediatric Weight Management Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guidelines in their dietary or nutrition counseling of patients with T2DM at the time of diagnosis and as part of ongoing management, and suggests that clinicians encourage children and adolescents with T2DM to engage in moderate-to-vigorous exercise for at least 60 minutes daily and to limit nonacademic screen time to less than 2 hours a day.

### Comparison of clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes between initially diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis [^42d685ab]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) can present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as the first manifestation. Differentiating types of newly diagnosed diabetes could provide appropriate long-term management. Therefore, we conducted this study to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes between initially diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients presenting with DKA.

Materials and methods

A retrospective study was conducted on adult patients who presented with DKA as the first diagnosis of diabetes in our tertiary hospital between January 2005 and December 2019. Demographic data, precipitating causes, laboratory investigations, treatment, and outcomes were obtained by chart review. The primary outcome was to compare the clinical characteristics of initially diagnosed patients with T1DM and T2DM who presented with DKA.

Results

A total of 100 initially diagnosed diabetic patients who presented with DKA were analyzed (85 T2DM patients and 15 T1DM patients). Patients with T1DM were younger than patients with T2DM (mean age 33 ± 16.2 vs. 51 ± 14.5 years, p value < 0.001). Patients with T2DM had a higher body mass index, family history of diabetes, precipitating factors, plasma glucose, and lower renal function than those with T1DM. There was no difference in resolution time or DKA management between T1DM and T2DM patients. The overall mortality rate of DKA was 4%.

Conclusion

In this population, most adult patients who presented with DKA had T2DM. Older age, obesity, a family history of diabetes, and the presence of precipitating factors were strong predictors of T2DM. We can implement the same clinical management for DKA in both T1DM and T2DM patients. However, T2DM patients had longer hospitalization than T1DM patients. After DKA resolution for 12 months, more than half of patients with T2DM could discontinue insulin. Therefore, the accurate classification of the type of diabetes leads to appropriate treatment.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^d8d47519]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

PATIENT-CENTERED APPROACH

Evidence-based advice depends on the existence of primary source evidence. This emerges only from clinical trial results in highly selected patients, using limited strategies. It does not address the range of choices available, or the order of use of additional therapies. Even if such evidence were available, the data would show median responses and not address the vital question of who responded to which therapy and why. Patient-centered care is defined as an approach to "providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions". This should be the organizing principle underlying health care for individuals with any chronic disease, but given our uncertainties in terms of choice or sequence of therapy, it is particularly appropriate in type 2 diabetes. Ultimately, it is patients who make the final decisions regarding their lifestyle choices and, to some degree, the pharmaceutical interventions they use; their implementation occurs in the context of the patients' real lives and relies on the consumption of resources (both public and private).

Patient involvement in the medical decision making constitutes one of the core principles of evidence-based medicine, which mandates the synthesis of best available evidence from the literature with the clinician's expertise and patient's own inclinations. During the clinical encounter, the patient's preferred level of involvement should be gauged and therapeutic choices explored, potentially with the utilization of decision aids. In a shared decision-making approach, clinician and patient act as partners, mutually exchanging information and deliberating on options, in order to reach a consensus on the therapeutic course of action. There is good evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach. Importantly, engaging patients in health care decisions may enhance adherence to therapy.

Is patient already on MDI? If yes: Stop short-acting insulin; ensure initial long-acting dose is optimized (0.5 units/kg); and start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily, and check BG 2x daily (fasting, post-prandial). If no: Is HbA1c ≥ 8.5% OR ketosis present; if yes: Start long-acting (LA) insulin (0.5 units/kg) and start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily; if no: Start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily over 4 weeks. Use post-prandial glucoses to guide changes in eating, adding medications, etc. Reassess: Is patient on maximally tolerated dose metformin? If yes: Increase LA insulin by 5–10 units if FBG ≥ 126 mg/dl; if no: Continue to increase metformin and increase LA insulin by 5–10 units if FBG ≥ 200 mg/dl. If difficulty tolerating metformin, try extended release or consider switching to pioglitazone 30 mg daily.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, 2022. A consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^64b62b35]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the previous consensus statements on the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes in adults, published since 2006 and last updated in 2019. The target audience is the full spectrum of the professional health care team providing diabetes care in the U.S. and Europe. A systematic examination of publications since 2018 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on social determinants of health, the health care system, and physical activity behaviors, including sleep. There is a greater emphasis on weight management as part of the holistic approach to diabetes management. The results of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes trials involving sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, including assessment of subgroups, inform broader recommendations for cardiorenal protection in people with diabetes at high risk of cardiorenal disease. After a summary listing of consensus recommendations, practical tips for implementation are provided.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^0e546f59]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Family-centered diabetes care — engagement, education, and culturally appropriate approaches — emphasizes that "family structure, support, and education help inform clinical decision-making and negotiations with the patient and family about medical preferences that affect medical decisions, independent of existing clinical recommendations", and that "because adherence is a major issue in any lifestyle intervention, engaging the family is critical not only to maintain needed changes in lifestyle but also to foster medication adherence". "Behavioral interventions in younger children have shown a favorable effect", while "with adolescents, however, interventions based on target-age behaviors (eg, including phone or Internet-based interventions as well as face-to-face or peer-enhanced activities) appear to foster better results, at least for weight management". Sustained change "requires the initial and ongoing education of the patient and the entire family about healthy nutrition and exercise", and recommendations "must establish realistic goals and take into account the families' health beliefs and behaviors". Because "T2DM disproportionately affects minority populations, there is a need to ensure culturally appropriate, family-centered care along with ongoing education", and "several observational studies cite the importance of addressing cultural issues within the family".

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: evidence and uncertainty [^1dbb88cb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes

Uncertainties also abound in pharmacological management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Sources of uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the panoply of glycemic (HbA1c) targets, the ideal sequence of drugs after metformin failure, the complexity of drug therapy, the possible harms of anti-hyperglycemic drugs, the outcomes of treatment (surrogate versus clinical), and the hierarchy of risk factors to treat in order to prevent the vascular complications. The rising number of diabetes medications available today (more tomorrow) makes it hard, if not impossible, to explore all possible combinations and sequences of combinations that could be recommended. As a corollary, treatment algorithms cannot be truly evidence-based because of a lack of studies comparing all available treatment combination options.

Another source of uncertainty was recently addressed by Tschöpe et al. who stressed the failure of recent guidelines to give advice on the use of specific antidiabetic drugs in patients with co-morbidity. As the patient with type 2 diabetes represents the paradigm of associated co-morbidities (overweight or obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function), the expert opinion released by Tschöpe and colleagues seems well-timed from a clinical practice perspective. The evidence presented in support of their expert opinion was the best available; however, the divarication between the world of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the real world of the average type 2 diabetic patient remains problematic. The otherwise very complete Figure accompanying the article is a long list of drugs recommended, contraindicated or neutral, among which clinicians may pick up the most appropriate drug for that particular patient, based on their own clinical judgment (a mixture of clinical experience, knowledge and skill).

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^4e1bf6f1]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The most recent glycemic goal recommended by the American Diabetes Association, selected on the basis of practicality and the projected reduction in complications over time, is, in general, an A1C level of < 7%. The most recent glycemic goal set by the International Diabetes Federation is an A1C level of < 6.5%. The upper limit of the nondiabetic range is 6.1% (mean ± SD. A1C level of 5 ± 2%) with the DCCT/UKPDS-standardized assay, which has been promulgated through the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and adopted by the vast majority of commercially available assays. Several recent clinical trials have aimed for A1C levels ≤ 6.5% with a variety of interventions. The results of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, which had the primary objective of decreasing CVD with interventions aimed at achieving an A1C level of < 6.0% vs. interventions aimed at achieving an A1C level of < 7.9%, showed excess CVD mortality in the intensive treatment group. Results from the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial and the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial, both of which had different interventions and study populations than ACCORD, did not demonstrate any excess total or CVD mortality with intensive regimens that achieved A1C levels comparable with the 6.5% in ACCORD. However, none of the studies has demonstrated a benefit of intensive glycemic control on their primary CVD outcomes. Our consensus is that an A1C level of ≥ 7% should serve as a call to action to initiate or change therapy with the goal of achieving an A1C level of < 7%. We are mindful that this goal is not appropriate or practical for some patients, and clinical judgement based on the potential benefits and risks of a more intensified regimen needs to be applied for every patient. Factors such as life expectancy, risk of hypoglycemia, and the presence of CVD need to be considered for every patient before intensifying the therapeutic regimen.

Assiduous attention to abnormalities other than hyperglycemia that accompany type 2 diabetes, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia, has been shown to improve microvascular and cardiovascular complications. Readers are referred to published guidelines for a discussion of the rationale and goals of therapy for the nonglycemic risk factors, as well as recommendations on how to achieve them.

### Changing the treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes [^a622aac8]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT

The "stepwise approach"' is usually adopted to manage glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. On diagnosis, lifestyle modification is initiated, followed by treatment with a single oral antidiabetic agent, which is often up-titrated to maximal recommended doses before combination therapy is introduced. However, this conservative approach has a number of drawbacks. On the contrary, a proactive approach and therapy tailored to the individual by methodical selection among available agents can optimize patient care.

Several clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of diet and exercise in preventing diabetes and reducing disease progression, but, as aforementioned, such regimens are difficult to implement and maintain, and glycemic control is rarely achieved. Hence, in conjunction with lifestyle intervention, pharmacologic approaches become the key component of diabetes management to the point that the recent American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes consensus suggested nutritional therapy should be initiated together with metformin. The latter is almost unanimously recognized as the drug of choice, but failure is expected to occur. In the UKPDS, after 9-year monotherapy, cumulative incidence of failure was 87% in obese patients randomized to metformin. In ADOPT, the 5-year cumulative incidence of metformin failure was 21%, and in two large retrospective analyses, the rate of metformin secondary failure was 35.5 and 38% at 4 and 5.7 years, respectively. Although different definitions for failure were used in these studies, all suggested that unacceptable therapeutic inertia occurs in clinical practice. Analysis of the 1994–2002 Kaiser Permanente Northwest database revealed that the average time between achieving A1C action point of 8% and switching to, or adding a second oral antidiabetic agent for patients on metformin, or sulfonylurea monotherapy, was 14.5 or 20.5 months, respectively. The authors of this analysis concluded that, "Clinicians should change glucose-lowering treatments in type 2 diabetes much sooner or use treatments that are less likely to fail". This view has been reinforced by the Global Partnership of Effective Diabetes Management and by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. Taking the same approach is the more recent American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes consensus statement advocating individualized therapeutic choices to be considered as soon as A1C overcomes a 7.0% threshold, supporting more intensive and earlier use of combination therapy and introduction of insulin therapy if glycemic control is not achieved. Several studies have shown how early use of submaximal combination doses of agents can improve glycemic control without significantly increasing side effects. The use of multiple drugs should be considered not simply on the basis of greater efficacy, but also in terms of a rational therapeutic approach of the multiple pathogenetic mechanisms underlying hyperglycemia and its progression. In particular, the primary role of progressive loss of β-cell function should be taken into full consideration as discussed hereunder.
