## Question

What is the pathophysiology of lichen sclerosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology of lichen sclerosus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching disease framework and its level of certainty. Then, I should review genetic susceptibility and autoimmune comorbidity. Next, I will examine the immune effector patterns alongside histopathologic correlates. After that, I need to evaluate proposed microvascular and oxidative injury mechanisms. Then, I will integrate environmental and mechanical triggers. Finally, I will connect these mechanisms to malignant potential and synthesize a multi-hit model, being explicit about uncertainties and evidence quality [^115pd4Py] [^1121oBLP] [^116rEZ21].

> Let me first confirm the disease framework so I don't jump to conclusions: lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis that predominantly affects anogenital skin and manifests clinically with pruritus, atrophy, and sclerosis; the etiology is not fully elucidated, but converging evidence supports an autoimmune-mediated process in genetically predisposed individuals rather than a primary hormonal disorder, while an initiating event remains uncertain [^115pd4Py] [^117CLsZP] [^1121oBLP].

> Wait, let me verify genetic susceptibility and familial risk before I proceed: LS shows familial clustering and HLA associations, with HLA-DQ7 overrepresented in prepubertal girls compared with controls, supporting a heritable component; whole-exome studies in multiplex families have identified rare variants in immune-regulatory and signaling genes (for example, CD177, CD200, ANKRD18A, LATS2), which is hypothesis-generating but not yet definitive; importantly, autoimmune comorbidity is common in women with LS (notably autoimmune thyroid disease, vitiligo, alopecia areata, pernicious anemia), and guidelines endorse evaluating for autoimmune diseases when clinically indicated, reinforcing the autoimmune–genetic link [^115xpGDW] [^111yBfr6] [^115pd4Py] [^112U2Pim] [^116rEZ21].

> I need to check the immune effector signature next: transcriptomic and immunohistochemical data demonstrate a Th1-skewed inflammatory milieu with upregulation of IFN-γ and IFN-γ–inducible chemokines and receptors (for example, CXCR3, CXCL9/10/11, CCR5, CCL4/5), alongside dense dermal infiltrates of CD4+, CD8+, and FOXP3+ T cells; microRNA-155 is notably upregulated, consistent with dysregulated immune control; histopathologically, a lichenoid tissue reaction pattern with basal layer degeneration is typical and aligns with a T cell–mediated interface dermatitis paradigm [^114hUwuE] [^1133My6x] [^112Pgi4N].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about vasculopathy — still, I should review the emerging microvascular injury hypothesis: recent pathologic series describe superficial vascular drop-out, endothelial cell necrosis, and microvascular basement membrane zone thickening with evidence of C5b-9 (membrane attack complex) deposition, suggesting complement-mediated chronic microvascular injury with morphologic echoes of interferonopathies; however, I need to emphasize that this is a novel, still-evolving hypothesis that requires external validation before being considered established pathomechanism [^115Q7Uzk].

> I should confirm the role of oxidative stress as a plausible downstream effector: LS lesions demonstrate increased lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal), oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine), and protein carbonylation, along with disturbed enzymatic antioxidant defenses; oxidative damage colocalizes with extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), which is a recognized autoantigenal target in LS, suggesting a feed-forward loop of immune-mediated tissue injury and oxidative stress, although causality versus consequence still needs careful disentangling [^113Ziqpq] [^117CLsZP].

> Next, I should review how these immune and injury mechanisms correlate with histopathology to ensure clinicopathologic coherence: early LS may show subtle changes such as subepithelial edema, collagen homogenization, and dilated superficial vessels beneath the basement membrane, which can overlap with lichen planus or even psoriasis; established LS classically shows hyperkeratosis, epidermal atrophy with flattened rete ridges, vacuolar interface change, loss of elastic fibers, and hyalinized upper dermis overlying a lymphocytic infiltrate; importantly, nonsclerotic variants exist in which clinical LS coexists with absent dermal sclerosis, so I need to remember that dermal features do not reliably track disease duration or activity and that clinicopathologic correlation is essential — indeed, relying solely on biopsy to make or exclude LS in clinically classic cases is inadvisable [^1133My6x] [^111TuWiS] [^111Zq6x9] [^116pP1MZ] [^115dbged].

> I will now examine contributing environmental and mechanical triggers, but I should be cautious not to overstate causality: LS can propagate via the Koebner phenomenon, particularly after urethral manipulation or trauma to squamous epithelium, which implies iatrogenic procedures may extend disease; chronic urine occlusion and irritation in males likely act as exacerbating factors; by contrast, infectious triggers such as Borrelia burgdorferi remain unproven and controversial, and hormonal influences appear to play a lesser or minimal pathogenetic role compared with immune dysregulation, so I need to avoid attributing primary causation to them [^1133ySdP] [^113WM5ZU] [^113DdK1Y] [^115pd4Py] [^113KFEqx].

> But wait, what about malignant potential — let me verify the magnitude and mechanistic plausibility: chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and oxidative DNA damage plausibly contribute to carcinogenesis, and genital LS carries an elevated lifetime risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), commonly cited around 4–6% in older reviews, with some summaries noting a broader 2–6% range; even with treatment, risk does not drop to zero, so durable suppression of inflammation plus vigilant long-term surveillance is prudent given the pathobiology; this mechanistic arc is consistent with the interface dermatitis–to–scar microenvironment and oxidative stress profile seen in LS [^115b4tJy] [^111jUSjt] [^112Zm9PF] [^113MdKLw] [^116xqZsb].

> Let me synthesize an integrated, multi-hit model and check for internal consistency: a genetically susceptible host (for example, HLA-DQ7 and other rare immune-regulatory variants) encounters environmental triggers such as mechanical trauma or urine irritation that initiate lesional formation; a Th1-dominant autoimmune response targets epithelial–dermal junction constituents (including ECM1), producing a lichenoid interface dermatitis; downstream, complement-mediated microvascular injury and oxidative stress sustain hypoxic–fibrosing remodeling, culminating in sclerosis, atrophy, and architectural distortion; over time, the chronic inflammatory–oxidative milieu confers a permissive field for SCC development; I should stress uncertainties — particularly that the complement vasculopathy requires prospective validation and that oxidative stress may be both driver and byproduct — while the autoimmune–genetic–inflammatory axis remains the most robustly supported scaffold of LS pathophysiology [^115pd4Py] [^1121oBLP] [^115Q7Uzk] [^113Ziqpq] [^116rEZ21].

> Finally, I should double-check practical implications for diagnosis to avoid missteps: because early or nonsclerotic histology may be nondiagnostic, a confident clinical examination often anchors the diagnosis, with biopsy reserved for neoplasia concern, diagnostic uncertainty, inadequate response to potent topical corticosteroids, or atypical features; if a biopsy is nondiagnostic but clinical features remain classic, management should not be derailed, and serial clinical correlation remains key to aligning the pathophysiologic understanding with patient care [^112CMj5e] [^116pP1MZ] [^115dbged] [^1133My6x].

---

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is driven by **autoimmune T-cell–mediated inflammation**, characterized by a strong Th1 cytokine signature [^114hUwuE] and frequent ECM1 autoantibodies [^113Ziqpq], especially in genetically predisposed individuals [^116rEZ21] (notably HLA-DQ7) [^115xpGDW]. Chronic inflammation leads to **dermal sclerosis and atrophy** via fibroblast activation, excess collagen deposition, and loss of elastic fibers [^1133My6x], while oxidative stress [^113Ziqpq] and microvascular injury [^115Q7Uzk] amplify tissue damage [^113DdK1Y]. Mechanical trauma, urine exposure [^1121oBLP], and incontinence are key triggers [^111sVSX7]; persistent inflammation with p53 dysregulation [^112Zm9PF] underlies the increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma [^113MdKLw].

---

## Immune dysregulation and autoimmunity

- **T-cell–mediated inflammation**: LS shows a dense dermal infiltrate of CD4+, CD8+, and FOXP3+ cells, with a Th1 cytokine milieu (IFN-γ, CXCL9/10/11, CCL4/5) and upregulated miR-155 [^114hUwuE], supporting an autoimmune phenotype [^116rEZ21].

- **Autoantibodies**: ECM1 autoantibodies are common [^113Ziqpq] and may contribute to matrix disruption and sclerosis [^117CLsZP].

- **Genetic predisposition**: HLA-DQ7 is enriched in LS, especially in prepubertal girls [^115xpGDW], indicating genetic susceptibility [^115b4tJy].

---

## Chronic inflammation and fibrosis

Chronic inflammation drives **fibroblast activation**, leading to excess collagen deposition and loss of elastic fibers [^1133My6x], producing dermal sclerosis and atrophy. Concurrent **oxidative stress** [^113Ziqpq] — with elevated lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA/protein damage alongside impaired antioxidant defenses — amplifies tissue injury and fibrosis [^113DdK1Y].

---

## Microvascular injury

Key features include **microvascular changes** — endothelial necrosis, basement membrane thickening, and C5b-9 deposition [^115Q7Uzk] — which indicate complement-mediated vascular injury contributing to ischemia and fibrosis.

---

## Environmental and mechanical factors

Environmental and mechanical factors include **mechanical trauma** — friction, scratching, and urine exposure [^111sVSX7] — that can trigger or worsen LS via the Koebner phenomenon [^1133ySdP]. Additionally, **incontinence**, with chronic moisture and urine contact, is a recognized trigger, particularly in females [^115pd4Py].

---

## Malignant transformation

In LS, **squamous cell carcinoma risk** is increased due to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress [^113Ziqpq], and p53 dysregulation [^112Zm9PF] [^113MdKLw].

---

LS pathophysiology reflects **autoimmune inflammation** in a genetically susceptible host, with fibrosis, oxidative stress, microvascular injury, and environmental triggers converging to drive chronic disease and increase malignancy risk [^1121oBLP].

### Should we always biopsy in clinically evident lichen sclerosus [^115dbged]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2019). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were to review cases of clinically diagnosed lichen sclerosus (LS) and to compare the histological features found on biopsy to clinical features seen on examination.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was undertaken of patients attending a specialist vulval service between 2013 and 2015 with a clinical diagnosis of LS. Patients in whom there was clinical diagnostic uncertainty or those with features of lichen planus or lichen planus/LS overlap were excluded. We determined the proportion of these patients who underwent vulval biopsy and reviewed their histology.

- **Results**: One hundred fifteen charts were reviewed. Sixty-nine (69/115, 60%) had a firm diagnosis of established LS, and of these, 39 (39/69, 56.5%) had a biopsy performed in the previous 5 years. Thirteen (13/39, 33.3%) of these biopsies fell short of a diagnosis of LS histologically with some suggestive but nondiagnostic and some showing nonspecific features.

- **Conclusions**: Reliance on biopsies solely to establish or exclude the diagnosis of LS is inadvisable. A good level of knowledge of the characteristic clinical features is imperative among gynecologists, dermatologists, and general practitioners.

Studies concerning pediatric lichen sclerosus are limited, and, at the time of writing, there have been no studies comparing the course of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls. We sought to examine all publications on boys and girls with lichen sclerosus and assess and compare epidemiology, symptoms and signs, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis. A systematic search was performed in the Embase, Medline, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria were information on children ages 0–18 years and a clinical or histologic diagnosis of lichen sclerosus. Literature from 1985 to 2021 was reviewed.

A total of 1780 articles were retrieved from the search, of which 90 articles were eligible for inclusion. Boys and girls present similarly on many aspects; nonetheless, treatment and follow-up are approached differently. Though the clinical approach is often different, lichen sclerosus in boys and girls demonstrates many similarities. More research is needed, especially on follow-up, to gain a better understanding of the course of lichen sclerosus and establish an advanced management plan for children.

Discussion

SCC is by far the most common cancer affecting the vulva, accounting for 90% of all vulvar malignancies. The association between LS and SCC is well established. The mechanism of the carcinogenic progression from LS to SCC is not clearly elucidated but is thought to be related to high cell turnover in the setting of chronic irritation.

In contrast, BCC is extremely rare in the perianal and genital regions, with an estimated prevalence of less than 1%. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation, fair skin, and advancing age are known risk factors for the development of BCC. However, the pathophysiology of BCC development in non–sun-exposed regions remains unknown. Vulvar BCC develops most commonly in middle-aged to elderly women (average age, 73 years) and tends to present with a large, often ulcerated lesion (average size, 1.95 cm). Associations between genital BCC and preceding immunosuppressive therapy, chronic irritation, pelvic radiation, and prior trauma have been reported. To our knowledge, there are very few cases of BCC arising in a foci of LS.

The potential pathogenic role of tacrolimus in this case remains unclear. LS compromises the skin barrier, potentially allowing tacrolimus to penetrate and accumulate in the epidermis and dermis, where it is theorized to impede DNA repair and decrease apoptosis of keratinocytes, leading to abnormal cell differentiation. Oral calcineurin inhibitors confer an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in organ transplant recipients. However, the literature has not definitively correlated topical calcineurin inhibitors with an increase.

Indications for biopsy

International guidelines and consensus statements vary regarding biopsy recommendations for suspected lichen sclerosus (LS) in adults, but there is consensus to obtain tissue when there is concern for neoplasia, diagnostic uncertainty, or inadequate response to potent topical corticosteroids. The preferred biopsy site is the most abnormal area, with the aim of sparing the periclitoral region, posterior fourchette, and anus when possible. In children, biopsy requires sedation, so it is performed when there is a diagnostic dilemma or another indication for surgery.

Lichen sclerosus may coexist with other vulvar dermatoses such as contact dermatitis, lichen planus, vitiligo, and psoriasis. It may be complicated by superinfection with Candida albicans, dermatophytes, and herpes simplex virus. Additionally, human papillomavirus (HPV)-related diseases can manifest on a background of LS as condyloma, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma. Each of these conditions may necessitate biopsy and complicate histopathologic assessment. For example, sclerosis disappears in 57% of cases of comorbid high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and LS, and florid inflammation due to mycosis may obscure basal layer changes.

Histopathology

- **Background**: Lichen sclerosus exhibits a variety of pathologic appearances across the epidermis and dermis. The epithelium can range from atrophic to acanthotic, while rete ridges may be absent, reduced, irregular, or psoriasiform. The infiltrate can vary from sparse to dense, and abnormal collagen may present as focal to diffuse and be edematous, hyalinized, and fibrotic.

### The surgical management of lichen sclerosus of the glans penis: Our experience and review of the literature [^115mj8Qe]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) of the glans penis is a chronic, progressive, scleroatrophic inflammatory process of unknown etiology affecting the glans penis, prepuce, and urethra. This condition may lead to severe impairment of sexual and urinary function.

- **Aims**: To report our experience of surgical management of LS of the glans penis.

- **Main outcome measures**: Complications, patients' satisfaction, cosmesis, resolution of pain and pruritus, and postoperative sexual function were recorded retrospectively.

- **Methods**: The surgical outcome of the 31 patients who have undergone resurfacing of the glans penis using skin grafting for the management of genital LS in our institute is reported.

- **Results**: After a median follow-up of 12.8 months, 26 patients (84%) were fully satisfied with cosmetic and functional results, and 71% of them have resumed sexual activity.

- **Conclusions**: Resurfacing of the glans penis represents a simple and reproducible technique for the management of LS and yields excellent functional and cosmetic results.

Lichen sclerosus in childhood appears to develop similarly in both sexes; however, the clinical approach often varies due to the division of care according to the patient's sex. Follow-up is crucial to prevent future complications. More collaborative research is needed to improve understanding of the course of lichen sclerosus and to establish an advanced management plan for children.

### Lichen sclerosus [^115b4tJy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic skin condition that presents many challenges to clinicians. It affects men, women, and children, usually occurring in the anogenital area. The clinical signs can be confused with those seen in cases of sexual abuse in children. The underlying cause is unknown; however, there is a strong association with autoimmune disorders, and immunogenetic studies have demonstrated a link with HLA DQ7.

Patients suffer significant morbidity due to intractable symptoms, physical scarring, and psychosexual damage. Support groups may be beneficial for some patients. Potent topical corticosteroids have been shown to be effective. There is a 5% incidence of squamous cell carcinoma; therefore, all suspicious lesions should be biopsied. It is unclear whether the risk of malignancy is altered with the use of topical corticosteroids, as there is a potential risk of triggering a latent infection of human papillomavirus.

A multidisciplinary approach to care is required. Ideally, all patients should attend a dedicated clinic and be offered long-term monitoring.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^1133My6x]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

In the early stages of lichen sclerosus (LS), not only the symptoms and clinical signs, but also the histologic picture may be uncharacteristic. The histologic features in early LS are quite subtle and may overlap with those seen in psoriasis or lichen planus (LP), with luminal hyperkeratosis and hypergranulosis of the adnexal structures. There may be mild irregular, occasionally psoriasiform acanthosis, and focal basement membrane thickening. Early dermal changes include subepithelial edema, homogenized collagen, and dilated blood vessels immediately under the basement membrane. The lymphocytic infiltrate can be lichenoid or interstitial with epidermal lymphocyte exocytosis and lymphocytic/lymphohistiocytic vasculitis. Serial sections are sometimes necessary.

The classic histologic features of more advanced uncomplicated LS are hyperkeratosis, epidermal atrophy with flattening of the rete ridges, vacuolar interface changes, loss of elastic fibers, and hyalinization of the lamina propria with an underlying lymphocytic infiltrate. However, prominent acanthosis may be a feature, particularly in vulvar LS. In a study of 121 cases of vulvar LS, changes in lichen simplex chronicus or spongiotic dermatitis, dermal eosinophils, and a frequent absence of atrophy have been documented. Those vulvar LS cases presenting with eosinophilic spongiosis, marked lymphocyte exocytosis, dermal eosinophils, and excoriations showed a poor symptomatic response to treatment. The cause might be a superimposed allergic contact dermatitis. Patch testing is recommended for these individuals.

The pathology for LS is far from being always conclusive.

### Lichen sclerosus: A C5b-9 mediated chronic microvascular injury syndrome potentially reflective of common adult comorbidities [^115Q7Uzk]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2023). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a cutaneous disease of unknown etiology that often involves the vulva or foreskin but also can affect extragenital sites. Regardless of the anatomic site, the histomorphology and presumably pathogenesis are similar. A possible clue to the pathophysiology of LS lies in its frequent association with morphea, specifically when occurring in an extragenital context.

In our experience, a striking feature evident in established lichen sclerosus (LS) is the superficial vascular drop-out, whereby residual vessels exhibited endothelial cell necrosis and microvascular basement membrane zone thickening. The latter is reflective of antecedent episodes of microvascular injury. We aimed to understand the pathophysiology underlying the distinct vascular changes to shed light on the pathogenesis of LS.

We examined 44 cases of LS from 2019 to 2021 and obtained past medical histories in 34 of the 44 cases. The pathological assessment predominantly focused on microvascular changes. We assessed the role of C5b-9 mediated vascular injury in the pathogenesis of the vasculopathy and enhanced type I interferon signaling in vessels given the morphologic semblance to select interferonopathy syndromes, namely fibrosing dermatomyositis and Kohlmeier-Degos disease.

We examined the expression of CMV DNA and proteins based on prior observations in an earlier study that isolated early protein expression in the microvasculature in the contexts of LS and scleroderma. From a clinical perspective, the most striking association was an

### Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of lichen sclerosus [^113Ziqpq]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of unknown aetiology which can be associated with secondary malignancies. Recent evidence supports an autoimmune basis for this disorder, as demonstrated by autoantibodies to extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM-1). The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to autoimmunity and carcinogenesis are poorly understood.

- **Objectives**: We hypothesized that oxidative stress, which has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and malignant disorders, contributes to these processes in LS.

- **Methods**: Skin biopsies from 16 patients with untreated, histologically confirmed vulval LS were examined immunohistochemically using antibodies against the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenale and against the oxidative DNA damage marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Protein carbonyls as markers of protein oxidation were visualized using the dinitrophenylhydrazone method. Expression of antioxidant enzymes was investigated. Normal vulval tissue from 16 subjects served as control.

- **Results**: In vulval LS tissue a significant increase of lipid peroxidation products was found, particularly within the basal cell layers of the epidermis, thus colocalizing with ECM-1. Oxidative DNA damage was detected throughout LS biopsies. Intriguingly, protein oxidation was significantly increased within the dermis of LS lesions, indicating oxidative protein damage in the areas of sclerosis and inflammation. The enzymatic antioxidant defence in LS was found to be significantly disturbed.

### Evidence-based (S3) guideline on (anogenital) lichen sclerosus [^113aSpky]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for lichen sclerosus, and more specifically in relation to topical corticosteroids, the EADV 2015 guidelines recommend considering long-term ultra-potent or potent topical corticosteroids if needed. This is particularly suggested for female patients with active disease, as male genital lichen sclerosus is generally aimed to be treated curatively in most cases.

### Lichen sclerosus: A review and practical approach [^111jUSjt]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic dermatitis predominantly found in the anogenital area. It can occur in patients of any age group, sex, or race, but is most commonly present in Caucasian peri- or postmenopausal women. Although the etiology of LS remains uncertain, an autoimmune process is believed to underlie this condition. With many cases going unreported, its incidence is still unknown.

There is no cure for LS, but treatment offers control of the condition. There are three reasons for treating LS: relief of symptoms and discomfort; prevention of any or further anatomical changes; and a theoretical prevention of malignant transformation. Although many treatments have been suggested to treat LS over the years, only potent or ultra-potent corticosteroids remain as the treatment of choice. After initial therapy, some patients might only use corticosteroids as needed, while others may require a twice-weekly maintenance therapy.

Surgery has no place in uncomplicated LS. Surgical interventions should be limited exclusively to patients with malignancy and to those requiring correction of scarring secondary to the disease. Lichen sclerosus is associated with a 4–6% risk of squamous cell carcinoma, making long-term follow-up essential in these patients.

### Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of lichen sclerosus: A systematic review [^1121oBLP]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to elucidate understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of genital lichen sclerosus (LS), its urologic manifestations, and treatment options.

- **Materials and methods**: The Medline/PubMed and Embase databases were systematically reviewed for publications pertaining to LS. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, references were assessed for relevance to the pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of LS by title and abstract review by two independent reviewers, yielding 186 articles for assessment.

- **Results**: The contemporary understanding of the epidemiology and histology of LS is reviewed herein. Additionally, we explore in detail the three hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanism contributing to disease presentation: infectious etiology, primary immune dysregulation, and the isotraumatopic response. We summarize the available biological evidence supporting each hypothesis. This discussion provides context for understanding LS morbidity and may spur new avenues of research. For the clinician, we review the clinical presentation of the disease, including the risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma. Medical and surgical treatment options are also detailed.

- **Conclusion**: LS remains a potentially insidious disease which may lead to debilitating urinary and sexual dysfunction. Cross-disciplinary research should aim for earlier detection, as well as more effective and durable treatment. The exact cause of LS remains unknown.

### Nonsclerotic lichen sclerosus: Definition of a concept and pathologic description [^111TuWiS]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Low credibility.

Tension exists in the literature regarding the relationship between dermal features in LS and the interval between disease initiation and tissue sampling. Some authors assign the label "early LS" to cases with subtle or absent sclerosis; others document that duration of disease does not predict collagen appearance. Likewise, extensive fibrosis with minimal infiltrate has been termed "burnt-out LS" and described as a late feature usually seen in elderly patients, but fibrosis may be seen throughout the age spectrum. Extrapolations of disease duration from histopathologic appearance complicate interpretation of the scant literature on NSLS.

This review aims to describe the clinicopathologic problem of clinically diagnosed LS accompanied by a tissue specimen suggesting LS but lacking sclerosis, and provides a classification approach.

### Comparison of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls: A systematic literature review of epidemiology, symptoms, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis [^111ANSnw]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS), first described by Breisky in 1885 and Hallopeau in 1887, is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that predominantly affects the anogenital region. LS is relatively common in postmenopausal women, with an estimated prevalence between 1:1000 and 1:60. In men, LS seems less common; the reported ratio between men and women varies from 1:10 to 1:6. The disease is well documented in adults; however, less is known regarding LS in children. In addition, many publications address LS in either boys or girls, but not both. Therefore, we aim to assess the literature on LS in both boys and girls.

LS has been known by various synonyms such as white spot disease, kraurosis vulvae, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus vulvae, or, in men, balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO). For consistency, in this review, we uniformly use the term lichen sclerosus.

### Pediatric vulvar lichen sclerosus: A survey of disease course [^1122zrvA]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

To assess long-term outcomes of lichen sclerosus (LS) in the female pediatric population, specifically in relation to patient age, treatment type and duration, and remission, a retrospective chart review was conducted. This review identified female pediatric patients (0–18 years of age) who were diagnosed with LS between January 1, 2015, and January 1, 2020, at the University of North Carolina Dermatology and/or Obstetrics and Gynecology Departments. Patients were contacted via telephone for follow-up interviews, which consisted of a series of questions regarding patient age, symptom onset, time of diagnosis, treatment, and symptoms.

Of the 128 patients identified, 61 consented and participated in follow-up interviews. At the time of the study follow-up, 55 out of 61 participants (90%) reported their symptoms were improved. Patients reported using a variety of treatments, with medium- to high-potency topical steroids being the most common. At the time of follow-up, 53 out of 61 patients (87%) reported being asymptomatic, 37 of whom (70%) were not using any form of maintenance therapy. Those who achieved symptom resolution did so at an average of 8.4 years of age. There was no significant difference in age between asymptomatic patients receiving maintenance therapy and those receiving no maintenance therapy. There was a positive correlation between the duration of LS treatment and time in remission (P < .001). Increased patient age at the time of follow-up also correlated positively with time in remission.

### Lichen sclerosus: Review of the literature and current recommendations for management [^115igr6h]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

We reviewed the literature regarding the clinical presentation, etiology, natural history, and medical and surgical management of lichen sclerosus in men.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a comprehensive search of the literature in PubMed, MEDLINE, and other electronic databases between 1950 and 2006 using the keywords lichen sclerosus, balanitis xerotica obliterans, and urethral stricture. Our search resulted in 1,268 sources containing the words lichen sclerosus or balanitis xerotica obliterans. We reviewed 68 articles in peer-reviewed journals and 2 chapters on this subject.

- **Results**: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, lymphocyte-mediated skin disease that was first described in 1887. It shows a predilection for the anogenital area in men and women. Much has been discovered regarding the epidemiology, natural history, and histological features of this disease process during the last century, including the discovery of a strong association between lichen sclerosus and squamous cell carcinoma. The techniques of medical and surgical management of this disorder are still being elucidated. Biopsy of the initial lesion for definitive diagnosis and long-term follow-up of affected patients are well-established, critical elements in the management of lichen sclerosus.

- **Conclusions**: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, debilitating condition that may progress to cause significant voiding complications. Biopsy is recommended in all patients suspected of having lichen sclerosus to rule out squamous cell carcinoma. Further research is needed to improve prevention and understanding.

### Future research priorities for lichen sclerosus - results of a James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership [^113WM5ZU]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory genital skin condition affecting men, women, and children. Long‐term complications include the loss of normal anatomy from scarring and malignant transformation. Uncertainties exist about the cause, diagnosis, and management of LS. For example, the aetiology is contested; evidence suggests that chronic irritation by occluded urine is important in males; however, autoimmune mechanisms are proposed in females. Genetic associations are suggested in both sexes. Existing evidence on which to make recommendations about management and the prevention of malignancy is generally of poor quality.

We conducted a Priority Setting Partnership (PSP) from June 2017 to July 2018 using James Lind Alliance (JLA) methodology. The aim was to identify future research priorities about the causes, diagnosis, management, and prevention of LS in men, women, and children. This research letter details the key findings; a full detailed report is available in the public domain.

The protocol was written prospectively and made publicly available. The steering group, chaired by a JLA independent adviser, included seven patient representatives (five patients, one parent of a child with LS, one patient support organization representative), seven health professionals (five dermatologists, one gynaecologist, and one nurse), and three researchers/administrators. From September to October 2017, we conducted the first of two online surveys using SurveyMonkey TM. These surveys, available in English, were promoted by partner organizations and social media.

### Multicentre, phase II trial on the safety and efficacy of topical tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of lichen sclerosus [^114yKoxf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease causing significant sclerosis, atrophy, and pruritus. Treatment remains unsatisfactory, with potent corticosteroids being the most effective therapy.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a multicentre, phase II trial to assess the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment 0.1% for the treatment of lichen sclerosus with a follow-up period of 18 months at 10 university and teaching hospitals in Germany and Austria.

- **Methods**: Eighty-four patients (49 women, 32 men, and three girls) aged between 5 and 85 years with long-standing, active lichen sclerosus (79 with anogenital and five with extragenital localization) were treated with topical tacrolimus ointment 0.1% twice daily for 16 weeks. Computerized analysis of the lesional area was performed. The primary endpoint was clearance of active lichen sclerosus. Secondary endpoints were time to optimal response, reduction of sclerosis, and duration of remission.

- **Results**: The primary endpoint (clearance of active lichen sclerosus) was reached by 43% of patients at 24 weeks of treatment. Partial resolution was reached in 34% of patients. Maximal effects occurred between week 10 and 24 of therapy. Treatment led to a significant reduction of the total lesional area (P < 0.01) and a significant decline in the total symptom score (P < 0.005). Symptoms (e.g. itching) and findings (erythema, erosions, and induration) showed significant improvement. No serious adverse events were observed. There were three (9%) recurrences during the follow-up period.

Conclusions: Topical tacrolimus ointment demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of lichen sclerosus, offering a potential alternative to corticosteroids.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: An update [^114T64e9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Systemic retinoids have been used in the past with considerable success in severe vulvar LS, but in women of childbearing age, the teratogenic risk limits their use.

Surgery should be limited to patients with associated malignancy or to patients who need correction of functionally restricting, scarring processes.

Phototherapy and PDT are possible third-line therapies in cases resistant to the aforementioned treatments.

Genital LS is associated with scarring and an increased risk for vulvar and penile SCC. Long-term follow-up and ongoing suppressive treatment are mandatory.

Regarding medical management for lichen sclerosus, specifically concerning agents with no evidence of benefit, the EADV 2015 guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to support the use of the following topical treatments in patients with LS:

- **Topical vitamin E**: This includes its use in vulvar LS.
- **Human fibroblast lysate cream**: Current research does not support its effectiveness.
- **Topical TRPM8 agonist icilin**: There is no evidence proving its benefit.

These guidelines encourage clinicians to consider the lack of evidence for these treatments in their practice.

### Comparison of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls: A systematic literature review of epidemiology, symptoms, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis [^115xpGDW]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Genetic background and risk factors**: Several factors suggest that LS is an autoimmune disease with a genetic predisposition. In 11–12% of LS cases, a positive family history was reported, supporting a genetic component. Most genetic studies have been conducted in adults, though several case-control studies found HLA-DQ7 (HLA-DQ-B1*301/04/09/10) in 50–66% of prepubertal girls with LS compared with 25–31% in controls. Furthermore, LS is frequently seen in patients with Turner syndrome, with a prevalence of 17.3%. In boys, the molecular evidence of specific gene expression patterns was found in congenital phimosis associated with LS, which is comparable with the existing literature on adult LS.

The association between LS and autoimmune disease is well-established in women but less so in men. In girls, the most common concomitant autoimmune diseases reported are vitiligo, thyroid disease, localized scleroderma, alopecia areata, and rheumatic diseases. One case series on three girls suggested a possible association with celiac disease. Intriguingly, HLA-DRB113 is more prevalent in LS patients without autoimmune disease compared with LS patients with autoimmune disease, suggesting a protective role of HLA-DRB113 against autoimmune diseases in the presence of LS. Baldo et al. detected circulating basement membrane zone protein antibodies in girls with LS. Other factors associated with LS in children include a history of urinary tract symptoms and urinary incontinence in girls, atopic constitution in both girls and boys, and obesity in boys.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^115pd4Py]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The etiology of lichen sclerosus (LS) has not yet been adequately explained, but there is increasing evidence that autoimmune mechanisms play a pathogenetic role. There appears to be a genetic susceptibility to LS. The chronic irritant effects of urinary contact are suggested to be provocative. No infectious agent has been consistently linked to LS.

- **Autoimmunity**: In common with many autoimmune diseases, LS is more prevalent in female patients. A large study of 350 women with LS revealed that 21.5% had one or more autoimmune-related diseases, 21% had a family history of autoimmune disease, and 42% had autoimmune antibodies. The most common autoimmune diseases in this group were autoimmune thyroiditis (12%), alopecia areata (9%), vitiligo (6%), and pernicious anemia (2%). These disorders should be considered in patients with LS. In an LS cohort of 190 women, Cooper et al. found that 28% had one or more associated autoimmune diseases compared with 9% of 230 control patients. Thyroid disease was the most prevalent autoimmune disorder, occurring in 16% of the LS cohort versus 8% of controls. Birenbaum and Young found that the prevalence of thyroid disease in 211 women with biopsy-proven LS was 30%. In comparison, in the general population of Scotland, Leese et al. observed in 2001 an overall prevalence of thyroid dysfunction of 3.8%. Female patients showed a prevalence of 6.4%, and male patients showed a prevalence of 1.1%.

The British Association of Dermatologists 2018 guidelines focus on follow-up and surveillance for lichen sclerosus, particularly concerning indications for referral to gynecology. These guidelines recommend considering a referral for all female patients with lichen sclerosus to a specialist vulvar clinic in cases of:

- **Nonresponse to topical corticosteroids**: Patients who do not respond to the use of topical corticosteroids may require specialist evaluation.
- **Considering surgical management**: Referral should also be considered for patients contemplating surgical management options.

### Nonsclerotic lichen sclerosus: Definition of a concept and pathologic description [^112Pgi4N]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Low credibility.

In summary, critical appraisal of studies in children and adults does not support a reliable link between dermal features and disease duration or activity. Determining the duration of the disease in a clinical setting is challenging due to issues such as non-help-seeking behavior, delays in diagnosis, and the variable presence, nature, and onset of symptoms. The term "early LS" is vague and subject to different interpretations, which can cause confusion for clinicians and patients. Replacing this term by categorizing cases into one of four pattern groups may alleviate these problems and encourage thoughtful clinicopathologic correlation.

- **Categorization of NSLS**: The varied appearances of NSLS may be grouped into four categories according to epithelial thickness and dermal collagen characteristics. Each pattern has its own histopathologic differential diagnosis; however, there is insufficient evidence to correlate these with clinical appearance, disease duration, or neoplastic risk.

- **Lichenoid dermatitis**: This is the most common pattern and displays an atrophic to mildly acanthotic epithelium, basal layer degeneration, lymphocytosis, an upper dermal band-like lymphocytic infiltrate, and normal collagen appearance (Figure 1). The infiltrate varies from scant to dense. There are no features specific to classic LP or the border of erosive LP, such as wedge-shaped hypergranulosis or spiky rete ridges. Likewise, cases lack the erosion and absent rete ridges often seen with regenerative or degenerative erosive LP. In addition to LP, the differential diagnosis for lichenoid dermatitis includes graft versus host disease.

### Does longer duration of corticosteroid treatment improve clearance in vulvar lichen sclerosus? Results from a single centre, comparative, open label study [^116AyTAc]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: The ideal treatment for vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) should aim at inducing relief of symptoms, reversing signs, and preventing further anatomical changes. Adherence to long-term treatment has also been shown to prevent progression towards cancer. Based on the immunological pathophysiology of VLS, high-potency topical corticosteroids represent the first-line treatment in the active phase of the disease. Consistent with this, there is strong evidence that potent and ultra-potent corticosteroids have an excellent effect on both symptom control and, albeit to a lesser extent, on the reversal of clinical signs. This evidence is largely based on trials of 12-week duration, which is the conventional duration for trials assessing the effectiveness of topical treatments during the active phase of the disease.

	- Despite significant improvement in symptoms and signs, a recent retrospective study highlighted that a complete cure of VLS occurs in a minority of patients treated with 12-week therapies. This implies that at treatment completion, most patients may still have substantial residual disease, potentially impacting their well-being and quality of life negatively. Therefore, one might wonder if treatment courses longer than the conventional duration may provide therapeutic advantages and increase the likelihood of complete clearance.

	- This study specifically assessed the effectiveness and tolerability of a 24-week treatment with a potent corticosteroid. A comparison was also made with the treatment outcomes achieved with a standard 12-week duration.

Regarding the medical management of lichen sclerosus, specifically concerning the management of co-occurring infections, the EADV 2017 guidelines recommend considering the administration of a combination of corticosteroids with antibiotics and antifungals. This combination may include agents such as gentamicin or fusidic acid, and nystatin or azole antifungals, or an alternative preparation. These should be administered for a short period to treat secondary infections in patients with vulvar LS.

### Comparison of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls: A systematic literature review of epidemiology, symptoms, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis [^116AEm9p]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

A total of 1780 articles were retrieved. After screening based on titles and abstracts, full texts of 300 publications were read. Eighty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria. The references in these articles were checked for relevant studies, yielding one additional publication, resulting in 90 included publications (Figure 1). Included articles were categorized into the following categories based on the focus of content: epidemiology, clinical presentation, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis.

- **Figure 1**: Flowchart of inclusions and exclusions in the systematic review of pediatric lichen sclerosus.

- **Table 1**: Systematic review of the literature - comparison in outcome measures between boys and girls with lichen sclerosus.

- **Epidemiology**: Data on the epidemiology of pediatric lichen sclerosus (LS) are limited. The true prevalence is difficult to estimate considering that many patients are asymptomatic, unaware, misdiagnosed, or hesitant to report their condition. The incidence of pediatric LS (0–20 years old) in the general population is estimated at 0.04–0.06% compared with 0.1–0.6% in adults. In adulthood, the incidence ratio for LS in women relative to men is higher (from 6:1 to 10:1); in children, the female-to-male ratio is 1:1.7.

The estimated prevalence of LS in girls aged 2–16 years is 1:900, with a mean age of onset of 6.6 years. Girls aged 0–19 years comprise 4.1% of females with LS. In boys aged 0–14 years, the incidence is estimated at 1:200, with most cases found in 9–11 years old, with a mean age at onset of 8.6 years.

### Influence of treatments on prognosis for vulvar lichen sclerosus: Facts and controversies [^112Zm9PF]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is an inflammatory dermatosis with a predilection for the anogenital skin. Vulvar LS can be a debilitating disease, causing pruritus and pain, and it carries the potential for atrophy, scarring, and significant functional impairment. Recently, many advances have been made regarding the etiology and natural history of the disease process; however, much debate still exists regarding the most advantageous medical and surgical management of this disorder.

In an effort to provide a comprehensive review of vulvar LS literature, the following three controversies will be discussed:

- **Optimal disease treatment**: Ultra-potent topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are the first-line treatment for vulvar LS, while topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) remain second-line agents for patients for whom TCS treatment resulted in incomplete resolution of symptoms or adverse events. Due to the relapsing nature of the disease, long-term maintenance therapy is often required.

- **Theories behind LS's oncogenicity and treatments for minimizing malignancy**: Recent advances have contributed to the understanding of the association between LS and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). While the exact mechanism responsible for LS-associated SCC is not known, immune dysregulation and inflammation may play an important role. Therefore, successful treatment of LS should be directed towards alleviation of symptoms and reversal of the underlying histopathologic changes.

- **The value of surgical treatment for LS**: Patients with LS-associated malignancy need careful evaluation to determine the necessity and extent of surgical intervention.

### Childhood onset vulvar lichen sclerosus does not resolve at puberty: A prospective case series [^111tj2kN]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

When vulvar lichen sclerosus occurs in prepubertal children, it is widely believed that it is likely to remit at puberty. However, when it occurs in adult women, it is accepted that remission is unlikely and that untreated or inadequately treated disease may lead to significant disturbance of vulvar architecture and, less commonly, squamous cell carcinoma. Our database reveals 18 girls who developed lichen sclerosus prior to puberty and are now adolescents or young adults. Twelve have remained under surveillance, while the other six patients have been lost to follow-up. We report a prospective series of these 12 patients.

Three patients have achieved complete remission sustained for three or more years, all prior to menarche. Nine patients, or 75% of the cohort, who still had active lichen sclerosus at puberty continue to require maintenance therapy after menarche. Of the 12, six have had significant disturbance of vulvar architecture. The concept that prepubertal lichen sclerosus resolves at puberty does not hold true for the majority of patients. Even when diagnosed early and treated effectively, childhood onset lichen sclerosus may lead to distortion of vulvar architecture.

Regarding medical management for lichen sclerosus, particularly with respect to agents lacking evidence for benefit, the EADV 2015 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to support the use of the following systemic treatments in patients with LS:

- **Hydroxycarbamide/hydroxyurea**: No supportive evidence for usage.
- **Cycloferon**: No supportive evidence for usage.
- **Fumarate**: No supportive evidence for usage.
- **Hydroxychloroquine**: No supportive evidence for usage.
- **Potassium para-aminobenzoate**: No supportive evidence for usage.
- **Oral vitamins A, E, and D**: No supportive evidence for usage.

### Nonsclerotic lichen sclerosus: Definition of a concept and pathologic description [^113SzMtJ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Low credibility.

- Nonsclerotic LS refers to a pathologic situation in which there are clinical and microscopic features to suggest LS, but dermal sclerosis is absent.

- Nonsclerotic LS always has a histopathologic differential diagnosis, so it requires clinical correlation to confirm a diagnosis of LS. Nonsclerotic lichenoid reactions may be grouped into one of four categories with a comment if LS is favored.

- If clinical features are consistent with LS and the pathology is nonspecific, the assigned diagnosis remains LS.

- When the pathologist includes NSLS in the differential diagnosis but clinical features are not specific, the diagnosis remains unclear. In cases with skin abnormality, it is often appropriate to manage with topical corticosteroids, serial photography, and follow-up; the diagnosis may become apparent over time in the context of evolving clinical findings, extragenital or vaginal involvement, and response to treatment.

### An autoimmune phenotype in vulvar lichen sclerosus and lichen planus: a Th1 response and high levels of microRNA-155 [^114hUwuE]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Vulvar lichen sclerosus and lichen planus are T-cell-mediated chronic skin disorders. Although autoimmunity has been suggested, the exact pathogenesis of these disorders is still unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the molecular and immunological mechanisms critical to the pathogenesis of vulvar lichen sclerosus and lichen planus. By using gene expression profiling and real-time RT-PCR experiments, we demonstrated a significantly increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, CXCR3, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCR5, CCL4, and CCL5) specific for a Th1 IFNγ-induced immune response. Additionally, BIC/microRNA-155 (miR-155) — a microRNA involved in the regulation of the immune response — was significantly upregulated in lichen sclerosus and lichen planus (9.5- and 17.7-fold change, respectively). Immunohistochemistry showed a significant T-cell response, with pronounced dermal infiltrates of CD4(+), CD8(+), and FOXP3(+) cells. In conclusion, these data demonstrate an autoimmune phenotype in vulvar lichen sclerosus and lichen planus, characterized by increased levels of Th1-specific cytokines, a dense T-cell infiltrate, and enhanced BIC/miR-155 expression.

### Vulvar lichen sclerosus: Unraveling a clinical conundrum [^113ZmRDs]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Vulvar lichen sclerosus is a chronic, progressive inflammatory dermatosis that predominantly affects postmenopausal women but can also present in premenopausal individuals. It can cause significant scarring, leading to anatomical distortion, urinary dysfunction, and impaired quality of life. The author describes a case of a woman in her late 30s with extensive vulvar involvement of lichen sclerosus, resulting in introital stenosis, dyspareunia, and painful micturition. The patient was managed with a combination of topical steroids and systemic immunosuppressants, followed by surgical intervention using a Singapore flap for vaginal reconstruction. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis, individualized treatment approaches, and long-term follow-up in managing severe vulvar lichen sclerosus.

It is recommended that women with vulvar lichen sclerosus be followed in specialist clinics where difficulty exists with symptom control or where there is clinical evidence of localized skin thickening. Follow-up is also recommended for women who have previously been treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva (arising in lichen sclerosus or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia) or where the pathologist expresses concern and is unable to make a definitive diagnosis of differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^117CLsZP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The etiology of lichen sclerosus (LS) is still unknown. There is evidence supporting an autoimmune etiology in genetically predisposed patients. Patients with LS and their relatives more frequently have autoimmune-related disorders and autoimmune antibodies than controls. Thyroid disease, alopecia areata, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia should be considered in a patient diagnosed with LS. The detection of autoantibodies to extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) and to basement membrane zone (BMZ) components suggests that autoimmunity to these components might contribute to the pathogenesis of LS. However, those antibodies, rather than being causative and involved in the initiation, might be a result of damage to the BMZ and contribute to the progression of the disease. An infectious etiology has been proposed, but could never be definitively confirmed. The role of Borrelia burgdorferi is still unclear. Hormonal influences do not seem to play a major role.

LS may lead to scarring and destruction of the normal genital architecture. In a high proportion of affected women and men, LS causes sexual dysfunction.

The diagnosis of LS is usually clinical. In clinically unclear cases, a histologic examination is required. Although classic histologic findings will confirm the diagnosis, a nonspecific histology does not rule out LS. The clinicopathologic correlation is pivotal. Patients under follow-up will need a biopsy in the case of a persistent area of hyperkeratosis, erosion or erythema, or a warty or nodular lesion, in the case of any area resistant to adequate treatment, in the case of unclear pigmentation, and if a second-line therapy is considered.

### Comparison of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls: A systematic literature review of epidemiology, symptoms, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis [^115njFh1]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Studies concerning pediatric lichen sclerosus are limited, and, at the time of writing, there have been no studies comparing the course of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls. We sought to examine all publications on boys and girls with lichen sclerosus and assess and compare epidemiology, symptoms and signs, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was performed in the Embase, Medline, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria were information on children ages 0–18 years and a clinical or histologic diagnosis of lichen sclerosus. Literature from 1985 to 2021 was reviewed.

- **Results**: A total of 1780 articles were retrieved from the search, of which 90 articles were eligible for inclusion. Boys and girls present similarly on many aspects; nonetheless, treatment and follow-up are approached differently.

- **Conclusions**: Though the clinical approach is often different, lichen sclerosus in boys and girls demonstrates many similarities. More research is needed, especially on follow-up, to gain a better understanding of the course of lichen sclerosus and establish an advanced management plan for children.

### Vulvar lichen sclerosus: Pathophysiology and treatment [^116ZTUXo]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic disorder affecting the skin and mucosal surfaces, most commonly observed on the female genital skin, but it can also affect other areas of the body. Although it can occur at any age, it is more frequently found in elderly women. The exact cause of lichen sclerosus remains unknown. Familial cases suggest a potential genetic link, and an autoimmune connection is also considered a possibility.

Currently, ultra-potent topical corticosteroids are the medical treatment of choice. Other treatments that have been utilized for this condition include testosterone, progesterone, tacrolimus, surgery, and phototherapy. Surgery should be reserved for symptomatic patients who do not respond to multiple medical treatments, as there is a high recurrence rate following surgical intervention.

The risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva approaches 5% in women with vulvar lichen sclerosus, necessitating close surveillance by healthcare providers and patients. This review addresses the history, clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment of lichen sclerosus of the vulva. It also covers pregnancy issues and sexual function in patients with this condition, along with problems specific to children with lichen sclerosus.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus: An update for dermatologists [^113MdKLw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Vulvar lichen sclerosus is an important skin disease that is common in women in their 50s and beyond; however, it can also affect females of any age, including children. If not treated, it has the potential to cause significant and permanent scarring and deformity of the vulvar structure. Additionally, if untreated, it is associated with a 2–6% lifetime risk of malignant squamous neoplasia of the vulva. Lichen sclerosus has been considered a difficult-to-manage condition; however, both serious complications can potentially be prevented with early intervention with topical corticosteroids, suggesting that the course of the disease can be treatment modified.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^113KFEqx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory, mucocutaneous disorder affecting both genital and extragenital skin. It is a debilitating disease, causing symptoms such as itch, pain, dysuria, restriction of micturition, dyspareunia, and significant sexual dysfunction in both women and men. Recent findings increasingly suggest that LS may be an autoimmune-induced disease in genetically predisposed patients, with hormonal factors having a lesser impact. Preceding infections may play a provocative role, although the involvement of Borrelia remains controversial. Trauma and an occlusive moist environment are potential precipitating factors.

Potent and ultrapotent topical corticosteroids continue to be the primary therapeutic treatment. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are considered viable alternatives for patients who have not responded to ultrapotent corticosteroids or have contraindications to their use. Topical and systemic retinoids may be beneficial in selected cases. Phototherapy for extragenital LS and photodynamic therapy for genital LS are possible options for rare cases that have not responded to other treatments. Surgical intervention is typically limited to cases involving scarring that leads to functional impairment. In men, circumcision proves effective in the majority of cases, though recurrences do occur. Additionally, anogenital LS is associated with a heightened risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva or penis.

This review provides an update on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, histopathology, pathogenesis, and management of LS affecting the male and female genitals, as well as extragenital locations.

### Nonsclerotic lichen sclerosus: Definition of a concept and pathologic description [^116pP1MZ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Low credibility.

Most cases of lichen sclerosus (LS) have characteristic clinical features, making biopsy unnecessary for diagnosis. When LS is evident on examination, clinicians may choose to perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis before starting long-term treatment and suppression. Less commonly, examination results may yield a differential diagnosis that includes LS and other dermatoses, prompting clinicians to conduct a biopsy for diagnostic clarification. In either circumstance, a nondiagnostic biopsy result may create doubt among patients and healthcare practitioners regarding the LS diagnosis and the necessity for treatment and follow-up. This uncertainty then shifts the diagnostic process back to clinician judgment and the observation of patient progress over time.

The histopathologic diagnosis of LS is generally straightforward, involving a lichenoid tissue reaction combined with stromal sclerosis. The lichenoid tissue reaction is one of six major dermatopathologic reaction patterns, characterized by a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate accompanied by basal layer degeneration. Sclerosis refers to fine cross-linked collagen fibers forming a pink "ground glass" appearance in the upper dermis. In contrast, fibrosis involves the replacement of thin collagen fibers with thicker ones. The term "lichenoid dermatitis" provides a working diagnosis for clinical presentations suggestive of LS and/or lichen planus (LP) when histopathology shows a lichenoid tissue reaction lacking specific features of LS or LP.

### Treatment algorithm for the comprehensive management of severe lichen sclerosus in boys based on the pathophysiology of the disease [^1133ySdP]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). High credibility.

It is estimated that approximately one out of 200 boys has the diagnosis of lichen sclerosus (LS), previously referred to as BXO (balanitis xerotica obliterans). Severe progressive disease is rare; however, mismanagement of urethral tissues may contribute to the progression of LS.

- **Study design**: The literature regarding the management of severe lichen sclerosus was reviewed alongside our management of seven patients with ages ranging from six to ten years, all of whom had severe lichen sclerosus requiring surgical intervention. These patients were identified from a busy pediatric practice that saw 5,507 patients during the four-year span. Based on the pathophysiology of lichen sclerosus, urethral anatomy, and our management, an algorithm was developed for medical and surgical management.

- **Results**: All patients received initial medical treatment with topical steroids. Three patients underwent urethral mobilization and serial biopsy. One of these patients, with severe disease, required a second distal urethral mobilization. Three patients were treated with circumcision, and one is responding well to topical steroids after complex reconstruction. None developed postoperative urethral disease.

- **Discussion**: Lichen sclerosus affects squamous epithelium but can extend to unaffected tissue if traumatized via the Koebner phenomenon. There are no randomized control trials for the management of the disease. Thus, appropriate early management with the avoidance of urethral dilation or incision may prevent extension down the urethra, which can lead to severe stricture disease.

### Vulval lichen sclerosus and lichen planus [^111pgfHC]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) and lichen planus (LP) are both immunologically mediated diseases with a preference for the genitalia. The basic principles of management for vulval LS and vulvovaginal LP are the same: explaining the disease, emphasizing the chronic nature of the condition, and outlining treatment options.

The main difference between the two conditions is that LP has a propensity to involve the mucous membranes, including the mouth and vagina, which are rarely affected in LS. First-line treatment for LS is a super-potent topical corticosteroid ointment, which has a high response rate. Erosive vulvovaginal LP is more challenging to treat. Second-line therapies include topical calcineurin inhibitors and systemic agents. There is limited evidence for systemic treatments for both conditions.

The risk of vulval squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is increased in both LP and LS, and it is not known how treatment affects this risk. We recommend teaching self-examination and longitudinal evaluation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^113DdK1Y]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory, mucocutaneous disorder affecting both genital and extragenital skin. This debilitating disease causes itch, pain, dysuria, restriction of micturition, dyspareunia, and significant sexual dysfunction in both women and men. Recent findings increasingly suggest an autoimmune origin in genetically predisposed individuals, moving away from a significant hormonal influence. Preceding infections may play a provocative role, although the involvement of Borrelia remains controversial. Trauma and occlusive moist environments may act as precipitating factors.

Potent and ultrapotent topical corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are considered as alternatives for patients who fail to respond to or cannot tolerate corticosteroids. Topical and systemic retinoids may be beneficial in selected cases. Phototherapy for extragenital LS and photodynamic therapy for genital LS are potential options in rare cases unresponsive to standard treatment. Surgical intervention is generally limited to addressing scarring that results in functional impairment. In men, circumcision is effective for most cases, though recurrences are documented.

Anogenital LS is associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva or penis. This review provides an update on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, histopathology, pathogenesis, and management of LS affecting both male and female genitalia as well as extragenital skin.

### Genomic profiling of vulvar lichen sclerosus patients shows possible pathogenetic disease mechanisms [^111yBfr6]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS) is known to occur in families, suggesting a genetic link. Genomic profiling of patients with vulvar LS was investigated to uncover underlying pathogenetic mechanisms, with the hope that targeted therapies and further clinical research will emerge.

- **Methods**: Two unrelated families with vulvar LS were investigated using whole-exome sequencing. Five affected sisters from one family were compared with their unaffected paternal aunt (unaffected control). A mother-daughter pair from a second affected family was compared with the first family. The results of the sequencing were compared with population-specific allele frequency databases to prioritize potential variants contributing to vulvar LS development.

- **Results**: Germ-line variants in four genes were identified as likely to be deleterious to proper protein function in all of the seven affected patients, but not in the unaffected control. The genes with variants included CD177 (neutrophil activation), CD200 (inhibitory signal to macrophages), ANKRD18A (ankyrin repeat protein, epigenetic regulation), and LATS2 (co-repressor of androgen signaling).

- **Conclusions**: Although many providers may see a mother and daughter with vulvar LS, this condition is rarely seen in multiple family members who are available for genetic testing. This report is the first to detail genomic profiling related to a familial association of vulvar LS.

### Population-level retrospective study associating lichen sclerosus with autoimmune dermatologic and rheumatologic conditions [^116rEZ21]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis that commonly involves the anogenital region in women and is speculated to have an autoimmune pathogenesis. Previous studies have reported an association with human leukocyte antigen constellations, and LS has been linked to several other autoimmune diseases, including thyroid disease, morphea, psoriasis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. Herein, we performed a population-level retrospective study to evaluate the association between LS and other autoimmune conditions.

We retrospectively identified our cohort using TriNetX, a global health research network. Within TriNetX, the United States Collaborative Network incorporates data from 60 health care organizations with over 104 million patients. Data were extracted in December 2023. International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) code L90.0, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, was used to identify cases. Although ICD-10 codes cannot differentiate between genital and extragenital LS, LS most frequently affects the vulva. Therefore, ICD-10 code N95, postmenopausal atrophic vaginitis, was used to identify the control cohort, as this is a common vulvar diagnosis without a known autoimmune disease association. Diagnoses prior to the use of ICD-10 codes were mapped using General Equivalence Mappings. Only female patients were included. Patients with a diagnosis of LS were excluded from the control cohort. Cohorts were matched by age and race/ethnicity, resulting in a 1:1 propensity score.
