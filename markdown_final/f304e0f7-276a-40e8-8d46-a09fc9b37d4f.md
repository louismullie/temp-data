## Question

Dull aching leg pain that hurts when walking around and stretching out

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a patient with dull, aching leg pain provoked by walking and stretching. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the pain's quality, location, and mechanical triggers guide the differential. Then, I should distinguish musculoskeletal versus vascular versus neurogenic etiologies using guideline-backed patterns. Next, I will review red flags that would alter urgency. After that, I will prioritize the most likely diagnoses and outline the key diagnostic tests to confirm them. Finally, I will translate this into a practical management plan and explicitly self-check each inference against the cited sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical signal embedded in the symptom description. A dull, aching leg pain that is provoked by walking and by stretching is mechanistic and strongly implicates load-dependent structures such as muscle-tendon units, periarticular tissues, and possibly neurovascular structures under tension, which immediately shifts my pretest probabilities toward musculoskeletal or fatigue-related etiologies rather than constant, stimulus-independent neuropathic pain, though I should not jump to conclusions before mapping location and timing precisely [^112NYuad] [^117Wi1DD].

> Wait, let me verify the differential that fits exertional, stretching-provoked dull aching. The leading contenders include intermittent claudication from PAD, venous claudication, chronic exertional compartment syndrome, muscle strain or DOMS, hip or knee osteoarthritis, meralgia paresthetica, and lumbosacral radicular or referred pain, with neurogenic claudication also on the table depending on posture effects; distinguishing among these relies on location, temporal pattern, positional modulation, and vascular versus neurogenic signs on exam [^115joPzm] [^115joPzm] [^111wjTRA] [^112xh1aP].

> I will now examine vascular etiologies, but hold on, I should verify that classic features are present before labeling claudication. Typical PAD claudication is aching, cramping, or fatigue in the calf, thigh, or buttock that is consistently induced by walking and consistently relieved within about 10 minutes of rest; relief is not positional and stretching alone would not be expected to relieve it, though symptoms can occur with uphill walking due to higher oxygen demand [^114yzqED] [^113ED3xo]. Let me double-check that atypical vascular patterns are less likely here: venous claudication often involves a tight, bursting calf pain that resolves slowly and is improved by elevation, which does not match a purely dull ache, and chronic compartment syndrome tends to require sustained high-intensity exertion and has delayed relief with rest, which likewise doesn't align with quick-onset pain from simple stretching [^115RyK6S] [^1149ZxQM].

> Next, I should review neurogenic etiologies. Lumbar radicular pain is typically sharp, shooting, or lancinating, often below the knee in a dermatomal pattern, and worsened by spinal flexion or root tension maneuvers; paresthesias and objective neurologic deficits are more common than with purely somatic referred pain, which is dull and deep and often stays above the knee, though overlap exists and requires careful examination [^112P9eXD] [^111wjTRA]. Hold on, I should verify the distinction with neurogenic claudication: spinal stenosis–related leg symptoms are classically provoked by upright walking or standing and relieved by forward flexion or sitting, and while the pain can be aching, the posture dependence is the key discriminator here, so I need to ask specifically about relief with lumbar flexion and prolonged standing intolerance [^114dZwgq].

> Let me consider peripheral nerve entrapments that can mimic radicular pain. Meralgia paresthetica from lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment causes burning, numbness, or dysesthesia over the anterolateral thigh and can be provoked by prolonged standing, walking, or hip hyperextension; stretching and tight clothing or belts can exacerbate it, and the diagnosis is primarily clinical with ultrasound useful for confirmation and guiding interventions [^112xh1aP] [^1111YikT]. I should confirm there is no focal neurologic deficit suggesting a radiculopathy, as meralgia is purely sensory [^112xh1aP].

> Turning to musculoskeletal causes, I need to check whether this pattern fits DOMS or a muscle strain. DOMS produces a dull, aching pain with tenderness and stiffness, peaking 24–72 hours after unaccustomed eccentric exercise and provoked by stretch or contraction, resolving within a week; in contrast, fatigue-induced muscle disorder from overuse presents as an aching, firm area with pain on both passive and active stretch and can persist if activity continues, risking structural injury [^112NYuad] [^115eLbMx]. But wait, what if this is a specific strain such as a hamstring injury; a hamstring strain will show focal pain, reproduction with stretch and activation, and deficits on the active knee extension test, with grading by pain and AKE angle loss that can guide prognosis and rehab intensity [^115jySbs].

> I should also consider joint-related sources. Hip osteoarthritis often causes deep, aching lateral hip or thigh pain worsened by weight-bearing and not quickly relieved, with morning stiffness under 30 minutes; knee osteoarthritis typically has activity-related deep pain and crepitus with weight-bearing provocation; patellofemoral pain is aggravated by loaded knee flexion and stairs and often reflects hip or quadriceps performance deficits that respond to targeted strengthening and movement retraining [^112NQBNU] [^112gsF2v]. Hold on, let me verify the relevance of stretching: in knee OA, stretching tight hip flexors such as the rectus femoris can improve ROM and gait parameters, which indirectly reduces pain with walking, aligning with a mechanism where stretch-provoked pain reflects tight periarticular structures and altered biomechanics [^116Ti7Gp].

> Now, I need to ensure I screen for red flags and vascular clues that would change urgency. I should palpate pulses and inspect for asymmetric hair loss, nail changes, or dependent rubor to screen for PAD; if pulses are diminished or asymmetric, ABI is indicated to confirm or exclude flow-limiting disease and to triage risk modification and supervised exercise therapy if PAD is present [^1178fa2z]. If there are focal neurologic deficits, saddle anesthesia, or bowel/bladder changes, I should expedite spine imaging; likewise, severe, out-of-proportion pain with passive stretch raises concern for compartment syndrome and warrants urgent evaluation, even in the absence of classic late findings [^115q2evU].

> Based on the provided vignette, the most likely diagnosis is delayed onset muscle soreness or a low-grade fatigue-induced muscle disorder given the dull ache, provocation by both walking and stretching, and absence of positional relief or classic vascular or radicular features; the second most likely consideration is meralgia paresthetica if the pain localizes to the anterolateral thigh and is worsened by hip extension or tight garments, followed by hip or knee osteoarthritis if the pain is load-dependent and not quickly relieved by rest, and finally lumbar radicular pain or neurogenic claudication if dermatomal features, paresthesias, or posture-dependent relief emerge on further questioning and exam [^112NYuad] [^112xh1aP] [^112NQBNU] [^114dZwgq].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup. Let me first confirm the basics: detailed pain mapping by location and radiation, temporal pattern relative to activity and rest, and aggravating factors such as hills, stairs, and footwear; a focused neurovascular exam including pulse palpation, capillary refill, sensory testing, myotomal strength, reflexes, and straight leg raise or slump to assess root tension; and selective provocative maneuvers such as Ober's for IT band tightness, FABER or Gaenslen for SIJ pain, and active knee extension for hamstring involvement [^114C2Gn7] [^116s653f] [^111L8CGt] [^115jySbs]. If PAD is suspected from exam, ABI is first-line; if radicular or stenosis patterns are suspected, MRI is reasonable; if meralgia is suspected, ultrasound can visualize nerve entrapment and guide injection; if compartment syndrome is suspected, compartment pressure testing may be needed when the exam is unreliable [^1178fa2z] [^112xh1aP] [^115q2evU].

> I should double-check that management aligns with the most likely diagnosis. For DOMS or fatigue-induced muscle pain, relative rest, gentle active range of motion, and graded loading after symptom resolution are appropriate, with education to ramp eccentric demands gradually; NSAIDs can be used short term for symptom relief, and warm-up before activity may mitigate recurrence, though stretching alone has mixed preventive effects and should be individualized [^112NYuad] [^115DyjFx]. For suspected meralgia, weight optimization, removal of compressive belts, and ultrasound-guided local steroid injection can be effective; for hip or knee OA, a combination of therapeutic exercise, manual therapy, and weight management is foundational, with rectus femoris stretching improving ROM and gait in knee OA; for patellofemoral pain, hip and quadriceps strengthening plus movement retraining are high-yield; and for suspected PAD, supervised walking therapy improves pain-free and maximal walking distance and quality of life even when ABI does not change, and should be prioritized alongside risk factor modification [^112xh1aP] [^112NQBNU] [^116Ti7Gp] [^112gsF2v] [^113ED3xo] [^1156Fmcq].

> But wait, what if the pain fails to follow expected trajectories or new neurologic features appear. In that case, I should reconsider radicular pain and neurogenic claudication, revisit the spine with targeted imaging, and assess for peripheral neuropathy or alternative vascular mimics such as popliteal artery entrapment in athletes, ensuring that my evolving hypotheses are stress-tested against the patient's actual symptom pattern and exam evolution over time [^1149ZxQM] [^114JmSb9].

Dull, aching leg pain that worsens with walking and stretching most commonly reflects **muscle strain or overuse** (DOMS, fatigue-induced muscle disorder) [^112NYuad], **peripheral artery disease (PAD)** [^114yzqED], or **lumbar spinal stenosis** [^114dZwgq]. Key features include: **reproducible pain with activity** and relief with rest (PAD) [^114yzqED]; stiffness or soreness after exercise (DOMS) [^112NYuad]; or neurogenic claudication with relief on flexion (stenosis) [^114dZwgq]. Red flags (weakness, numbness, rest pain, or systemic symptoms) require **urgent evaluation** [^1178fa2z]. Diagnosis is guided by history, exam, and ABI [^1178fa2z]; management includes activity modification, stretching, strengthening, and medical therapy tailored to the cause [^111t91W6] [^116kC6fJ].

## Common causes of dull aching leg pain with walking and stretching

### Musculoskeletal conditions

- **Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)**: Dull, aching pain 24–72 hours after unaccustomed eccentric exercise; worsens with stretching/activity, resolves in ~7 days [^112NYuad] [^115eLbMx].

- **Fatigue-induced muscle disorder**: Persistent dull ache from overuse; may progress to structural injury if untreated [^112NYuad].

- **Muscle strain**: Partial tears causing localized pain worsened by stretch/contraction; may have bruising or weakness [^115jySbs].

- **Compartment syndrome**: Tight, bursting calf pain after exercise; resolves slowly with rest [^115joPzm].

---

### Vascular conditions

- **Peripheral artery disease (PAD)**: Reproducible calf pain with walking, relieved within 10 minutes of rest; may include weakness, numbness, or fatigue [^114yzqED] [^113ED3xo].

- **Venous insufficiency**: Aching, heaviness, and swelling relieved by elevation; often bilateral [^115RyK6S].

---

### Neurological conditions

- **Lumbar spinal stenosis**: Neurogenic claudication with buttock/leg pain relieved by flexion; may include numbness or weakness [^114dZwgq].

- **Radiculopathy**: Sharp, radiating leg pain from nerve root compression; worsens with spine movement [^1149ZxQM].

## Clinical features distinguishing musculoskeletal, vascular, and neurological causes

| **Feature** | **Musculoskeletal** | **Vascular (pad)** | **Neurological (stenosis)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Pain quality | Dull, aching | Cramping, aching | Burning, radiating |
| Onset | After exercise | Reproducible with walking | Walking or standing |
| Relief | Rest, stretching | Rest (< 10 min) | Flexion, sitting |
| Associated symptoms | Stiffness, tenderness | Weakness, numbness | Numbness, weakness |
| Physical findings | Localized tenderness, reduced ROM | Diminished pulses, bruits | Positive straight leg raise, reflex changes |

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

- **Weakness or numbness**: Suggests nerve compression or ischemia [^114C2Gn7].

- **Rest pain or night pain**: Indicates severe ischemia or malignancy [^116GFsKr].

- **Rapidly progressive swelling**: Suspect DVT or compartment syndrome [^notfound].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, weight loss, or malaise suggest infection or malignancy [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### History and physical examination

Assess pain location, quality, onset, duration, aggravating/relieving factors, and associated symptoms. The physical exam should include inspection, palpation, ROM, neurovascular assessment, and specific tests (straight leg raise, slump, femoral stretch) [^115kHRSD].

---

### Diagnostic tests

- **Ankle-brachial index (ABI)**: Screens for PAD [^115RdKFQ].

- **Duplex ultrasound**: Evaluates venous insufficiency or DVT [^notfound].

- **MRI or CT**: Assesses spinal stenosis or radiculopathy [^112s91MC].

- **EMG**: Differentiates neurogenic from musculoskeletal pain [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Musculoskeletal pain

Management includes relative rest with gradual return, targeted stretching and strengthening, and NSAIDs or acetaminophen for analgesia. Physical therapy provides structured rehabilitation [^116kC6fJ].

---

### Vascular pain

Management emphasizes supervised walking therapy, risk factor modification (smoking, diabetes, hypertension, lipids), and pharmacotherapy such as cilostazol or pentoxifylline; revascularization is considered for severe disease [^1156Fmcq] [^111t91W6] [^114jnDpk] [^113ED3xo].

---

### Neurological pain

Management includes physical therapy with flexion-based exercises, epidural steroid injections for stenosis, and surgical decompression for refractory cases [^1174L2qy].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive measures include regular, progressive exercise with warm-up and cool-down, flexibility and strength training, and weight management. Address modifiable vascular risk factors and use ergonomic adjustments to reduce repetitive strain.

---

Dull, aching leg pain with walking and stretching is most often musculoskeletal, vascular, or neurological; a **focused history, exam, and targeted tests** guide diagnosis, and management should be tailored to the cause while watching for red flags that require urgent care [^1149ZxQM].

Fatigue-induced muscle disorder and delayed onset muscle soreness

Muscle fatigue has been shown to predispose to injury. One study has demonstrated that in the hind leg of the rabbit fatigued muscles absorb less energy in the early stages of stretch when compared with non-fatigued muscle. Fatigued muscle also demonstrates increased stiffness, which has been shown to predispose to subsequent injury (Wilson AJ and Myers PT, unpublished data, 2005). The importance of warm up prior to activity and of maintaining flexibility was emphasised since a decrease in muscle stiffness is seen with warming up. A study by Witvrouw et al found that athletes with an increased tightness of the hamstring or quadriceps muscles have a statistically higher risk for a subsequent musculoskeletal lesion.

Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) has to be differentiated from fatigue-induced muscle injury.DOMS occurs several hours after unaccustomed deceleration movements while the muscle is stretched by external forces (eccentric contractions), whereas fatigue-induced muscle disorder can also occur during athletic activity. DOMS causes its characteristic acute inflammatory pain (due to local release of inflammatory mediators and secondary biochemical cascade activation) with stiff and weak muscles and pain at rest and resolves spontaneously usually within a week. In contrast, fatigue-induced muscle disorder leads to aching, circumscribed firmness, dull ache to stabbing pain and increases with continued activity. It can — if unrecognised and untreated — persist over a longer time and may cause structural injuries such as partial tears. However, in accordance with Opar et al it has to be stated, that it remains an area for future research to definitely describe this muscle disorder and other risk factors for muscle injuries.

Intermittent claudication (IC) differential diagnosis — Table I lists conditions with distinguishing location, pain characteristics, and responses to exercise, rest, and position. Calf IC involves calf muscles with a prevalence of 3% of adult population, presenting with cramping, aching discomfort of reproducible onset on exercise, quickly relieved at rest, with no positional effect and possible atypical limb symptoms on exercise. Nerve root compression radiates down the leg, causes sharp lancinating pain induced by sitting, standing, or walking, is often present at rest, and is improved by change in position. Venous claudication affects the entire leg (worse in calf), produces tight, bursting pain after walking that subsides slowly, with relief speeded by elevation and a history of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis or venous congestion/edema. Foot/ankle arthritis causes aching pain after a variable degree of exercise, is not quickly relieved, and may be relieved by not bearing weight, with symptoms that may relate to activity level and be present at rest.

Symptomatology

The etiologies contributing to CPIP are varied and complex in nature. Consequently, the symptomatology of CPIP is just as complex and variable and is dependent upon the type(s) of pain that the patient is suffering from: neuropathic pain, non-neuropathic pain, somatic pain, and/or visceral pain. Patients with neuropathic pain may describe having pain (neuralgia), reduced sensation (hypoesthesia), increased sensation (hyperesthesia), or a burning sensation (paresthesia). Occasionally, patients with neuropathic pain will report pain to a non-painful stimulus (allodynia) or increased pain response to a painful stimulus (hyperalgesia). Stabbing, burning, pulling, throbbing, shooting, prickling, and sharp are descriptors that are commonly used by patients suffering from neuropathic pain. These symptoms can be constant or intermittent. Pain can be localized or radiating in nature, with common sites of radiating pain being to the scrotum, labium, and/or upper thigh. Occasionally, a "trigger point" will exist and when palpated will cause the patient to experience the neuropathic pain symptoms. Neuropathic pain symptoms typically worsen with ambulation, twisting, or stretching of the upper body, stooping or sitting, hyperextension of the hip, or sexual intercourse and are made better with lying down or flexion of the hip and thigh.

Non-neuropathic pain in CPIP is typically described as a dull ache, typically constant, usually over the entirety of the groin area, with no specific trigger point or radiating component. Words typically used to describe this type of pain include: gnawing, tender, pounding, or pulling. Somatic pain, as discussed previously, is usually localized to the pubic tubercle area as the area of maximum tenderness. Visceral pain in CPIP is generally related to sexual dysfunction or ejaculatory pain in the region of the superficial ring or the testicular/labial region. According to a study performed by Loos et al, patients with CPIP visceral pain symptoms describe them as aching, without a specific trigger point. Those with a history of anterior approach who have visceral pain have a spermatic cord that is diffusely tender to palpation.

### Meralgia paresthetica after strenuous exercise [^1111YikT]. Muscle & Nerve (2005). Low credibility.

We present three patients with signs and symptoms of meralgia paresthetica (MP) after long-distance walking and cycling. No other possible causes of MP, such as trauma or exogenous compression, were present. A neuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was confirmed in all patients with somatosensory evoked potentials. We propose that conduction block due to local ischemia during repetitive muscle stretching was the probable cause for the neuropathy.

3.2.1.1. Somatic-referred pain

Somatic-referred pain is caused by noxious stimulation of nerve endings in somatic structures but is perceived in regions innervated by nerves other than those innervating the site of noxious stimulation. Somatic referred pain may originate from discs, facet joints, and muscles, as per previous definition. We have further added tendons, ligaments, fascia, and bones as potential sources of somatic-referred pain in the context of spine-related leg pain. Indeed, these structures are nociceptively innervated, and can produce referral patterns into the lower limb. The pain may be perceived as dull, aching, gnawing, or pressure. We have also clarified that although somatic referred pain mostly presents in the gluteal and thigh area, it may occasionally refer to the lower leg but rarely to the foot. We have further clarified that somatic referred pain is usually perceived as deep but rarely cutaneous. Importantly, somatic referred pain needs to be distinguished from visceral referred pain, which may also refer to the limbs and particularly to the gluteal or groin areas in the lower limbs. In this case, a thorough clinical history will be important to understanding the nature of the focal and referred pain.

### Pramipexole dihydrochloride (Mirapex) [^11541n5E]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Parkinson's Disease

Mirapex® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets are indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

The effectiveness of MIRAPEX tablets was demonstrated in randomized, controlled trials in patients with early Parkinson's disease who were not receiving concomitant levodopa therapy as well as in patients with advanced disease on concomitant levodopa (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

Restless Legs Syndrome

MIRAPEX tablets are indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).

Key diagnostic criteria for RLS are: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant leg sensations; symptoms begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting; symptoms are partially or totally relieved by movement such as walking or stretching at least as long as the activity continues; and symptoms are worse or occur only in the evening or night. Difficulty falling asleep may frequently be associated with symptoms of RLS.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^111wjTRA]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Features of somatic and radicular pain — somatic or referred pain versus radicular pain are contrasted across causes, symptoms, mechanical modification, radiation, and signs. Segment causes for somatic or referred pain include posterior elements such as "Posterior segment or element", "Facet joint pain", "Sacroiliac joint pain", "Myofascial syndrome", and "Internal disc disruption", whereas radicular pain lists "Anterior segment", "Disc herniation", "Annular tear, discogenic pain", and "Spinal stenosis". Symptoms differ with somatic described as "Dull, aching, deep" and "Like an expanding pressure", while radicular is "Sharp, shooting, superficial, lancinating" and "Like an electric shock". Somatic pain is "Poorly localized", "Covers a wide area", with "Back worse than leg", "No paresthesia", and "No radicular or shooting pain", whereas radicular pain is "Well localized", "Leg worse than back", has "Paresthesia present", is "Well defined", with "Radicular distribution". Mechanical modification shows somatic "Worse with extension" and "Better with flexion" with "No radicular pattern", while radicular is "Worse with flexion" and "Better with extension" with "Radicular pattern". Radiation for somatic is "Low back to hip, thigh, groin", with "Radiation below knee unusual" and "Quasi segmental", while radicular "Follows nerve distribution", with "Radiation below knee common" and "Radicular pattern". Signs differ in that sensory alteration is "Uncommon" for somatic and "Probable" for radicular; motor changes show somatic "Only subjective weakness" and "Atrophy rare" versus radicular "Objective weakness" and "Atrophy possibly present"; reflex changes are "None" for somatic and "Commonly described, but seen only occasionally" for radicular; straight leg raises show somatic "Only low back pain" versus radicular "Reproduction of leg pain", and somatic presents "No root tension signs" versus radicular "Positive root tension signs".

### A review of nocturnal leg cramps in older people [^115yyypp]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

Nocturnal leg cramps are common and troublesome, especially in later life, and have a significant impact on quality of life, particularly sleep quality. This article reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the diagnosis, frequency, pathophysiology and management of cramps. Recent evidence suggests that diuretic and long-acting beta-agonist therapy predispose to leg cramps. There is conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of prophylactic stretching exercises in preventing cramps. Quinine remains the only medication proven to reduce the frequency and intensity of leg cramps. However, the degree of benefit from quinine is modest and the risks include rare but serious immune-mediated reactions and, especially in older people, dose-related side effects. Quinine treatment should be restricted to those with severe symptoms, should be subject to regular review and requires discussion of the risks and benefits with patients.

### Nocturnal leg cramps [^116uaeLE]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Up to 60 percent of adults report that they have had nocturnal leg cramps. The recurrent, painful tightening usually occurs in the calf muscles and can cause severe insomnia. The exact mechanism is unknown, but the cramps are probably caused by muscle fatigue and nerve dysfunction rather than electrolyte or other abnormalities. Nocturnal leg cramps are associated with vascular disease, lumbar canal stenosis, cirrhosis, hemodialysis, pregnancy, and other medical conditions. Medications that are strongly associated with leg cramps include intravenous iron sucrose, conjugated estrogens, raloxifene, naproxen, and teriparatide. A history and physical examination are usually sufficient to differentiate nocturnal leg cramps from other conditions, such as restless legs syndrome, claudication, myositis, and peripheral neuropathy. Laboratory evaluation and specialized testing usually are unnecessary to confirm the diagnosis. Limited evidence supports treating nocturnal leg cramps with exercise and stretching, or with medications such as magnesium, calcium channel blockers, carisoprodol, or vitamin B(12). Quinine is no longer recommended to treat leg cramps.

### Ultrasound-guided diagnosis and treatment of meralgia paresthetica [^112xh1aP]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Meralgia paresthetica refers to the entrapment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve at the level of the inguinal ligament. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve - a purely sensory nerve - arises from the L2 and L3 spinal nerve roots, travels downward lateral to the psoas muscle, and then crosses the iliacus muscle. Close to the anterior superior iliac spine, the nerve courses in contact with the lateral aspect of the inguinal ligament and eventually innervates the lateral thigh. The entrapment syndrome is usually idiopathic but can also ensue due to trauma/overuse, pelvic and retroperitoneal tumors, stretching of the nerve due to prolonged leg/trunk hyperextension, leg length discrepancies, prolonged standing, external compression by belts, weight gain, and tight clothing. The diagnosis of Meralgia paresthetica is usually clinical, i.e., based on the following symptoms: paresthesia, numbness, burning sensation, dysesthesia, and pain over the anterolateral aspects of the thigh. These complaints may be worsened by walking or prolonged standing and typically disappear after weight loss, abdominal muscle strengthening, or elimination of the underlying cause. Although there are several reports on the confirmatory role of electrodiagnostic studies in the diagnosis of Meralgia paresthetica, electromyographers would usually prefer/suggest not to perform nerve conduction studies in daily clinical practice. Herewith, due to its several advantages, ultrasound imaging has been proposed as an alternative diagnostic method in the recent literature. It not only confirms the entrapment morphologically, but also uncovers a likely underlying cause and provides immediate interventional guidance. The pertinent sonographic findings would be hypoechoic and swollen lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.

### Non-drug therapies for the secondary prevention of lower limb muscle cramps [^113vNeye]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lower limb muscle cramps are common and painful. They can limit exercise participation, and reduce quality of sleep, and quality of life. Many interventions are available for lower limb cramps; some are controversial or could cause harm, and often, people experience no benefit from the interventions used. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012. We updated the review to incorporate new evidence.

Objectives

To assess the effects of non-drug, non-invasive therapies for lower limb muscle cramps.

Search Methods

In August 2018 and May 2020, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of included studies. We imposed no restrictions by language or publication date.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non-drug, non-invasive interventions tested over at least four weeks, for lower limb muscle cramps in any group of people, except pregnant women. The primary outcome was cramp frequency. Secondary outcomes were cramp pain severity, cramp duration, health-related quality of life, quality of sleep, participation in activities of daily living, proportion of participants reporting lower limb muscle cramps, and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, and cross-checked data extraction and analyses according to standard Cochrane procedures.

Main Results

We included three trials, with 201 participants, all 50 years of age and older; none had neurological disease. All trials evaluated a form of stretching for lower limb muscle cramps. A combination of daily calf and hamstring stretching for six weeks may reduce the severity of night-time lower limb muscle cramps (measured on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) where 0 = no pain and 10 cm = worst pain imaginable) in people aged 55 years and older, compared to no intervention (mean difference (MD) -1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.74 to -0.86; 1 RCT, 80 participants; low-certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence was very low for cramp frequency (change in number of cramps per night from week zero to week six) comparing the stretching group and the no intervention group (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.8 to -0.6; 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Calf stretching alone for 12 weeks may make little to no difference to the frequency of night-time lower limb muscle cramps in people aged 60 years and older (stretching group median number of cramps in the last four weeks (Md) 4, interquartile range (IQR) 8; N = 48; sham stretching group Md 3, IQR 7.63; N = 46) (U = 973.5, z = -0.995, P = 0.32, r = 0.10; 1 RCT, 94 participants; low-certainty evidence). This trial did not report cramp severity. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of a combination of daily calf, quadriceps, and hamstring stretching on the frequency and severity of leg cramps in 50- to 60-year-old women with metabolic syndrome (N = 24). It was not possible to fully analyse the frequency data and the scale used to measure cramp severity is not validated. No study reported health-related quality of life, quality of sleep, or participation in activities of daily living. No participant in these three studies reported adverse events. The evidence for adverse events was of moderate certainty as the studies were too small to detect uncommon events. In two of the three studies, outcomes were at risk of recall bias, and tools used to measure outcomes were not validated. Due to limitations in study designs that led to risks of bias, and imprecise findings with wide CIs, we cannot be certain that findings of future studies will be similar to those presented in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

A combination of daily calf and hamstring stretching for six weeks may reduce the severity of night-time lower limb muscle cramps in people aged 55 years and older, but the effect on cramp frequency is uncertain. Calf stretching alone compared to sham stretching for 12 weeks may make little or no difference to the frequency of night-time lower limb muscle cramps in people aged 60 years and older. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of a combination of daily calf, quadriceps, and hamstring stretching on the frequency and severity of leg cramps in 50- to 60-year-old women with metabolic syndrome. Overall, use of unvalidated outcome measures and inconsistent diagnostic criteria make it difficult to compare the studies and apply findings to clinical practice. Given the prevalence and impact of lower limb muscle cramps, there is a pressing need to carefully evaluate many of the commonly recommended and emerging non-drug therapies in well-designed RCTs across all types of lower limb muscle cramps. A specific cramp outcome tool should be developed and validated for use in future research.

Knee osteoarthritis patient history — patients typically present with activity-related knee pain often relieved by rest and joint stiffness of limited duration notably after inactivity. Pain is often described as a deep, aching pain that can be localized or diffuse. Additional complaints may include crepitus, bony tenderness, reduced range of motion, swelling, and/or joint instability, buckling, or giving way, with exacerbation or difficulty during activities that stress the joint such as standing, squatting, kneeling, walking, and stair climbing.

### Perceived versus objective change in walking ability in peripheral artery disease: results from 3 randomized clinical trials of exercise therapy [^114PckRU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Mean change in 6‐minute walk distance corresponding to participant‐perceived change in walking ability.

The number of participants in the exercise and control groups reporting specific changes in walking ability (scale:‐2 to +2, +2 = best) is as follows: Exercise group: −2: n = 24, −1: n = 81, no change: n = 188, +1: n = 144; +2: n = 89; Control group: −2: n = 33; −1: n = 107; no change: n = 185; +1: n = 121; +2: n = 54.

Of 159 participants who reported no change between baseline and follow‐up in the degree to which pain, aching, or cramps in the calf or buttock made walking difficult, those randomized to exercise had significantly greater improvement in 6‐minute walk distance compared with those randomized to control (+33.9 versus −7.5 m, P < 0.001) (Figure 2). Among the 87 participants who reported worsening in pain, aching, or cramps in the calf or buttock during walking, those randomized to exercise had significantly greater improvement in 6‐minute walk distance compared with those randomized to control (+28.9 versus −12.5 m, P = 0.003) (Figure 2). Similarly, those randomized to exercise significantly improved 6‐minute walk distance compared with control, even while reporting no change or worsening in the degree to which thigh symptoms worsened walking ability (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Mean change in 6‐minute walk distance according to participant‐reported change in (A) calf symptoms and (B) pain or aching in thighs.

In sensitivity analyses, results did not substantially change when the 10 participants (2%) who used a cane for the 6‐minute walk at baseline or follow‐up were excluded from analyses (Table S1). Results did not substantially change when the 25 participants (6%) who were asymptomatic at baseline were excluded from analyses (Table S2).

What should I avoid while taking sumatriptan injection?

Sumatriptan injection can cause dizziness, weakness, or drowsiness. If you have these symptoms, do not drive a car, use machinery, or do anything where you need to be alert.

What are the possible side effects of sumatriptan injection?

Sumatriptan injection may cause serious side effects. See "What is the most important information I should know about sumatriptan injection?"

These serious side effects include:

- changes in color or sensation in your fingers and toes (Raynaud's syndrome)

- stomach and intestinal problems (gastrointestinal and colonic ischemic events). Symptoms of gastrointestinal and colonic ischemic events include:

- sudden or severe stomach pain

- stomach pain after meals

- weight loss

- fever

- nausea or vomiting

- constipation or diarrhea

- bloody diarrhea

- problems with blood circulation to your legs and feet (peripheral vascular ischemia). Symptoms of peripheral vascular ischemia include:

- cramping and pain in your legs or hips

- feeling of heaviness or tightness in your leg muscles

- burning or aching pain in your feet or toes while resting

- numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs

- cold feeling or color changes in 1 or both legs or feet

- medication overuse headaches. Some people who use too many sumatriptan injections may have worse headaches (medication overuse headache). If your headaches get worse, your healthcare provider may decide to stop your treatment with sumatriptan injection.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^112P9eXD]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

3.2.1.2. Radicular pain without radiculopathy

Radicular pain is likely associated with hyperexcitability and ectopic discharges of dorsal roots or dorsal root ganglia. The hyperexcitability and ectopic discharges may be due to inflammatory irritation, ischaemia, or mechanical deformation of neural structures or a combination of these and their downstream mechanisms (eg, inflammation).

The pain may be described as shocking, lancinating, electric, stabbing, or shooting and is often accompanied by a dull background ache. We have further added sharp and burning as potential pain descriptors as these are frequently reported by patients with lumbar radicular pain. With radicular pain, the pain may be spontaneous or evoked, for instance, by certain movements of the spine or leg. In addition to pain, patients may experience paraesthesia and dysaesthesia such as tingling, a "woolen feeling", or "a block of ice".

The pain can be felt deep or cutaneous and may radiate into the leg in areas reminiscent of, but not necessarily identical to, dermatomes. The working group further agreed to remove the original description of "band-like" location of the pain, which seemed sufficiently covered by "areas reminiscent of, but not necessarily identical to, dermatomes".

### Rehabilitation management of low back pain-it's time to pull it all together! [^113Qzghu]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Part 2: practical integration of the model into practice

Once a patient is deemed suitable for rehabilitation (ie, no red flags), our model proposes a structure to further guide the clinician's assessment. In essence, rehabilitation professionals should establish the patient's profile based on the presence/absence of elements within each domain – this would then identify and target where the relative treatment efforts should be focused. Accordingly, this theoretical model is designed to provide a more comprehensive management overview, by appreciating the relative contribution of each domain driving pain and disability. The following clinical profiles of two hypothetical case examples illustrates this.

Patient A presents with painful symptoms in the low back area along with left leg pain that he describes as dull and achy. The pain is considered to mainly be nociceptive. He shows centralization of his symptoms after repeated lumbar extension exercises, but also has signs of radiculopathy (decreased endurance of dorsiflexors) related to his leg pain. At 5′8″ and 245 lbs, he is aware that his extra weight probably does not help his condition and that his co-occurring history of severe bilateral knee osteoarthritis pain does not help either. He reports that his mood is good, but he scores 6/9 on the StartBack questionnaire and does not see the day when he will be ready to return to work, although his employer is already willing to accommodate him.

Patient B presents with pain located in the low back as well as the posterior aspect of both thighs that he describes as lancinating – the painDetect questionnaire points to a neuropathic component. The segmental hypomobility observed in the lower segments of the lumbar spine during the physical examination does not change his symptoms. He has full range of motion and repeated movement examination does not reveal any specific mechanical pattern of pain (no directional preference either). However, he is also complaining of intermittent pain in his upper back and neck along with sleep disturbances, as pain wakes him up 5–6 times per night. He scores 42 on the CSI questionnaire, where questions regarding fatigue and endurance scored highest. He has concomitant physical comorbidity (migraines) but no mental health comorbidities. He clearly shows pain behaviors in the clinic (grimaces, guarding) and scores 8/9 on the StartBack tool. During the initial assessment, the therapist notes poor perception regarding return to work and high occupational demands for this 49-year-old welder.

14.1 Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) 12-Week Pivotal Studies

The effectiveness of HORIZANT in the treatment of moderate-to-severe primary RLS was demonstrated in two 12-week clinical studies in adults diagnosed with RLS using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria. Key diagnostic criteria for RLS are: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant leg sensations, symptoms begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting, symptoms are partially or totally relieved by movement such as walking or stretching at least as long as the activity continues, and symptoms are worse or occur only in the evening or night. Patients were required to have a total score of ≥ 15 on the International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Rating Scale at baseline. Patients with RLS secondary to other conditions (e.g., pregnancy, renal failure, iron deficiency anemia) were excluded. In study 1, patients were randomized to receive 1,200 mg of HORIZANT (N = 112) or placebo (N = 108) taken once daily at about 5 PM with food. In study 2, patients were randomized to receive 600 mg of HORIZANT (N = 114), 1,200 mg of HORIZANT (N = 111), or placebo (N = 96) taken once daily at about 5 PM with food.

### Proximal tibiofibular synostosis as a possible cause of a pseudoradicular syndrome: a case report [^1144jXR8]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Takai et al. proposed that the classification of O'Dwyer should be extended with a type-4 synostosis, because no deformity, bowing or length discrepancy of the fibula was present in their case. They suggested that the type-4 synostosis occurred after closure of the growth plate, with repeated mechanical stress to the tibiofibular joint as a possible cause. Because no deformity, bowing or length discrepancy of the fibula was present in our patient, we can confirm that adding a type 4 to the classification of O'Dwyer would be logical. At revision of the literature, the presented patient by Nishikawa et al. had another type-4 synostosis.

A pseudoradicular syndrome in combination with a fibular head abnormality, as a result of non-specific fibrosis, with peroneal nerve entrapment was described by Saal et al. They suggested that a lower extremity nerve entrapment could mimic a lumbar pain syndrome. Of 45 patients with peripheral nerve entrapment (femoral, saphenous, peroneal or tibial nerve), 49% had low back complaints. Twenty peroneal lesions were noted at or above the fibular head, of which six patients (30%) were presented with low back pain.

Although we did not find a peroneal entrapment, our patient had a painful and abnormal spinal range of motion, indicating a masquerading lumbar radiculopathy as described by Saal et al. They performed surgical neurolysis in 12 cases (60%); non-specific fibrosis at and above the fibular head was present in all cases. They referred to the theory that neural activation of the dorsal root ganglion could cause referred pain in the same pattern as in lumbar pain syndromes. Although we did not notice fibrosis at or above the fibular head in our patient, theoretically the synostosis could have caused stretching of the peroneal nerve, causing dorsal root ganglion activation. Speculative, the coughing and sneezing which worsened the leg symptoms in our patient could have stimulated this activation. Because no herniated disc was present, this would have been referred stimulation of the sciatic nerve.

Another possible cause of low back pain in their patients could be the mechanical factors created by asymmetrical gait patterns and knee instability (noted in 9 cases). These subtle alterations in gait mechanics could be another plausible explanation in our patient although he had a symmetrical gait pattern and no knee instability.

### Piriformis syndrome and low back pain: a new classification and review of the literature [^115uf7VV]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome is a common cause of low back pain. It is often not included in the differential diagnosis of back, buttock, and leg pain. Additionally it has received minimal recognition because it is often seen as a diagnosis of exclusion. Familiarity with the common elements of the syndrome should increase its recognition and facilitate the appropriate treatment. These include buttock pain and tenderness with or without electrodiagnostic or neurologic signs. Pain is exacerbated in prolonged sitting. Specific physical findings are tenderness in the sciatic notch and buttock pain in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FADIR) of the hip. Imaging modalities are rarely helpful, but electrophysiologic studies should confirm the diagnosis, if not immediately, then certainly in a patient re-evaluation and as such should be sought persistently. Physical therapy aims at stretching the muscle and reducing the vicious cycle of pain and spasm. It is a mainstay of conservative treatment, usually enhanced by local injections. Surgery should be reserved as a last resort in case of failure of all conservative modalities. Piriformis syndrome may constitute up to 5% of cases of low back, buttock, and leg pain. Recognition and widespread appreciation of the clinical presentation improves its early detection and accurate treatment.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — features distinguishing somatic or referred pain from radicular pain are tabulated, emphasizing that determining the difference is critical to diagnosis and treatment. Somatic or referred pain aligns with posterior elements and includes "Posterior segment or element", "Facet joint pain", "Sacroiliac joint pain", "Myofascial syndrome", and "Internal disk disruption", whereas radicular pain aligns with anterior elements and includes "Anterior segment", "Disk herniation", "Annular tear", and "Spinal stenosis". Somatic symptoms are described as "Dull, aching, deep" and "Like an expanding pressure", while radicular symptoms are "Sharp, shooting, lancinating" and "Like an electrical shock". Quality differs with "Back worse than leg", "No paresthesia", "Covers a wide area", and "No radicular or shooting pain", versus radicular patterns of "Leg worse than back", "Paresthesia present", "Well defined and localized", and "Radicular distribution". Radiation contrasts include "Low back to hip, thigh, groin" with "Radiation below knee unusual" versus "Follows nerve root distribution" with "Radiation below knee common". Signs also diverge: somatic shows "Uncommon" sensory alteration, "Only subjective weakness", "Atrophy rare", "None" reflex changes, and straight leg raise produces "Only low back pain", while radicular shows sensory alteration "Probably", "Objective weakness", "Atrophy possibly present", reflex changes "Commonly described, but seen only occasionally", and straight leg raise with "Reproduction of leg pain".

### Low back pain [^113h3ASB]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain — prevalence, risk factors, and physical therapy treatments are described, noting that 8 of 10 people experience it at some time in their lives and that pain is usually felt in the lower back and buttocks with possible leg pain and numbness and tingling in the toes; lifestyle risks include sitting too much, being in poor physical condition, and bending and lifting improperly, and stress and lack of sleep can make the pain worse. Evidence suggests that early treatment for low back pain is helpful in decreasing the chance that your pain will become chronic. Not all low back pain should be treated the same, and a physical therapist can help determine if you will respond better to manipulation or to exercises to improve mobility and/or strengthen your back muscles. New clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of low back pain were published in the April 2012 issue of JOSPT, describing ways to treat back pain based on best research evidence.

### A pragmatic randomised trial of stretching before and after physical activity to prevent injury and soreness [^115DyjFx]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effects of stretching before and after physical activity on risks of injury and soreness in a community population.

Design

Internet-based pragmatic randomised trial conducted between January 2008 and January 2009.

Setting

International.

Participants

A total of 2377 adults who regularly participated in physical activity.

Interventions

Participants in the stretch group were asked to perform 30 s static stretches of seven lower limb and trunk muscle groups before and after physical activity for 12 weeks. Participants in the control group were asked not to stretch.

Main Outcome Measurements

Participants provided weekly on-line reports of outcomes over 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were any injury to the lower limb or back, and bothersome soreness of the legs, buttocks or back. Injury to muscles, ligaments and tendons was a secondary outcome.

Results

Stretching did not produce clinically important or statistically significant reductions in all-injury risk (HR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.13), but did reduce the risk of experiencing bothersome soreness (mean risk of bothersome soreness in a week was 24.6% in the stretch group and 32.3% in the control group; OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.82). Stretching reduced the risk of injuries to muscles, ligaments and tendons (incidence rate of 0.66 injuries per person-year in the stretch group and 0.88 injuries per person-year in the control group; HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96).

Conclusion

Stretching before and after physical activity does not appreciably reduce all-injury risk but probably reduces the risk of some injuries, and does reduce the risk of bothersome soreness.

### Mechanisms and management of diabetic painful distal symmetrical polyneuropathy [^113nGCD2]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical features of painful DSPN

The onset of DSPN is usually gradual or insidious and is heralded by sensory symptoms that start in the toes and then progress proximally to involve the feet and legs in a stocking distribution. When the disease is well established in the lower limbs in more severe cases, there is upper limb involvement, with a similar progression proximally starting in the fingers. As the disease advances further, motor manifestations, such as wasting of the small muscles of the hands and limb weakness, become apparent. In some cases, there may be sensory loss that the patient may not be aware of, and the first presentation may be a foot ulcer. Approximately 50% of patients with DSPN experience neuropathic symptoms in the lower limbs including uncomfortable tingling (dysesthesia), pain (burning; shooting or "electric-shock like"; lancinating or "knife-like"; "crawling", or aching etc. in character), evoked pain (allodynia, hyperesthesia), or unusual sensations (such as a feeling of swelling of the feet or severe coldness of the legs when clearly the lower limbs look and feel fine, odd sensations on walking likened to "walking on pebbles" or "walking on hot sand", etc.). There may be marked pain on walking that may limit exercise and lead to weight gain. Painful DSPN is characteristically more severe at night and often interferes with normal sleep. It also has a major impact on the ability to function normally (both mental and physical functioning, e.g. ability to maintain work, mood, and quality of life [QoL]).

In one study from the U.S. the burden of painful DSPN was found to be considerable, resulting in a persistent discomfort despite polypharmacy and high resource use and led to limitations in daily activities and poor satisfaction with treatments. The unremitting nature of the pain can be distressing, resulting in mood disorders including depression and anxiety. The natural history of painful DSPN has not been well studied, and there is a need for large, population-based, prospective studies looking at the natural history and potentially modifiable risk factors, if any. However, it is generally believed that painful symptoms may persist over the years, occasionally becoming less prominent as the sensory loss worsens.

### Painful diabetic neuropathy: advantage of novel drugs over old drugs? [^115P5qak]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

MANIFESTATIONS OF PAINFUL NEUROPATHY

Chronic DPN with persistent or episodic pain that typically may worsen at night, and improve during walking, is localized predominantly in the feet. The pain is often described as a deep-seated ache, but there may be superimposed lancination, or it may be of burning thermal quality. In a clinical survey including 105 patients with DPN, the following locations of pain were most frequent: 96% feet, 69% balls of feet, 67% toes, 54% dorsum of foot, 39% hands, 37% plantum of foot, 37% calves, and 32% heels. The pain was most often described by the patients as "burning/hot", "electric", "sharp", "achy", and "tingling", which was worse at night and when tired or stressed. The average pain intensity was moderate, ∼5.75/10 on a 0–10 scale, with the "least" and "most" pain being 3.6 and 6.9/10, respectively. Evoked pain, such as allodynia (pain due to a stimulus that does not normally cause pain, e.g. stroking) and hyperalgesia (severe pain due to a stimulus that normally causes slight pain, e.g. a pin-prick) may be present. The symptoms may be accompanied by sensory loss, but patients with severe pain may have few clinical signs. Pain may persist over several years causing considerable disability and impaired quality of life in some patients, whereas it remits partially or completely in others, despite further deterioration in small fiber function. Pain remission tends to be associated with sudden metabolic change, short duration of pain or diabetes, preceding weight loss, and less severe sensory loss.

### Perceived versus objective change in walking ability in peripheral artery disease: results from 3 randomized clinical trials of exercise therapy [^1138hosz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Leg Symptoms

The presence and characteristics of exertional leg symptoms were measured using the San Diego Claudication Questionnaire. Intermittent claudication was defined as exertional calf pain that was not present at rest and resolved within 10 minutes of rest. Atypical exertional leg symptoms were defined as exertional leg symptoms that did not meet criteria for intermittent claudication. Participants reporting no exertional leg symptoms were classified as "asymptomatic".

WIQ Distance Score

The WIQ was developed specifically for people with PAD, to measure perceived difficulty walking distances in the community. The WIQ includes 3 domains: walking distance, walking speed, and stair climbing. These analyses focused on the WIQ distance domain because it measures the participant's perception of difficulty walking long distances and therefore is most directly related to the 6‐minute walk test, an objective assessment of walking endurance, than the other WIQ domains (stair climbing and walking speed). The WIQ distance questionnaire consists of 7 questions measuring participants' perceived difficulty walking 7 specified distances, ranging from walking indoors around the home to walking 5 blocks, without stopping to rest. For each question, participants indicated their perception of difficulty walking the distance on level ground without stopping to rest on a 0–4 scale, where 0 represents inability to walk the distance and 4 represents no difficulty walking the distance. A total WIQ distance score was calculated, ranging from 0 to 100 (100 = best and indicates no difficulty walking any of the distances) as previously described.

The WIQ also includes Likert scale questions about the degree to which pain, aching, or cramps in calves or buttocks cause difficulty walking and the degree to which pain or aching in the thighs cause difficulty walking. Responses to each question are rated on a 5‐point scale, ranging from "none" to "very difficult". For these analyses, participants were classified according to whether their response at 6‐month follow‐up represented improvement, no change, or decline, compared with their baseline response.

### Intermittent claudication: effective medical management of a common circulatory problem [^111t91W6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Intermittent claudication (IC), most often characterized by a reproducible, painful aching or cramping in muscle groups of the leg caused by walking and relieved by rest, is a common, lifestyle-limiting symptom of lower-extremity peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Because IC is usually indicative of systemic atherosclerosis, active investigation and treatment are recommended. Positive outcomes have been shown with a treatment regimen including risk-factor modification, particularly smoking cessation and control of diabetes, exercise, and pharmacotherapy. Pentoxifylline has been used since 1984 for the treatment of IC with indifferent results. Recently, clinical trials with cilostazol, a drug approved for use in the United States, have shown significant effectiveness in IC patients, generally doubling their maximal walking distance at 24 weeks of treatment. Cilostazol has also been shown to be significantly more effective than pentoxifylline in improving pain-free and maximal walking distance. Other classes of drugs, such as platelet antiaggregants, are being studied for the treatment of IC, but little efficacy has been shown. Arterial revascularization by endovascular or surgical methods is an additional option but must be considered on an individual basis depending on severity of symptoms and disability in each patient.

### Successful diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^111L8CGt]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

History and Physical Exam

SIJ disorders are best differentiated from other forms of low back pain by using a combination of diagnostic modalities, including obtaining a thorough history and physical examination. SIJ pain typically presents as a uni- or bilateral aching pain below the L5 level without numbness or paresthesia (tingling). Patients typically report low back pain that is worse after prolonged sitting, bending forward, and with transfers out of a bed or up from a low chair or toilet. Pain in these patients may worsen after performing weight-bearing activities, such as climbing stairs, bending, twisting, or even prolonged walking. Repetitive bending with activities such as vacuuming, sweeping, mopping, pulling weeds and loading a dishwasher can also exacerbate SIJ pain. Gait is often compromised in individuals with SIJ pain. This dysfunction involves reduced coactivation of the gluteus maximus and contralateral latissimus dorsi, which together provide joint stability during walking.

While no single physical exam maneuver is diagnostic, a combination of specific findings and provocative tests can be essential in determining SIJ disorders. Specific physical exam provocative tests for SIJ dysfunction include FABER, compression, distraction, thigh thrust, and Gaenslen tests. Typically, SIJ pain is diagnosed when at least three out of the five provocative maneuvers are positive. Of the three positive tests, either the thigh thrust or compression test should be positive. By performing these provocative maneuvers, there is an 85% pretest probability that an intra-articular joint injection will be successful. Another study confirmed that three or more pain provocation SIJ tests have a 91% sensitivity and 78% specificity.

### Pain and neuromuscular disease: the results of a survey [^116ogiUG]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate pain frequency, severity, location, treatment, and relief in a population of adult patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMD).

Design

The authors used a self-completion mail questionnaire from the Physical Medicine Clinic at the Lille University Medical Center (northern France). Two hundred eighty-one adults with a confirmed diagnosis of hereditary neuromuscular disease were mailed a questionnaire, which was returned by 125 subjects (response rate = 45%). The main outcome measures were mean motor deficiency scores (on the Brooke and Vignos scales), anxiety and depression scores, pain intensity (on a 0–10 numeric scale) and location, frequency of pain-aggravating situations, and pain treatment and relief.

Results

Seventy-three percent of respondents reported pain and 62% reported chronic pain (defined as pain for at least 3 mos). The mean pain intensity was 6.1/10 with 40% reporting severe pain (a score of ≥ 7). Forty-six percent and 16% of subjects had a high risk for anxiety and depression, respectively. The most common pain-aggravating situations were "walking", "standing", and "muscle stretching". Walking was more frequently cited as a pain-aggravating situation by the chronic pain population than by the acute pain population. Seventy percent of patients with pain had received at least one analgesic drug. Massage was the most frequently prescribed physical treatment.

Conclusions

Pain is a frequent symptom in adult patients with NMD and needs to be better characterized in this population. The use of painkillers and physical pain treatments did not seem to provide adequate relief for the patients studied here.

### Efficacy of rectus femoris stretching on pain, range of motion and spatiotemporal gait parameters in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a randomised controlled trial [^116Ti7Gp]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Our findings showed that rectus femoris stretching increased flexion ROM. Stretching exercises may increase ROM by raising the pain threshold, stretch tolerance and sarcomere numbers. The current results support the findings of Suzuki's research, which showed that improving joint flexibility and multiple muscle strength was more important than increasing quadriceps strength alone. The current study also supports Chow et al 's study, which showed that 2 weeks of stretching, was beneficial for total knee arthroplasty patients given that it improved ROM and postoperative outcomes.

Evidence has shown that a walking speed increase exceeding 0.1 m/s can be considered clinically significant. In the current study, rectus femoris stretching increased walking speed by 0.28 m/s. Step length and cadence are the factors that determine walking speed. As expected, the experimental group displayed an increase in walking speed considering that stretching may reduce hip flexor muscle tightness, which limits hip joint extension and causes anterior pelvic tilt.

The increase in step length may be attributed to the increased ROM during knee flexion, hip and pelvic motion, which has been considered the key for increasing walking velocity after stretching. Given the increased ROM around the pelvis, the swinging leg may be able to contact the ground with the heel further in front of the body. The findings obtained in the current study agree with those presented in a previous study, which showed that stretching exercises can modify and normalise movement patterns in gait among the elderly to resemble healthy adults.

In conclusion, simple rectus femoris stretching exercises are easy to perform even at home and are beneficial for pain, flexion ROM, function and spatiotemporal gait parameters, such as step length and speed, in KOA patients if the compliance with the exercise regimen is good.

### Lazar K. lazarevi ć, the author who first described the straight leg raising test [^114T5HJw]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To highlight the contributions of Lazar K. Lazarević (1851–1891), physician, scientist, writer, and translator in the field of neurology. During his brief period of professional activities, Lazar K. Lazarević published 78 articles in various branches of medicine. His most important contribution to neurologic science was his description of the straight leg raising test. The article "Ischiac postica cotunnii: one contribution to its differential diagnosis" was published in Serbian in the Serbian Archives of Medicine in 1880, and republished in German in Vienna in 1884. In this article, based on 6 patients from his medical practice, Lazarević correctly explained that stretching the sciatic nerve is the cause of pain during the straight leg raising test. He gave a full description of several maneuvers used to perform the test, and described the control test. Maneuvers described by Lazarević are known by other names.

Conclusions

Analysis of the historical events and documentation indicates that Lazarević could have described the straight leg raising test in sciatica before Lasègue. He identified stretching of the sciatic nerve as the cause of pain and presented several maneuvers, which are now known by other names as labels for various diagnostic categories.

### Proximal tibiofibular synostosis as a possible cause of a pseudoradicular syndrome: a case report [^114QvMGC]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Case report

A 49-year-old man presented with a 4-year history of low back pain and referred pain in his right leg. While standing, he felt sensory sensations from the lateral side of his right upper leg to the knee and the medial side of his lower leg and ankle. Coughing and sneezing worsened these symptoms. He complained about some weakness of his leg, but he had no pain or other symptoms of his knee. Apart from a trochanteric bursitis 5 years earlier, his medical record reported no relevant details. Physical examination showed a restricted flexion of his lumbar spine, with pain at the level of the right sacroiliac joint during lateroflexion and extension of the lumbar spine. Local tenderness was noticed at the level of the right sacroiliac joint, gluteal and trochanteric region. Neurologic examination did not reveal any abnormalities: no weakness was noticed in his right leg, and the straight leg and femoral stretch tests were negative.

Plain radiographs of the SI-joint, pelvis and hip did not reveal any abnormality. Also an MRI of the lumbar vertebrae revealed no abnormality, especially no herniated disc. Laboratory data showed no abnormal blood levels. A technetium scintigraphic scan showed no increased isotope uptake in the lower spine, but revealed a hot spot at the level of the proximal tibiofibular joint (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Technetium scintigraphic scan. No increased isotope uptake of the lower spine, but a hotspot at the level of the right proximal tibiofibular joint is shown

At a second physical examination, local tenderness at the level of the proximal tibiofibular joint was present. There was a normal mechanical axis of the right leg and the knee function was optimal. Radiographs of the right knee showed proliferative bone formation between the proximal tibia and fibula. There was no dislocation or subluxation of the proximal tibiofibular joint, and the proximal fibula had a normal shaft without any bowing. A CT scan showed eccentric bone growth of both the proximal tibia and fibula, causing a synostosis at the edges of the bone formations (Fig. 2).

### A conceptual model of patient experiences of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy to support clinical outcomes assessment [^111R49MS]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Qualitative Patient Interviews

The interview study included 25 participants of varied age, sex, race or ethnicity, educational background, and employment status (Table 2). All participants self-reported moderate to severe pain from DPN (a score of 4 to 9 on a 0–10 scale). More than half of the sample reported using prescription medication to treat their pain (n = 15, 60%) and most reported using over-the-counter medication (n = 21, 84%). Duration of participants' experiences with pDPN symptoms ranged from one to ten years, with a sample mean of 3.6 years. Participants resided in ten different US states representing all regions of the country. Conceptual saturation was reached in interview 21.

Table 2
Qualitative Interview Study Participant Characteristics

All interview participants reported pDPN symptoms in their feet, with some experiencing symptoms in their legs as well. Some participants also noted symptoms in the hands or arms, usually described as numbness or tingling rather than pain. Participants often described the frequency and severity of their symptoms as unpredictable and fluctuating. Participants also commonly reported worsening symptoms at nighttime or following physical activity (eg, walking or standing for long periods). Participants described symptoms with many of the same terms identified in the TLR, including numbness, tingling, burning, sharp, stabbing or electric-shock like pain, aching, tightness, squeezing, and cramping. Nearly all participants (n = 24, 96%) reported that pDPN in the feet or legs interfered with physical function, including any activity or task that required walking or standing, such as household chores, exercise, or running errands. Impacts on emotional well-being, social life and cognitive functioning were also reported by a majority of participants. For example, participants reported avoiding social events with others if the plans involved physical activity and canceling plans or avoiding social interactions while in pain because they were angry or irritated and did not want their mood to affect others. Cognitive effects were most often described as diminished mental acuity due to pain consuming one's thoughts, making it challenging to think and focus normally.

### Acute effects of graduated elastic compression stockings in patients with symptomatic varicose veins: a randomised double blind placebo controlled trial [^117LxCTw]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the effectiveness of graduated elastic compression stockings (GECS) below the knee in improving symptoms in patients with varicose veins in the absence of high quality evidence.

Methods

This was a randomised double blind placebo controlled trial. Thirty patients with no experience of elastic stockings, presenting with primary varicose veins causing calf pain or aching were randomised to a GECS (18–21 mmHg at the ankle level, n = 15) or a placebo stocking (0 mmHg, n = 15). Pain or aching of the index leg after 1 week was the primary outcome measure. In patients with bilateral varicose veins the leg with the most severe pain/aching was considered. Other defined symptoms were secondary outcome measures. All symptoms were scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS).

Results

The two study groups were well balanced at baseline. At the completion of the study after 1 week, GECS were more effective than placebo stockings in reducing pain or aching (VAS score 1.7 ± 3.0 vs. 4.5 ± 2.8 for placebo, p = .02), while non-significant trends were observed for some of the remaining symptoms of the index leg, including feeling of swelling (VAS score 0.9 ± 1.9 vs. 3.3 ± 3.5 for placebo), paraesthesiae (VAS score 0.2 ± 0.6 vs. 2.1 ± 3.1 for placebo), and the number of symptoms other than pain or aching (1.3 ± 1.1 vs. 2.8 ± 1.7 for placebo). Number needed to treat (95% CI) for a 50% or complete improvement of pain or aching in the index leg was 2 (95% CI 1.2–5.5) and 2 (95% CI 1.2–5.3), respectively. Mean daily use of the placebo stockings and GECS was 8.0 hours and 10.2 hours, respectively (p = .13).

Conclusions

Among patients with varicose veins, GECS seem effective in ameliorating symptoms, particularly pain or aching, compared with placebo stockings after 1 week of use. Long-term studies are justified.

### Experiences of pain in paediatric chronic fatigue syndrome / myalgic encephalomyelitis: a single-centre qualitative study [^112AK1c3]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Theme A: Children's wide-ranging experiences of pain

A spectrum of pain: ('dull' to 'being stabbed')

Children described a range of distinct pain experiences, varying in character, location, frequency, onset, triggers and intensity of their pain (table 2).

Table 2
Participant quotes relating to theme A: Children's wide-ranging experiences of pain

Some children had very severe pain (see quotes 1a, 1b, 1d), while others experienced more subtle pain (1c, 1e). Of note, older children were able to use more complex language to describe their pain experiences (1a–1d). Some younger children found it hard to express what type of pain they experienced stating 'it's hard to describe' (P12).

Distribution of pain: from 'everywhere' to specific body sites

Children experienced pain at multiple sites. A wide variety of locations were described, most commonly: the back, legs and neck (2a–2g). Others were unable to pinpoint distinct painful areas and experienced pain throughout their bodies (2g, 2h). Two participants experienced heightened sensitivity in their skin and hair (2j, 2k), particularly triggered by touch.

Random to specific triggers for pain

While some children were unable to identify a clear trigger for their pain (3a, 3b), several identified physical activity, 'walking… and any kind of sport' (3c) and/or 'tiredness' (3d–3f) triggering or worsening pain. Two participants found that pain was linked to temperature, experiencing worse pain in colder climates (3g, 3h). Others found pain was triggered by sensory stimuli. Specifically, two children who experienced headaches frequently found that auditory and visual stimuli worsened pain (3i, 3j).

Theme B: Negative impact of pain

### Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome: a diagnostic and treatment enigma for orthopaedic surgeons [^114JmSb9]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is an uncommon condition that causes recurrent posterior leg pain and foot paresthesia in running athletes. This condition occurs most commonly due to an accessory or abnormal implant of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle. It may mimic or coincide with other chronic conditions of the lower extremity including chronic exertional compartment syndrome but is most consistent with vascular claudication. Clinical features that distinguish PAES from other causes of leg pain include a sensation of coolness of the posterior leg during exercise and associated paresthesia of the plantar aspect of the foot. Physical examination often reveals decreased intensity of the posterior tibial or dorsalis pedis pulses with passive dorsiflexion or active plantarflexion of the ankle. Diagnostic tests that confirm the presence of PAES include lower extremity angiography during active resisted plantarflexion or maximal passive dorsiflexion, and magnetic resonance angiography done after exercise provocation. Nonsurgical treatment with physical therapy and stretching of the gastrocnemius complex should be done as the first line of treatment. When conservative treatments are ineffective, referral to a vascular specialist for surgical intervention with a muscular band excision or transection, vascular bypass, or arterial reconstruction is necessary.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

History and symptoms in peripheral artery disease (PAD) — Patients at increased risk of PAD should undergo a comprehensive medical history and a review of symptoms to assess for exertional leg symptoms, including claudication or other walking impairment, ischemic rest pain, and nonhealing wounds, because studies have demonstrated that the majority of patients with confirmed PAD do not have typical claudication but have other non–joint-related limb symptoms or are asymptomatic; atypical lower extremity symptoms may include pain or discomfort that begins at rest but worsens with exertion, pain or discomfort that does not stop an individual from walking, and pain or discomfort that begins with exertion but is not alleviated within 10 minutes of rest, and all patients at increased risk of PAD should be asked not only about claudication but also about other exertional non–joint-related limb symptoms and perceived walking impairment.

With injury incidence ranging from 26% to 92%, runners are continually seeking the next great cure that will keep them injury free. And the information they receive is often conflicting: land on your heels, land on your toes; stretching makes you faster, stretching makes you slower; wear supportive shoes, do not wear shoes at all. As practitioners, we are often guilty of the same search for a common cause of all running injuries: foot pronation, impact forces, excessive hip motion, and so on. It is a confusing time for runners, as well as for those of us who treat them. By covering a diverse range of running topics, we hope this special running issue of JOSPT improves our understanding of what running is and takes us one step further toward having common answers for those on the run.

### Healing of achilles tendon partial tear following focused shockwave: a case report and literature review [^113t3Lgu]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Case description

A 64-year-old female nurse suffered from severe left heel pain for half year after a long period of walking and standing. She mentioned that the dull pain was induced after ankle sprain with a "pop" sound when traveling in a bus, and she still could walk at that time. She did not receive any treatment or take rest at that time. Two days later, the pain became severe and radiated to soleus muscle, especially when walking, accompanied with sharp pain sensation especially when climbing stairs. Swelling around the heel to leg was also noted with mild ecchymosis at that time. Before visiting, she received cold or hot packing, electric therapy, stretching exercising, manual therapy, massage, acupuncture, oral and topical medicines at other clinics. All modes of treatment were less effective and the symptoms progressed.

Half a year later, she could not even walk or stand when first visiting at our department. The activity of daily living (ADL) and working performance were affected. The visual analog scale (VAS) was nine. At the first visit, granulation like lesions and tenderness was observed at surface of the heel skin, compatible to Haglund's deformity and spurs formation as revealed on the image taken through X-ray. No bony fracture was noted at tibia, fibula, or calcaneus bone. Active ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion would induce painful sensation during examination. Passive range of motion could be smoothly completed when gently performed on the ankle, but positive finding of Thompson test was noted when the calf was squeezed. Pain would also generate when the area around the insertion site of Achilles tendon was compressed and knocked. Taut band with referred pain to the ankle and twitch sign was noted at soleus muscle. Soft tissues around the heel showed mild swelling, but no wound or ecchymosis was noted at that time. Muscle power of the lower limb was within normal limit except at active plantar flexion compared to the healthy side. Because the muscle power was of grade 3, lesions at common tendon of soleus and gastrocnemius should be suspected. According to the aforementioned findings, Achilles tendinitis, retrocalcaneal bursitis, tendon tear, soleus and gastrocnemius muscle strain, and myofascial pain syndrome should be distinguished.

Case presentation

This patient is an otherwise healthy early-adolescent boy who presented to the emergency department (ED) 4 days after hearing 'multiple small pops' in his left hip while walking upstairs. The patient had mild pain at the time of the incident, which increased over the next couple of days to the point where he could no longer ambulate. The patient was discharged home and referred to our clinic for further evaluation and management. On initial consultation at our clinic 3 days later, the patient reported that his pain had improved, and he was able to bear some weight on the left leg. However, he stated he experienced groin pain after standing for long durations of time. He described an ongoing history of mild aching hip pain with no diagnosis prior to this incident.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^116s653f]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In the context of pain and tenderness over the lateral femoral epicondyle, a positive Ober's test is supportive of ITBS. The maneuver has a high inter-rater reliability of 97% and intra-rater reliability of 90%. To perform the test, as demonstrated in Figure 2, the patient is positioned in side-lying with the affected leg on top, and the pelvis is stabilized perpendicular to the exam table by the examiner's hand. Next, the hip and knee of the affected leg are passively flexed to 90°, and then the examiner passively stretches the hip through abduction and extension in order to position the ITB behind the GT. Finally, the knee of the affected leg is allowed to slowly drop under the weight of gravity until it reaches its final resting angle. If the final angle is greater than 0°, meaning the hip is still abducted, Ober's test is positive and indicates the patient has a tight ITB. Oftentimes in patients with ITBS, the examiner will also be able to palpate a taut ITB while the patient is standing or supine. Because the diagnosis of this syndrome is clinical, imaging is not necessary unless coexisting lumbar radicular and/or intra-articular hip pathology is suspected.

Similar to the treatment for GTPS, hip abductor strengthening is essential for long-term resolution of ITBS. ITB stretching, in addition to correction of other contributing factors such as core weakness, suboptimal biomechanics, and improper footwear can be helpful, as well. Relative rest, ice, and acetaminophen are appropriate for acute management, but similar to the limitation of corticosteroid injections for GTPS, these treatments are unlikely to provide lasting relief unless the underlying biomechanical imbalance is also addressed.

### Novel approach to characterising individuals with low back-related leg pain: cluster identification with latent class analysis and 12-month follow-up [^115kHRSD]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Variables included in the latent class modelling

There is no restriction in latent class (LC) modelling on the number of variables or measurement level to model the clusters. Twelve variables were a priori chosen from the larger set of available self-report and clinical assessment findings. Variable selection was based on (i) expert consensus from a Delphi study on items from clinical assessment considered most important for distinguishing sciatica from referred leg pain in LBLP patients, and (ii) clinical features of sciatica identified in a systematic review of LBLP classification systems.

Two variables were on a continuous scale (0–10) (leg pain intensity; back pain intensity). The remaining variables were binary (yes/no): subjective sensory changes in the lower limb; below knee pain; leg pain worse than back pain; leg pain on cough/sneeze/strain; leg pain on forward or backward spinal bend; positive neural tension test (straight leg raise or slump or femoral nerve stretch); myotomal (strength) deficit, reflex deficit, sensory deficit. (See Supplementary digital content file for description of variables).

### Avoiding, diagnosing and treating well leg compartment syndrome after pelvic surgery [^115h2bSW]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Key recommendations

All surgeons who undertake pelvic procedures on patients maintained in the Lloyd‐Davies/lithotomy positions should be aware of well leg compartment syndrome (WLCS).
The risk of WLCS must be noted specifically in the preoperative team brief and WHO time out. Strategies agreed to minimize the risk to each patient must be recorded before commencement of surgery.
Unless mandated by other patient safety considerations, the patient's legs should be kept at a level below the heart for the maximum duration possible during a procedure.
Where elevation of the legs is required to facilitate surgery, the maximum unbroken period of elevation should not exceed 4 h. The patient's legs should be kept at a lower level than the heart for a minimum of 15 min after each 4‐h interval. The duration of elevation and the time allowed for recovery should be monitored and documented in the patient's operation note/anaesthetic chart.
Intraoperative hypotension should be corrected where possible and intraoperative fluid therapy optimized to avoid both excessive fluid administration, or inadequate tissue perfusion.
Any patient who has undergone pelvic surgery in the lithotomy position, whether or not combined with Trendelenberg tilt, who complains of postoperative leg pain should be suspected of having WLCS.
The initial diagnosis of WLCS is entirely clinical, so assessment of the patient with suspected WLCS must be methodical, focused and thorough, and documented clearly and contemporaneously.
Assessment must include: Accurate history – pain, paraesthesia, numbness, weakness, paralysis. Pain – onset, site, nature. Presence of paraesthesia or numbness. Inspection: swelling – unilateral/bilateral, oedema. Palpation: tension in compartments, palpable difference between sides; tenderness in each compartment. Passive stretch exacerbation of pain: dorsiflexion of toes, plantar flexion of toes, dorsiflexion/plantar flexion of ankle. Assessment of sensation, pulses and capillary refill.
If WLCS is suspected, immediate referral should be made to the orthopaedic or vascular surgery team, according to local protocols.
If clinical assessment confirms a definite or likely diagnosis of WLCS, this is a limb/life‐threatening surgical emergency requiring immediate decompression by open four‐compartment fasciotomy. Treatment should be under way within 1 h of diagnosis.
There should be a low threshold for reassessment in patients whose symptoms persist or deteriorate.
If initial assessment is equivocal, for example in a sedated/unconscious patient, in whom adequate clinical assessment cannot be undertaken, and there is a high index of suspicion, measurement of compartment pressures may be used to confirm or exclude compartment syndrome.
If compartment pressure measurement is undertaken, and the difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is less than 30 mmHg in any compartment, an immediate (within 1 h), bilateral four‐compartment fasciotomy should be undertaken.
Reassessment of the compartments in theatre should be carried out between 48 and 72 h after decompression.
After fasciotomy, early discussion with, and involvement of, plastic and reconstructive surgeons is recommended for patients with significant tissue loss.

### Efficacy of specified manual therapies in combination with a supervised exercise protocol for managing pain intensity and functional disability in patients with knee osteoarthritis [^116Ty34X]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Partial squats (weight-lessened with arm support as needed):These were performed in a standing position with arm support as needed. The participants were asked to perform a partial squat, keeping the knees centered over the feet, then returning to a standing position by contracting the quadriceps femoris and gluteal muscles. They were instructed to hold each contraction for 7 to 10 seconds with hips and knees kept as straight as possible and then to repeat this for 30 bouts. This exercise was progressed further to full body weight without support and to add additional bouts.

Step-ups:The participants were instructed to stand up in front of a low step, place the foot of their ipsilateral leg on the step and bring their body over the foot in order to stand on the ipsilateral step. Patients used as little push-off assistance from the contralateral foot as possible, then stepped down with the contralateral foot. This was repeated slowly for 30s. This exercise was progressed further to increase the height of the step and to add additional bouts.

Stretching Exercises

Slow, sustained stretching was performed in different positions for different groups of muscles with a holding time 30 seconds and a gap of 1 minute between two repetitions. This was repeated 3 times per session on alternate days for 2 weeks. Stretching was performed for the calf muscle, hamstring muscle, and quadriceps femoris muscle in standing, supine, and prone positions, respectively.

Standing calf stretch:This stretch was performed in a standing position for the calf muscle. The participant was instructed to stand in a walking–standing position with the foot of the leg to be stretched in complete contact with the ground behind the body and the other foot in front of the body, keeping the toes pointed straight forward. The participants used the support of wall and leaned forward until a moderate pull was perceived in their calf region.

Supine hamstring muscle stretch:This stretch was performed in a supine position, keeping the contralateral lower extremity straight and the ipsilateral hip and knee flexed to 90°. The thigh was stabilized, the lower leg grasped by the therapists' hand, and the knee was straightened gradually until a moderate pull was perceived in the posterior thigh region.

Prone quadriceps femoris muscle stretch:This stretch was performed in a prone position, keeping the ipsilateral knee fully flexed. The therapist grasped the distal end of the thigh and lifted it upward progressively until a moderate pull was perceived in the anterior region of the thigh.

Clinical examination

A proper clinical examination must be based on the following points:

Palpation.
Checking of ROM.
Stretching.
Functional manoeuvres.

Palpation

The palpation exam (PE) requires specific skill set and experience of the clinician. The PE shall be conducted in two ways:

PE mode 1: The patient is positioned in a way that the examined muscle is in a slightly elongated position (hence slightly contracted eccentrically).
PE mode 2: The muscle to be examined must be completely relaxed. The PE should be repeated several times, according to the two above-mentioned modalities, both on the entire muscle belly and on the area/point of pain indicated by the patient. The clinician should get information, obviously subjective, from the skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia and muscle. The PE should be performed, when applicable, in a comparative manner and in both modalities described above, exerting a moderate pressure, and in a proximal-distal direction and vice versa, always following the orientation of the fibres.

The PE aims to verify:

The tone of the muscles affected by the alleged lesion compared with the contralateral one. In addition, it is of utmost importance to check the tone of the muscles adjacent to the presumably injured one, as a tone alteration may suggest a high-grade lesion.
The presence of gap or clear muscle retraction.
The existence of stiff zones.
The existence of previous fibrotic areas or altered myofascial adhesion.
The existence of painful areas or otherwise impaired perception by the patient.

Checking of ROM

The ROM of the proximal and distal joints (when applicable) to the injured muscle should be checked (eg, hip and knee in case of a rectus femoris lesion).

Stretching

A stretching of the injured muscle should be performed in the following modalities:

Active modality.
Passive modality.

Generally, a structural lesion results in pain on both passive and active stretching, while in a functional pathology (such as the DOMS) stretching may provide a pleasant feeling to the patient.

Functional manoeuvres

The injured muscle should be tested in three ways:

Maximum isometric contraction.
Concentric contraction of medium intensity against the operator's resistance.
Medium effort eccentric contraction against operator's resistance with no pain.

Quantification (from 0 to 10) of the perceived pain in accordance with the visual analogue scalewill be required for each type of contraction.

Finally, in order to facilitate a summary of the main information of the clinical evaluation exam, CC proposes the adoption of two dedicated tabs of which we provide an example in online supplementary annex 1 and annex 2.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^115tgnSQ]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

Relevant History

The patient is a 90-year-old female with past medical history including a left sacral insufficiency fracture, thoracic vertebral compression fracture, and degenerative left medial meniscus tear, who presented with stabbing left lateral hip pain. The pain was chronic but had been progressing in severity over the past month. There was no inciting event or fall. The pain was exacerbated by lying on her left side and was affecting her sleep. At baseline, she ambulated with a rollator walker, but the pain was starting to limit her ability to walk. She had a history of low back and posterior left buttock pain, but she denied current pain in these regions. She also denied weakness or pain radiation into her lower extremities.

Relevant Physical Examination

On examination, she had no pain with lumbar or hip range of motion. She had full, symmetric, and pain-free lower extremity strength, and deep tendon reflexes and sensation to light touch were intact and symmetric in her lower extremities. She had a positive Trendelenburg sign with single-leg stance bilaterally, and she was tender to palpation over the left greater trochanter but not the right. Ober's, seated slump, and straight leg raise tests were negative. (See Figures 2 and 4 for descriptions of Ober's and the seated slump test.)

Figure 2
Ober's test: 1) The patient is positioned side-lying, and the leg to be tested is on top; the pelvis is stabilized perpendicular to the exam table by the examiner's hand; 2) The knee of the affected leg is passively flexed to 90°, and then the hip is passively stretched through abduction and extension (to position the iliotibial band behind the greater trochanter) by the examiner; (A) shows the view from above and (B) shows the anterior perspective; 3) The knee of the affected leg is allowed to slowly drop by gravity until reaching its final resting angle. If the final angle is greater than 0° when compared to the plane of the table (i.e. the hip is still abducted), Ober's test is positive; (C) highlights a negative Ober's test.

Imaging

Focused ultrasound performed by a musculoskeletal physiatrist with ultrasound training revealed evidence of bursitis of the left greater trochanter, which correlated with the patient's point of maximal tenderness.

### Pain sensitivity and torque used during measurement predicts change in range of motion at the knee [^117FKuKM]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Interventions

Control group

The control group (CG) continued with their regular activity, but was dissuaded from starting a flexibility program during the study period.

Stretch technique (static)

Our goal was to replicate what is "typically" done in a home stretching program, and we used the same technique described by Bandy et al, in their work. Participants stood on one leg with the other leg on a chair and the hip in neutral rotation. The participant maintained the pelvis in an anteriorly rotated (tilted) position and "head up", and bent the stance limb until a stretching sensation was felt in the back of the thigh. The participant was asked to maintain the position, without contracting the quadriceps, for 30 seconds and undertook two repetitions. In between each stretch, the participant was instructed to release the stretch position and stand prior to returning for the second stretch. Participants were given verbal and written instructions on performance of the interventions and a home-exercise log. Recommendations included undertaking the exercise in the morning and evening after a brief walk; stretching was to be done on both legs, every day for 8 weeks. However, participants were not observed when performing these exercises.

All participants were called by a research assistant once a week to ask if they had any questions about the program. Participants were encouraged to continue with whichever intervention had been assigned.

Follow-up testing

Follow-up testing was conducted at 1 month and then again at 2 months by the same evaluator who remained blinded to group assignment. ROM assessment and QST were carried out at each visit.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^115q2evU]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Orthopaedic trauma compartment syndrome — clinical diagnosis and the role of pressure measurement are summarized as follows: Compartment syndrome should be presumed until proven otherwise, and it can occur after relatively minor injuries to an extremity, even in the absence of fracture; patients who take anticoagulants, who have long periods of leg elevation, and those who have been "found down" after a prolonged period are at increased risk. In a patient that is awake with a normal sensorium, the diagnosis of compartment syndrome is best made by physical examination, classically marked by a constellation of clinical findings referred to as the "P's" of compartment syndrome, with paraesthesias, pain out of proportion to injury, and pain with passive stretch as reliable early findings; pain is typically the earliest and most pronounced, and worsening pain or pain refractory to medication warrants further examination, whereas in some patients paraesthesias may be the first detectable finding. Paralysis, pallor, and pulselessness are typically very late findings and may never be present, and the perceived "tightness" or "fullness" of the compartment has low diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Overall, clinical findings have low sensitivity and positive predictive value, but when more than two clinical findings are present the sensitivity and positive predictive value improve; despite exam insensitivity, a negative physical exam without a tense compartment is very helpful to rule out compartment syndrome. In the appropriate clinical context, the diagnosis of compartment syndrome should be made by physical exam, but in suspected cases with an unreliable or unobtainable exam, measuring intracompartmental pressures can be helpful; historically, absolute pressures from 30 to 45 mm Hg were considered diagnostic, although tissue perfusion is determined by the arteriovenous pressure gradient and depends on arterial blood pressure.

### Exercise training for intermittent claudication: a narrative review and summary of guidelines for practitioners [^113ED3xo]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Lower-limb peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in which the arteries that carry blood to the legs and feet become hardened, narrowed and/or obstructed by the build-up of atheroma.PAD is a common problem thought to affect over 200 million people worldwide. The total disease prevalence is approximately 13% of adults > 50 years old, with major risk factors including smoking, diabetes and dyslipidaemia.

The most classic symptom of PAD is intermittent claudication (IC). This is ischaemic muscle pain that usually presents in the calves (but can include the thighs or buttocks), is precipitated by exertion and relieved with rest (figure 1). This pain is thought to be due to a mismatch between the oxygen demand (of the working muscle) and an inadequate blood supply (due to the narrowed arterial pathway).

Figure 1
Intermittent claudication due to peripheral artery disease. Reproduced from Morlet et alwith permission from BMJ Publishing Group Ltd. Note: Iliac or femoral artery disease can cause symptoms at multiple distal muscle sites.

Although PAD is progressive (in the pathological sense), the clinical course is relatively stable. However, patients with PAD have a higher burden of cardiovascular disease and are at greater risk of major cardiovascular events. Another major issue for many patients is the severe decline in functional capacity (V̇O 2Peak) which are comparable to patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. The reduction in functional capacity is commonly caused by a decline in walking capacity, which may be up to less than 50% of healthy aged-matched controls. Factors influencing the walking distance or speed at which symptoms occur are multifactorial and include the site and severity of disease, walking pace, terrain, incline and footwear. These physical constraints in turn have negative connotations on patient's mental health and there are strong associations with depression, poor quality of life (QoL) and further avoidance of physical activity. This cycle of activity avoidance only leads to worsening functional ability and there is some evidence to suggest it also leads to an elevated mortality risk independent of disease severity and age.

### Managing patients with restless legs [^1135kB6r]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Estimates suggest that around 10–15% of adults have restless legs, or Ekbom syndrome. This condition is characterised by a range of uncomfortable and sometimes distressing motor and sensory symptoms during quiet wakefulness and/or sleep, such as feelings of burning, tickling or crawling, pain, cramping, numbness or weakness in the lower limbs, and, sometimes, also in the trunk and arms. The problem can seriously affect quality of life, yet is frequently dismissed as trivial. Often, it is unrecognised, incorrectly regarded as a neurosis, or managed poorly or not at all.

### Exercise for intermittent claudication [^111g1E77]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Exercise programmes are a relatively inexpensive, low-risk option compared with other, more invasive therapies for treatment of leg pain on walking (intermittent claudication (IC)). This is the fourth update of a review first published in 1998.

Objectives

Our goal was to determine whether an exercise programme was effective in alleviating symptoms and increasing walking treadmill distances and walking times in people with intermittent claudication. Secondary objectives were to determine whether exercise was effective in preventing deterioration of underlying disease, reducing cardiovascular events, and improving quality of life.

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Specialised Register (last searched 15 November 2016) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 10) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, along with trials registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of an exercise regimen versus control or versus medical therapy for people with IC due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We included any exercise programme or regimen used for treatment of IC, such as walking, skipping, and running. Inclusion of trials was not affected by duration, frequency, or intensity of the exercise programme. Outcome measures collected included treadmill walking distance (time to onset of pain or pain-free walking distance and maximum walking time or maximum walking distance), ankle brachial index (ABI), quality of life, morbidity, or amputation; if none of these was reported, we did not include the trial in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update (2017), RAL and AH selected trials and extracted data independently. We assessed study quality by using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We analysed continuous data by determining mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and dichotomous data by determining risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model unless we identified significant heterogeneity, in which case we used a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review.

Main Results

We included two new studies in this update and identified additional publications for previously included studies, bringing the total number of studies meeting the inclusion criteria to 32, and involving a total of 1835 participants with stable leg pain. The follow-up period ranged from two weeks to two years. Types of exercise varied from strength training to polestriding and upper or lower limb exercises; supervised sessions were generally held at least twice a week. Most trials used a treadmill walking test for one of the primary outcome measures. The methodological quality of included trials was moderate, mainly owing to absence of relevant information. Most trials were small and included 20 to 49 participants. Twenty-seven trials compared exercise versus usual care or placebo, and the five remaining trials compared exercise versus medication (pentoxifylline, iloprost, antiplatelet agents, and vitamin E) or pneumatic calf compression; we generally excluded people with various medical conditions or other pre-existing limitations to their exercise capacity. Meta-analysis from nine studies with 391 participants showed overall improvement in pain-free walking distance in the exercise group compared with the no exercise group (MD 82.11 m, 95% CI 71.73 to 92.48, P < 0.00001, high-quality evidence). Data also showed benefit from exercise in improved maximum walking distance (MD 120.36 m, 95% CI 50.79 to 189.92, P < 0.0007, high-quality evidence), as revealed by pooling data from 10 studies with 500 participants. Improvements were seen for up to two years. Exercise did not improve the ABI (MD 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.08, 13 trials, 570 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Limited data were available for the outcomes of mortality and amputation; trials provided no evidence of an effect of exercise, when compared with placebo or usual care, on mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.17, 5 trials, 540 participants, moderate-quality evidence) or amputation (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.15, 1 trial, 177 participants, low-quality evidence). Researchers measured quality of life using Short Form (SF)-36 at three and six months. At three months, the domains 'physical function', 'vitality', and 'role physical' improved with exercise; however this was a limited finding, as it was reported by only two trials. At six months, meta-analysis showed improvement in 'physical summary score' (MD 2.15, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.04, P = 0.02, 5 trials, 429 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and in 'mental summary score' (MD 3.76, 95% CI 2.70 to 4.82, P < 0.01, 4 trials, 343 participants, moderate-quality evidence) secondary to exercise. Two trials reported the remaining domains of the SF-36. Data showed improvements secondary to exercise in 'physical function' and 'general health'. The other domains - 'role physical', 'bodily pain', 'vitality', 'social', 'role emotional', and 'mental health' - did not show improvement at six months. Evidence was generally limited in trials comparing exercise versus antiplatelet therapy, pentoxifylline, iloprost, vitamin E, and pneumatic foot and calf compression owing to small numbers of trials and participants. Review authors used GRADE to assess the evidence presented in this review and determined that quality was moderate to high. Although results showed significant heterogeneity between trials, populations and outcomes were comparable overall, with findings relevant to the claudicant population. Results were pooled for large sample sizes - over 300 participants for most outcomes - using reproducible methods.

Authors' Conclusions

High-quality evidence shows that exercise programmes provided important benefit compared with placebo or usual care in improving both pain-free and maximum walking distance in people with leg pain from IC who were considered to be fit for exercise intervention. Exercise did not improve ABI, and we found no evidence of an effect of exercise on amputation or mortality. Exercise may improve quality of life when compared with placebo or usual care. As time has progressed, the trials undertaken have begun to include exercise versus exercise or other modalities; therefore we can include fewer of the new trials in this update.

### Supervised walking exercise therapy improves gait biomechanics in patients with peripheral artery disease [^1156Fmcq]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

In patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), supervised exercise therapy is a first line of treatment because it increases maximum walking distances comparable with surgical revascularization therapy. Little is known regarding gait biomechanics after supervised exercise therapy. This study characterized the effects of supervised exercise therapy on gait biomechanics and walking distances in claudicating patients with PAD.

Methods

Forty-seven claudicating patients with PAD underwent gait analysis before and immediately after 6 months of supervised exercise therapy. Exercise sessions consisted of a 5-minute warmup of mild walking and stretching of upper and lower leg muscles, 50 minutes of intermittent treadmill walking, and 5 minutes of cooldown (similar to warmup) three times per week. Measurements included self-perceived ambulatory limitations measured by questionnaire, the ankle-brachial index (ABI), walking distance measures, maximal plantar flexor strength measured by isometric dynamometry, and overground gait biomechanics trials performed before and after the onset of claudication pain. Paired t-tests were used to test for differences in quality of life, walking distances, ABI, and maximal strength. A two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance determined differences for intervention and condition for gait biomechanics dependent variables.

Results

After supervised exercise therapy, quality of life, walking distances, and maximal plantar flexor strength improved, although the ABI did not significantly change. Several gait biomechanics parameters improved after the intervention, including torque and power generation at the ankle and hip. Similar to previous studies, the onset of claudication pain led to a worsening gait or a gait that was less like healthy individuals with a pain-free gait.

Conclusions

Six months of supervised exercise therapy produced increases in walking distances and quality of life that are consistent with concurrent improvements in muscle strength and gait biomechanics. These improvements occurred even though the ABI did not improve. Future work should examine the benefits of supervised exercise therapy used in combination with other available treatments for PAD.

### Can loss of muscle spindle afferents explain the ataxic gait in riley-day syndrome? [^116vSYKF]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

The Riley-Day syndrome is the most common of the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (Type III). Among the well-recognized clinical features are reduced pain and temperature sensation, absent deep tendon reflexes and a progressively ataxic gait. To explain the latter we tested the hypothesis that muscle spindles, or their afferents, are absent in hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy III by attempting to record from muscle spindle afferents from a nerve supplying the leg in 10 patients. For comparison we also recorded muscle spindles from 15 healthy subjects and from two patients with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy IV, who have profound sensory disturbances but no ataxia. Tungsten microelectrodes were inserted percutaneously into fascicles of the common peroneal nerve at the fibular head. Intraneural stimulation within muscle fascicles evoked twitches at normal stimulus currents (10–30 µA), and deep pain (which often referred) at high intensities (1 mA). Microneurographic recordings from muscle fascicles revealed a complete absence of spontaneously active muscle spindles in patients with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy III; moreover, responses to passive muscle stretch could not be observed. Conversely, muscle spindles appeared normal in patients with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy IV, with mean firing rates of spontaneously active endings being similar to those recorded from healthy controls. Intraneural stimulation within cutaneous fascicles evoked paraesthesiae in the fascicular innervation territory at normal stimulus intensities, but cutaneous pain was never reported during high-intensity stimulation in any of the patients. Microneurographic recordings from cutaneous fascicles revealed the presence of normal large-diameter cutaneous mechanoreceptors in hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy III. Our results suggest that the complete absence of functional muscle spindles in these patients explains their loss of deep tendon reflexes. Moreover, we suggest that their ataxic gait is sensory in origin, due to the loss of functional muscle spindles and hence a compromised sensorimotor control of locomotion.

### Pain experience and sensory changes in astronauts during and after short-lasting commercial spaceflight: a proof-of-concept study [^115G4T9f]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Qualitative Interview

Participant 2 shared his perspective on previous experiences with pain, describing them as "pretty average", often related to injuries, with his most recent being a tibia fracture four years ago. During his space training program, he encountered pain and soreness in his tibia, depending on his level of exercise, standing, and walking. This discomfort became "predictable" over time.

Once exposed to microgravity, Participant 2 recounted experiencing "fairly significant lower back pain early on" and also mentioned pain in his left iliotibial band. Upon return to Earth, he described pain in his distal tibia, especially when getting up from a chair or after being off his right leg for a while.

When I said pre-flight that the pain became predictable, it is fairly painful when I get up in the morning or when I get up out of a chair or something that I'm off my right leg for a while, the first few steps are quite painful. And effectively, I was off my right leg for seventeen days, so coming back from that was really pretty uncomfortable for I would say, 24 to 36 hours.

To manage his pain, Participant 2 self-administered anti-inflammatory medication for his iliotibial band pain during the initial days aboard the ISS. He found stretching helpful in alleviating low back pain: "it's very helpful to stretch and to actually wrap something around your lower back and your knees, kind of pull your knees to your chest". Sleeping in this position also provided relief. At the time of the interview, eight days after splashdown, he was still using anti-inflammatories to manage his pain.

Furthermore, when asked if he wanted to add anything, Participant 2 expressed that the questionnaires provided during the study were not very helpful in identifying or characterizing his experience accurately. While he answered truthfully, the questionnaires "didn't capture [his] experience very well" and he was not sure they were "very reflective of the experience [he] was having". He questioned their suitability for space travelers, citing an example of a questionnaire asking about pain interfering with housework. Despite this, he acknowledged the value of the interview in providing additional context to the questionnaire responses. This insight highlights the challenges in assessing and characterizing pain experiences in the unique environment of spaceflight.

### Exercise for intermittent claudication [^112Ey3Bs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Exercise programmes are a relatively inexpensive, low-risk option compared with other more invasive therapies for leg pain on walking (intermittent claudication (IC)). This is an update of a review first published in 1998.

Objectives

The prime objective of this review was to determine whether an exercise programme in people with intermittent claudication was effective in alleviating symptoms and increasing walking treadmill distances and walking times. Secondary objectives were to determine whether exercise was effective in preventing deterioration of underlying disease, reducing cardiovascular events and improving quality of life.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched September 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 8).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of an exercise regimen versus control or versus medical therapy in people with IC due to peripheral arterial disease. Any exercise programme or regimen used in the treatment of intermittent claudication was included, such as walking, skipping and running. Inclusion of trials was not affected by the duration, frequency or intensity of the exercise programme. Outcome measures collected included treadmill walking distance (time to onset of pain or pain-free walking distance and maximum walking time or maximal walking distance), ankle brachial index (ABI), quality of life, morbidity or amputation; if none of these were reported the trial was not included in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Eleven additional studies were included in this update making a total of 30 trials which met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 1816 participants with stable leg pain. The follow-up period ranged from two weeks to two years. The types of exercise varied from strength training to polestriding and upper or lower limb exercises; generally supervised sessions were at least twice a week. Most trials used a treadmill walking test for one of the outcome measures. Quality of the included trials was moderate, mainly due to an absence of relevant information. The majority of trials were small with 20 to 49 participants. Twenty trials compared exercise with usual care or placebo, the remainder of the trials compared exercise to medication (pentoxifylline, iloprost, antiplatelet agents and vitamin E) or pneumatic calf compression; people with various medical conditions or other pre-existing limitations to their exercise capacity were generally excluded. Overall, when taking the first time point reported in each of the studies, exercise significantly improved maximal walking time when compared with usual care or placebo: mean difference (MD) 4.51 minutes (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.11 to 5.92) with an overall improvement in walking ability of approximately 50% to 200%. Walking distances were also significantly improved: pain-free walking distance MD 82.29 metres (95% CI 71.86 to 92.72) and maximum walking distance MD 108.99 metres (95% CI 38.20 to 179.78). Improvements were seen for up to two years, and subgroup analyses were performed at three, six and 12 months where possible. Exercise did not improve the ABI (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.09). The effect of exercise, when compared with placebo or usual care, was inconclusive on mortality, amputation and peak exercise calf blood flow due to limited data. No data were given on non-fatal cardiovascular events. Quality of life measured using the Short Form (SF)-36 was reported at three and six months. At three months, physical function, vitality and role physical all significantly improved with exercise, however this was a limited finding as this measure was only reported in two trials. At six months five trials reported outcomes of a significantly improved physical summary score and mental summary score secondary to exercise. Only two trials reported improvements in other domains, physical function and general health. Evidence was generally limited for exercise compared with antiplatelet therapy, pentoxifylline, iloprost, vitamin E and pneumatic foot and calf compression due to small numbers of trials and participants.

Authors' Conclusions

Exercise programmes are of significant benefit compared with placebo or usual care in improving walking time and distance in people with leg pain from IC who were considered to be fit for exercise intervention.

### Pain fluctuations of women with subacute herpetic neuralgia during local methylcobalamin in combination with lidocaine treatment: a single-blinded randomized controlled trial [^114V7ufE]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

To be more in line with the limb movement characteristics of women in this age group, the walking ability and normal work of ZBPI-QoL were replaced with a variety of unconstrained body activities associated with daily living and housework (higher ADLs). Referring to the 8 items of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), we divide usually 10 weight-bearing movements into three levels, namely, light level (including self-bath; defecation difficulty; taking a bus for more than 30 minutes; intentional chest-expanding or upper extremity stretch exercises), medium level (such as cutting and cooking; washing coats; hanging and sunning coats or quilts) and high-intensity level (walking more than 500 meters with heavy objects [≥ 2.5 kg]; cleaning the house and mopping the floor; driving a car or riding a battery motorcycle for more than 30 minutes). The patients were inquired if they did any of these ADLs, then these ADLs were coded as 3 (high-intensity level), 2, 1, and 0, respectively.

We also recorded the patient's sleep time and quality by self-reported to replace the sleep component of ZBPI-QoL scores. The participants were asked how many hours per night and day they slept. Total diurnal sleeping time was categorized into < 1h, 1–2h, 2–3h, and > 4h of sleep, respectively. "How does pain interfere with your sleep in the past day?" The answer options are "difficulty falling asleep due to pain", "unable to fall asleep after waking up due to pain", "continue to fall asleep after waking up due to pain", and "able to sleep without being woken up" (Combine with sleep time and quality, coded as 3, 2, 1, and 0, respectively). Participants answered the question to address the perceived acute effect of pain on sleep.

### Heel pad syndrome… [^117Q5M7j]. Wikipedia (2015). Low credibility.

Heel pad syndrome is a pain that occurs in the center of the heel. There are many causes, but a mechanical etiology is most common: risk factors include obesity. Other conditions with similar symptoms include plantar fasciitis. Treatment includes rest, pain medication, and heel cups. It becomes more common with age. Signs and symptoms
- Pain in the heel, usually on the middle of the heel. This is in direct contrast to plantar fascia pain or heel spur pain which is present at the front of the heel, not the middle.
- Pain is usually a deep, dull ache that feels like a bruise.
- Pressing with the thumb into the centre of the heel should re-create the pain.
- Condition can often be attributed to a blow to the heel – landing hard while barefoot on a hard surface, jumping in dress shoes with a hard heel, stepping on a stone while running.
- Pain is aggravated by walking barefoot on hard surfaces like ceramic tile, concrete, hardwood floors, etc.

Diagnosis The main differential diagnosis of heel pad syndrome is plantar fasciitis. In heel pad syndrome all parts of the heel are tender while in plantar fasciitis typically only the part of the heel closer to the toes is sore. Treatment Manual therapy and exercise have better efficacy in the long term than electrophysical agents and exercise for function, but not for pain. Manual therapy and exercise are preferably focused at stretching the plantar fascia. Foot orthoses however do not appear to help with heel pain. References External links.

### Shin splints [^111QYL3u]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

A shin splint, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome, is pain along the inside edge of the shinbone due to inflammation of tissue in the area. Generally this is between the middle of the lower leg and the ankle. The pain may be dull or sharp, and is generally brought on by high-impact exercise that overloads the tibia. It generally resolves during periods of rest. Complications may include stress fractures. Shin splints typically occur due to excessive physical activity. Groups that are commonly affected include runners, dancers, gymnasts, and military personnel. The underlying mechanism is not entirely clear. Diagnosis is generally based on the symptoms, with medical imaging done to rule out other possible causes. Shin splints are generally treated by rest followed by a gradual return to exercise over a period of weeks. Other measures such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cold packs, physical therapy, and compression may be used.

Shoe insoles may help some people. Surgery is rarely required, but may be done if other measures are not effective. Rates of shin splints in at-risk groups range from 4% to 35%. The condition occurs more often in women. It was first described in 1958. Signs and symptoms Shin splint pain is described as a recurring dull ache, sometimes becoming an intense pain, along the inner part of the lower two-thirds of the tibia. The pain increases during exercise, and some individuals experience swelling in the pain area. In contrast, stress fracture pain is localized to the fracture site. Women are several times more likely to progress to stress fractures from shin splints. This is due in part to women having a higher incidence of diminished bone density and osteoporosis. Causes Shin splints typically occur due to excessive physical activity. Groups that are commonly affected include runners, dancers, and military personnel.

Risk factors for developing shin splints include:

- Flat feet or rigid arches
- Being overweight
- Excessively tight calf muscles
- Engaging the anti-pronatory muscles in excessive amounts of eccentric muscle activity
- Undertaking high-impact exercises on hard, non-compliant surfaces People who have previously had shin splints are more likely to have them again. Pathophysiology While the exact mechanism is unknown, shin splints can be attributed to the overloading of the lower leg due to biomechanical irregularities resulting in an increase in stress exerted on the tibia. A sudden increase in intensity or frequency in activity level fatigues muscles too quickly to help shock absorption properly, forcing the tibia to absorb most of the impact. Lack of cushioning footwear, especially on hard surfaces, does not absorb transmitting forces while running or jumping.

This stress is associated with the onset of shin splints. Muscle imbalance, including weak core muscles, inflexibility and tightness of lower leg muscles, including the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantar muscles can increase the possibility of shin splints. The pain associated with shin splints is caused from a disruption of Sharpey's fibres that connect the medial soleus fascia through the periosteum of the tibia where it inserts into the bone. With repetitive stress, the impact forces eccentrically fatigue the soleus and create repeated tibial bending or bowing, contributing to shin splints. The impact is made worse by running uphill, downhill, on uneven terrain, or on hard surfaces. Improper footwear, including worn-out shoes, can also contribute to shin splints. Diagnosis Shin splints are generally diagnosed from a history and physical examination.

### Sacroiliac joint dysfunction… [^115Q9jz8]. Wikipedia (2011). Low credibility.

The term sacroiliac joint dysfunction refers to abnormal motion in the sacroiliac joint, either too much motion or too little motion, that causes pain in this region. Signs and symptoms Common symptoms include lower back pain, buttocks pain, sciatic leg pain, groin pain, hip pain, urinary frequency, and "transient numbness, prickling, or tingling". Pain can range from dull aching to sharp and stabbing and increases with physical activity. Symptoms also worsen with prolonged or sustained positions. Bending forward, stair climbing, hill climbing, and rising from a seated position can also provoke pain. Pain can increase during menstruation in women. People with severe and disabling sacroiliac joint dysfunction can develop insomnia and depression.

Sacral rotation can be transmitted distally down the kinematic chain and, if left untreated over a long period of time, may lead to severe Achilles tendinitis. As many as 58% of people diagnosed with sacroiliac joint pain had some inciting traumatic injury based on clinical examination findings. The joint that was once stabilized by strong ligaments, now overly stretched, sprained, or torn, will move beyond its normal range. This is thought to result in the ilium and sacral surfaces "locking" in an incongruent or asymmetrical fashion causing pain that can be debilitating. In some people, the sacroiliac joints reverse the normal concave-convex 'locking' relationship, which can lead to rotational misalignment. The variation in joint configuration results in some sacroiliac joints being inherently weaker or more prone to misalignment.

Certain biomechanical or muscle length imbalances may ultimately predispose a person to sacroiliac dysfunction and pain. Likely, this is a result of altered gait patterns and repetitive stress to the SI joint and related structures. These conditions exist in persons with leg-length inequality, scoliosis, a history of polio, poor-quality footwear, and hip osteoarthritis. Patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction can also develop tightness and dysfunction in the hamstring, quadriceps, iliotibial tract and hip flexors, including the psoas muscle. Individuals with severe and long-standing sacroiliac joint dysfunction can develop muscle deconditioning and atrophy throughout the body due to limitation of activities and exercise that bring about pain in the low back. There is a new imaging test SPECT/CT which can sometimes detect sacroiliac joint dysfunction.

There is also a lack of evidence that sacroiliac joint mobility maneuvers detect motion abnormalities. Given the inherent technical limitations of the visible and palpable signs from these sacroiliac joint mobility maneuvers another broad category of clinical signs have been described called provocative maneuvers. These maneuvers are designed to reproduce or increase pain emanating within the sacroiliac joint.
- Gaenslen test
- This pain provocation test applies torsion to the joint. With one hip flexed onto the abdomen, the other leg is allowed to dangle off the edge of the table. Pressure should then be directed downward on the leg in order to achieve hip extension and stress the sacroiliac joint.
- FABER or Patrick test
- To identify if pain may come from the sacroiliac joint during flexion, abduction, and external rotation, the clinician externally rotates the hip while the patient lies supine.

### Signs and symptoms… [^114jnDpk]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Intermittent claudication, also known as vascular claudication, is a symptom that describes muscle pain on mild exertion, classically in the calf muscle, which occurs during exercise, such as walking, and is relieved by a short period of rest. It is classically associated with early-stage peripheral artery disease, and can progress to critical limb ischemia unless treated or risk factors are modified and maintained. Claudication derives from Latin claudicare 'to limp'. Signs and symptoms One of the hallmarks of arterial claudication is that it occurs intermittently. It disappears after a very brief rest and the patient can start walking again until the pain recurs.

The following signs are general signs of atherosclerosis of the lower extremity arteries:

- cyanosis
- atrophic changes like loss of hair, shiny skin
- decreased temperature
- decreased pulse
- redness when limb is returned to a "dependent" position. The six "P"s of ischemia
- Pain
- Pallor
- Pulse
- Perishing cold
- Paraesthesia
- Paralysis. Causes Most commonly, intermittent claudication is due to peripheral arterial disease which implies significant atherosclerotic blockages resulting in arterial insufficiency. Other uncommon causes are coarctation of the aorta, Trousseau disease and Buerger's disease, in which vasculitis occurs. Raynaud's phenomenon functional vasospasm. It is distinct from neurogenic claudication, which is associated with lumbar spinal stenosis. It is strongly associated with smoking, hypertension, and diabetes.

Diagnosis Intermittent claudication is a symptom and is by definition diagnosed by a patient reporting a history of leg pain with walking relieved by rest. However, as other conditions such as sciatica can mimic intermittent claudication, testing is often performed to confirm the diagnosis of peripheral artery disease. Magnetic resonance angiography and duplex ultrasonography appear to be slightly more cost-effective in diagnosing peripheral artery disease among people with intermittent claudication than projectional angiography. Treatment Exercise can improve symptoms, as can revascularization. Both together may be better than one intervention of its own. Supervised exercise improves maximum walking distance and pain-free walking distance more than home based exercise. Although when monitoring is included in home based exercise programmes similar changes in pain-free walking distance are observed in both supervised and home based exercise.

In people with stable leg pain, exercise, such as strength training, pole-striding and upper or lower limb exercises, compared to usual care or placebo improves maximum walking time, pain-free walking distance and maximum walking distance. Alternative exercise modes, such as cycling, strength training and upper-arm ergometry compared to supervised walking programmes showed no difference in maximum walking distance or pain-free walking distance for people with intermittent claudication. Pharmacological options exist, as well. Medicines that control lipid profile, diabetes, and hypertension may increase blood flow to the affected muscles and allow for increased activity levels. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, adrenergic agents such as alpha-1 blockers and beta-blockers and alpha-2 agonists, antiplatelet agents, naftidrofuryl, pentoxifylline, and cilostazol are used for the treatment of intermittent claudication.

### Delayed onset muscle soreness [^115eLbMx]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Delayed onset muscle soreness is the pain and stiffness felt in muscles after unaccustomed or strenuous exercise. The soreness is felt most strongly 24 to 72 hours after the exercise. It is thought to be caused by eccentric exercise, which causes small-scale damage to the muscle fibers. After such exercise, the muscle adapts rapidly to prevent muscle damage, and thereby soreness, if the exercise is repeated. Delayed onset muscle soreness is one symptom of exercise-induced muscle damage. The other is acute muscle soreness, which appears during and immediately after exercise. Signs and symptoms The soreness is perceived as a dull, aching pain in the affected muscle, often combined with tenderness and stiffness. The pain is typically felt only when the muscle is stretched, contracted or put under pressure, not when it is at rest. This tenderness, a characteristic symptom of DOMS, is also referred to as "muscular mechanical hyperalgesia".

Although there is variance among exercises and individuals, the soreness from DOMS usually increases in intensity in the first 24 hours after exercise. It peaks from 24 to 72 hours, then subsides and disappears up to seven days after exercise. Cause Muscle soreness is caused by eccentric exercise, that is, exercise consisting of eccentric contractions of the muscle. Isometric exercise causes much less soreness, and concentric exercise causes none. Mechanism The mechanism of delayed onset muscle soreness is not completely understood, but the pain is ultimately thought to be a result of microtrauma — mechanical damage at a very small scale — to the muscles being exercised. The soreness has been attributed to the increased tension force and muscle lengthening from eccentric exercise. This may cause the actin and myosin cross-bridges to separate prior to relaxation, ultimately causing greater tension on the remaining active motor units.

This increases the risk of broadening, smearing, and damage to the sarcomere. When microtrauma occurs to these structures, nociceptors within the muscle's connective tissues are stimulated and cause a sensation of pain. Another explanation for the pain associated with DOMS is the "enzyme efflux" theory. Following microtrauma, calcium that is normally stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum accumulates in the damaged muscles. Cellular respiration is inhibited and ATP needed to actively transport calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum is produced at a lower rate. This accumulation of calcium may activate proteases and phospholipases which in turn break down and degenerate muscle protein. This causes inflammation, and in turn pain due to the accumulation of histamines, prostaglandins, and potassium. An earlier theory posited that DOMS is connected to the build-up of lactic acid in the blood, which was thought to continue being produced following exercise.

This build-up of lactic acid was thought to be a toxic metabolic waste product that caused the perception of pain at a delayed stage. This theory has been largely rejected, as concentric contractions which also produce lactic acid have been unable to cause DOMS. Additionally, lactic acid is known from multiple studies to return to normal levels within one hour of exercise, and therefore cannot cause the pain that occurs much later. Relation to other effects Although delayed onset muscle soreness is a symptom associated with muscle damage, its magnitude does not necessarily reflect the magnitude of muscle damage. Soreness is one of the temporary changes caused in muscles by unaccustomed eccentric exercise. Other such changes include decreased muscle strength, reduced range of motion, and muscle swelling. It has been shown, however, that these changes develop independently in time from one another and that the soreness is therefore not the cause of the reduction in muscle function.

### Sciatica… [^116Tbn3f]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Sciatica is pain going down the leg from the lower back. This pain may extend down the back, outside, or front of the leg. Onset is often sudden following activities such as heavy lifting, though gradual onset may also occur. The pain is often described as shooting. Typically, symptoms occur on only one side of the body; certain causes, however, may result in pain on both sides. Lower back pain is sometimes present. Weakness or numbness may occur in various parts of the affected leg and foot. The test is positive if, when the leg is raised while a person is lying on their back, pain shoots below the knee. In most cases medical imaging is not needed. However, imaging may be obtained if bowel or bladder function is affected, there is significant loss of feeling or weakness, symptoms are long standing, or there is a concern for tumor or infection. Conditions that can present similarly are diseases of the hip and infections such as early shingles.

Initial treatment typically involves pain medications. However, evidence for effectiveness of pain medication, and of muscle relaxants, is lacking. It is generally recommended that people continue with normal activity to the best of their abilities. Often all that is required for resolution of sciatica is time; in about 90% of cases, symptoms resolve in less than six weeks. If the pain is severe and lasts for more than six weeks, surgery may be an option. While surgery often speeds pain improvement, its long term benefits are unclear. Surgery may be required if complications occur, such as loss of normal bowel or bladder function. Many treatments, including corticosteroids, gabapentin, pregabalin, acupuncture, heat or ice, and spinal manipulation, have only limited or poor evidence supporting their use. Definition The term "sciatica" usually describes a symptom — pain along the sciatic nerve pathway — rather than a specific condition, illness, or disease.

Some use it to mean any pain starting in the lower back and going down the leg. The pain is characteristically described as shooting or shock-like, quickly traveling along the course of the affected nerves. Others use the term as a diagnosis for nerve dysfunction caused by compression of one or more lumbar or sacral nerve roots from a spinal disc herniation. Pain typically occurs in the distribution of a dermatome and goes below the knee to the foot. It may be associated with neurological dysfunction, such as weakness and numbness. Spinal stenosis Other compressive spinal causes include lumbar spinal stenosis, a condition in which the spinal canal, the space the spinal cord runs through, narrows and compresses the spinal cord, cauda equina, or sciatic nerve roots.

This narrowing can be caused by bone spurs, spondylolisthesis, inflammation, or a herniated disc, which decreases available space for the spinal cord, thus pinching and irritating nerves from the spinal cord that become the sciatic nerve. This is the most frequent cause after age 50. Sciatic pain due to spinal stenosis is most commonly brought on by standing, walking, or sitting for extended periods of time, and reduces when bending forward. However, pain can arise with any position or activity in severe cases. The pain is most commonly relieved by rest. Piriformis syndrome Piriformis syndrome is a condition that, depending on the analysis, varies from a "very rare" cause to contributing up to 8% of low back or buttock pain. In 17% of people, the sciatic nerve runs through the piriformis muscle rather than beneath it. When the piriformis shortens or spasms due to trauma or overuse, it is posited that this causes compression of the sciatic nerve.
