## Question

managment of tinea barbae

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of tinea barbae. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing tinea barbae from look-alikes. Then, I should verify the principle that systemic therapy is required and why. Next, I will select first-line and alternative oral agents with dosing and duration, and I need to check for any nuances in adults versus children. After that, I should consider adjunctive topical measures and infection control. I will then outline monitoring and endpoints, including what to do if treatment fails. Finally, I should review special scenarios like steroid-induced tinea incognito, zoonotic sources, and antifungal resistance, and close with a concise, practical algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions based on appearance alone, because tinea barbae can mimic bacterial folliculitis, pseudofolliculitis barbae, acneiform eruptions, or even herpetic folliculitis. I should obtain KOH microscopy and fungal culture from beard-area hairs and skin scrapings to identify the dermatophyte and guide therapy, and I should remember that tinea barbae often follows animal exposure or prior topical steroid use, which can modify the clinical picture and delay recognition [^111wddq7] [^116WMR8D] [^116sHXuC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about topical therapy. I need to ensure I anchor the treatment principle correctly: because tinea barbae involves infected hair shafts and follicles, topical agents alone cannot eradicate the infection, so systemic antifungal therapy is required, and this principle is consistently reflected in guidance for hair-involved tinea such as tinea capitis and tinea barbae, with FDA labeling explicitly supporting systemic griseofulvin for tinea barbae [^111wddq7] [^115JK63G] [^115GPHap].

> Now, for first-line systemic therapy, I should double-check dosing and duration. Griseofulvin remains a standard option, with microsized griseofulvin 500 mg orally daily for 4–8 weeks in adults, or ultramicrosized griseofulvin 375 mg daily for 4–8 weeks, noting that ultramicrosize has improved bioavailability and may be better tolerated, and I should confirm that the organism is a susceptible dermatophyte before committing to prolonged therapy [^115GPHap] [^116wdZ35].

> Wait, let me verify the role of terbinafine as an alternative. Although much of the comparative efficacy data derive from tinea capitis, terbinafine is widely used for hair-involved dermatophytoses and is reasonable for tinea barbae, typically 250 mg daily for 2–4 weeks, with the advantage of shorter courses and fungicidal activity. I should also consider that some clinicians extend to 4–6 weeks for deep or inflammatory disease, even though the strongest evidence base is in tinea capitis rather than tinea barbae per se [^111otfS3] [^111DXT7n] [^1172AFNR].

> I need to check second-line options and when to pivot. Itraconazole 100–200 mg daily for 2–4 weeks is a reasonable alternative, particularly when griseofulvin is unavailable or not tolerated, and fluconazole can be considered in select cases, though data are more limited. If there is no clinical improvement after 2–4 weeks, I should reassess adherence, absorption, the diagnosis, and the possibility of resistance before switching agents or extending therapy [^113HdeFH] [^117XGKpg].

> Let me consider pediatric dosing briefly, even though tinea barbae is uncommon in children. If it occurs, weight-based regimens mirror tinea capitis protocols, with griseofulvin 20–25 mg/kg/day for 6–8 weeks and terbinafine weight-tiered dosing of 62.5 mg, 125 mg, or 250 mg daily for 2–4 weeks, ensuring adequate duration to clear hair involvement and confirming mycologic cure before stopping [^111DXT7n].

> Next, I should review adjunctive measures. While systemic therapy is essential, I can reduce spore burden and transmission with topical antiseptic or antifungal shampoos such as selenium sulfide 2.5% or ketoconazole 2% applied to the beard area for 5 minutes several times weekly for 2–4 weeks, and I should advise meticulous hygiene, avoiding shared razors, towels, and beard-care items, plus laundering bedding and clothing, especially if there is household or animal exposure [^112Yr8re] [^1111eGKS] [^115iMCiz].

> I will now examine monitoring and endpoints. I should confirm clinical improvement within 2–4 weeks and, importantly, treat until mycologic cure is achieved rather than stopping at purely clinical resolution, so repeating KOH and culture to document clearance is prudent, and if the patient improves but mycology remains positive, I should extend therapy by 2–4 additional weeks before switching agents [^111bbrVQ] [^117XGKpg].

> But wait, what if treatment fails or the presentation is atypical? I need to ensure I consider tinea incognito from prior topical steroids, which can mask and worsen disease, and I should screen for zoonotic exposures such as cattle, horses, or hedgehogs that carry Trichophyton verrucosum or T. mentagrophytes var. erinacei, and in refractory or epidemic contexts I should consider antifungal resistance, particularly Trichophyton indotineae, where itraconazole may outperform terbinafine and susceptibility patterns can guide therapy [^116sHXuC] [^116WMR8D] [^117GSVi8].

> Let me reconsider a potential pitfall: I initially thought to try a short course of topical terbinafine alone for a small, early lesion, but hold on, I should verify that this would be inadequate for hair-shaft involvement. The mechanistic requirement for systemic therapy in tinea barbae remains, so even limited disease warrants an oral agent rather than topical monotherapy, reserving topicals as adjuncts to reduce spore shedding [^111wddq7] [^115JK63G].

> To synthesize a practical algorithm, I should confirm the diagnosis with KOH and culture, start systemic therapy tailored to availability and tolerance with griseofulvin 500 mg daily for 4–8 weeks or terbinafine 250 mg daily for 2–4 weeks, add adjunctive topical shampoos and strict hygiene, reassess clinically and mycologically at 2–4 weeks, extend therapy if mycology is still positive, and if there is no improvement, re-evaluate adherence, absorption, the diagnosis, animal exposure, and resistance before switching to itraconazole or fluconazole and considering culture-directed susceptibility testing [^115GPHap] [^111DXT7n] [^111bbrVQ] [^116sHXuC].

---

Tinea barbae requires **systemic antifungal therapy** because topical agents cannot penetrate the hair shaft [^111wddq7] [^112TyWPo]. First-line options are **terbinafine 250 mg daily for 2–4 weeks** or **griseofulvin 500 mg daily for 4–8 weeks**; itraconazole 200 mg daily for 4–6 weeks is an alternative if first-line agents are unsuitable [^115GPHap]. Topical antifungals (e.g. terbinafine 1% cream) may be added for local control but are not sufficient alone [^112TyWPo]. Treatment should continue at least 1 week after clinical clearance, and mycological cure should be confirmed with repeat KOH/culture [^111bbrVQ]. Avoid topical corticosteroids to prevent tinea incognito and worsening infection [^113QBoZe].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

Before initiating therapy, **confirm the diagnosis** with KOH microscopy and fungal culture to identify the causative dermatophyte and guide treatment [^115k4zc7] [^111Cdt6L]. Common pathogens include Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Microsporum canis [^116WMR8D].

---

## Systemic antifungal therapy

Systemic therapy is **essential** because topical agents cannot penetrate the hair shaft [^114tHuQ3] [^115JK63G].

| **Antifungal agent** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Terbinafine | 250 mg orally once daily | 2–4 weeks | First-line; shorter course; well tolerated [^111DXT7n] [^111otfS3] |
| Griseofulvin | 500 mg orally once daily | 4–8 weeks | Alternative; longer course; monitor LFTs [^116ZKjv4] [^111DXT7n] |
| Itraconazole | 200 mg orally once daily | 4–6 weeks | Alternative; monitor LFTs; drug interactions [^113zajmk] |

---

Continue treatment for **at least 1 week after clinical clearance** to reduce recurrence risk [^1138Uspt].

---

## Adjunctive topical therapy

Topical antifungals may be used as adjuncts for local control but are **not sufficient alone** [^115JK63G] [^117T4L2E]. Options include terbinafine 1% cream or itraconazole 1% solution applied once or twice daily for 2–4 weeks.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is **necessary** to assess response and adherence. Confirm mycological cure with repeat KOH preparation and culture at the end of therapy [^111bbrVQ].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Patient education on **hygiene** and **reinfection** prevention is critical:

- Avoid sharing razors, towels, and personal items [^115iMCiz].
- Disinfect shaving equipment regularly.
- Treat infected animals to prevent zoonotic transmission [^115FMUfY].

---

## Management of treatment failure

If treatment fails, **evaluate adherence**, absorption, and the possibility of reinfection or resistance [^117XGKpg]. Consider switching to an alternative systemic antifungal or extending the treatment duration [^117XGKpg].

---

## Special considerations

Avoid **topical corticosteroids**, which can worsen infection and cause tinea incognito [^116sHXuC]. Immunocompromised patients may require longer treatment courses and closer monitoring.

---

Tinea barbae is best managed with **systemic antifungal therapy**, with terbinafine or griseofulvin as first-line options. Adjunctive topical therapy and patient education are important, and treatment should continue beyond clinical clearance with mycological confirmation of cure.

### Skin disorders, including pyoderma, scabies, and tinea infections [^115F47Qf]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Pyoderma, scabies, and tinea are common childhood skin disorders too often considered to be merely of nuisance value. More than 111 million children are believed to have pyoderma, with many also co-infected with scabies, tinea, or both. These skin disorders cannot be differentiated by ethnicity or socioeconomic status but, in high-prevalence areas, poverty and overcrowded living conditions are important underlying social determinants. Each is transmitted primarily through direct skin-to-skin contact. For many Indigenous children, these skin conditions are part of everyday life. Although rarely directly resulting in hospitalization or death, there is a high and largely unmet demand for effective management at the primary health-care level, particularly for pyoderma and scabies. Despite particularly high prevalence in some settings, treatment is not sought for many children, and when sought, the clinical benefit from such consultations is variable. The lack of standard, evidence-based recommendations is of much concern. The current evidence base for clinical diagnosis and treatment of these common childhood skin disorders is highlighted.

### Guidelines for the management of tinea capitis in children [^1152Fr5e]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Practice guidelines for the treatment of tinea capitis (TC) from the European Society for Pediatric Dermatology are presented. Tinea capitis always requires systemic treatment because topical antifungal agents do not penetrate the hair follicle. Topical treatment is only used as adjuvant therapy to systemic antifungals. The newer oral antifungal agents including terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole appear to have efficacy rates and potential adverse effects similar to those of griseofulvin in children with TC caused by Trichophyton species, while requiring a much shorter duration of treatment. They may be, however, more expensive (Grading of recommendation A; strength of evidence 1a). Griseofulvin is still the treatment of choice for cases caused by Microsporum species. Its efficacy is superior to that of terbinafine (Grading of recommendation A; strength of evidence 1b), and although its efficacy and treatment duration is matched by fluconazole (Grading of recommendation A; strength of evidence 1b) and itraconazole (Grading of recommendation A; strength of evidence 1b), griseofulvin is cheaper. It must be noted, however, that griseofulvin is nowadays not available in certain European countries (e.g. Belgium, Greece, Portugal, and Turkey).

### Topical antifungal treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis [^112KrRYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea infections are fungal infections of the skin caused by dermatophytes. It is estimated that 10% to 20% of the world population is affected by fungal skin infections. Sites of infection vary according to geographical location, the organism involved, and environmental and cultural differences. Both tinea corporis, also referred to as 'ringworm' and tinea cruris or 'jock itch' are conditions frequently seen by primary care doctors and dermatologists. The diagnosis can be made on clinical appearance and can be confirmed by microscopy or culture. A wide range of topical antifungal drugs are used to treat these superficial dermatomycoses, but it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antifungal treatments in tinea cruris and tinea corporis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 13th August 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We handsearched the journal Mycoses from 1957 to 1990.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with proven dermatophyte infection of the body (tinea corporis) or groin (tinea cruris).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses.

Main Results

Of the 364 records identified, 129 studies with 18,086 participants met the inclusion criteria. Half of the studies were judged at high risk of bias with the remainder judged at unclear risk. A wide range of different comparisons were evaluated across the 129 studies, 92 in total, with azoles accounting for the majority of the interventions. Treatment duration varied from one week to two months, but in most studies this was two to four weeks. The length of follow-up varied from one week to six months. Sixty-three studies contained no usable or retrievable data mainly due to the lack of separate data for different tinea infections. Mycological and clinical cure were assessed in the majority of studies, along with adverse effects. Less than half of the studies assessed disease relapse, and hardly any of them assessed duration until clinical cure, or participant-judged cure. The quality of the body of evidence was rated as low to very low for the different outcomes. Data for several outcomes for two individual treatments were pooled. Across five studies, significantly higher clinical cure rates were seen in participants treated with terbinafine compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 4.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.10 to 6.56, number needed to treat (NNT) 3, 95% CI 2 to 4). The quality of evidence for this outcome was rated as low. Data for mycological cure for terbinafine could not be pooled due to substantial heterogeneity. Mycological cure rates favoured naftifine 1% compared to placebo across three studies (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.14, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 4) with the quality of evidence rated as low. In one study, naftifine 1% was more effective than placebo in achieving clinical cure (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.16, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 5) with the quality of evidence rated as low. Across two studies, mycological cure rates favoured clotrimazole 1% compared to placebo (RR 2.87, 95% CI 2.28 to 3.62, NNT 2, 95% CI 2 to 3). Data for several outcomes were pooled for three comparisons between different classes of treatment. There was no difference in mycological cure between azoles and benzylamines (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07). The quality of the evidence was rated as low for this comparison. Substantial heterogeneity precluded the pooling of data for mycological and clinical cure when comparing azoles and allylamines. Azoles were slightly less effective in achieving clinical cure compared to azole and steroid combination creams immediately at the end of treatment (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84, NNT 6, 95% CI 5 to 13), but there was no difference in mycological cure rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05). The quality of evidence for these two outcomes was rated as low for mycological cure and very low for clinical cure. All of the treatments that were examined appeared to be effective, but most comparisons were evaluated in single studies. There was no evidence for a difference in cure rates between tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Adverse effects were minimal - mainly irritation and burning; results were generally imprecise between active interventions and placebo, and between different classes of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled data suggest that the individual treatments terbinafine and naftifine are effective. Adverse effects were generally mild and reported infrequently. A substantial number of the studies were more than 20 years old and of unclear or high risk of bias; there is however, some evidence that other topical antifungal treatments also provide similar clinical and mycological cure rates, particularly azoles although most were evaluated in single studies. There is insufficient evidence to determine if Whitfield's ointment, a widely used agent is effective. Although combinations of topical steroids and antifungals are not currently recommended in any clinical guidelines, relevant studies included in this review reported higher clinical cure rates with similar mycological cure rates at the end of treatment, but the quality of evidence for these outcomes was rated very low due to imprecision, indirectness and risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to confidently assess relapse rates in the individual or combination treatments. Although there was little difference between different classes of treatment in achieving cure, some interventions may be more appealing as they require fewer applications and a shorter duration of treatment. Further, high quality, adequately powered trials focusing on patient-centred outcomes, such as patient satisfaction with treatment should be considered.

### Cutaneous infections dermatophytosis, onychomycosis, and tinea versicolor [^115iuH8W]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Cutaneous fungal infections cause significant morbidity for healthy and ill patients. The incidence of some dermatomycoses is increasing, despite availability of newer and better topical and systemic treatments. Fungal remnants last months to years under the ideal conditions, allowing continued spread of infection. Mycoses treated in one area may recur because of organism travel from concomitant areas of infection. Failure of patients and physicians to recognize a fungal etiology early may lead to more extensive, severe, or difficult-to-treat infections. Finally, a patient's concurrent illnesses may play a part in susceptibility and ability to manage fungal infections. For these reasons, scientists have studied and developed newer antifungal agents with better efficacy and greater convenience in dosing. These drugs, however, still have side effects and medication interactions that may limit their use in some patients. Better efforts to educate patients and physicians alike may aid in faster recognition and treatment of dermatophytoses. More research is needed to continue to develop drugs suitable for use in a broader range of patients and diagnostic tests that may be quicker or more specific than conventional ones.

Ringworm

Background

Ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungus. A ringworm infection can occur on the scalp (tinea capitis), the body (tinea corporis), the hands (tinea manuum), the feet (tinea pedis or "athlete's foot"), the nails (tinea unguium), the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris of "jock itch"), and the beard area (tinea barbae). Typical symptoms include red, itchy skin, a ring-shaped rash, and hair loss.

Ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone whohas a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus. It also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat.

Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body. Over-the-counter topical medication can treat infections on the skin, but a prescription medication taken by mouth is used to treat infections on the scalp. There are rare reports of infections that are resistant to antifungal medicines.

Recommendations

Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection. A rash should not be not used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks.
Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Dermatophytid in tinea capitis: rarely reported common phenomenon with clinical implications [^115cgnen]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis may be associated with a dermatophytid, which appears as a disseminated eczematous eruption. This phenomenon may occur before or after initiation of systemic antifungal drug therapy and is not an indication for stopping medication. We present here a series of cases that involve 5 children with tinea capitis who developed a dermatophytid before or during the course of their management. In each child, the eruption resolved despite continuation of oral antifungal therapy. Our experience suggests that dermatophytid secondary to tinea capitis is much more common than reported. Furthermore, parents and clinicians frequently mistake dermatophytid for drug allergy. Recognition of this phenomenon, distinction of dermatophytid from drug allergy, and continuation of systemic treatment is essential for clearing the infection and dermatophytid.

### Ethnic equity implications in the management of pseudofolliculitis barbae [^117MMW6G]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

One major issue facing the health care system in the United States is the disparity in health care management of diseases that affect minority patient populations. Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is very common in Black men. It presents as skin-colored to erythematous, follicular or perifollicular papules and pustules predominantly on the neck and chin. The most definitive treatment for PFB is cessation of close shaving. However, many Black men are forced to comply with "clean-shaven" policies in the workforce. For those who are able to obtain medical waivers, there is significant time and costs associated with this, especially if they must wait to receive this waiver from a dermatologist. If primary care providers are able to identify the disease and spread awareness of its legitimacy, it may be easier for patients to receive the necessary waivers and may encourage employers to reflect on the ethnic equity of this practice. Our professional support can help reduce stigma and lead to improvements in the physical and psychological health of this historically mistreated population.

### Tinea capitis mimicking cicatricial alopecia: what host and dermatophyte factors lead to this unusual clinical presentation? [^1178V31c]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection in children. The clinical presentation varies from subtle asymptomatic scaling to inflammatory suppurative nodules and draining tracks. Both chronic and acute inflammatory infections may damage the hair follicle leading to secondary cicatricial alopecia. In rare instances, the initial presentation can mimic a primary cicatricial alopecia. We present three cases of tinea capitis in children masquerading as cicatricial alopecia and discuss the possible host immune and fungal antigenic factors that may influence the course of disease and its clinical presentation. An understanding of the clinical morphology of tinea capitis in the context of both host and fungal factors may improve treatment strategies and direct future paradigms of therapy.

### Topical treatment of common superficial tinea infections… [^112TyWPo]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

With some pertinent exceptions, dermatomycosis is typically confined to the superficial keratinized tissue 2 and, thus, can often be treated with topical antifungal medications. 3 Because these agents do not penetrate hair or nails, tinea capitis, tinea barbae, and tinea unguium usually require systemic therapy. This article focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of tinea infections with topical medications. Because tinea capitis and tinea unguium are not typically amenable to topical therapy, they will not be discussed in this article. Treatment Most tinea corporis, cruris, and pedis infections can be treated with topical agents. Consideration should be given to systemic treatment when lesions covering a large body-surface area fail to clear with repeated treatment using different topical agents. 3 In treating dermatophytosis, the physician must also address environmental factors that lead to or exacerbate tinea infection and select an appropriate topical therapy for the infection.

3 Because there are few direct comparisons of individual topical agents, it can be difficult to justify the choice of one preparation over another. This choice is made less clear because several genera and species may produce the same clinical condition. When treating a dermatophyte infection, it is unlikely that the physician will know the infecting species. In general, tinea corporis and tinea cruris require once- to twice-daily treatment for two weeks. Tinea pedis may require treatment for four weeks. Allylamines Naftifine and terbinafine are applied once-daily and remain active in the skin for up to one week after application. COMBINED STEROID/ANTIFUNGAL AGENTS In the United States, the only combination steroid/antifungal agent indicated for the treatment of dermatophytosis is clotrimazole-betamethasone. This formulation combines an effective antifungal agent with a potent steroid.

Patients who have symptomatic inflammatory dermatophytosis with erythema, pruritus, and burning are optimally treated twice daily with this combination. The steroid component provides rapid symptomatic relief while the slower-acting antifungal agent eradicates the causative organism. Inflammation typically occurs in tineas caused by zoophilic dermatophytes. Because of the potent steroid component, this medication provides rapid relief, but it must be used judiciously.

### Topical treatment of common superficial tinea infections [^1138Uspt]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Tinea infections are superficial fungal infections caused by three species of fungi collectively known as dermatophytes. Commonly these infections are named for the body part affected, including tinea corporis (general skin), tinea cruris (groin), and tinea pedis (feet). Accurate diagnosis is necessary for effective treatment. Diagnosis is usually based on history and clinical appearance plus direct microscopy of a potassium hydroxide preparation. Culture or histologic examination is rarely required for diagnosis. Treatment requires attention to exacerbating factors such as skin moisture and choosing an appropriate antifungal agent. Topical therapy is generally successful unless the infection covers an extensive area or is resistant to initial therapy. In these cases, systemic therapy may be required. Tinea corporis and cruris infections are usually treated for two weeks, while tinea pedis is treated for four weeks with an azole or for one to two weeks with allylamine medication. Treatment should continue for at least one week after clinical clearing of infection. Newer medications require fewer applications and a shorter duration of use. The presence of inflammation may necessitate the use of an agent with inherent anti-inflammatory properties or the use of a combination antifungal/steroid agent. The latter agents should be used with caution because of their potential for causing atrophy and other steroid-associated complications.

### Common tinea infections in children… [^11458Aq5]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

TREATMENT Tinea capitis must be treated with oral agents to penetrate the affected hair shafts. Although griseofulvin is often considered the treatment of choice for children, other agents are increasingly more cost-effective and may be more convenient. 8 If griseofulvin is used, micronized oral griseofulvin is recommended at a dosage of 20 mg per kg per day for at least eight weeks. The long duration of treatment and the adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, and photosensitivity often negatively affect patient compliance. Ketoconazole and itraconazole are not recommended for treating tinea capitis because of the limited data on their effectiveness and safety. Adjunctive selenium sulfide should be used to decrease the spread of tinea capitis. 15 Selenium sulfide 2. 5% shampoo is most effective and should be applied at least two to three times per week and should remain on the scalp for at least five minutes per application.
16.

TREATMENT Topical treatment is often sufficient to cure tinea corporis, although oral medications can be used for patients with severe infection or for infections that do not respond to topical therapy. A topical antifungal agent is applied to the lesion and a 2-cm area surrounding the lesion once or twice daily; therapy is continued for one week after the lesion appears to resolve. Topical therapy is usually a sufficient treatment for tinea cruris. Therapies include terbinafine cream or spray applied once daily for one week and butenafine 1% cream applied once daily for two weeks. TREATMENT Topical antifungal agents such as terbinafine applied once daily for one week or butenafine 1% applied once daily for two weeks are effective for most forms of tinea pedis. The therapies can be applied directly to the web spaces and other affected areas. As with treatment of tinea cruris, these therapies are more effective than clotrimazole and miconazole.

Occasionally, systemic terbinafine therapy, 250 mg taken orally every day for two weeks, or fluconazole, 150 mg taken once weekly for three weeks, can be used to treat severe or refractory infections. TREATMENT The best evidence supports terbinafine for treating adolescents with tinea unguium.

### Expert panel review of skin and hair dermatophytoses in an era of antifungal resistance [^116sHXuC]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Dermatophytoses are fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails that affect approximately 25% of the global population. Occlusive clothing, living in a hot humid environment, poor hygiene, proximity to animals, and crowded living conditions are important risk factors. Dermatophyte infections are named for the anatomic area they infect, and include tinea corporis, cruris, capitis, barbae, faciei, pedis, and manuum. Tinea incognito describes steroid-modified tinea. In some patients, especially those who are immunosuppressed or who have a history of corticosteroid use, dermatophyte infections may spread to involve extensive skin areas, and, in rare cases, may extend to the dermis and hair follicle. Over the past decade, dermatophytoses cases not responding to standard of care therapy have been increasingly reported. These cases are especially prevalent in the Indian subcontinent, and Trichophyton indotineae has been identified as the causative species, generating concern regarding resistance to available antifungal therapies. Antifungal-resistant dermatophyte infections have been recently recognized in the United States. Antifungal resistance is now a global health concern. When feasible, mycological confirmation before starting treatment is considered best practice. To curb antifungal-resistant infections, it is necessary for physicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for resistant dermatophyte infections coupled with antifungal stewardship efforts. Furthermore, by forging partnerships with federal agencies, state and local public health agencies, professional societies, and academic institutions, dermatologists can lead efforts to prevent the spread of antifungal-resistant dermatophytes.

### Pediatric tinea capitis: recognition and management [^116RNAjY]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis (ringworm of the head) is the most common dermatophytosis of childhood with an increasing incidence worldwide. If suspected clinically, further diagnostic procedures, including direct microscopy and culture, should be performed. Other scalp alterations, such as seborrheic dermatitis, atopic eczema, psoriasis, alopecia areata, folliculitis, and pseudopelade, may mimic ringworm of the head and must be identified. A proven fungal infection of scalp skin and hairs warrants immediate initiation of systemic treatment. At present, only oral griseofulvin is approved for therapy of scalp ringworm in children by health authorities. However, the advent of several newer antifungal agents such as itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine has broadened the therapeutic armamentarium in recent years. These agents offer shorter treatment intervals, and their adverse effects and drug interaction profiles appear to be well within acceptable limits. In patients with tinea capitis, systemic therapy at weight-dependent dosages for an appropriate amount of time in conjunction with topical supportive measures will help to prevent disfiguring hair loss, permanent formation of scar tissue, spread of fungal organisms to other cutaneous regions, and infection of other persons.

### The efficacy and safety of terbinafine in children [^114RDses]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

In summary, terbinafine is a broad-spectrum allylamine, which has been used to treat superficial fungal infections including onychomycosis, and some systemic mycoses in adults. With a fungicidal activity, low minimum inhibitory concentration value, and high selectivity for fungal squalene epoxidase, terbinafine has demonstrated good efficacy in superficial fungal infections. Its lipophilic nature provides excellent, widespread absorption into hair, skin, and nails where it can eradicate fungal infection. Terbinafine has been shown to be effective and safe in several studies of the treatment of tinea capitis and onychomycosis in children. When treating Trichophyton tinea capitis the length of therapy may be 2 or 4 weeks. Microsporum tinea capitis may require somewhat higher or longer doses of terbinafine for adequate efficacy. These regimens still tend to be shorter than treatment with griseofulvin, and terbinafine may provide a higher compliance and a more cost-effective means of managing tinea capitis. It is possible that even higher cure rates and a shorter duration of therapy may be achieved following further optimization of treatment regimens that use a higher daily dosage of terbinafine than is currently recommended. The evidence is strongly in favor of using terbinafine to treat superficial fungal infections in children.

### Therapeutic options for the treatment of tinea capitis caused by trichophyton species: griseofulvin versus the new oral antifungal agents, terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole [^113rosew]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis is a relatively common fungal infection of childhood. Griseofulvin has been the mainstay of management. However, newer oral antifungal agents are being used more frequently. A multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, non-industry-sponsored study was conducted in centers in Canada and South Africa to determine the relative efficacy and safety of griseofulvin, terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole in the treatment of tinea capitis caused by Trichophyton species. The regimens for treating tinea capitis were griseofulvin microsize 20 mg/kg/day x 6 weeks, terbinafine [> 40 kg, one 250 mg tablet; 20–40 kg, 125 mg (half of a 250 mg tablet); < 20 kg, 62.5 mg (one-quarter of a 250 mg tablet)] x 2–3 weeks, itraconazole 5 mg/kg/day x 2–3 weeks, and fluconazole 6 mg/kg/day x 2–3 weeks. Patients were asked to return at weeks 4, 8, and 12 from the start of the study. Griseofulvin was administered for 6 weeks and the final evaluation was at week 12. Terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole were administered for 2 weeks and the patient evaluated 4 weeks from the start of therapy. At this time, if clinically indicated, one extra week of therapy was given. There were 200 patients randomized to four treatment groups (50 in each group). At the final evaluation at week 12, the number of evaluable patients were griseofulvin, 46; terbinafine, 48; itraconazole, 46; and fluconazole, 46. Patients who discontinued therapy or were lost to follow-up were griseofulvin, 1/3; itraconazole, 0/4; terbinafine, 0/4; and fluconazole, 0/4. The causative organisms were Trichophyton tonsurans and T. violaceum species. Patients were regarded as effectively treated at week 12 if there was mycologic cure and either clinical cure or only a few residual symptoms. Effective treatment was recorded in, intention to treat, griseofulvin (46 of 50, 92.0%), terbinafine (47 of 50, 94.0%), itraconazole (43 of 50, 86.0%), and fluconazole (42 of 50, 84.0%) (p = 0.33). Adverse effects were reported only in the griseofulvin group (gastrointestinal effects in six patients). Discontinuation from therapy due to adverse effects occurred only in the griseofulvin group (nausea in one patient). For the treatment of tinea capitis caused by the Trichophyton species, in this study, griseofulvin given for 6 weeks is similar in efficacy to terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole given for 2–3 weeks. Each of the agents has a favorable adverse-effects profile.

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections [^113QBoZe]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Tinea infections (often called ringworm) are caused by dermatophyte fungi and classified by the body site involved. Tinea corporis and tinea capitis are most common in prepubertal children, and tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (most common type of onychomycosis) are more likely in adolescents and adults. Clinical diagnosis without testing may be unreliable because other conditions can resemble tinea infections (eg, tinea corporis can be confused with eczema, and onychomycosis with dystrophic toenails from repeated low-level trauma or psoriasis). Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis generally respond to inexpensive topical antifungal agents, but oral antifungal agents may be indicated for patients with extensive disease, lack of response to topical treatment, immunocompromise, or hair follicle involvement (eg, tinea capitis). Oral terbinafine is considered first-line therapy for tinea capitis and onychomycosis because it is well tolerated, effective, and inexpensive. Emerging tinea infections may be more severe than classic tinea infections and generally do not improve with first-line topical or oral antifungals. These infections may require prolonged oral antifungal therapy and specialized diagnostic testing. Antifungal stewardship, including avoiding the use of combination antifungal-corticosteroids, should be emphasized to optimize outcomes and help prevent resistance.

### Shave frequency and regimen variation effects on the management of pseudofolliculitis barbae [^113ykkKu]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is an inflammatory condition of the face with a clinical presentation of papules in the beard area with occasional pustules or hypertrophic scarring, all of which develop in response to shaving. Prevalent in African American men, a limited amount of data have been published on the shave outcomes as they relate to clinically measurable responses and patient satisfaction scoring. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a daily shaving regimen and advanced shaving products on exacerbation of lesions and symptoms in patients with PFB.

Methods

Ninety African American men were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups shaving 2 to 3 times per week with standard products (control group), shaving daily with standard products (daily standard group) or shaving daily with advanced products (daily advanced). The number of pustules, papules, ingrown hairs, and investigator's assessment of severity and subjective symptoms of itching and burning/stinging were assessed at baseline, week 6, and week 12. The response to treatment was also assessed by the investigator and the subject at weeks 6 and 12. Secondary measures including questionnaires regarding baseline shave practices were also correlated with outcomes variables.

Results

There were no significant differences noted between the 3 groups for papule (P = 0.32) or pustule (P = 0.46) count for the 12-week study. However, there was a significant mean papule reduction from baseline detected for both the control and daily advanced groups. In addition, compared to baseline, there was a significant reduction in ingrown hairs for the control group, and a directional reduction in ingrown hairs for the daily advanced group. There were significant group differences between the control group and both daily shaving groups, with the control group seeing significantly fewer ingrown hairs (P = 0.005 for control vs daily standard group and P = 0.04 for control vs daily advanced group). There were no significant group differences among the 3 groups for investigator-graded severity (P = 0.43) and response to treatment (P = 0.51). There was a significant perceived improvement in the response to treatment (P = 0.007) and itching (P = 0.002) for the daily advanced group vs the control group.

### Evidence-based topical treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis: a summary of a cochrane systematic review [^112bMr62]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Tinea cruris and tinea corporis are common fungal infections. Most can be treated with a variety of topical antifungals. This review aimed to assess the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of topical treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Searches included the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, LILACS and ongoing trials registries (August 2013). One hundred and twenty-nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 18 086 participants evaluated a range of interventions - mostly azoles. Pooling of data for several outcomes was only possible for two individual treatments. In five studies, terbinafine showed a statistically significant higher clinical cure rate compared with placebo [risk ratio (RR) 4·51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3·10–6·56]. Data for mycological cure could not be pooled owing to substantial heterogeneity. Across three studies, mycological cure rates favoured naftifine (1%) compared with placebo (RR 2·38, 95% CI 1·80–3·14) but the quality of the evidence was low. Combinations of azoles with corticosteroids were slightly more effective than azoles for clinical cure, but there was no statistically significant difference with regard to mycological cure. Sixty-five studies were assessed as 'unclear' and 64 as being at 'high risk' of bias; many were over 20 years old, and most were poorly designed and inadequately reported. Although most active interventions showed sufficient therapeutic effect, this review highlights the need for further, high-quality, adequately powered RCTs to evaluate the effects of these interventions, which can ultimately provide reliable evidence to inform clinical decision making.

### A randomized comparison of 4 weeks of terbinafine vs. 8 weeks of griseofulvin for the treatment of tinea capitis [^1172AFNR]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is a common childhood infection that has recently become more frequent in urban areas in Europe and the U.S. A. The current licensed treatment in children is griseofulvin 10 mg kg(-1) daily, which is usually given for 6–8 weeks.

Objectives

To compare this treatment with a 4-week course of oral terbinafine.

Methods

Terbinafine was given at the following doses: in children weighing < 20 kg, 62.5 mg daily; 20–40 kg, 125 mg daily; > 40 kg, 250 mg daily. Two hundred and ten children aged 2–16 years, with mycologically confirmed tinea capitis, were randomized to 4 weeks treatment with terbinafine or 8 weeks with griseofulvin, and followed for a total of 24 weeks to determine the difference between treatments with respect to short- and long-term efficacy and tolerability.

Results

One hundred and forty-seven patients were evaluable (terbinafine 77, griseofulvin 70). Although the 4-week course of terbinafine resulted in a trend to more rapid clearance of tinea capitis, there were no statistically significant differences between the two drugs in terms of overall outcome or tolerability, apart from in a subgroup of patients with Trichophyton infections, and weighing > 20 kg, who responded better to terbinafine than to griseofulvin at 4 weeks. By contrast, there was a better response to griseofulvin than to terbinafine in patients with Microsporum audouinii infections.

Conclusions

Overall, the study showed that 4 weeks of treatment with oral terbinafine has similar efficacy to 8 weeks of treatment with griseofulvin for the management of tinea capitis in children.

### The assessment and management of tinea capitis in children [^114tHuQ3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis is an infection of the scalp and hair shaft caused by dermatophyte fungi. It is seen in all age groups, and the incidence seems to be on the rise in North America. Clinical diagnosis of tinea capitis can be challenging, as symptoms can vary from minimal pruritus with no hair loss, to severe tenderness, purulence, and permanent scarring in inflammatory kerion lesions. The diagnosis of tinea capitis must be confirmed in the laboratory by using fungal stains or obtaining cultures, since treatment may be prolonged with potential side effects. Systemic therapy is needed because topical antifungals cannot effectively penetrate the hair shaft to eradicate the infection. Oral griseofulvin remains the standard treatment agent, but terbinafine and itraconazole are also effective alternatives (although currently without Food and Drug Administration approval).

### The role of ingrown hairs in persistent kerion of children: a clinical study [^115K4M4W]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tinea capitis, an infection of the hair, follicles, and surrounding skin caused by dermatophytes, occurs with notable frequency in children, including those who are not immunocompromised, with a particular prevalence among preschool‐aged children. Although the spectrum of pathogens varies significantly with geography and over time, tinea capitis continues to be a global public health issue, particularly in developing countries where sanitation and nutrition may be inadequate. Kerion, a severe inflammatory form of tinea capitis, can result in scarring alopecia and extensive tissue damage, in addition to common symptoms such as erythema, scaling, and abscess formation.

Persistent kerion exhibits more extensive involvement and increased severity in the infrequently reported cases of tinea capitis that are refractory to treatment, and managing cases resistant to systemic antifungal agents poses a significant challenge. In this process, ingrown hairs may play an important role. Ingrown hairs, also named pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), can act as foreign bodies to cause local inflammations. The erythema papulopustular lesions mainly involves the beard, neck, submental, and groin areas. In fact, ingrown hairs can occur in any area where traumatic hair removal has been performed, but reports of scalp involvement are rare, especially in infections. Clinical practice in our patients suggested that ingrown hairs might be a contributing factor to the prolonged duration and suboptimal outcomes in persistent cases of tinea capitis, particularly in kerion. Further research into the cause and progression of this condition could enhance prevention and treatment strategies for tinea capitis that is unresponsive to conventional therapies.

This prospective study evaluated persistent kerion cases among children with tinea capitis at our hospital, documenting six instances that showed limited improvement with standard antifungal therapy and were subsequently treated effectively with ingrown hair removal. The study also discussed the potential role of ingrown hairs in superficial fungal infections affecting the hair.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^115iMCiz]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Ringworm (tinea) management in residential facilities notes that ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungi and ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone who has a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus; it also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat. Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body, with over-the-counter topical medication used for infections on the skin but a prescription medication taken by mouth used to treat infections on the scalp. Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection, and a rash should not be used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks. Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Optimal management of fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails [^115QoBrU]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections are chronic and recurring conditions. Tinea capitis is a scalp infection, primarily affecting prepubescent children. Ringworm infections, such as tinea corporis and tinea cruris, involve the glabrous skin. Tinea nigra is a rare mycotic infection that may be related to travel abroad. Piedra, black or white, is limited to the hair shaft without involvement of the adjacent skin. Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis are dermatoses associated with yeasts of the genus Malassezia that affect the lipid-rich areas of the body. The taxonomy of the Malassezia yeasts has been revised to include nine species, eight of which have been recovered from humans. Tinea pedis, an infection of the feet and toes, is one of the most common forms of dermatophytosis. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection affecting the nail bed and nail plate; it may be chronic and can be difficult to treat. In instances where the superficial fungal infection is severe or chronic, an oral antifungal agent should be considered. Terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole are oral antifungals that are effective in the treatment of superficial mycoses.

### Pustular tinea manuum frominfection [^115FMUfY]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

T erinacei is the most common dermatophyte isolated in hedgehogs, with infection rates of 20% to 47%. Other than hedgehog exposure, other reported exposures include an elephantand direct human-to-human contact by kissing. Immunosuppression use in our patient likely predisposed her to infection after contact with the hedgehog.

Infection typically occurs at the sites of contact — most commonly the hands as in tinea manuum, and less frequently as tinea facei, and tinea kerion barbae. They may present as an erosive inflammatory vesiculopustular eruption, or scaling eczematous plaques mimicking eczema. Infection in hedgehogs may be asymptomatic or may present with scaling and loss of quills.

Diagnosis is confirmed by culturing the fungus on agar plates and DNA sequencing. Topical antifungals are rarely adequate, and systemic treatment options include terbinafine and itraconzole. The animal ideally should be treated as well.

Such zoonotic infections are rare and, as in our patient, the inoculating event may be only determined after isolation of the fungus. An index of suspicion is important, especially with the increasing number of exotic domestic pets.

### Management of a trichophyton tonsurans outbreak in a day-care center [^117XRzw7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Trichophyton tonsurans is the leading cause of tinea capitis in the United Kingdom (UK) as well as causing tinea corporis. This organism has been linked to several outbreaks in the UK and abroad, and such outbreaks may be prolonged since T. tonsurans can be difficult to control. There remains an incomplete consensus in the literature on the optimal management of such outbreaks of this infection. Following notification that a child with T. tonsurans was identified at a day-care center in the UK, initial investigations identified nine cases of fungal infection involving children and staff over the previous 7 months. We report on the management of an outbreak of T. tonsurans tinea capitis and tinea corporis among children and staff in a day-care center. An outbreak control team with representatives from dermatology, microbiology, day-care center management, and the Health Protection Agency initiated case ascertainment by scalp inspection and brushing of all children and staff at the nursery. Two complete rounds of screening were required before the outbreak was declared over. Infection control measures included antifungal shampoo use, exclusion of identified cases for a short period, removal of shared items from the center, and enhanced decontamination of fomites. The outbreak, which lasted longer than 12 months, involved 12 children and 7 staff members. Of these, 12 cases were confirmed by positive fungal culture. T. tonsurans is difficult to manage, especially in childcare settings, but case ascertainment, appropriate treatment with oral agents, and sustained infection control measures can be effective in controlling such outbreaks.

### Common tinea infections in children [^11658ib2]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

The common dermatophyte genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton are major causes of superficial fungal infections in children. These infections (e.g., tinea corporis, pedis, cruris, and unguium) are typically acquired directly from contact with infected humans or animals or indirectly from exposure to contaminated soil or fomites. A diagnosis usually can be made with a focused history, physical examination, and potassium hydroxide microscopy. Occasionally, Wood's lamp examination, fungal culture, or histologic tissue examination is required. Most tinea infections can be managed with topical therapies; oral treatment is reserved for tinea capitis, severe tinea pedis, and tinea unguium. Topical therapy with fungicidal allylamines may have slightly higher cure rates and shorter treatment courses than with fungistatic azoles. Although oral griseofulvin has been the standard treatment for tinea capitis, newer oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole are effective, safe, and have shorter treatment courses.

### Inguinal annular plaque with central maceration [^117VrhXg]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following topical therapies is most effective in treating this condition?
A. Topical antifungal therapy
B. Topical imiquimod
C. Topical steroid therapy
D. Topical antibiotic therapy
E. Topical 5-fluorouracil

Answers:
A. Topical antifungal therapy – Incorrect. This would be appropriate for the management of tinea cruris or intertrigo. It is important to note that EMPD can mimic fungal or inflammatory conditions, which often results in delays in diagnosis and management.
B. Topical imiquimod – Correct. Topical imiquimod is often used as a first line agent and has been shown to provide a complete response in up to 73% of patients. Its efficacy is due to its ability to stimulate an immune response against tumor cells.
C. Topical steroid therapy – Incorrect. Topical steroid therapy does not have a role in the management of EMPD.
D. Topical antibiotic therapy – Incorrect. Topical antibiotic therapy is not applicable in the management approach for EMPD, as it does not target the underlying malignant pathology.
E. Topical 5-fluorouracil – Incorrect. While it has been shown to be effective in some case series, it is not effective as a monotherapy. Instead, it must be paired with other agents, such as imiquimod or calcipotriene, and is often reserved for refractory cases.

### New treatments for tinea capitis [^1115H7Vs]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Tinea capitis, a dermatophyte infection involving the hair shaft on the scalp, is primarily a disease of preadolescent children. The predominant pathogen varies according to the geographical location. Trichophyton tonsurans and Microsporum canis account for the majority of infections in north America and certain parts of Europe. The current standard of care for the treatment of tinea capitis in the USA is oral griseofulvin, but evidence is accumulating that some of the newer antifungal agents may also be useful.

Recent Findings

The newer oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole seem to be effective, safe, and have the advantage of a shorter treatment duration. Although a significant number of clinical studies and reports have documented experience with terbinafine and itraconazole for the treatment of tinea capitis, it should be noted that only a few trials have been conducted utilizing fluconazole. Both 2% ketoconazole and 1% selenium sulfide shampoos are often recommended as adjuvant topical therapy.

Summary

Currently, many experts consider griseofulvin to be the drug of choice for tinea capitis. Short-term terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole therapy have been shown to be comparable in efficacy and safety with griseofulvin. Regular epidemiological surveillance of causative fungal organisms in the community and their antifungal susceptibility is an essential component in the management of this condition.

### Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea nigra, and piedra [^114WZD29]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Tinea infections are among the most common dermatologic conditions throughout the world. To avoid a misdiagnosis, identification of dermatophyte infections requires both a fungal culture on Sabouraud's agar media, and a light microscopic mycologic examination from skin scrapings. Topical antifungals may be sufficient for treatment of tinea corporis and cruris and tinea nigra, and the shaving of hair infected by piedra may also be beneficial. Systemic therapy, however, may be required when the infected areas are large, macerated with a secondary infection, or in immunocompromised individuals. Preventative measures of tinea infections include practicing good personal hygiene; keeping the skin dry and cool at all times; and avoiding sharing towels, clothing, or hair accessories with infected individuals.

### Diagnosis… [^113RFcyG]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis should be treated with oral therapy. Griseofulvin is the only oral anti-fungal agent approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the first-line treatment of tinea capitis. However, itraconazole and terbinafine are good alternatives. 9–11. Tinea Barbae Tinea barbae affects the beard area of men who work with animals. It is often accompanied by bacterial folliculitis and inflammation secondary to ingrown hairs. In the treatment of tinea barbae, oral therapy is preferred over topical therapy because the involved hair follicles do not respond well to topical therapy. The agents used to treat tinea capitis are also used to treat tinea barbae. Unless only one or two lesions are present, tinea corporis should be treated orally. Terbinafine and itraconazole are equally effective in treating tinea corporis.

12, 13 Furthermore, these agents each have a better mycologic cure rate and a lower relapse rate than griseofulvin. 14–16 An alternative is fluconazole, which is given orally once a week for up to four consecutive weeks. 17, 18. Tinea pedis is often treated with topical therapy. Since oral agents provide better skin penetration than most topical preparations, oral therapy may be more efficacious in the treatment of hyperkeratotic tinea pedis. Itraconazole, terbinafine and griseofulvin are good choices for oral therapy. Itraconazole and terbinafine are slightly more effective than griseofulvin. 14, 19 Once-weekly dosing with fluconazole is another option, especially in non-compliant patients.
17. The clinical state of the lesion also must be considered. Ointment preparations soften thickened, hyperkeratotic lesions. Lotions and solutions prevent maceration in intertriginous areas and hairy areas of the body. They are also appropriate for treating moist, oozy, weepy lesions.

Cream formulations are beneficial in the treatment of scaling, non-oozing lesions. Powders alone are less effective in treating existing tinea infections. However, they are helpful as adjunctive agents for reducing moisture and maceration, and they can prevent fungal infections in intertriginous areas.

### Eyebrow and eyelash alopecia: a clinical review [^111YqJUG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Eyebrow and eyelash alopecia have many different etiologies. Although often presenting with other concomitant symptomatology, eyebrow and eyelash alopecia may be the only presenting symptom, as seen in multiple cases of AA. Although autoimmune and genetic etiologies of alopecia have greater variability in clinical response, prompt diagnosis and treatment are important to minimize hair loss. Trichoscopy is a useful tool to aid in diagnosis of common causes of eyebrow and eyelash alopecia including AA, FFA, tinea infection, and trichotillomania. After determining the diagnosis, treatment is focused on targeting the underlying etiology of disease and preventing or reversing the progression of hair loss. This review highlights the etiologies, trichoscopy findings, and importance of swift clinical recognition and management of madarosis.

### Dermatophyte infections [^111wddq7]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Dermatophytes are fungi that require keratin for growth. These fungi can cause superficial infections of the skin, hair, and nails. Dermatophytes are spread by direct contact from other people (anthropophilic organisms), animals (zoophilic organisms), and soil (geophilic organisms), as well as indirectly from fomites. Dermatophyte infections can be readily diagnosed based on the history, physical examination, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy. Diagnosis occasionally requires Wood's lamp examination and fungal culture or histologic examination. Topical therapy is used for most dermatophyte infections. Cure rates are higher and treatment courses are shorter with topical fungicidal allylamines than with fungistatic azoles. Oral therapy is preferred for tinea capitis, tinea barbae, and onychomycosis. Orally administered griseofulvin remains the standard treatment for tinea capitis. Topical treatment of onychomycosis with ciclopirox nail lacquer has a low cure rate. For onychomycosis, "pulse" oral therapy with the newer imidazoles (itraconazole or fluconazole) or allylamines (terbinafine) is considerably less expensive than continuous treatment but has a somewhat lower mycologic cure rate. The diagnosis of onychomycosis should be confirmed by KOH microscopy, culture, or histologic examination before therapy is initiated, because of the expense, duration, and potential adverse effects of treatment.

### Tinea barbae (tinea sycosis): experience with nine cases [^116WMR8D]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Tinea barbae is a rare dermatophytosis that affects the hair and hair follicles of the beard and mustache. This paper presents 9 cases of tinea barbae observed over an 18-year period of time and classified as follows: 1 was superficial and 8 were deep (6 folliculitis-like and 2 kerion-like). Most of the cases (4) were associated with topical steroid therapy, others with pet contact (3 cases) and one with diabetes. The causal agents isolated were: Trichophyton rubrum in 3; Microsporum canis in 3; Trichophyton mentagrophytes in 2; and Trichophyton tonsurans in one. The involvement of the hair was observed and classified in all cases. The trichophytin skin reaction was positive in all 9 patients. All the patients were treated with systemic antimycotics, 3 cases with griseofulvin, 1 with ketoconazole, 3 with itraconazole, and 2 with terbinafine. Clinical and mycologic cures were achieved at 6 to 8 weeks of treatment at the usual doses.

### A curious observation of passive transfer of steroid antifungal combination creams to the scrotum in patients of tinea cruris-is this forme fruste of red scrotum syndrome? [^112JLcDH]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

We report 16 patients of tinea cruris who presented with an asymptomatic red scrotum due to fixed dose combination creams containing antifungal agents and topical steroids applied to the thighs as a treatment of tinea cruris. The erythema resolved upon starting appropriate treatment with single molecule antifungal creams and oral antifungal drugs in about six weeks' time in majority of cases. We propose that this clinical presentation may be akin to red scrotum syndrome (RSS). Due to its asymptomatic nature in most of the cases, we propose that this could be a forme fruste of RSS.

### Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the use of telemedicine on the diagnosis and treatment of tinea corporis: an experience of Southern Italy center [^113Htj9a]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Teledermatology played a central role during the COVID‐19 pandemic, which led to a strong development of this type of service, providing ample satisfaction for both physicians and pa Although works in the literature suggest how helpful this service has been, in our experience not all dermatologic conditions can benefit equally from this type of visit.

In conclusion, it is often not easy to manage or explain a treatment through this modality, so we believe that there are still considerable difficulties for therapeutic management as our data show.

We believe that new guidelines are needed for the future to improve these services and increase the satisfaction of both patients and dermatologists.

### Concentric scaly rings in a patient with a history of breast cancer [^111Hhq3g]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
A. Topical ketoconazole 2% cream twice daily for 4 weeks
B. Oral terbinafine 250 mg daily for 4 weeks
C. Oral ketoconazole 200 mg daily for 4 weeks
D. Topical clobetasol 0.05% ointment twice daily for 2 weeks
E. Oral prednisone 60 mg daily for 3 weeks

Answers:
A. Topical ketoconazole 2% cream twice daily for 4 weeks — Incorrect. A topical antifungal agent alone would not be appropriate, given the extensive areas of involvement and previous extended treatment with topical corticosteroids.
B. Oral terbinafine 250 mg daily for 4 weeks — Correct. Oral terbinafine is one of the most effective treatments for tinea imbricata and tinea pseudoimbricata. Oral antifungal therapy can be combined with topical antifungals for an enhanced cure rate.
C. Oral ketoconazole 200 mg daily for 4 weeks — Incorrect. Although oral ketoconazole may be effective in the treatment of dermatophytosis, the Food and Drug Administration has applied a black-box warning because of the risk of serious hepatotoxicity potentially requiring liver transplant. The oral form of this medication is not indicated to treat skin or nail infections. It is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver failure.
D. Topical clobetasol 0.05% ointment twice daily for 2 weeks — Incorrect. Although topical corticosteroids may be helpful in cases of erythema gyratum repens, their use in tinea imbricata or tinea pseudoimbricata would be expected to worsen the disease.
E. Oral prednisone 60 mg daily for 3 weeks — Incorrect. Oral corticosteroids may be helpful in cases of erythema gyratum repens but would not be indicated for the treatment of tinea imbricata or tinea pseudoimbricata. Systemic immunosuppression could potentially worsen the progression of a dermatophyte infection.

### The role of naftifine HCl 2% gel and cream in treating moccasin tinea pedis [^116KszRN]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

In recent years, new topical antifungals have emerged for the treatment and management of tinea pedis, but all have been investigated and approved for the treatment of interdigital tinea pedis. Moccasin tinea pedis has not been recognized by governing bodies as a definable and treatable disease entity separate from interdigital tinea pedis at this time. Thus, creating randomized, controlled clinical trials to investigate moccasin tinea pedis is a challenge without an agreed upon definition of the disease state, treatment regimen, and treatment course. Considering systemic therapy issues and the lack of data from large trials demonstrating safety and efficacy in the topical management of this clinical presentation, an unmet need has been created for a topical antifungal agent that can treat moccasin tinea pedis. Naftifine 2% gel, an allylamine, was studied in a clinical trial that enrolled patients who had interdigital or both interdigital and moccasin-type tinea pedis. In the moccasin group, the primary efficacy endpoint of complete cure at week 2 (end of treatment) was 1.7% (gel) vs 0.9% (vehicle) and week 6 (four weeks post-treatment) was 19.2% (gel) vs 0.9% (vehicle). Naftifine 2% cream in combination with urea 39% also showed improvement in hyperkeratotic moccasin tinea pedis.

TREATMENT OPTIONS AND CHALLENGES IN MANAGING DERMATOPHYTOSIS CAUSED BY T. INDOTINEAE

The primary treatment for dermatomycoses typically involves topical antifungals. The main classes of topical antifungal agents include azoles such as clotrimazole and allylamines such as TRB and benzylamines such as butenafine. When topical therapy fails, oral antifungals such as oral TRB, itraconazole, ketoconazole, or fluconazole are commonly prescribed. Griseofulvin is an alternative but requires a longer duration of treatment and carries a risk of drug interactions. Combined regimens of topical and oral antifungals with anti-inflammatory agents have also been used to enhance cure rates.

However, many chronic and recurrent dermatophytosis cases, particularly those caused by T. indotineae, are unresponsive to topical or oral TRB due to its high resistance. A daily dose of oral TRB, 250 mg for 4–8 weeks, is often prescribed as first-line treatment and achieves clinical cure in patients with TRB-susceptible strains of T. indotineae. Increasing the dosage to 250 mg twice daily in cases of treatment failure with standard dosing has shown some success, although the failure rate remains significant at 30%. Itraconazole is the preferred treatment for T. indotineae infections with a recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily for 4–8 weeks, extendable to 12 weeks for some cases. Sonego et al. described itraconazole 200 mg per day for a variable duration of 1 to 12 weeks as the most effective treatment for T. indotineae infections. Super bioavailability (SUBA)-itraconazole has shown efficacy at a dose of 50 mg twice daily for 4–8 weeks. This is due to increased bioavailability. Furthermore, serum levels of SUBA are more stable, and the need for an acidic environment is not required. While fluconazole and griseofulvin are options, they often exhibit increased MICs against T. indotineae, and clinical responses vary. In a study from Banaras Hindu University in India, treatment with fluconazole, griseofulvin, TRB, and itraconazole showed limited effectiveness at 4 weeks, with cure rates below 8%. By eight weeks, itraconazole demonstrated the highest cure rate (66%), outperforming fluconazole (42%), TRB (28%), and griseofulvin (14%).

Cryptococcus — cutaneous involvement and management: Single or multiple painless skin lesions involving the face and scalp develop in 5%–10% of clinically infected patients and may precede cryptococcal meningitis by several weeks. Fluconazole is often used as initial treatment for patients with mild infections or to complete treatment after clinical and microbiologic improvement with amphotericin B and 5‑flucytosine induction therapy, and surgical debridement and/or drainage are not helpful in the management of skin or soft tissue cryptococcal infections.

### Treatments of tinea pedis [^112FBpH2]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

The severity of tinea pedis infection determines the course of treatment required. Mild infections may be resolved using a topical agent. More severe presentations (eg, dermatophytosis complex) may require treatment that eliminates the bacterial and fungal infection. Some topical monotherapies may exhibit both antifungal and antibacterial activity. In other instances, it may be necessary to combine an antifungal agent with an antibacterial agent. If inflammation is present, an agent with known anti-inflammatory action may need to be used. The chronic presentation of tinea pedis (dry type) sometimes does not respond well to topical therapy. In such instances, systemic antifungal therapy is required to ensure that adequate concentrations of the therapeutic agent are present at the site of infection.

Topical antifungal therapy and the application of emollients containing lactic acid are effective. 21 Relapses may be frequent if onychomycosis or tinea pedis is not resolved. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Table 3. 20, 21 Adjunctive treatment can include a low-dose corticosteroid for the first few days. Rarely, systemic antifungal therapy is needed for refractory tinea cruris. Patient education on avoiding prolonged exposure to moisture and keeping the affected area dry is important. Treatment of tinea pedis involves application of an antifungal cream to the web spaces and other infected areas. Infrequently, systemic therapy is used for refractory infections.

In several studies, twice-daily application of the allylamine terbinafine resulted in a higher cure rate than twice-daily application of the imidazole clotrimazole, and at a quicker rate. 16, 17 A pharmacoeconomic analysis 18 of tinea treatments found topical terbinafine to be more cost-effective than imidazole or ciclopirox cream. When marked inflammation and vesicle formation occur and signs of early cellulitis are present, the addition of a systemic or topical antibiotic with streptococcal coverage is warranted. Tinea unguium, especially of the toenails, is difficult to eradicate. Topical agents have low efficacy. Mycologic cure rates for ciclopirox nail lacquer, applied daily for up to 48 weeks, have ranged from 29 to 47 percent.

26 Oral treatment with griseofulvin must be continued for 12 to 24 months, and ketoconazole carries a risk of hepatotoxicity. Fluconazole has not been studied extensively in the treatment of onychomycosis and is not labeled by the FDA for this indication.
