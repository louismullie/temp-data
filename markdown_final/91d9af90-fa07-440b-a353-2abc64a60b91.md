## Question

positive thyroglobulin antibodies, positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies means what

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means when both thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) are positive, including risk, contexts, assay pitfalls, and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what each antibody signifies immunologically and diagnostically. Then, I should quantify how dual positivity changes risk compared with single-antibody positivity in different clinical settings. Next, I will examine special contexts such as pregnancy, cancer surveillance, and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. After that, I need to check assay interferences and variability that could mislead interpretation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical monitoring and treatment approach, while verifying guideline alignment and highlighting where the evidence is strongest versus more uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the basics: TPOAb and TgAb are IgG autoantibodies directed at key thyroid antigens that mark autoimmune thyroid disease; TPOAb is the more prevalent and clinically predictive antibody for hypothyroidism risk, while TgAb is less predictive for primary hypothyroidism but is crucial because it interferes with serum thyroglobulin measurements used in thyroid cancer follow-up; for thyrotoxicosis, TRAb is the etiologic antibody for Graves' disease and the preferred diagnostic antibody when hyperthyroidism etiology is uncertain [^111mnQ72] [^111WGmTK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — even though dual positivity might intuitively imply higher autoimmunity burden, I should verify where this is proven; the clearest dose–response data come from anti–PD-1 cohorts, where baseline TgAb+/TPOAb+ status confers about a 60% cumulative incidence of thyroid immune-related adverse events compared with 42% for isolated TgAb+, 16% for isolated TPOAb+, and 5% for dual-negative over the first 24 weeks, which strongly supports dual positivity as the highest-risk stratum in that setting [^113Nm5ys].

> Wait, let me verify how this translates to progression toward hypothyroidism outside immunotherapy; in subclinical hypothyroidism, positive anti-TPO increases progression to overt hypothyroidism to roughly 4.3% per year versus 2.6% when negative, and while many guidelines and clinicians weigh antibody positivity to favor earlier treatment, the direct added risk from dual positivity over TPOAb alone in non-immunotherapy populations is suggested rather than definitively quantified; still, concurrent antibodies correlate with higher TSH and a more autoimmune phenotype in pregnancy cohorts and with higher risk when both antibodies arise together in children, which supports a clinically meaningful higher-risk categorization for dual positivity in general practice [^114zDFsD] [^111Uorua] [^113KzFUG].

> I will now examine the hyperthyroid end of the spectrum, because TgAb and TPOAb can also be present in Graves' disease; I need to ensure we prioritize TRAb for etiologic diagnosis and risk stratification in thyrotoxicosis and pregnancy, while recognizing that TPOAb/TgAb reflect broader autoimmunity rather than driving disease, so dual positivity may coexist with Graves' but TRAb measurement guides diagnosis and management decisions most directly [^112yfSqc] [^111WGmTK].

> Next, I should review the thyroid cancer surveillance implications, because TgAb positivity is pivotal here; TgAb interferes with Tg immunometric assays and can produce falsely low or undetectable Tg, which can mask residual or recurrent disease, so I need to check for TgAb with every Tg and rely on TgAb trends as a surrogate tumor marker when interference is present, where falling titers suggest response and rising titers raise concern for persistent disease; importantly, method differences and cutoffs can misclassify interfering TgAb as negative, so trend-based interpretation and awareness of platform changes are essential [^114JFjKy] [^116nGLu6].

> Let me consider pregnancy and reproductive contexts, where antibody positivity — often even when euthyroid — is linked to adverse outcomes; TPOAb positivity is associated with miscarriage and preterm birth in meta-analysis and with postpartum thyroiditis risk, and guidelines recommend measuring TPOAb when TSH exceeds 2.5 mU/L in pregnancy and considering low-dose levothyroxine for euthyroid women with positive TPOAb and prior pregnancy loss; I should remember antibody titers fall during pregnancy so first-trimester testing best captures positivity, and dual positivity tends to associate with higher TSH, which may further refine risk stratification and monitoring frequency in pregnancy [^112zniSx] [^114cdU7j] [^113NYhrf] [^113ysmUG] [^111Uorua].

> I should double-check the immunotherapy setting because it provides the most granular risk stratification for dual positivity; baseline TgAb+/TPOAb+ predicts approximately 48% thyrotoxicosis and 60% cumulative thyroid irAEs over 24 weeks with anti–PD-1 therapy, most often a transient thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism, so baseline antibody testing and proactive TSH/free T4 monitoring every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks is warranted to catch early transitions and treat hypothyroidism promptly [^113Nm5ys].

> Let me think about population prevalence and genetic determinants, because these inform how commonly we will encounter dual positivity; TPOAb is present in roughly 5–24% of adults and is more common in women and with age, and genetic studies identify loci such as YES1 and IRF8 associated with TPOAb/TgAb positivity, supporting a heritable predisposition to dual antibody development and clustering with other autoimmune phenotypes [^111mVgN2] [^112wBybZ].

> I need to ensure assay pitfalls do not mislead us; changing TgAb platforms can reclassify patients and disrupt longitudinal interpretation, manufacturer cutoffs may miss interfering TgAb that lower Tg IMA values, heterophile antibodies can cause spurious Tg elevations, and in these scenarios mass spectrometry Tg or blocking reagents plus dilution linearity checks can clarify true disease status; all of this argues for consistent platforms and trend-based interpretation, especially when dual positivity complicates data streams [^117AbqsX] [^116nGLu6] [^1123qNCp].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic management approach when both TgAb and TPOAb are positive; first, I should confirm positivity with a repeat assay on the same platform when possible and check TSH with free T4 and, if clinically indicated, free T3; second, I will risk stratify: higher vigilance is warranted for those pregnant or planning pregnancy, on immune checkpoint inhibitors, or with subclinical hypothyroidism and symptoms or goiter; third, I will monitor TSH and free T4 periodically, typically every 6–12 months in stable outpatients, more often in higher-risk settings, and in DTC I will measure TgAb with every Tg and follow trends; fourth, I will consider levothyroxine treatment if TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L, or if TSH is 4.5–10 mIU/L with symptoms, goiter, or persistent antibody positivity, aligning with AACE/ATA guidance while individualizing to context and patient preference [^1178ZGxH] [^117AbqsX] [^114JFjKy] [^113Nm5ys].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially said dual positivity represents the highest risk stratum "across clinical contexts", but I should correct that overgeneralization; the most robust dose–response evidence for dual positivity comes from the PD-1 immunotherapy cohorts, whereas in general populations the incremental risk over TPOAb alone is suggested by higher TSH, autoimmunity burden, and pediatric data when both antibodies arise together, yet it is not as precisely quantified and may vary by cohort and assay, so I will frame dual positivity outside immunotherapy as a higher-risk signal that justifies closer follow-up rather than a deterministic prognosis [^113Nm5ys] [^111Uorua] [^113KzFUG].

> But wait, what if hyperthyroidism is suspected and antibodies are dual positive — should I still rely on TPOAb/TgAb; I should not, because TRAb is the key etiologic test to confirm Graves' disease and to guide pregnancy-related monitoring and neonatal risk assessment, so in thyrotoxicosis I will prioritize TRAb and use TPOAb/TgAb only as supportive markers of background autoimmunity [^112yfSqc] [^111WGmTK].

> Key clinical takeaways I need to ensure are clear: dual TgAb and TPOAb positivity signals a robust autoimmune phenotype that, in immunotherapy, confers the highest thyroid irAE risk, and in general practice warrants closer monitoring for progression from subclinical to overt dysfunction; in DTC, TgAb positivity mandates interpreting Tg cautiously and following TgAb trends; in pregnancy, antibody positivity supports tighter TSH targets, early testing, and in selected euthyroid women with prior pregnancy loss, consideration of low-dose levothyroxine, with vigilance for postpartum thyroiditis; above all, confirm results, know your assays, and tailor monitoring and treatment thresholds to the clinical context and patient goals [^113Nm5ys] [^116khaDr] [^114JFjKy] [^114cdU7j] [^113NYhrf].

Positive thyroglobulin (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) indicate autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) [^111mnQ72], most often Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^113Gct4P], and signal a higher risk of hypothyroidism and progression from subclinical to overt disease [^114zDFsD]. Dual positivity is also linked to increased risk of thyroid immune-related adverse events with immune checkpoint inhibitors [^113Nm5ys] and can interfere with thyroglobulin assays [^114JFjKy], complicating thyroid cancer surveillance [^116nGLu6]. Management includes regular TSH monitoring [^1178ZGxH], levothyroxine if hypothyroid, and careful interpretation of thyroglobulin in cancer follow-up [^114JFjKy].

## Clinical significance of positive TgAb and TPOAb

- **Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD)**: Positive TgAb and TPOAb are hallmarks of AITD [^111mnQ72], including Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease [^111mVgN2].

- **Hashimoto's thyroiditis**: The most common AITD, characterized by chronic lymphocytic infiltration and progressive hypothyroidism [^113Gct4P].

- **Graves' disease**: Typically associated with TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) [^111WGmTK], but TgAb and TPOAb may also be present [^111mnQ72].

---

## Risk of thyroid dysfunction

Positive TgAb and TPOAb significantly increase the risk of developing **hypothyroidism** [^114zDFsD], including progression from subclinical to overt disease [^116khaDr]. Hyperthyroidism is **less common** but can occur, particularly in Graves' disease [^111mnQ72].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Monitoring thyroid function**: Regular monitoring of thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) [^1178ZGxH] is essential in patients with positive TgAb and TPOAb to detect early thyroid dysfunction [^113oU9wq].

- **Levothyroxine therapy**: Initiate levothyroxine replacement therapy [^1178ZGxH] if hypothyroidism develops, with periodic adjustment based on TSH levels.

- **Thyroglobulin assay interference**: TgAb can interfere with thyroglobulin measurements [^114JFjKy], complicating thyroid cancer surveillance. Alternative methods or careful interpretation is required [^116nGLu6].

---

## Associated conditions and risk factors

- **Autoimmune diseases**: Positive TgAb and TPOAb are associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes [^111zB991] and vitiligo [^113QuGwz].

- **Pregnancy**: Positive TPOAb in pregnancy increases the risk of postpartum thyroid dysfunction [^114ZyAvy] and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^112zniSx].

- **Immune checkpoint inhibitors**: Baseline positivity of TgAb and TPOAb significantly increases the risk of thyroid immune-related adverse events during immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^113Nm5ys] [^1121RpeL].

---

## Prognostic significance

Prognostically, positive TgAb and TPOAb are associated with differentiated **thyroid cancer** — particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma [^112Av16b] — and may indicate a more aggressive disease course [^112izesM]. After **thyroidectomy**, complete removal of thyroid tissue leads to the gradual disappearance of these antibodies [^111yiw5C], correlating with reduced autoimmune activity [^114JFjKy].

---

Positive thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies indicate **autoimmune thyroid disease** [^111mnQ72], most commonly Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and increase the risk of hypothyroidism [^114zDFsD]. They can also interfere with thyroid cancer surveillance [^114JFjKy] and are associated with other autoimmune conditions [^113QuGwz]. Regular **monitoring** and appropriate **management** are essential [^1178ZGxH].

### Risk of thyroid dysfunction in PD-1 blockade is stratified by the pattern of TgAb and TPOAb positivity at baseline [^113Nm5ys]. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Positive antithyroglobulin (TgAb) and/or antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) at baseline indicate a high risk of thyroid immune-related adverse events (irAEs) induced by antiprogrammed cell death-1 antibodies (anti-PD-1-Ab). However, whether the positivity patterns of both antibodies are associated with the risk of thyroid irAEs is unknown.

- **Objective**: The aim of the present study was to clarify the association of the pattern of TgAb and TPOAb positivity at baseline with the risk of thyroid irAEs induced by anti-PD-1-Ab.

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 516) were evaluated for TgAb and TPOAb at baseline and prospectively for thyroid function every 6 weeks for 24 weeks after initiating anti-PD-1-Ab.

- **Results**: Fifty-one (9.9%) patients developed thyroid irAEs (thyrotoxicosis in 34, hypothyroidism without prior thyrotoxicosis in 17). Twenty-five patients subsequently developed hypothyroidism following thyrotoxicosis. The cumulative incidence of thyroid irAEs differed among four groups classified by the presence of TgAb/TPOAb at baseline:
	1. TgAb-(-)/TPOAb-(-), 4.6% [19/415]
	2. TgAb-(-)/TPOAb-(+), 15.8% [9/57]
	3. TgAb-(+)/TPOAb-(-), 42.1% [8/19]
	4. TgAb-(+)/TPOAb-(+), 60.0% [15/25]

These results were significant for groups 1 vs 2–4 (P ≤ .001), groups 2 vs 3 (P = 0.008), and group 4 (P < .001). There were differing incidences of thyrotoxicosis (groups 1–4: 3.1%, 5.3%, 31.6%, 48.0%, respectively; P < .001) in groups 1 vs 3 and 4, and groups 2 vs 3 and 4. Hypothyroidism incidences were (groups 1–4: 2.9%, 15.8%, 31.6%, 60.0%, respectively; P < .001) in groups 1 vs 2 to 4, and groups 2 vs other groups.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: A pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^114zDFsD]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Autoimmunity is a common etiology of subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo), characterized clinically by high levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO). Anti-TPO induces cell-mediated cytotoxicity and its presence is associated with the development of thyroid dysfunction. Adults with SHypo and positive anti-TPO are more prone to progress to overt hypothyroidism, with studies showing long-term follow-up of up to 20 years indicating a progression rate of 4.3% per year for positive antibodies versus 2.6% per year for negative antibodies.

For these patients, the indication for treatment remains controversial. Two guidelines suggest considering treatment in the presence of positive antibodies to prevent progression to overt hypothyroidism, irrespective of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, as do some international experts. Conversely, another guideline does not mention antibody status as an indication for treatment. Despite controversial recommendations, physicians often use anti-TPO testing to decide whether to initiate treatment. In a survey of American Thyroid Association members and primary care providers, approximately 10%–20% more physicians would initiate therapy in SHypo if antibodies were positive than if antibodies were negative.

Little data on the frequency of anti-TPO measurements at the population level exist. However, a population-based study of 5,552 outpatients found a relatively high proportion of 3% per year of participants with at least one anti-TPO antibody test. Data are very limited on the impact of positive antibodies, as no large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that antibody status influences the effectiveness of levothyroxine on clinical outcomes in adults with SHypo.

### Clinical review: Clinical utility of thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) measurements for patients with differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) [^114JFjKy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) are primarily measured in serum alongside thyroglobulin (Tg), the primary tumor marker used to monitor patients with differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC). Every specimen requires TgAb testing to ensure that the Tg measurement is not compromised by TgAb interference. When present, TgAb concentrations can be monitored as a surrogate tumor marker.

The study aimed to review published reports to determine if there are associations between DTC, thyroid autoimmunity (such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis), and the presence of TgAb. Additionally, it evaluated methodological factors influencing TgAb interference with serum Tg testing.

PubMed was utilized to identify studies published over the last 55 years that focused on DTC relationships with thyroid autoimmunity and the presence of thyroid autoantibodies.

Several studies have reported significant associations between papillary thyroid cancer and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which may have favorable prognostic significance. TgAb is detected in approximately 20% of DTC patients and may be a more specific thyroid tumor marker than thyroid peroxidase antibodies. TgAb interferes with Tg immunometric assay (IMA) measurements, leading to falsely low or undetectable Tg values, particularly when TgAb concentrations are high and serum Tg concentrations (measured by RIA) are low. Changes in Tg-secreting thyroid tissue impact TgAb concentrations, and thus the TgAb trend can be used as a more reliable surrogate DTC tumor marker than Tg IMA.

### Thyroid autoantibodies [^111mnQ72]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Low credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody (TSH-R-Ab or TRAb) testing plays a pivotal role in arriving at the aetiological diagnosis in patients with thyrotoxicosis. A positive test establishes the diagnosis of Graves' disease (GD), while a negative result, in conjunction with imaging studies, supports other possible aetiologies. In patients with GD, TRAb levels at diagnosis and at the time of withdrawal of antithyroid drugs can identify patients who are unlikely to achieve remission and guide clinical management decisions.

- **Algorithm for management**: We provide an algorithm that incorporates TRAb in the decision-making process for the management of thyrotoxicosis. The utility of TRAb in predicting the risk of fetal and neonatal thyroid dysfunction is established and widely accepted in guidelines. TRAb may also help in the diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy, especially in euthyroid or hypothyroid patients, and its role in guiding its management is evolving as a useful adjunct to the clinical parameters used in making therapeutic decisions.

- **Thyroid autoantibodies**: Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) indicate thyroid autoimmunity. The most common use of TPOAb is to identify patients at a higher risk of progression to treatment-requiring hypothyroidism. They also aid the diagnosis of immune thyroiditis and Hashimoto's encephalopathy.

- **Thyroglobulin measurement**: Thyroglobulin measurement is used to help guide differentiated thyroid cancer treatment. TgAb is used as an accompanying test with thyroglobulin measurement, as its presence can interfere with the thyroglobulin assay. A negative TgAb result reduces the risk of falsely altered results.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^1178ZGxH]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, specifically with respect to laboratory follow-up, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend measuring serum TSH at 4–8 weeks after initiating treatment or following a change in dose. Once an adequate replacement dose has been determined, periodic TSH measurements should be obtained after 6 months and then at 12-month intervals, or more frequently if the clinical situation dictates otherwise.

### Genome-wide analysis identifies two susceptibility loci for positive thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies [^111mVgN2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) are main components of the thyroid gland and play an essential role in thyroid hormone synthesis. The development of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin (TgAb) is the major diagnostic hallmark and early indicator of autoimmune thyroid disease. TPOAb and TgAb are under strong genetic influence; however, genetic factors that determine thyroid antibody positivity are largely unknown.

- **Materials and methods**: To identify novel loci associated with TPOAb and/or TgAb positivity, we performed a genome-wide meta-analysis in a total of 2613 individuals from Croatia. Participants with elevated plasma TPOAb and/or TgAb were defined as cases (N = 619), and those with TPOAb and TgAb within reference values were defined as controls (N = 1994).

- **Results**: We identified 2 novel loci, of which 1 is located within the YES1 gene (rs77284350, P = 1.50 × 10⁻⁸), and the other resides within the IRF8 gene (rs16939945, P = 5.04 × 10⁻⁸).

- **Conclusions**: Although the observed variants were associated with TPOAb and TgAb positivity for the first time, both YES1 and IRF8 were previously linked to susceptibility to other autoimmune diseases and represent plausible biological candidates. This study adds to the knowledge of genetics underlying thyroid antibodies and provides a good basis for further research.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^113CAmza]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, more specifically with respect to anti-TPO antibodies, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of anti-TPO antibodies (either at 20–26 weeks of gestation or during the first trimester and repeated at 20–26 weeks of gestation if initially elevated) in pregnant patients with hypothyroidism who have a history of Graves' disease treated with radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy before pregnancy.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^112yfSqc]. Thyroid (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thyroid disease in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to thyrotropin receptor antibody, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend remeasuring TSH receptor antibody in late pregnancy (weeks 30–34) in patients with elevated TSH receptor antibody levels at 18–22 weeks of gestation, to guide decisions regarding neonatal monitoring. Do not test patients with an intact thyroid who are no longer in need of antithyroid drug therapy.

### Mutational analysis in pediatric thyroid cancer and correlations with age, ethnicity, and clinical presentation [^116kTRWQ]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Thyroiditis was diagnosed in 16 out of 39 (41%) patients based on either pathology or positive thyroid antibodies. Most patients had thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies measured together with antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies before their thyroidectomy, and all had documented post-thyroidectomy Tg level and antibody titers. Of the 39 patients, 28 had anti-TPO antibody testing, and 12 (43%) were elevated. Thirteen (81.25%) of those with thyroiditis were diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and three (18.75%) with non-PTC (p = 0.27).

From the cases with positive mutations, 62.5% of the PTC cases had thyroiditis compared with 20% of the non-PTC cases (p = 0.01). Patients with thyroiditis compared with those without thyroiditis had mutations in 68.7% versus 43.5%, respectively (p = 0.12), and a BRAF V600E mutation was present in both groups. The small number of cases with mutations does not allow us to comment on whether thyroiditis affects the type of mutation noted.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: Role of TRAbs [^113cT9y7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by activation of the TSH receptor by stimulatory autoantibodies (TSH receptor antibodies, or TRAbs), leading to unregulated thyroid hormone production. Diagnosis is largely based on the typical clinical picture and laboratory thyroid panel. Establishment of elevated serum levels of TRAbs by competitive binding assay or cell-binding assay has its unique role in diagnosis and management, especially in differential diagnosis, therapy selection, prognostication, evaluation of thyroid function during pregnancy, peri-conceptional and neonatal thyroid workup, and in certain special situations.

Inclusion of TRAbs in the GD diagnostic algorithm can improve the cost-effectiveness of GD management. Best practice guidelines were developed to provide evidence-based recommendations for the use of TRAbs in GD management for healthcare providers in South Asia. A panel of endocrinologists with a minimum of 10 years of clinical experience in thyroid disorders reviewed the existing literature and its quality. After deliberation and discussion, they developed 21 recommendations surrounding the best practices for the role of TRAbs in GD management.

### Thyroglobulin antibodies could be a potential predictive marker for papillary thyroid carcinoma [^111Np5JZ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is associated with an increased risk of developing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The relationship between thyroid autoimmunity and cancer remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether preoperative thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) could be a potential predictor of PTC in patients with thyroid nodules and to assess whether there is an association of preoperative TgAb with lymph node metastases.

- **Methods**: This retrospective, non-randomized study included 854 patients who underwent standard total thyroidectomy. Benign thyroid nodules were diagnosed in 447 patients, and 407 presented with malignant nodules. The examined parameters included the clinical characteristics, preoperative TSH and TgAb levels, and the histopathological characteristics of the tumor.

- **Results**: Tumor size > 10 mm (p = 0.01), presence of PTC (p 10 mm (p 3.4 μU/ml, p = 0.038) were independent risk factors for PTC based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis.

- **Conclusions**: This study showed that TgAb positivity was an independent risk factor for PTC. A positive correlation exists between TgAb and PTC in patients with indeterminate nodules. Additionally, a positive correlation exists between TgAb and lymph node metastases in patients with PTC.

### Antithyroid peroxidase antibodies in patients with high normal range thyroid stimulating hormone [^117Vamuy]. Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is linked to heart disease and decreased quality of life. Since screening guidelines for the general population are controversial, and physicians use clinical judgment in deciding to order thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), high-normal levels of TSH pose a dilemma. This study's objective was to compare rates of positive anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (antiTPO) tests in persons with high-normal versus low-normal TSH levels.

- **Methods**: Physicians at a publicly funded family medicine outpatient clinic used a standard clinical set of criteria to identify patients in need of TSH testing. Patients with non-thyroid diseases or conditions that affect TSH were excluded. A total of 143 patients over 18 years of age presented with symptoms necessitating TSH testing and had levels that fell between 0.36 and 5.49 IU/ml. They were allocated into two groups: 100 patients with TSH levels between 0.36–2.49 IU/ml (low-normal TSH) and 43 patients with TSH levels between 2.5–5.49 IU/ml (high-normal TSH). All had measurements of antiTPO levels. Primary outcomes were rates of antiTPO and demographic comparisons between the two groups.

- **Results**: The prevalence of the antiTPO antibody in the high-normal group was 18.6% versus 3% in the low-normal range TSH. The antiTPO prevalence was higher in females than in males and had a racial predominance in Hispanics compared to African Americans; however, these differences were not statistically significant.

- **Conclusions**: AntiTPO measurement may be appropriate for patients with high-normal TSH.

### To reflect human autoimmune thyroiditis, thyroid peroxidase (not thyroglobulin) antibodies should be measured in female (not sex-independent) NOD.H2mice [^1167PJQx]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2019). Low credibility.

NOD.H2 h4 mice are the most commonly used model for human autoimmune thyroiditis. Because thyroid autoimmunity develops slowly over months, NOD.H2 h4 mice are usually exposed to excess dietary iodide to accelerate and amplify the process. However, unlike the female bias in human thyroid autoimmunity, autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (TgAb) are reported to be similar in male and female NOD.H2 h4.

We sought evidence for sexual dimorphism in other parameters in this strain maintained on regular or iodized water. Without iodide, TgAb levels are higher in males than in females, the reverse of human disease. In humans, autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) are a better marker of disease than TgAb. In NOD.H2 h4 mice, TPOAb develop more slowly than TgAb, being detectable at 6 months of age versus 4 months for the latter. Remarkably, unlike TgAb, TPOAb levels are higher in female than male NOD.H2 h4 mice on both regular and iodized water.

As previously observed, serum T4 levels are similar in both sexes. However, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are significantly higher in males than females, with or without iodide exposure. TSH levels correlate with TgAb levels in male NOD.H2 h4 mice, suggesting a possible role for TSH in TgAb development. However, there is no correlation between TSH and TPOAb levels, the latter being more important than TgAb in human disease.

In conclusion, if the goal of an animal model is to closely reflect human disease, TPOAb rather than TgAb should be measured in older female NOD.H2 h4 mice, an approach requiring patience and the use of mouse TPO pro.

### Evaluation of risk-factor-based screening for thyroid peroxidase antibody positivity in pregnancy [^112NtnSd]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

To determine whether risk-factor-based screening for thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy performs well for detecting thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb), a marker for autoimmune thyroid disease, we prospectively evaluated pregnant women using The Endocrine Society's eleven screening questions. Serum was analyzed for TPOAb.

We enrolled 546 women. TPOAb positivity was higher in women with a personal (odds ratio (OR) = 8.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.7–37.4; P = 0.02) or family history of thyroid disease (OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.3–5.7; P = 0.02). There was no association between the number of positive responses and TPOAb positivity (P = 0.41). Risk-factor-based screening missed 18 women (33%) with TPOAb.

In conclusion, one-third of women with TPOAb were missed by the case-finding method. A personal or family history of thyroid disease was most strongly associated with TPOAb positivity.

### Diseases associated with thyroid autoimmunity: Explanations for the expanding spectrum [^113QuGwz]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Anyone who has been in an endocrine clinic will appreciate that associations exist between autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and other autoimmune disorders. However, the full extent of these associations is still not fully appreciated, and new associations are being uncovered that may shed new light on the pathogenic basis for these connections. The underlying reasons for these associations are only now becoming understood. This review is based on the British Thyroid Association Pitt-Rivers Lecture 2010.

- **Update on studies**: The first section provides an update on studies that have detailed the strength of various autoimmune disease associations.
- **Environmental and genetic factors**: The second section discusses the environmental and genetic factors underlying these associations.
- **Unexpected AITD associations**: The final section describes some recently identified, unexpected AITD associations.

Unraveling these associations further will illuminate the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and offer the prospect of new therapeutic approaches.

### Why measure thyroglobulin autoantibodies rather than thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies [^1171SszC]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) are of immunoglobulin G (IgG) class and have high affinities for their respective autoantigens. Both autoantibodies are markers of thyroid autoimmunity and can be measured by a variety of assays. From a clinical perspective, TgAb are less prevalent than TPOAb and are less useful for predicting thyroid dysfunction. Moreover, TgAb interfere with thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements used to monitor metastases in thyroid cancer. However, increasing evidence suggests that these TgAb provide a surrogate for Tg.

In terms of disease pathogenesis, Tg has been suggested to play a role in Graves' ophthalmopathy. Pending further studies, TgAb epitopes could distinguish between individuals who are euthyroid and those with clinical disease. A final, intriguing reason for measuring and characterizing TgAb is the renewed interest these autoantibodies have sparked in their autoantigen. It is conceivable that Tg polymorphisms, combined with the explosive mix of iodine, TPO, and H2O2 necessary for thyroid hormone synthesis, inadvertently provide the trigger for the autoimmune thyroid response.

### Postoperative unstimulated thyroglobulin accurately predicts outcomes in high-risk differentiated thyroid cancer: A retrospective cohort study [^114URNhU]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Our study intentionally focuses on high-risk DTC patients — a challenging subgroup that represents only 10%–15% of all DTC cases but accounts for a disproportionate share of disease-specific morbidity and mortality, particularly where evidence supporting the use of unstimulated thyroglobulin (UTg) is scarce. We believe that the insights gained from studying this targeted group provide valuable data that may not be captured in larger, more heterogeneous populations. While the number of patients in our study is indeed small, the focus on this rare and challenging cohort allows for a deeper understanding of their unique clinical characteristics and treatment responses, which can inform future research and clinical practice.

### Early appearance of thyroid autoimmunity in children followed from birth for type 1 diabetes risk [^113uXXSJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025).

Autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin (TgAb) define preclinical autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), which can progress to either clinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. We determined the age at seroconversion in children genetically at risk for type 1 diabetes.

TPOAb and TgAb seropositivity were determined in 5066 healthy children with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR3- or DR4-containing haplogenotypes from The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. Children seropositive on the cross-sectional initial screen at age 8 to 13 years had longitudinally collected samples (from age 3.5 months) screened retrospectively and prospectively for thyroid autoantibodies to identify age at seroconversion. The first-appearing autoantibody was related to sex, HLA genotype, family history of AITD, and subsequent thyroid dysfunction and disease.

The youngest appearance of TPOAb and TgAb was age 10 and 15 months, respectively. Girls had higher incidence rates of both autoantibodies. Family history of AITD was associated with a higher risk of TPOAb (hazard ratio [HR] 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–3.08) and TgAb (HR 2.55; 95% CI, 1.91–3.41). The risk of progressing to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism was not different between TgAb and TPOAb, but children with both autoantibodies appearing at the same visit had a higher risk compared to TPOAb appearing first (HR 6.34; 95% CI, 2.72–14.76).

Thyroid autoantibodies may appear during the first years of life, especially in girls, and in children with a family history of AITD.

### Clinical consequences of a change in anti-thyroglobulin antibody assays during the follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^117AbqsX]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroglobulin (Tg) quantitation by immunometric assays is compromised by anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs), potentially resulting in falsely low Tg concentrations. TgAb screening is recommended when measuring Tg, but TgAb immunoassays do not detect all possible TgAbs in circulation. We assessed the impact of a change in TgAb assay on the apparent disease status of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).

Patients seen at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, for follow-up of DTC, who had been tested using two different TgAb assays (Beckman Access and Roche Elecsys) were identified. Electronic medical records were reviewed to evaluate any impact the change in TgAb assay had on clinical disease status assessment and follow-up.

A total of 1,457 patients were tested using both assays. A change in TgAb status was found in 124 (8.5%) patients; 117 patients who were TgAb-negative on the Beckman assay became TgAb-positive with the Roche assay. Additional testing was performed in five of these patients. Seven patients previously considered TgAb-positive were now TgAb-negative. In all seven cases, physicians documented that they considered these patients now to be truly TgAb-negative and free of disease.

Discrepancies in TgAb status are seen when using different TgAb assays. Relying on Tg and TgAb measurements to determine disease status may lead to underestimation of residual cancer. A multimodal (clinical, biochemical, and radiologic) approach to follow-up on patients with DTC should be continued, pending development.

### Prognostic value of preoperative anti-thyroglobulin antibody in differentiated thyroid cancer [^112izesM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

The coexistence of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and thyroid autoimmune disease might represent a better or worse prognosis. This study investigated the prognostic importance of preoperative anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) in DTC patients.

This retrospective hospital-cohort study enrolled 1,171 consecutive DTC patients with preoperative TgAb data, who underwent total thyroidectomy between January 2006 and December 2011. Clinical parameters studied included demographics, primary tumor characteristics, radioiodine therapy, thyroid function tests, preoperative thyroglobulin (Tg) and TgAb levels, and cancer persistence/recurrence.

A total of 254 (21.7%) patients were preoperatively TgAb positive. The percentage positive for thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody and lymphocytic thyroiditis was significantly higher in the TgAb-positive group. The TgAb-positive group had a significantly higher rate of lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis both overall and in patients without TPOAb and lymphocytic thyroiditis (non-HT group). The mean number of total and central lymph nodes dissected and rate of lateral lymph node dissection were significantly higher in the TgAb-positive group, both overall and in non-HT patients. In regression analysis, preoperative TgAb was an independent risk factor for lateral lymph node metastasis. Over 50.2 ± 14.5 months of follow-up, disease persistence/recurrence was not significantly different between patients with and without TgAb, both overall and in non-HT patients. Preoperative TgAb showed no significant impact on this outcome.

### Is there a role for unstimulated thyroglobulin velocity in predicting recurrence in papillary thyroid carcinoma patients with detectable thyroglobulin after radioiodine ablation [^117AYbUz]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), thyroidectomy, radioiodine (131 I) therapy, and thyroid hormone suppression are the mainstay of treatment, conferring excellent overall survival. Despite effective initial treatment, the prognosis is significantly affected by tumor recurrence, which occurs in up to 30% of patients over 30 years. Improvement of methods to detect recurrence early and accurately is therefore clinically important.

Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a glycoprotein specific to differentiated thyroid tissue. After thyroidectomy and radioiodine remnant ablation, an elevated serum Tg level is a sensitive marker of residual cancer. Periodical measurement of Tg after initial thyroid ablative therapy is recommended in the monitoring of PTC patients. Nevertheless, Tg levels may be affected by the various laboratory assays used. Interference may also occur in the presence of anti-Tg antibodies or heterophile antibodies.

The sensitivity of Tg can be increased with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulated by either thyroid hormone withdrawal or recombinant human TSH administration. On the other hand, some patients may present with elevated interference-corrected Tg levels alone, without clinical or radiological evidence of disease on physical examination, neck ultrasound, diagnostic radioiodine whole body scan (WBS), and/or computed tomography (CT) or 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Although possibly nonspecific, especially with the development of increasingly sensitive Tg assays, this condition is generally taken to represent occult malignant disease.

### Association of thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies with thyroid function in pregnancy: An individual participant data meta-analysis [^111Uorua]. Thyroid (2022). Low credibility.

Thyroid autoimmunity is common in pregnant women and is associated with thyroid dysfunction and adverse obstetric outcomes. Most studies focus on thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) assessed by a negative-positive dichotomy and rarely consider thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs). This study aimed to determine the association of TPOAbs and TgAbs, both individually and interdependently, with maternal thyroid function.

- **Methods**: This was a meta-analysis of individual participant cross-sectional data from 20 cohorts in the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy. Women with multiple pregnancies, pregnancies by assisted reproductive technology, history of thyroid disease, or use of thyroid-interfering medication were excluded. Associations of (log2) TPOAbs and TgAbs (with or without mutual adjustment) with cohort-specific z-scores of (log2) thyrotropin (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), total triiodothyronine (TT3), free thyroxine (fT4), total thyroxine (TT4), or triiodothyronine:thyroxine (T3:T4) ratio were evaluated in a linear mixed model.

- **Results**: A total of 51,138 women participated; 51,094 had TPOAb data, and 27,874 had TgAb data. Isolated TPOAb positivity was present in 4.1% [95% confidence interval, CI: 3.0 to 5.2], isolated TgAb positivity in 4.8% [CI: 2.9 to 6.6], and positivity for both antibodies in 4.7% [CI: 3.1 to 6.3]. Compared with antibody-negative women, TSH was higher in women with isolated TPOAb positivity (z-score increment 0.40, CI: 0.16 to 0.64) and TgAb positivity (0.21, CI: 0.10 to 0.32), with the highest increase in those positive for both antibodies (0.54, CI: 0.

### Point-of-care assays for autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase and to thyroglobulin [^112xsnU2]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Point-of-care (POC) assays for autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and to thyroglobulin (TgAb) are described. Both assays are based on the ability of autoantibodies in test samples (whole blood, plasma, or sera) to inhibit the binding of monoclonal antibodies to TPO or Tg. The assays require no special equipment and give results in 10 minutes.

Analysis of samples from healthy blood donors (n = 80), patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (n = 97), and non-thyroid autoimmune diseases (n = 20) showed that results with the POC tests compared well to those obtained by agglutination assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The reference immunoprecipitation assays (IPA), based on 125I-labeled TPO or Tg, were more sensitive than the POC tests, particularly in the case of TgAb measurements. However, no samples were found positive by POC test and negative by IPA, emphasizing the high specificity of the POC assays.

Our results suggest that POC testing for TPOAb and TgAb with assays such as those we describe could be useful in certain situations. These include the prediction of postpartum thyroiditis and the development of interferon-alpha-related thyroid disease.

### Diagnostic confusion attributable to spurious elevation of both total thyroid hormone and thyroid hormone uptake measurements in the setting of autoantibodies: Case report and review of related literature [^1141qfQ5]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

To review the effect of thyroid autoantibodies on thyroid function assays and to present a case in which thyroid autoantibodies resulted in spurious assay readings for both total thyroid hormone levels and thyroid hormone uptake measurements, we present a detailed case and review the relevant literature.

A 61-year-old man with a history of autoimmune disease presented for evaluation of abnormal results of thyroid function tests. The patient had been treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and was noted to have an elevated total thyroxine (T4) level in the setting of a low total triiodothyronine (T3) value and a mildly elevated thyrotropin concentration. He had been referred for evaluation of a presumed deiodinase deficiency that impaired conversion of T4 to T3. During treatment with levothyroxine, these test results were confirmed, and the patient was also found to have an elevated T4 uptake. These findings were initially thought to be due to an excess of transthyretin; however, more extensive testing revealed that the patient had an autoantibody to T4 that interfered with the assays for both T4 and T4 uptake.

Autoantibodies to both T3 and T4 have been described. Such antibodies are not uncommon in patients with thyroid disease. On rare occasions, these antibodies may cause spurious assay readings and obscure the diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which both the total T4 level and the T4 uptake were elevated because of the presence of autoantibodies.

### Association between thyroid autoantibodies and miscarriage and preterm birth: Meta-analysis of evidence [^112zniSx]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

The prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in the included studies varied between 5.4% and 31%. The miscarriage rates ranged from 2.4% to 42.9%. The association between thyroid autoantibodies and miscarriage was consistently strong across varying rates of thyroid autoantibodies and miscarriages. The individual studies used various assays for thyroid peroxidase antibodies, each with different detection limits and thresholds for test positivity, usually predetermined by the assay manufacturer. The effect size does not seem to be related to the threshold concentrations of thyroid peroxidase antibodies.

Although 28 of the 31 miscarriage studies and all five preterm studies showed a positive association, there was still unexplained heterogeneity in the meta-analyses for both miscarriage and preterm birth. The clinical heterogeneity between the studies on the population, test assay platforms, thresholds used, and the quality features of the studies are likely to have contributed to the statistical heterogeneity observed.

The strength of inference on the effectiveness of levothyroxine is weakened by the small number of studies. There have been only two small randomized trials involving a total of 187 women. One of them was not placebo-controlled. To obtain a definitive answer on the role of levothyroxine in reducing miscarriages and preterm births, a large placebo-controlled randomized trial is needed, with live births as the primary outcome. The two randomized studies included in the review did not find any safety concerns.

### Thyroglobulin autoantibodies: Is there any added value in the detection of thyroid autoimmunity in women consulting for fertility treatment [^112TDVAC]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) is frequent in infertile women, but the contribution of thyroglobulin autoantibodies (Tg-Abs) to TAI remains unclear in the literature. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of TAI in women consulting for fertility problems and to investigate the impact of isolated Tg-Abs, isolated thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPO-Abs), and the presence of both autoantibody types on thyroid function. Furthermore, thyroid function was compared between women with and without TAI and between infertile and fertile women.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional data analysis nested within an ongoing prospective cohort study was conducted to determine the prevalence of TAI in unselected women consulting our tertiary referral center for reproductive medicine (CRM). The women underwent a determination of serum thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), TPO-Abs, and Tg-Abs. The cause of infertility, age, body-mass index (BMI), and smoking habits were recorded.

- **Results**: The prevalence of TAI was 16% (163/992). In 8% of cases, both types of autoantibodies were present; 5% had isolated positive Tg-Abs, and 4% had isolated positive TPO-Abs (p = 0.025 and p = 0.003, respectively). The prevalence of TAI was significantly higher in infertile women compared to fertile controls (19% vs. 13%; p = 0.047). The median serum TSH level was significantly higher in women with TAI and isolated positive Tg-Abs compared to those without TAI (1.83 [1.44] and 1.90 [0.85] vs. 1.47 [0.94] mIU/L; p < 0.001 respectively).

### Thyroid peroxidase antibodies in early pregnancy: Utility for prediction of postpartum thyroid dysfunction and implications for screening [^114ZyAvy]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) in pregnancy are a marker for postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD) and long-term thyroid dysfunction, with variable sensitivity and specificity in PPTD prediction. To test its utility in prediction, we recruited 308 TPOAb-positive women (147 developed PPTD in the PPTD group and 161 remained euthyroid in the PPTE group) and 102 TPOAb-negative women (none developed PPTD) in early pregnancy (median, 18; range, 9–19 weeks' gestation). TPOAb levels were higher in the PPTD group (median 125.2 kIU/L; p < 0.001), and in its hypothyroid (162.4 kIU/L; p < 0.0001), hyperthyroid (114.2 kIU/L; p < 0.007), and biphasic (105.1 kIU/L; p < 0.02) variants, compared to the PPTE group (66.7 kIU/L).

The incidence of PPTD was significantly higher with TPOAb levels above 58.2 kIU/L (early pregnancy versus postpartum; relative risk 1.37 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17–1.61] versus 0.78 [95% CI 0.5–1.2]) compared to levels below. The integrated postpartum TPOAb response was higher in the PPTD group (median 159 kIU/L per week) and its variants (hypothyroid 199 kIU/L per week; biphasic 180 kIU/L per week; hyperthyroid 120 kIU/L per week), compared to the PPTE group (86 kIU/L per week; p < 0.004). Median early pregnancy TPOAb levels in the PPTD and PPTE groups correlated well with the postpartum antibody response (r = 0.58, p < 0.001). The sensitivity of TPOAb in PPTD prediction was 100% in both early pregnancy and postpartum, specificity was 62% (early pregnancy) versus 41% (postpartum), and positive predictive value was 48% in both early pregnancy and postpartum.

### A longitudinal study of thyroid autoantibodies in pregnancy: The importance of test timing [^113ysmUG]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAb) are frequently measured to investigate thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy. Despite the recognized fall of these autoantibodies in pregnancy, there is limited guidance on the timing of such testing. The study assessed the optimal test timing of TPOAb/TGAb for the detection of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD).

- **Design**: Prospective longitudinal study with recruitment in Trimester 1.

- **Patients**: Healthy women ≤ 13 weeks' gestation from Mercy Hospital for Women, a tertiary obstetric hospital in Melbourne.

- **Measurements**: Serum TPOAb, TGAb, TSH, and fT4 were measured at Trimester 1 (T1), Trimester 2 (T2), Trimester 3 (T3), and postpartum (PP) in each participant. Postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD) was defined if TSH deviated from the assay's nonpregnant reference interval. Longitudinal random-effect logistic regression was used to investigate the association between time and positive/negative thyroid autoantibody status.

- **Results**: Samples from 140 women at T1 (12.0: 10.3–13.0) (median: IQR weeks' gestation); 95 at T2 (24.3: 23.0–25.9), 79 at T3 (35.9: 34.8–36.7), and 83 at PP (12.4: 10.8–14.6 weeks postpartum) were attained. At T1, 13 (9%) and 15 (11%) women had positive TPOAb and TGAb, respectively. The odds of having a positive TPOAb were 96% lower at T2 [OR = 0.04 (95% CI: 0.02–0.8; P = 0.03)] and 97% lower at T3 [OR = 0.03 (95% CI: 0.001–0.6; P = 0.02)] than at T1. Similarly, the odds of having a positive TGAb were 99.4% lower [OR = 0.006 (95% CI: 0–0.3; P = 0.01)] at T2.

### Early appearance of thyroid autoimmunity in children followed from birth for type 1 diabetes risk [^111zB991]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin (TgAb) define preclinical autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), a common endocrine disease characterized by T- and B-lymphocyte infiltration of the thyroid gland. Over time, many patients with AITD progress to develop hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, which we define as clinical thyroid disease. Either autoantibody may be present independently of the other; not all patients with thyroid disease are autoantibody positive, and not all autoantibody positive individuals develop hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The immune-mediated destruction of the thyroid is likely initiated by environmental factors in individuals who are genetically susceptible to autoimmunity.

AITD is thus more common in patients with other autoimmune diseases or with a family history of autoimmune disease. Furthermore, AITD is diagnosed 5 to 10 times more often in women compared to men, with a slightly lower female-to-male ratio, 4:1, in children and adolescents. Although hypothyroidism is the most common clinical presentation of individuals with AITD, hyperthyroidism can occur in patients with TPOAb and TgAb; therefore, we include both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in our definition of individuals with clinical thyroid disease.

The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study follows children from the general population at increased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes, tested at birth or in the neonatal period for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes. The co-occurrence of type 1 diabetes and AITD is well documented.

### Thyrogen [^111AczNb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Thyrogen Tg testing alone and in combination with diagnostic whole body scanning is compared with results after thyroid hormone withdrawal. In anti-Tg antibody negative patients with a thyroid remnant or cancer (as defined by a withdrawal Tg ≥ 2.5 ng/mL or a positive scan after thyroid hormone withdrawal or radioiodine therapy), the Thyrogen Tg was positive (≥ 2.5 ng/mL) in 69% (40/58) of patients after 2 doses of Thyrogen. In these same patients, adding the whole body scan increased the detection rate of thyroid remnant or cancer to 84% (49/58) of patients after 2 doses of Thyrogen.

Among patients with metastatic disease confirmed by a post-treatment scan or by lymph node biopsy, Thyrogen Tg was positive (≥ 2.5 ng/mL) in all 35 patients, while Tg on thyroid hormone suppressive therapy was positive (≥ 2.5 ng/mL) in 79% of these patients. As with thyroid hormone withdrawal, the intrapatient reproducibility of Thyrogen testing, with regard to both Tg stimulation and radioiodine imaging, has not been studied.

- **Hypothyroid signs and symptoms**: Thyrogen administration was not associated with the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism that accompanied thyroid hormone withdrawal as measured by the Billewicz scale. Statistically significant worsening in all signs and symptoms was observed during the hypothyroid phase (p < 0.01).

### Thyroglobulin antibody is associated with increased cancer risk in thyroid nodules [^111sVRmn]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

The association between autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) and thyroid cancer remains unclear despite many previous reports. This study investigated whether serologic thyroid antibodies are predictive of thyroid cancer in patients with thyroid nodules.

- **Method**: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients with thyroid nodules evaluated by ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology at our institution between January 2006 and December 2008. Thyroid autoimmunity was assessed by measuring thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb). The final outcome, deciding a benign or malignant status, involved a combination of cytology and histology.

- **Results**: Of the 1638 patients, malignant nodules displayed a higher rate of positive TgAb (30.8% vs. 19.6%; p < 0.001) and elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels (2.5 ± 2.8 mIU/L vs. 2.1 ± 2.0 mIU/L; p = 0.021) compared to benign nodules. The rate of positive TPOAb was not higher in malignant nodules, although both TPOAb and TgAb were well correlated with TSH levels and histological AIT. In the multivariate analysis, a positive TgAb was significantly associated with thyroid cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–2.33) with the upper tertile of normal range of TSH levels (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.12–2.63) and above the normal range of TSH levels (OR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.06–3.70).

- **Conclusion**: We report for the first time that a positive serum TgAb test was an independent predictor for thyroid malignancy in thyroid nodules along with serum TSH levels, regardless of the presence of AIT. Our results suggest a close association between positive TgAb and thyroid cancer risk.

### Identification of novel genetic loci associated with thyroid peroxidase antibodies and clinical thyroid disease [^112wBybZ]. PLoS Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of TPOAb-positivity in the general population is high (5–24%), but it is currently unknown why some individuals with thyroid autoimmunity develop clinical thyroid disease, whereas others do not. It is interesting to note that the TPOAb-associated SNPs located in TPO and ATXN2 were not associated with clinical thyroid disease. This suggests that the TPOAbs in these individuals may be of less clinical relevance, providing insight into why TPOAb-positive individuals do or do not eventually develop clinical thyroid disease.

Our study has some limitations. The validity of the results is restricted to individuals from populations of European ancestry. Future GWASs in populations from non-European descent will be required to determine to what extent our results can be generalized to other ethnic groups. Secondly, we did not perform conditional analyses to further identify secondary association signals within the identified loci, nor did we perform functional studies for the identified variants. Further research is therefore needed to unravel the exact biological mechanism behind the observed associations.

The fact that various TPOAb assays were used across the participating cohorts could lead to bias. We therefore used TPOAb-positivity cut-off values as provided by the respective assay manufacturer, instead of using one fixed cut-off value. This is also of clinical importance, as in clinical practice most institutions rely on the TPOAb-positivity cut-off as provided by the assay manufacturer.

### False positives in thyroglobulin determinations due to the presence of heterophile antibodies: An underrecognized and consequential clinical problem [^1123qNCp]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Low credibility.

To report a case series of thyroid cancer patients in whom false positive results in immunometric assays for thyroglobulin (TgIMA) were caused by heterophilic antibody interference, a description is provided of the clinical scenario in which this interference should be suspected, along with recommendations for methods to demonstrate the interference.

- **Methods**: Three patients with unexpectedly elevated thyroglobulin results (range, 1.6–75 ng/mL) were studied. In the first patient, thyroglobulin was elevated despite the presence of Tg antibody. The second patient had suppressed thyroglobulin that was higher than a recent stimulated thyroglobulin. In the third patient, thyroglobulin became detectable years after treatment and did not change after thyroid-stimulating hormone stimulation. TgIMA concentration determination was compared to a mass spectrometry method (TgMS). Thyroglobulin was remeasured after preabsorption with heterophile antibody blocking reagents and after serial dilutions.

- **Results**: In all cases, thyroglobulin was undetectable by TgMS. In 2 of 3 patients, dilutions provided nonlinear thyroglobulin results. After blocking agent preabsorption, thyroglobulin dropped by 35%, 45%, and 91% in the 3 samples.

- **Conclusion**: False positive thyroglobulin concentrations from heterophilic antibody interference significantly impact the management of thyroid cancer. This study shows that TgMS assays can be used to rule out heterophilic antibody interference. This interference should be suspected when a detectable thyroglobulin by TgIMA does not respond to thyroid-stimulating hormone.

### Thyroid peroxidase antibodies in dried blood specimens of newborns [^114xkr1p]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

Previous studies have disclosed that a substantial percentage of infants born to mothers with thyroid autoimmunity have antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) at birth. Furthermore, these antibodies have been shown to be of maternal origin. In view of this, we thought it would be of interest to determine the prevalence of TPOAb in newborns from an unselected population of women. This was done by retrieving stored dried blood specimens from 240 full-term, healthy infants, which had been obtained during 1999 for routine newborn screening. Ten percent of the randomly selected specimens tested TPOAb positive.

Thyroid function in the mothers could not be evaluated because all specimens had been tested anonymously. In summary, our results indicate that a significant percentage of newborns were TPOAb positive. It is unclear at this time whether such antibodies reflected maternal thyroid autoimmunity and/or other autoimmune disorders. However, the close association between autoimmune thyroid disease and TPOAb positivity raises the possibility of abnormal thyroid function in some of the mothers.

### Positive thyroid peroxidase antibody and thyroglobulin antibody are associated with better clinicopathologic features of papillary thyroid cancer [^113CS7xv]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Low credibility.

To compare the thyroid autoantibody status of patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and benign nodular goiter, the study examined possible associations between thyroid autoantibodies and clinicopathologic features of PTC. A total of 3934 participants who underwent thyroidectomy were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into PTC and benign nodule groups according to pathological diagnosis. Based on the preoperative serum antibody results, PTC patients were categorized into thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb)-positive, thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb)-positive, dual TPOAb- and TgAb-positive, or antibody-negative groups.

Of the 3934 enrolled patients, 2926 (74.4%) were diagnosed with PTC. Multivariate regression analyses suggested that high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.732, 95% CI [1.485–2.021], P < .001), positive TgAb (adjusted OR = 1.768, 95% CI [1.436–2.178], P < .001), and positive TPOAb (adjusted OR = 1.452, 95% CI [1.148–1.836], P = 0.002) were independent risk factors for predicting malignancy of thyroid nodules. Multinomial multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that positive TPOAb alone was an independent predictor of less central lymph node metastasis in PTC patients (adjusted OR = 0.643, 95% CI [0.448–0.923], P = 0.017), whereas positive TgAb alone was significantly associated with less extrathyroidal extension (adjusted OR = 0.778, 95% CI [0.622–0.974], P = 0.028). PTC patients with dual-positive TPOAb and TgAb displayed a decreased incidence of extrathyroidal extension.

### Current thyroglobulin autoantibody (TgAb) assays often fail to detect interfering TgAb that can result in the reporting of falsely low/undetectable serum Tg IMA values for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^116nGLu6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Specimens have thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) measured prior to thyroglobulin (Tg) testing because the qualitative TgAb status (positive or negative) determines risk for Tg assay interference, and the quantitative TgAb concentration serves as a surrogate tumor marker for differentiated thyroid cancer.

- **Objective**: This study assessed the reliability of four TgAb methods to detect interfering TgAb [as judged from abnormally low Tg immunometric assay (IMA) to Tg RIA ratios] and determine whether between-method conversion factors might prevent a change in method from disrupting TgAb monitoring.

- **Methods**: Sera from selected and unselected TgAb-negative and TgAb-positive differentiated thyroid cancer patients had serum Tg measured by both IMA and RIA and TgAb measured by a reference method and three additional methods.

- **Results**: The Tg IMA and Tg RIA values were concordant when TgAb was absent. Tg IMA to Tg RIA ratios below 75% were considered to indicate TgAb interference. Manufacturer-recommended cutoffs were set in the detectable range, and when used to determine the presence of TgAb, misclassified many specimens displaying Tg interference as TgAb negative. False-negative misclassifications were virtually eliminated for two of four methods by using the analytical sensitivity (AS) as the detection limit for TgAb. Relationships between values for different specimens were too variable to establish between-method conversion factors.

- **Conclusions**: Many specimens with interfering TgAb were misclassified as TgAb negative using manufacturer-recommended cutoffs. It is recommended…

### Thyroid autoimmunity, thyroglobulin autoantibodies, and thyroid cancer prognosis [^113f8vcn]. Endocrine-related Cancer (2023). High credibility.

The relevance of thyroid autoimmunity to the prognosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma is still unsettled. We decided to investigate the impact of thyroid autoimmunity on the prognosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma and the handling of thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAbs). We evaluated the clinical course of a large group of patients according to the presence (PTC-LT) or absence (PTC) of lymphocytic thyroiditis at histology.

We studied 194 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of PTC and treated them with total thyroidectomy plus ¹³¹I ablation between 2007 and 2009. The median follow-up (with 25th-75th percentiles) was 84.0 (56.4–118.0) months. The remission criteria were: basal Tg < 0.2 ng/mL (or stimulated Tg: < 1), TgAbs < 8 IU/mL (otherwise 'decreasing TgAb trend', a decline of ≥ 20% in sequential TgAb measurements) and unremarkable imaging.

- **Results**: PTC-LT and PTC patients had comparable treatment. TgAbs were detectable in 72.5% of PTC-LT and 16.5% of PTC patients. Time to remission was longer in the detectable than in the undetectable TgAb cohort (28.5 vs. 7.5 months; HR: 0.54, CI: 0.35–0.83, P = 0.005). When comparing PTC-LT to PTC patients, the difference was maintained in the detectable TgAb group (29.3 vs. 13.0 months; HR: 0.38, CI: 0.18–0.80, P = 0.01) but not in the undetectable TgAb cohort (7.7 vs. 7.3 months; HR: 0.90, CI: 0.55–1.47, P = 0.68). Using the decreasing TgAb trend, the influence of detectable TgAbs on time to remission was abolished.

Thyroid autoimmunity does not influence the prognosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. A decreasing TgAb trend seems an appropriate criterion to establish remission.

### Disappearance of humoral thyroid autoimmunity after complete removal of thyroid antigens [^111yiw5C]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The development of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor is a main feature of autoimmune thyroid diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether complete removal of thyroid antigens results in the abatement of humoral thyroid autoimmunity.

- **Design**: Retrospective chart review study of patients treated and monitored with a standard prospective protocol.

- **Setting**: University hospital in Pisa, Italy, between 1976 and 1994.

- **Patients**: 182 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma and serum antibodies to thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin, or TSH receptor due to coexistent clinical Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves' disease, or focal autoimmune thyroiditis.

- **Intervention**: Total thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment to ablate residual or metastatic thyroid tissue. Regular follow-up included iodine-131 whole-body scanning and serum thyroglobulin measurement. The mean follow-up was 10.1 ± 4.1 years, ranging from 4 to 20 years.

- **Measurements**: Serum antibodies to thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin, and TSH receptor.

Results indicated that thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin, and TSH-receptor antibodies progressively disappeared after the initial treatment. The median disappearance time was 6.3 years for thyroid peroxidase antibodies and 3.0 years for thyroglobulin antibodies. There was a statistically significant correlation between the disappearance of thyroid tissue and that of thyroid antibodies. The coexistence of Hashimoto thyroiditis or Graves' disease with thyroid cancer did not modify the pattern of disappearance of thyroid antibodies.

The study concludes that TPOAb positivity was not associated with poor pregnancy-related or fetal outcomes in euthyroid women. However, in euthyroid women with a female fetus, TPOAb positivity was strongly associated with preterm birth. It is important to emphasize the risk of preterm birth in euthyroid women with TPOAb positivity in clinical practice.

### Autoimmunity in thyroid disease [^113Gct4P]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2002). Low credibility.

The autoimmune thyroid diseases, Graves' disease and autoimmune hypothyroidism, represent the two ends of a disease spectrum where an immune response is directed against the thyroid gland. In Graves' disease, antibodies directed against the thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R) lead to the development of glandular overactivity, while in autoimmune hypothyroidism, cell-mediated and humoral thyroid injury leads to destruction of thyroid tissue and thyroid hormone deficiency.

The mechanisms by which these diseases develop are unknown, although it is likely that both diseases occur in genetically susceptible individuals exposed to a permissive environment. A number of environmental factors have been postulated to be involved in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease. There is, however, no direct evidence to support clear causality. Susceptibility loci within immune response genes have been identified, although a significant component of the genetic predisposition to disease remains unknown. This review will focus on some of the studies designed to identify genes that confer susceptibility to the autoimmune disease process within the thyroid gland.

### Early appearance of thyroid autoimmunity in children followed from birth for type 1 diabetes risk [^113KzFUG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin (TgAb) define preclinical autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), which can progress to either clinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.

- **Objective**: We determined the age at seroconversion in children genetically at risk for type 1 diabetes.

- **Methods**: TPOAb and TgAb seropositivity were determined in 5,066 healthy children with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR3- or DR4-containing haplogenotypes from The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. Children seropositive on the cross-sectional initial screen at age 8 to 13 years had longitudinally collected samples (from age 3.5 months) screened retrospectively and prospectively for thyroid autoantibodies to identify age at seroconversion. The first-appearing autoantibody was related to sex, HLA genotype, family history of AITD, and subsequent thyroid dysfunction and disease.

- **Results**: The youngest appearance of TPOAb and TgAb was at age 10 and 15 months, respectively. Girls had higher incidence rates of both autoantibodies. Family history of AITD was associated with a higher risk of TPOAb (hazard ratio [HR] 1.90; 95% CI, 1.17–3.08) and TgAb (HR 2.55; 95% CI, 1.91–3.41). The risk of progressing to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism was not different between TgAb and TPOAb, but children with both autoantibodies appearing at the same visit had a higher risk compared to TPOAb appearing first (HR 6.34; 95% CI, 2.72–14.76).

Thyroid autoantibodies may appear during the first years of life, especially in girls, and in children with a family history of AITD.

### Pregnancy outcomes in women with thyroid peroxidase antibodies [^112YJ2EC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

To estimate the prevalence of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies in the general obstetric population and to compare pregnancy outcomes in women who are antithyroid peroxidase-antibody positive with those who are antithyroid peroxidase-antibody negative, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: Between November 2000 and April 2003, all women who presented for prenatal care underwent thyroid screening. Serum samples from women without clinical hypothyroidism, screened in the first 20 weeks of gestation and who delivered a singleton newborn weighing 500 g or more, were analyzed for concentrations of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies. Serum thyroid peroxidase antibody levels were determined using a chemiluminescent immunoassay. Pregnancy outcomes in women with positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (more than 50 international units/mL) were compared with those with negative levels.

- **Results**: Serum samples from 17,298 women were tested. Of these, 1,012 (6%) women were identified with positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies. Women who were antithyroid peroxidase-antibody positive were older, heavier, and more often parous than women with negative antithyroid peroxidase antibodies. The rate of placental abruption was threefold higher in women with antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (1.0% compared with 0.3%, odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7–6.7) after adjustment for differences in maternal demographics. Seven of the 10 abruptions associated with antithyroid peroxidase antibody occurred in women with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels.

### Early appearance of thyroid autoimmunity in children followed from birth for type 1 diabetes risk [^117JeYkQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The predictive value of TPOAb, TgAb, or both, for abnormal TSH and diagnosis of clinical thyroid disease in clinical practice has been a matter of debate. Interestingly, when we examined if the order of appearance of TPOAb vs. TgAb was a risk for later disease, no difference was found between the first-appearing autoantibody and later clinical thyroid disease. In contrast, children with both autoantibodies appearing at the same visit had a six-fold higher risk of developing clinical thyroid disease compared to children with TPOAb-first. Children with only TPOAb and those with only TgAb at the screening visit at age 8 to 13 years did not differ in the risk of thyroid dysfunction, that is, abnormal TSH, whereas the risk was higher for those with both autoantibodies. Therefore, since half of the children with thyroid autoimmunity had both TPOAb and TgAb at the time of the screening visit, a high overall burden of morbidity is expected in this population. Our investigation raises the possibility that measurement of both thyroid autoantibodies in children in clinical practice should be considered.

A diagnosis of clinical thyroid disease in infants and young children is rare and is likely to be missed, as the diagnosis is more common in older children and adolescents. Our finding of thyroid autoimmunity in the very young, although in a selected cohort at risk for type 1 diabetes, stresses the importance of early awareness to avoid a delay in treatment that may result in an increased risk for neurological damage and growth deficits.

### Determinants and clinical implications of thyroid peroxidase antibodies in middle-aged and elderly individuals: The Rotterdam study [^112Ja45U]. Thyroid (2022). Low credibility.

Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Abs) play an important role in autoimmune thyroid disease, but are also prevalent in healthy individuals. However, it is unclear what determinants may influence the occurrence of TPO-Abs in healthy individuals and how TPO-Abs may affect health outcomes in these individuals. We aimed to identify determinants of TPO-Abs in a large, prospective population-based cohort of middle-aged and elderly individuals and to subsequently assess the association between TPO-Abs and risk of overall and cause-specific mortality.

- **Methods**: We performed binomial and multinomial logistic regression analyses to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association of potential determinants based on previous literature with TPO-Ab positivity (> 35 kU/L), TPO-Ab detectability (> 5 kU/L), and TPO-Ab categories. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and CIs for the association between TPO-Abs and mortality risk.

- **Results**: In 9685 participants (57% women, median baseline age 63.3 years, median follow-up time 10.1 years), we identified female sex (OR = 2.47 [CI 2.13–2.86]) and smoking (OR = 3.10 [CI 2.66–3.62]) as determinants of TPO-Ab positivity and TPO-Ab detectability, respectively. Higher age (OR = 0.98 [CI 0.97–0.98]) and all categories of alcohol consumption (ORs ranging from 0.71–0.78) were associated with lower odds of TPO-Ab detectability. TPO-Ab detectability was associated with a higher risk of overall (HR = 1.09 [CI 1.01–1.17]) and cancer-related (HR = 1.18 [CI 1.01–1.38]) mortality.

### Approach to follow-up of the patient with differentiated thyroid cancer and positive anti-thyroglobulin antibodies [^116KtZia]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are commonly identified in patients with differentiated follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer. When present, they interfere with the measurement of thyroglobulin (Tg), which is the primary biochemical marker used for disease surveillance, creating challenges in monitoring patients for residual or recurrent disease. Moreover, there is variability in measuring anti-Tg antibodies according to the different assays, such that not all patients with anti-Tg antibodies are identifiable on a single assay system.

The persistence of anti-Tg antibodies, especially if levels are rising, may indicate persistent, recurrent, or progressive thyroid cancer. In contrast, declining anti-Tg antibody levels may indicate reduced tumor burden or the absence of disease. In this review, we will explore in a case-based manner the data supporting monitoring and treatment paradigms for patients with anti-Tg antibodies and will stress areas where more evidence is needed to better inform clinicians regarding the management of patients with this challenging situation.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: Role of TRAbs [^115HUrWg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

At the time of their first discovery in 1956, TSAbs were named 'long-acting thyroid stimulators' (LATS). Over the next two decades, the association of TSAbs with GD became stronger through consistent observation of elevated TSABs levels among GD patients. It was also established that the TSAbs bind to the same leucine-rich domain on the A-subunit of the TSH receptor, onto which TSH binds physiologically. The downstream effects of binding of both TSH and TSAbs were also found to be similar, including the generation of cAMP, leading to stimulation of thyroid follicular epithelium proliferation, thyroid growth, release of both thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), and suppression of TSH release from the pituitary, which was actually mediated through negative feedback suppression by T3 and T4.

- **Clinical features and diagnostics**: The core clinical features of GD include palpitations, heat intolerance, and weight loss, due to TSAbs-induced thyrotoxicosis. Diagnostic laboratory findings of GD include a typical serum picture of elevated T3 and T4 with suppressed TSH and detectable levels of TRAbs, specifically TSAbs. The TSAbs are considered to be the specific biomarkers for GD.

- **Contrasting antibodies**: By contrast, the TBAbs bind to TSH receptors and block the action of TSH; these have been associated with hypothyroidism caused by certain forms of autoimmune thyroiditis, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis. Finally, the neutral antibodies do not appear to affect cAMP generation despite binding to TSH receptors, but may induce thyroid cell apoptosis.

### Clinical aggressiveness and long-term outcome in patients with papillary thyroid cancer and circulating anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies [^112Av16b]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

The association between papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis is widely recognized, but less is known about the possible link between circulating anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) titers and PTC aggressiveness. To shed light on this issue, we retrospectively examined a large series of PTC patients with and without positive TgAb.

- **Methods**: Data on 220 TgAb-positive PTC patients (study cohort) were retrospectively collected in 10 hospital-based referral centers. All the patients had undergone near-total thyroidectomy with or without radioiodine remnant ablation. Tumor characteristics and long-term outcomes (follow-up range: 2.5–24.8 years) were compared with those recently reported in 1,020 TgAb-negative PTC patients with similar demographic characteristics. We also assessed the impact on clinical outcome of early titer disappearance in the TgAb-positive group.

- **Results**: At baseline, the study cohort (mean age 45.9 years, range 12.5–84.1 years; 85% female) had a significantly higher prevalence of high-risk patients (6.9% vs. 3.2%, p < 0.05) and extrathyroidal tumor extension (28.2% vs. 24%, p < 0.0001) than TgAb-negative controls. Study cohort patients were also more likely than controls to have persistent disease at the 1-year visit (13.6% vs. 7.0%, p = 0.001) or recurrence during subsequent follow-up (5.8% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.0001). At the final follow-up visit, the percentage of patients with either persistent or recurrent disease in the two cohorts was significantly different (6.4% of TgAb-positive patients vs. 1.7% in the TgAb-negative group, p < 0.0001).
