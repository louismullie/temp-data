## Question

Cause of foul smelling urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of foul-smelling urine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of malodorous urine and whether it reliably indicates infection. Then, I should categorize the major etiologies, including infectious, noninfectious urologic, dietary and metabolic, and systemic or genetic causes. Next, I will appraise the diagnostic value of urine odor across populations, especially older adults, children, and catheterized patients. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned approach to evaluation and testing, and I will double-check where the evidence is strong versus uncertain so I don't overstate claims.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance. Foul-smelling urine is common but nonspecific; it can reflect infection, but it is also frequently due to dehydration, diet, or normal variation, so I should not jump to conclusions about UTI solely based on odor. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic weight of odor in women versus men; in older adult outpatients, foul-smelling urine has been a predictor of UTI in men but not in women, underscoring its limited standalone value and the need for localizing symptoms and objective testing before treating [^ad93cdb2] [^6f4cc955].

> I will now examine infectious etiologies, since these are often top-of-mind. Bacterial UTIs, including cystitis and pyelonephritis, can produce malodorous urine via bacterial metabolism of urea and other substrates; however, odor alone is insufficient to diagnose UTI, and guidelines emphasize not using odor or cloudiness alone to distinguish asymptomatic bacteriuria from true infection, particularly in catheterized patients [^fbc01725] [^76754d5b] [^ed92c551]. Hold on, I should verify the catheter context: in CAUTI, odor is common but nonspecific, and cultures should be guided by symptoms and pyuria rather than smell alone, so I need to ensure I don't overcall CAUTI based on odor [^76754d5b] [^ed92c551].

> Next, I should review noninfectious urologic causes. Dehydration concentrates urine and can intensify odor, and certain foods and supplements can impart characteristic smells; asparagus famously causes a sulfurous odor in some individuals due to methanethiol and S-methyl thioesters, and genetic variation in olfactory receptors explains why only some people detect it, which is a classic example of a benign, diet-related odor change [^87846402]. But wait, what if the odor is fishy or musty? That could signal trimethylaminuria, a metabolic disorder with excess TMA excreted in urine and other secretions, or it could reflect bacterial vaginosis with vaginal discharge contaminating the urine; I should confirm the source and associated symptoms before attributing causality [^7f5253ed] [^732b3084].

> Let me consider systemic and genetic contributors. Maple syrup urine disease produces a sweet, maple-syrup odor due to branched-chain keto acid accumulation, and although rare, it is a classic example of a metabolic cause of malodorous urine; similarly, cresol poisoning can cause dark urine with a strong carbolic odor, reminding me to ask about exposures and toxins when the story fits [^6d5afac9] [^3b04ebed]. I should double-check for medication and supplement effects too, since L-carnitine and choline-related pathways can increase trimethylamine and lead to fishy odors in susceptible patients, reinforcing the need for a careful medication and diet history [^bf980c0a] [^b3c7efad].

> Now, I need to appraise diagnostic value across populations. In older adults, especially in long-term care, foul-smelling urine is a frequent trigger for unnecessary urine cultures and antibiotics, yet most positive cultures reflect asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than true UTI; stewardship guidance explicitly advises against testing based on odor alone and emphasizes aligning cultures with localizing symptoms and pyuria to avoid overtreatment and harm [^d89f8d9c] [^c89f0cc7]. In children, parental reports of smelly urine correlate poorly with UTI, so I should not rely on odor to diagnose pediatric UTIs without supportive findings on urinalysis and culture when indicated [^3d1d74a5]. In catheterized patients, odor is ubiquitous and should not be used to differentiate CA-ASB from CA-UTI, reinforcing the principle that management must be symptom-driven rather than odor-driven [^76754d5b] [^ed92c551].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment either. I initially thought that if odor is present with pyuria, antibiotics might be reasonable, but wait, I should verify the ASB guidance; even with pyuria, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated except in specific high-risk scenarios like pregnancy or urologic procedures, so I need to ensure there are localizing symptoms before prescribing antibiotics [^e2e33772] [^b44724ce]. I should also remember that in women with recurrent UTIs, surveillance urine testing for malodorous or cloudy urine without new symptoms is discouraged, again to avoid treating ASB rather than true infection [^b44724ce].

> Next, I should review a practical, stewardship-aligned approach. First, confirm hydration status and recent diet, medications, and supplements, and ask about vaginal discharge or irritation that could suggest a gynecologic source of odor. Then, assess for localizing urinary symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, or new incontinence. If symptoms are present, obtain a urinalysis and consider culture; if symptoms are absent, avoid testing based on odor alone. In catheterized patients, do not culture based on odor or cloudiness alone, and prioritize removing or changing the catheter when appropriate before obtaining a culture from a freshly placed device [^c89f0cc7] [^76754d5b] [^ed92c551]. I should double-check that I am not inadvertently ordering a culture for a nonurinary source of odor, such as vaginal infection or skin infection, which would misclassify the problem and lead to inappropriate therapy [^c89f0cc7].

> Let me synthesize the hierarchy of causes so I don't miss anything. The most common scenario is benign variation or diet-related odor, especially with dehydration or asparagus intake. The next most common is UTI, but odor alone is insufficient and must be corroborated by symptoms and urinalysis. Less common but important are vaginal infections contaminating the specimen, metabolic or genetic conditions like trimethylaminuria or maple syrup urine disease, and toxin or medication effects. Finally, structural urologic disease such as fistulas or abscesses can produce malodorous discharge or urine, but these are typically accompanied by other distinctive clinical features that should redirect the workup accordingly [^87846402] [^fbc01725] [^7f5253ed] [^6d5afac9] [^253fa265].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure I communicate clearly that foul-smelling urine is a nonspecific finding with limited diagnostic value. It can reflect infection, but it is just as often due to dehydration, diet, or normal variation, and in older adults, children, and catheterized patients, relying on odor to trigger testing or treatment leads to overdiagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria and unnecessary antibiotics. The safest, evidence-based approach is to interpret odor in clinical context, prioritize localizing symptoms, and apply diagnostic stewardship to avoid harm from overtreatment [^d89f8d9c] [^c89f0cc7] [^e2e33772].

---

Foul-smelling urine most often reflects **bacterial infection** (UTI, prostatitis, or catheter-associated infection) [^fbc01725] [^76754d5b] due to ammonia and sulfur compounds from urea-splitting bacteria [^notfound]. Dehydration concentrates urine and intensifies odor, while diet (asparagus, coffee, garlic) and certain medications (antibiotics, vitamins) can also cause transient changes [^87846402] [^ff676142]. Less common causes include metabolic disorders (maple syrup urine disease, trimethylaminuria) [^6d5afac9] [^7f5253ed], liver disease, or fistulas [^253fa265]. Persistent or severe odor warrants urinalysis and culture to identify infection or other pathology [^ff676142].

---

## Infectious causes

- **Urinary tract infections (UTIs)**: Most common cause; bacteria like Proteus, Klebsiella, and E. coli metabolize urea to ammonia and sulfides, producing a strong odor [^fbc01725].

- **Prostatitis**: Chronic bacterial prostatitis can cause foul-smelling urine with pelvic pain and frequency [^91c15f34].

- **Catheter-associated infections**: Odor alone is not diagnostic; cultures are needed to distinguish infection from colonization [^76754d5b] [^ed92c551].

---

## Non-infectious causes

- **Dehydration**: Concentrated urine has a stronger odor; dark yellow urine is common [^ff676142].

- **Diet**: Asparagus, coffee, garlic, and certain spices can impart odor via sulfur-containing metabolites [^87846402].

- **Medications**: Antibiotics (e.g. penicillins), vitamins (B6, B12), and supplements can alter urine odor.

- **Metabolic disorders**: Maple syrup urine disease (sweet odor) [^6d5afac9] and trimethylaminuria (fishy odor) [^7f5253ed] are rare causes.

- **Liver disease**: Hepatic dysfunction can cause musty or sweet-smelling urine due to metabolite accumulation.

- **Fistulas**: Vesicovaginal or colovesical fistulas can introduce fecal or vaginal odors into urine [^253fa265] [^f466eccd].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **History**: Assess hydration, diet, medications, and associated symptoms (dysuria, frequency, fever, abdominal pain) [^abb92430].

- **Urinalysis**: Screen for pyuria, bacteriuria, hematuria, and glucose [^ff676142].

- **Urine culture**: Confirm infection and guide therapy [^ff676142].

- **Imaging**: Consider ultrasound or CT if obstruction, stones, or fistulas are suspected [^253fa265].

---

## Clinical significance

Foul-smelling urine is a **nonspecific symptom** that may indicate infection, dehydration, diet, or systemic disease. Persistent or severe odor, especially with other symptoms, warrants evaluation to identify and treat underlying causes [^c89f0cc7].

---

Foul-smelling urine is most often due to **bacterial infection**, but dehydration, diet, medications, and rare metabolic or structural causes also contribute. Persistent or severe cases need urinalysis and culture to guide management [^ff676142].

Estimates of Disease Probability

Estimates of probability of disease were consistently higher than scientific evidence (Figure). We also broke down answers by type of practitioner (resident physician, attending physician, and nurse practitioner or physician assistant) (Table 3). All types of practitioners overestimated probability of disease before and after testing.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^253fa265]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Manifestations

Regardless of type, all VF cause distressing symptoms including persistent vaginitis despite treatment, dyspareunia, painful perineal dermatitis and excoriation. Entero-VF are heralded by foul-smelling enteral or faecal discharge through the vagina. Faecal incontinence may develop secondary to associated loss of anal sphincter function.

The characteristic symptom of urinary VF is continual leakage of urine from the vagina and vulvar irritation. In recently operated patients, specific symptoms of VF are often masked by common post-operative problems such as abdominal and flank pain, hematuria, worsening renal function, fever and paralytic ileus. Not unusually, iatrogenic damage to the urinary tract is heralded by imaging detection of fluid collections representing urinoma. Biochemical assay of discharge fluid for creatinine levels and intravesical injection of methylene blue dye are helpful to confirm the presence of the VF.

### Educational intervention to reduce treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in long-term care [^4eea23fc]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Despite research findings and guidelines, inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of ASB with antibiotics is a common clinical practice in LTC facilities. Walker et al, in a qualitative study of physicians' and nurses' perceptions, speculated that the emergence of non-specific signs and symptoms as well as pressure from residents and their families contributes to such practice. Furthermore, Zabarsky et al emphasised the role of nursing staff in decreasing the inappropriate screening of ASB. This study suggested that nurses often ordered UC&S tests for non-specific signs and symptoms such as cloudy, dark or foul-smelling urine, following catheter changes and with increased resident falls, even prior to a prescriber order. The prescriber often received a positive UC&S result and initiated antibiotics without a thorough reassessment of the resident, as positive tests results are hard to ignore. A similar process had been indicated in the LTC facilities included in this study. Thus, this initiative concentrated on the education of clinical staff, including licenced practical nurses and continuing care assistants who largely contribute to monitoring and reporting changes in residents. In the educational sessions, misconceptions about the association of non-specific symptoms and UTIs were addressed, and clinical staff were advised not to send UC&S tests unless residents show localising symptoms as outlined in the diagnostic criteria for UTIs.

### Neonate with intrauterine xylazine exposure: a case report [^0f25f8ae]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fentanyl is a rising cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting neonates exposed in utero. Xylazine, an alpha-2 receptor agonist, is a non-narcotic sedative that is becoming an increasingly common adulterant. There are case reports describing the clinical manifestations of xylazine exposure and toxicity in adult populations; however, cases involving neonatal populations are not described in the literature. Limitations of toxicology analyses for neonates cause delays in the identification and treatment of affected patients.

Case Summary

We present the case of a term neonate who presented to the neonatal intensive care unit with a strong foul-smelling odor, diffuse rash, hypertonicity, irritability, and inconsolability. This case describes additional symptoms that presented over the subsequent 120 hours of life, including sustained bradycardia, significant peripheral vasoconstriction, and focalization of odor to breath, urine, feces, and umbilical stump. Mass spectroscopy toxicology of the neonate's serum confirmed the presence of methamphetamine, fentanyl, multiple fentanyl metabolites, and xylazine. Management strategies are discussed, including the role of alpha-2 receptor agonists in treating withdrawal.

Clinical Significance

This case report presents clinical manifestations of xylazine toxicity and withdrawal in neonatal populations and highlights the need for additional attention on the effects of adulterants to improve management strategies. There is a need for improved toxicology testing to identify affected populations in a timely manner.

### Exploration of primary care clinician attitudes and cognitive characteristics associated with prescribing antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria [^618bd55d]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

We conducted a survey between June 1, 2018, and November 26, 2019, of 723 primary care clinicians in Delaware, Maryland, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia to explore their understanding of and reactions to common diagnostic tests. Development of the survey and recruitment of the sample are described in detail elsewhere. Clinicians were identified and enrolled during site visits to approximately 30 eligible clinics. Completion of the survey was incentivized with a US $50 gift card. Institutional review board approval was obtained at each of 3 coordinating sites (Baltimore, Maryland; San Antonio, Texas; and Portland, Oregon). Verbal informed consent with a waiver of documentation was approved at all sites to protect confidentiality. The study followed the American Association for Public Opinion Research reporting guideline.

The survey presented 4 clinical scenarios, including 1 case of asymptomatic bacteriuria:

"Mr. Williams, a 65-year-old man, comes to the office for follow-up of his osteoarthritis. He has noted foul-smelling urine and no pain or difficulty with urination. A urine dipstick shows trace blood. He has no particular preference for testing and wants your advice".

Respondents were prompted to indicate whether they would prescribe antibiotics. They were also asked to estimate the probability that the patient described in the clinical scenario had a UTI: "How likely is Mr. Williams to have a urinary tract infection (UTI)?"

Survey items included validated instruments to assess numeracy, burnout, comfort with uncertainty, tendency toward risk-taking, fear of malpractice, and tendency toward medical maximalism as well as demographic information and training background. Race and ethnicity were selected by participants from a list of categories. Medical maximalism represents clinician and patient preferences regarding active and passive approaches to health care use. Orientation toward medical maximizing was assessed using a modified version of the Medical Maximizer-Minimizer Scale (eAppendix in the Supplement), which includes prompts that query whether "it is important to treat a disease even when it does not make a difference in quality of life". Individuals with a stronger orientation toward medical maximizing prefer treatment even when the value of treatment is ambiguous.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^ad93cdb2]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

The evidence from studies of predictors of infection in older adult outpatients is sparse, of variable quality and demonstrates that a number of urinary symptoms commonly associated with UTI, such as nocturia and urgency, have limited use for diagnosing UTI. In men, incontinence, foul smelling urine and haematuria were predictors of UTI, but not in women. Importantly, abnormal vital signs (fever, tachycardia and hypotension) are of limited value in UTI diagnosis. Symptoms that may be less typically associated with UTI, such as inability to perform a number of acts of daily living (poor functional status), were strong predictors of UTI. It must be noted, however, that the majority of these estimates were derived from a single studyand are likely to be highly correlated with each other.

Haematuria was found to be of diagnostic value in diagnosing UTI in men, but not in women. We postulate that this could be a result of increased chance of contamination of urine specimens with blood in women, making it less discriminatory for UTI in females. Up to 40% of post-menopausal women have atrophic vaginitis, which can result in microscopic haematuria on urine dipstick. Urinary incontinence was found to be a strong predictor of UTI in men but not in women. This may be due to incontinence being approximately twice as common in women compared to men, and therefore less specific for the presence of UTI in women. Similarly, it may be that abnormal vital signs (such as fever, tachycardia and hypotension) were not found to be predictive of UTI, as if combined with other symptoms (such as breathlessness), they might better predict a different infection (such as a chest infection). We were only able to identify a single estimate for the value of combinations of symptoms in diagnosing UTI.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^ff676142]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### Accuracy of urinary symptoms and urine microscopy in diagnosing urinary tract infection in women [^79079e04]. Family Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Women with urinary tract infections (UTIs) often present with urinary complaints such as frequency of micturition, dysuria, foul-smelling urine and other non-specific symptoms like fever. Physicians may order urine microscopy to guide empirical antibiotic prescription. However, the performance of this approach has not been assessed.

Objectives

This study aimed to determine the accuracy of UTI symptoms and urine microscopy associated with culture-positive UTI in Asian women.

Methods

A cross-sectional study of adult women who presented with UTI-related symptoms was conducted at three public primary care clinics in Singapore. Demographic data and information on their symptoms were collected, followed by urine microscopy and culture to diagnose UTI. The sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), accuracy (ACC) and area under curve (AUC) of combinations of symptom and urine investigations were analysed in association with culture-positive UTI, which was regarded as a benchmark.

Results

Data on 564 women (73.9% Chinese, 11.5% Malay, 8.2% Indian) were analysed, of which 259 (45.9%) had culture-positive UTI. Frequency and foul-smelling urine, pyuria (WBC ≥ 10/hpf) and semi-quantitative bacterial count (≥ 2+) were significantly associated with positive urine culture. The ACC and AUC for single or multiple urinary and/or general symptoms were low. Urine pyuria (minimally > 10/hpf) alone or in combination with symptoms and/or semi-quantitative bacterial count achieved high sensitivity (> 85%) and PPV, NPV, ACC and AUC of > 70%.

Conclusion

Urinary symptoms have limited accuracy in diagnosing culture-positive UTI. Concurrent urine microscopy showing presence of pyuria and/or bacterial count increased the diagnostic accuracy of culture-positive UTI.

### Modification of major contributors responsible for latrine malodor on exposure to hypochlorous acid: the potential for simultaneously impacting odor and infection hazards to encourage latrine use [^34b09814]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Open defecation remains a common practice in many rural areas of developing countries. The practice contributes to high levels of environmental fecal pathogen contamination and is associated with gastrointestinal disease morbidity that especially afflicts young children ages 1–5 years. – Encouraging the construction and use of latrines has become a priority for public health authorities in many regions in an effort to reduce open defecation and improve sanitation in developing countries. Significant philanthropic and government support for these efforts has materialized in recent years. – However, despite marked increases in the numbers of installed latrines, rates of adoption for routine use remain low. – Widespread aversion to latrine use arises not only from long-standing cultural traditions but also from unwillingness to make use of foul-smelling structures that give rise to the perception of uncleanliness. – Odor control clearly needs to be included as part of improving sanitation.

### Bacteremia from a presumed urinary source in hospitalized adults with asymptomatic bacteriuria [^ba39fc56]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Data Collection

As previously described, trained abstractors collected data retrospectively from patient records (eMethods in Supplement 1). Briefly, deidentified data were collected from 90 days before admission until 30 days after discharge or sooner if follow-up was terminated by a major complication (eg, death). Variables collected from the medical record include demographics, signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, vital signs, antibiotic type and duration, and outcomes. Information on signs and symptoms were collected from clinician and nursing documentation 3 days before through 3 days after urine culture collection. Demographics like race, ethnicity, age, and sex were assessed to better understand their association with bacteremia from a presumed urinary source. Thirty-day patient outcomes were collected via medical record review and prospective patient phone call 30 days following hospitalization. Patients who died or were discharged to hospice or another care facility were not eligible for postdischarge phone calls.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was bacteremia from a presumed urinary source (positive blood culture with matching organism within 3 days of urine culture). We assessed for possible variables associated with bacteremia including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), complicated urologic history, comorbidities, presence of dementia or AMS, nonspecific signs or symptoms (eg, foul smelling urine, fatigue) and relevant laboratory results (ie, elevated peripheral white blood cell [WBC] count, urinalysis parameters, and urine culture results). Secondary outcomes included duration of hospitalization after urine culture and 30-day CDI event, mortality, readmission, and/or emergency department visit.

### Urinary tract infection as a single presenting sign of multiple vaginal foreign bodies: case report and review of the literature [^5f7e91ac]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal foreign bodies in children usually present with foul-smelling discharge and/or vaginal bleeding. Rarely, these basic clinical diagnostic signs are not present.

Case

We report on a 5(1/2)-year-old girl with recurrent lower urinary tract infection as the sole presentation of multiple vaginal foreign bodies. Ultrasound of the lower urinary tract was inconclusive, and cystography indicated for recurrent urinary tract infections was declined by the patient in an outpatient setting. Cystography under general anesthesia raised the suspicion of foreign vaginal objects, and the definitive diagnosis was made by vaginoscopy. The relevant literature covering this subject is reviewed.

Conclusion

High level of suspicion and strict basic diagnostic protocol are the most important steps for a timely diagnosis of this condition.

### The urinary microbiome in patients with refractory urge incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infection [^03a0875b]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Women with severe refractory urge incontinence suffer an overwhelming burden of rUTI. Here, we have documented the progression of UTI in a cohort of such patients and correlated this with changes in their urinary microbiota.

Increasing evidence suggests that the urinary microbiota might play a role in the pathology of urge incontinence and refractory DO. Traditionally, clinicians in the field of urogynaecology have not recognised that women without the classical symptoms of dysuria and foul-smelling urine may nevertheless have recurrent, and often multi-resistant, bacterial cystitis. Our findings demonstrate that UTI is common in these patients, and highlight scenarios for rUTI with either the same persistent strain or a new infecting strain. Instances where refractory DO patients suffer from rUTI with the same strain suggest the existence of a chronic reservoir, with the source (i.e. bladder, urethra, vagina or bowl flora) being a contentious topic. In experimental mice, E. coli can replicate in superficial bladder epithelial cells as intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) and survive intracellularly in a quiescent non-replicating state. Evidence for the existence of IBCs and quiescent bacteria has been reported in human patients, supporting the possibility that the bladder could serve as a reservoir for rUTI.

Our study specifically aimed to investigate women with refractory DO. Pearce et al. previously demonstrated that there is a marked difference in the diversity of the microbiome of women with urge incontinence compared with healthy women with no proven history of UTI, thus negating the need for us to include a comparative control group in our study. Overall, our results demonstrate that refractory DO patients do have a urinary microbiota and we hypothesise that the composition of this microflora might have an impact on the incidence of rUTI and their lack of response following treatment with antimuscarinic drugs. It remains to be determined whether certain urotypes, as characterised in this work and by others, are associated with worsening patient outcomes. We also note that ~40% of the MSU specimens examined by routine pathology were reported as "mixed growth", suggesting that the focus on reporting a single dominant organism might be open to question in patients with refractory DO who suffer from rUTI.

### Parental reporting of smelly urine and urinary tract infection [^3d1d74a5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Parents often report that young children have "smelly urine" or a particular urinary odour. There is little evidence that these observations are relevant to the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI).

Aims

To determine whether parental reporting of smelly urine is of any relevance to the diagnosis of UTI in children less than 6 years of age.

Methods

Parents whose children were having urine collected as part of their admission to a large district hospital were given a simple questionnaire to complete regarding the current smell of their child's urine. Parents were asked whether their child's urine smelled different from usual or had a particular smell. Microscopy and culture results of the child's urine were compared to their parent's questionnaire answers to see if there was a association between parental reporting of a different or particular urine smell and a diagnosis of UTI.

Results

One hundred and ten questionnaires and urine samples were obtained. Fifty two per cent of parents thought that their child's urine smelled different from usual or had a particular smell. Only 6.4% of children were diagnosed as having a UTI. There was no statistically significant association between parental reporting of abnormal urine smell and diagnosis of UTI.

Conclusion

In determining whether a young child has a UTI, asking parents about urine smell is unlikely to be of benefit.

### The urinary microbiome in patients with refractory urge incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infection [^e61bb603]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Sample collection and microbiology

Urine collection was performed when patients experienced worsening of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as urgency, frequency, or urge incontinence; however, dysuria and foul-smelling urine were not required for entry to the study. Patients provided midstream urine (MSU) specimens with careful labial toilet by parting the labia and rinsing the peri-urethral area with water. Half of each MSU sample was sent to a single microbiology unit, where culturing and diagnosis was performed using a threshold of > 10 3 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL to identify the dominant infecting organism/s. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined as described in the Calibrated Dichotomous Sensitivity Test manual. The other half of the sample was immediately placed at 4°C, and within 30 min was stored at −20°C for subsequent bacterial DNA extraction and 16 s rRNA amplicon sequencing.

Clinical treatment criteria for acute cystitis included symptoms of dysuria, suprapubic pain, and/or foul-smelling urine, in combination with a single organism reported on routine microbiology at > 10 3 CFU/mL (low count threshold) and pyuria (white cell count [WCC] > 10 per high power field [HPF]). In the absence of dysuria, suprapubic pain, and/or foul-smelling urine, the microbiological criteria for treatment of acute UTI was > 10 5 CFU/mL with pyuria (WCC > 100 per HPF). After acute UTI treatment, a post-therapy MSU was checked to be negative. Some patients received treatment in the community by their general practitioner, with less stringent criteria (Fig. 1). Where bacterial growth was > 10 3 CFU/mL, but no single dominant organism was cultured, these samples were reported as "mixed growth" and the patient was not treated. Bacterial isolates recovered from culture-positive MSU samples were stored in 20% glycerol at −80°C.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^da2e66f2]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

We applied a very stringent definition of confirmed UTIs, requiring a set of urinary signs/symptoms and a positive urine culture. Some studies only demand a positive urine sample for their UTI diagnosis, an outcome which might not be appropriate given the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in NHs. Half of all urine cultures in our study were positive, while a quarter were contaminated and thus considered negative. Our protocol gave preference to a clean midstream sample. Notwithstanding training was provided, contaminated samples were to be expected. We included all residents in our study, even those with physical or cognitive impairments in whom it can be challenging to collect a clean-catch sample.

There is lack of empirical data on which signs/symptoms are associated with UTIs in a geriatric population. Clinical features clearly indicating UTIs in adults are not always presented by older persons or they may not be able to communicate them. The association between non-specific signs, such as confusion or falls, and UTIs also remains unclear. Decision algorithms for UTIs in an older population, whether or not living in LTCFs, are hence often based on expert opinion and consensus. The Stone criteria we used are a good example of this. These criteria are intended for surveillance and benchmarking purposes and are therefore designed to be highly specific, not sensitive. In the absence of formal evidence with respect to an optimal gold standard for UTI diagnosis in an older population, we felt that the Stone criteria were the best available and acceptable to use in this study. After all, a positive urine culture could not be used as a gold standard for a UTI because of the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in this NH population.

A study of Walker et al. showed that there was a wide range of indicators, more subtle than the classic symptoms of a UTI (e.g. dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain), that influenced the ordering of cultures and the prescribing of antibiotics in both general practitioners and nurses. In our questionnaire, we therefore also included signs/symptoms which are not widely accepted and sometimes even controversial for the diagnosis of a UTI in an older adult, e.g. cloudy or foul smelling urine. Nonetheless, these changes in the characteristics of the urine are often reported by NH staff as triggers for UTI suspicions and we also wanted to explore if this was the case in our participating facilities. In our study, it were mostly nurses and nursing assistants who reported these signs.

### Critical signs and symptoms for self-assessment in the immediate postnatal period: an international systematic scoping review and Delphi consensus study [^3af8a1f1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Every two minutes a woman dies from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Most maternal deaths occur within the first 24 hours following birth, highlighting the importance of immediate postnatal care (iPNC). Self-care strategies are increasingly being employed to promote women-centred, continuous care provision. Despite international calls for development of strategies promoting self-care, none have been developed for self-monitoring in the immediate postnatal period. Fundamental to the development of a self-monitoring strategy, is an understanding of which signs and symptoms are predictive of maternal morbidity and mortality and can be easily assessed by mothers and birth companions, in health facilities, without the need for equipment. The objective of this study was to develop and achieve international consensus on the key signs and symptoms.

Methods

A multi-step approach involving a systematic scoping review, two- round Delphi Survey, and expert consensus was employed to identify key signs and symptoms that can be self- assessed and predict morbidity and mortality in the immediate postnatal period.

Results

A comprehensive list of 351 key signs and symptoms was identified from 44 clinical practice guidelines. Subsequently, 134 signs and symptoms were reviewed by Delphi respondents and international expert consensus was achieved for 19 key signs and symptoms across seven condition categories. The signs that were considered both important and able to be self-assessed by mothers and birth companions in the first 24 hours following birth included change in consciousness, seizure, severe headache, persistent visual impairment, urinary incontinence, chest pain, shortness of breath, severe pallor, fast heartbeat, rejection of baby, suicidal/infanticidal, fever, heavy blood loss, soft flabby uterus, unable to urinate easily, foul smelling discharge, rigors, syncope/dizziness, abnormal coloured urine.

Conclusion

This study identified key signs and symptoms which can be easily assessed by mothers and birth companions in the immediate postnatal period to identify those most at risk of morbidity and mortality. Further work is needed to validate this screening tool, and adapt it regionally and nationally.

### Quality of publicly available information about urinary tract infections [^8b7123fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

Of 1413 websites identified, 1082 were excluded, and 331 were included in analyses (Table 1). Almost all (322 [97%]) websites mentioned at least 1 accurate UTI symptom (Table 2). However, most (264 [80%]) included at least 1 inaccurate UTI symptom. The most commonly mentioned inaccurate symptom was change in urine color (244 [74%]). Many websites (227 [69%]) also incorrectly included strong-smelling urine as a symptom. Few websites (31 [9%]) mentioned the term asymptomatic bacteriuria. Even fewer (9 [3%]) mentioned that symptoms need to be present to diagnose a true UTI. A minority (70 [21%]) of websites mentioned the possibility of antibiotic resistance on an individual level. Even fewer (29 [9%]) mentioned the possibility of global antibiotic resistance, or information about adverse reactions of antibiotics (28 [8%]). A full list of symptoms, diagnosis methods, treatment, and consequences of antibiotics overuse described on websites can be found in Table 2.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^898bb0a9]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study looked at signs/symptoms triggering a UTI diagnosis and explored whether or not CRP could be of added value in the diagnosis of a UTI. Only 11.7% of our UTI suspicions corresponded to the applied definition of a confirmed UTI. Strong or foul smelling urine and acute change in mental status mainly triggered a UTI suspicion. However, only acute dysuria and acute suprapubic pain were found significant and increased the post-test probability. The combined nitrite and leucocyte esterase urine had a high negative predictive value. Antimicrobials were prescribed in more than half of the events with a suspected but unconfirmed UTI, indicating a potential significant overuse in this NH population.

Conducting research in LTCFs can be challenging. We also experienced some major limitations in our study. As there was no funding for this study (diagnostic material payed with own resources) we relied on the voluntary participation of NHs and on their staff to carry out the study. The observation period was limited to three months to make the study as feasible as possible and to limit the time investment. Three non-hospital laboratories were willing to take part in this study and invited all their surrounding NHs. Unfortunately, the majority of facilities were not eager to participate, either because they were not interested in the topic, had other projects going on or because they perceived the study as a significant time investment. In one region, we found no participants and therefore continued the study with only two microbiological laboratories. Because of this and a slower than expected inclusion of residents with a UTI suspicion, we reached only half of our intended sample size and only half of our expected confirmed UTI diagnoses. This led to larger confidence intervals around our estimates.

### Urine: waste product or biologically active tissue? [^47b6aff4]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Historically, urine has been viewed primarily as a waste product with little biological role in the overall health of an individual. Increasingly, data suggest that urine plays a role in human health beyond waste excretion. For example, urine might act as an irritant and contribute to symptoms through interaction with-and potential compromise of-the urothelium.

Methods

To explore the concept that urine may be a vehicle for agents with potential or occult bioactivity and to discuss existing evidence and novel research questions that may yield insight into such a role, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease invited experts in the fields of comparative evolutionary physiology, basic science, nephrology, urology, pediatrics, metabolomics, and proteomics (among others) to a Urinology Think Tank meeting on February 9, 2015.

Results

This report reflects ideas that evolved from this meeting and current literature, including the concept of urine quality, the biological, chemical, and physical characteristics of urine, including the microbiota, cells, exosomes, pH, metabolites, proteins, and specific gravity (among others). Additionally, the manuscript presents speculative, and hopefully testable, ideas about the functional roles of urine constituents in health and disease.

Conclusion

Moving forward, there are several questions that need further understanding and pursuit. There were suggestions to consider actively using various animal models and their biological specimens to elaborate on basic mechanistic information regarding human bladder dysfunction.

Diagnostic stewardship — urine cultures — Avoid testing in nonspecific clinical syndromes (eg, leukocytosis, isolated fever, fatigue, and fall), do not order based on odor or smell, and educate on prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and lack of treatment benefit. For collection, do not collect from catheter bag and only culture urine if pyuria present on urinalysis. For reporting, use selective and cascade reporting to help tailor antibiotic choices and add comments to nudge toward only using antibiotics with true symptoms of UTI.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^7fec16cc]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Participation

Eleven NHs participated in the study, totalling 1 263 eligible residents. The characteristics of this population can be consulted in Additional file 1.

UTI suspicions and triggering signs/symptoms

In 115 residents (9.11%; 80.0% female) at least one UTI was suspected during the three-month observation period. Twenty residents had two UTI suspicions and one resident had three suspicions. The median time between two UTI suspicions was 33.5 days (interquartile range (IQR): 23.0–39.0). In total, 137 UTI suspicions were reported.

Figure 1 presents the signs/symptoms most frequently reported overall and by type of caregiver. On average, 2.40 signs/symptoms (maximum: 8) per UTI suspicion were reported. For four suspicions, no signs/symptoms were reported (missing information). Strong or foul smelling urine (35.8%), acute change in mental status (27.7%), new or marked increase in frequency (18.2%) and restlessness (18.2%) mainly triggered a UTI suspicion. Acute dysuria was reported in 16.1% of the cases. The group of "other" reported signs/symptoms included among others overall body pain, vomiting, hyperglycaemia and sticky discharge. Acute pain, swelling or tenderness of the testes, epididymis or prostate, leukocytosis and new-onset hypotension were not reported. In less than half of all UTI suspicions (46.7%), typical UTI symptoms (i.e. acute dysuria, new or marked increase in frequency, urgency or incontinence, suprapubic pain/tenderness and/or acute costovertebral angle pain) was reported.

Urine culture results

Although the study protocol required a urine culture to be performed after each UTI suspicion, there were 13 results missing (9.49%). When a urine culture was performed (n = 124) the result was positive, negative or contaminated in 50.8% (n = 63), 21.8% (n = 27) and 27.4% (n = 34) of the cases, respectively.

The most frequently isolated microorganisms and their non-susceptibility profile can be found in Additional file 2. Of all isolates for which the status was determined, 28.1% were MDR.

### Urine trouble: should we think differently about UTI? [^b8771610]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is clinically important, given that it is one of the most common bacterial infections in adult women. However, the current understanding of UTI remains based on a now disproven concept that the urinary bladder is sterile. Thus, current standards for UTI diagnosis have significant limitations that may reduce the opportunity to improve patient care. Using data from our work and numerous other peer-reviewed studies, we identified four major limitations to the contemporary UTI description: the language of UTI, UTI diagnostic testing, the Escherichia coli-centric view of UTI, and the colony-forming units (CFU) threshold-based diagnosis. Contemporary methods and technology, combined with continued rigorous clinical research can be used to correct these limitations.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^6f4cc955]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Summary ROC plots

Both urinary incontinence and dysuria were predictors of UTI [+ ve LR: 1.96 (95% CI 1.48–2.60) and + ve LR: 1.70 (95% CI 1.12–2.57), respectively]. Absence of these symptoms did not help to rule out a diagnosis of UTI (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 shows that urinary incontinence and dysuria were quite specific, but not sensitive for UTI.

Summary ROC plots for both urinary frequency and nocturia revealed high heterogeneity and so we did not calculate pooled estimates for these symptoms (See supplementary file 2).

Dumbbell plots

Urinary tract specific symptoms

Estimates for UTI specific symptoms were divided into seven broad categories, with gender specific estimates given when possible (Fig. 3). Much variation was found in the way that symptoms were described by studies. For example, incontinence was defined in six different ways, dysuria in five different ways, and urinary frequency was described in six different ways (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3 shows that when both sexes were assessed together, incontinence and a change in the character of urine were found to be predictors of UTI. One of the three estimates for dysuria produced a significant result. In women, of the four estimates for urinary incontinence, only one predicted UTI. This was also true of urinary frequency, where one of four estimates produced a significant result. Of the six estimates for nocturia in women, only one was significant in predicting UTI. None of the eight estimates for dysuria and urgency in women were significant, and absence of these symptoms did not help rule out UTI. Cloudy urine was a significant predictor of UTI in women, but not foul smelling urine or haematuria.

In men, there was only a single estimate for both urinary incontinence and frequency, but both produced significant results. Nocturia was not a predictor of UTI. However, unlike in women, dysuria was helpful in diagnosing UTI. Cloudy urine, foul smelling urine and haematuria were all predictors of UTI in men. Of note, all of the estimates in men came from a single studythat was assessed as low risk against six of the seven QUADAS-2 domains (Fig. 2 b).

### Women's views about management and cause of urinary tract infection: qualitative interview study [^4eced1c1]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Participants and procedure

Participants were recruited from a large randomised trial of different management strategies, in which patients were randomised within the consultation to one of five management groups: empirical antibiotic treatment; empirical delayed antibiotics; antibiotic targeted by symptom score (two or more of urine cloudy, urine with offensive smell, moderately severe dysuria, or nocturia); antibiotic according to dipstick algorithm (nitrites or leucocytes and a trace of blood); or mid-stream urine analysis with symptomatic treatment until culture and sensitivity results were available and then antibiotics targeted according) (box 1).

To be eligible for inclusion participants had to be taking part in the larger trial, have consented to have a single face to face interview, and have been allocated to a management group in which delayed antibiotics were specified by the protocol, meaning this option was discussed and negotiated flexibly with each patient, and they were given access to the delayed prescription at any stage. The third criterion ensured that we were able to explore participants' thoughts on the appropriate treatment of urinary tract infection and their views on the acceptability or otherwise of being asked to delay taking antibiotic medication. At interview it was clear that seven of the interviewees had in fact received antibiotic medication. We interviewed general practitioners in cases where the policy of delay was apparently not followed, and they reported patients' expectations as a prominent reason for negotiating a different strategy.

Patients were drawn from practices across Berkshire (Reading), Wiltshire (Salisbury), Hampshire (Romsey, Portsmouth, Waterlooville, Havant), and Dorset (Dorchester). GML and ST conducted the interviews in women's homes. Each interview lasted an hour on average and was audio-taped and transcribed verbatim by a professional freelance transcriptionist. GML checked 10 full transcriptions against corresponding audio-recorded interviews and found good accuracy. Subsequent quality checks were made during analysis.

The interviews

A semistructured topic guide ensured that critical topics were covered in every interview, while also providing the necessary flexibility to allow participants to volunteer topics that were germane to them. The interviews were designed to elicit participants' experiences and understanding of urinary tract infection, their beliefs regarding treatment, and their views about the management strategy of delayed antibiotic prescribing (that is, a prescription being available at reception (or, by negotiation with the general practitioner, that could be taken away) for use should symptoms not start to settle).

Step 5: Expert Committee

When reviewing the results of each round of the Delphi Survey, the Expert Committee highlighted the value of a broad list of signs and symptoms, not limited to specific conditions occurring in the postnatal period, given that many signs and symptoms span multiple conditions. Of the 144 signs and symptoms reviewed in round 2 of the Delphi survey, 35 (24%) were considered 'critically important'; 109 (76%) 'somewhat important'; and none were deemed unimportant or excluded (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Data flow chart for Expert Committee discussion

'Critically important' signs and symptoms

Of the 35 most critically important signs, the Expert Committee excluded 23 of them. Thirteen were duplicates; 10 were deemed difficult for a mother and birth companion to assess without training and equipment or would occur after 24 hours following birth. Twelve were selected for inclusion in the list of key signs and symptoms. These included, "change in consciousness, seizure, severe headache, persistent visual impairment, urinary incontinence, chest pain, shortness of breath, severe pallor, fast heartbeat, rejection of baby, suicidal/infanticidal, fever".

'Somewhat important' signs and symptoms

For the 109 somewhat important signs and symptoms, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. Ten signs and symptoms categories contained at least one sign or symptom that was scored as "critically important" by more than 75% of respondents. These were dizziness, amount of blood loss, foul smelling discharge, hallucinations/delusions, inability to pass urine, depression, rigors, lethargy, coloured urine and soft flabby uterus. Fifty-four signs and symptoms were listed within the ten sign and symptoms categories and excluded as duplicates. Forty-five signs and symptoms were not housed within the ten important signs and symptoms categories and excluded as deemed not important.

The Expert Committee advised renaming two of the signs and symptoms for clarity. Coloured urine was renamed "abnormally coloured urine", and amount of blood loss was renamed "heavy blood loss".

Three signs and symptoms; "lethargy", "hallucinations and delusions" and "depression" were excluded as the Expert Committee considered them to be difficult for a mother and birth companion to assess.

A final list of 19 signs and symptoms that were important and possible to be assessed in the immediate postnatal period were selected as below:

### A case of foul genital odor treated with botulinum toxin a… [^b5cb5123]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Genital odor is an uncommon condition characterized by an offensive and malodorous smell in the genital area. Although the etiology of foul genital odor is multifactorial, an important cause is sweat secretion and decomposition of sweat components by bacteria. Different methods are effective in reducing body odor secondary to bromhidrosis. Conservative methods only act for a short period of time, and more invasive surgical methods carry risk of complications or are inapplicable for the genital region.

Methods

A patient with localized foul odor in the genital hair bearing area was treated with botulinum toxin A.

Results

Botulinum toxin A was effective in creating an odorless and anhydrous response in the genital region, and no major adverse effects were noted during a follow-up of 9 months after injection.

Conclusion

Local injection of botulinum toxin A appears to be a useful treatment for foul genital odor related to sweat glands activity.

### The effects of gentamicin intravesical bladder instillations on decreasing urinary tract infections after spinal cord injury and disease [^8e82d083]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Outcomes

The primary outcome was the number of symptomatic UTIs (i.e. chills, fever, foul smelling urine, blood in urine, etc.) with a positive urine culture and clinician prescribed antibiotic treatment. This study used a combination of symptoms and microbiological analysis of urine to define symptomatic UTIs. Other outcomes included patient surveys to assess bladder and bowel symptoms and common complications associated with dysfunction. These were measured by the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS); and the Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score (NBD) and included urine leakage, urge to urinate, bladder spasms, constipation, fecal incontinence, uncontrollable flatus. While these are common in thoracic SCI, the aim was to find out if they worsen during UTIs or if they decrease after UTI resolution.

Quality of life measures included the SCI‐QOL Bladder Management Difficulties, Bladder Complications, Bowel Management Difficulties, and Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities; and the SF‐Qualiveen. Participants also completed the Community Participation Indicators (CPI). Demographics, clinical history, and current medications were abstracted from electronic medical records (EMR) and confirmed with participants during study interviews. In addition, participants completed urinalysis and culture, complete blood count and metabolic panel prior and immediately after treatment ended. Positive urinalysis (leukocyte esterase or nitrites) were cultured. UTI query and adverse events were reviewed using the participant's EMR and confirmed during by‐weekly phone calls.

2.3 Intervention

The intervention consisted of 30 mg of gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic indicated for a variety of gram‐negative bacterial infections, diluted in 50 mL of normal saline nightly bladder instillations for 6 months. After emptying the bladder, participants and/or caregivers instilled the bladder with the treatment drug via bladder or stoma catheterization in the evening, leaving it in overnight, and emptying it the next morning. Participants who developed a UTI during treatment, stopped the drug, and received culture directed antibiotics for 7 days and infection resolution was confirmed by a negative urinalysis. Positive results were sent to the lab for a repeat urine culture. After a 1‐week washout period they returned to the trial.

### Awareness and knowledge of diabetic ketoacidosis in people with type 1 diabetes: a cross-sectional, multicenter survey [^4152a1a4]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

The most common multiple-choice causes of DKA were missed insulin injection (61%) and illness (54%) (see figure 1A). A total of 85 (25%) participants stated 'too low' or 'forgotten insulin administration' as causes of DKA, whereas 62 (19%) participants attributed 'high glucose values' and 5 (2%) participants specifically stated 'pregnancy', 'stress' and 'diseases' as causes of DKA.

Figure 1

(C) ORs for individuals reporting no DKA compared with those with several experienced DKA episodes. ORs with 95% CI are depicted. *Indicates atypical symptoms. BMI, body mass index.

With regard to free-text symptoms of DKA most frequently 'nausea', 'vomiting' or 'abdominal pain' were mentioned by 59 (18%) participants; 'Thirst', 'need to urinate' or 'dry mouth' by 44 (13%) participants; and symptoms such as 'fruity' or 'acetonic odour/urine' by 33 (10%) participants. A total of 30 (9%) participants mentioned further symptoms of DKA such as 'tiredness', 'sweating', 'visual disturbances' or 'coma'. Participants were then offered multiple-choice answers including atypical symptoms of DKA. Answers can be found in figure 1B. Symptoms not typical for DKA that were offered included aggression, muscular pain, olfactorial disorder, increased appetite and hearing disorder.

There was a significant but low positive correlation between diabetes duration and knowledge of DKA (Spearman r = 0.187; 95% CI 0.0714 to 0.298; p = 0.001).

A total of 185 (64%) individuals did not test for ketones at all, 124 (56%) participants tested less than every 6 months and 78 participants (38%) only if glucose was high or testing was needed. The last testing was longer than 1 year ago or never happened in a total of 165 participants (63%). A total of 148 individuals (60%) reported that their ketone test strips were either expired or they did not know (see table 2).

### Treatment strategy for a multidrug-resistant Klebsiella UTI [^48fb229c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the management strategy for a multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI).

Case Summary

A 69-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of recurrent UTIs and a right-lung transplant presented with fever to 101.4°F, chills, malaise, and cloudy, foul-smelling urine for approximately 1 week. She was found to have a MDR Klebsiella UTI that was sensitive to tigecycline and cefepime. To further evaluate the degree of resistance Etest minimum inhibitory concentrations were requested for cefepime, amikacin, meropenem, and ertapenem. The patient received a 14-day course of amikacin, which resulted in resolution of her symptoms. One month later, the patient's UTI symptoms returned. The urine culture again grew MDR Klebsiella, sensitive only to tigecycline. Fosfomycin was initiated and resulted in limited resolution of her symptoms. Colistin was started, however, therapy was discontinued on day 5 secondary to the development of acute kidney injury. Despite the short course of therapy, the patient's symptoms resolved.

Discussion

The case presented lends itself well to numerous discussion items that are important to consider when determining optimal treatment for MDR Gram-negative bacilli (GNBs). Susceptibility testing is an important tool for optimizing antibiotic therapy, however, automated systems may overestimate the susceptibility profile for a MDR GNB. Treatment strategies evaluated to treat MDR GNB, include combination therapy with a carbepenem and synergy using polymyxin.

Conclusion

We have described the management strategy for a MDR Klebsiella UTI, the consequences of the initial management strategy, and potential strategies to manage these types of infections in future patients.

### Biallelic loss-of-function variants in KCNJ16 presenting with hypokalemic metabolic acidosis [^8258da1c]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical case description

The proband was a grossly nondysmorphic 2-year-old female, height at the 53rd percentile and weight at the 56th percentile, daughter of a consanguineous union who was born at full term by normal standard vaginal delivery and presented with dehydration and acidosis precipitated by minor illnesses. At 21 months of age, the patient presented to the emergency room with a 1-day history of fever, rhinorrhea, foul-smelling urine, and decreased oral intake and was found to be Influenza B positive. Of note, the parents denied history of diarrhea. Initial vital signs in the emergency department were normal for age and included heart rate of 140 beats/min, respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, and blood pressure of 86/58 mmHg. Physical exam was notable only for rhinorrhea, and no increased work of breathing was noted. Initial labs were significant for an extremely low serum tCO 2 at 7 mmol/L. Serum sodium was 129 mmol/L (reference range: 136–145), potassium was 3.2 mmol/L (reference range: 3.5–5.1), chloride was 111 mmol/L (reference range: 98–108), blood urea nitrogen was 14 mg/dL (reference range: 6–23), serum creatinine was 0.32 mg/dL (reference range: 0.24–0.41), serum calcium level was 8.6 mg/dL (reference range: 8.6–10.3), and serum magnesium level was 1.9 mg/dL (reference range: 1.6–2.3). Intravenous hydration was initiated. In addition, urinalysis revealed a pH of 6.0, specific gravity of 1.018 mOsm/kg, ketones at 80 mg/dL, and 30 mg/dL of protein. Urine was negative for blood, leukocyte esterase, and nitrites. A complete blood count revealed a normal white blood count at 12.82 × 10 3 /mcL and differential was notable for 15% bands. Chest X-ray was normal. The patient was hospitalized for continued intravenous hydration and noted to have a persistent metabolic acidosis despite aggressive hydration, improved appetite, and resolution of symptoms. During the course of the hospitalization, urine electrolytes were obtained, which included a urine calcium:creatinine ratio of 0.06 (normal < 0.2). Liver enzymes were noted to be elevated to a maximum of AST 583 u/L (reference range: 4–32) and ALT 390 u/L (reference range: 4–33). A single parathyroid hormone level during the hospitalization was noted to be low at 11.39 pg/ml (reference range: 15–65 pg/mL). In addition, the patient was noted to have altered mental status as demonstrated by an abnormal gait. Computerized tomography of the head without contrast revealed extensive bilateral symmetric calcification within the basal ganglia, subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, and within the cerebellar hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain also noted widespread intracranial calcifications. Mental status gradually returned to baseline over the course of several days, suggesting her transient alternation in mental status was due to the presenting infectious process and biochemical abnormalities. Abdominal and renal ultrasound were normal, and renal calcifications were not seen. The patient was discharged home on citric acid/sodium citrate 20 mEq by mouth three times daily (equivalent to 4 mEq/kg/day). At baseline, and while on citric acid/sodium citrate, the patient continued to demonstrate a persistent metabolic acidosis.

PERT is effective for treating EPI (below). Patients with nonspecific symptoms, such as bloating, excess gas, and foul-smelling or floating stools may not have some improvement in these symptoms while taking PERT, but these symptoms are nonspecific and symptomatic changes may be a placebo effect or masking other disorders, such as celiac disease, causing delays in a correct diagnosis. Appropriate testing (eg, fecal elastase) should be suggested before initiating therapy with PERT.

### Urinary tract infections among under-five children with congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract in hospitalized patients in addis ababa [^3fd8380d]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Operational definitions

Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): In this study, a diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is defined as a recorded diagnosis by the treating physician based on any one of the following criteria documented in the patient's medical chart: Clinical Signs and symptoms, Urinalysis Results, and Urine Culture.

Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT)

In this study, CAKUT is defined as the presence of any structural abnormality of the kidney or urinary tract identified and recorded by the treating physician. CAKUT are typically diagnosed through a combination of prenatal and postnatal imaging studies, along with clinical evaluations.

Study variables

Dependent variables

UTIs among CAKUTs.

Independent variables

Socio-demographic characteristics of children (age, sex, and residence); clinical characteristics (fever, dribbling urine, incontinence urine, dysuria, turbid (pyuria), foul-smelling urine, vomiting, irritability); etiological agents (E.coli, klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, Staphylococci spp.); other factors (duration of hospitalization, immunization status, circumcised, catheterization, malnutrition, history of previous CAKUT, surgery, types of CAKUT, known comorbidity, history of UTI).

Data collection tool and procedures

A comprehensive examination of the medical records of the study participants was conducted using a data-gathering instrument (created in the Kobo Toolbox) that was developed based on information extracted from the patient's medical records, registration books, and previous studies. The data collection tool included information on sociodemographic factors, clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and other risk factors. The data were collected by three trained health professionals and one supervisor in the pediatric inpatient wards using Kobo Toolbox software.

Urine sample collection and analysis

Collection

Midstream clean-catch method, catheterization, and in certain cases, suprapubic.

aspiration techniques were used to collect urine specimens from the study participants.

Analysis

Physical examination (color and clarity), chemical analysis (dipstick test), microscopic examination (centrifugation and microscopic analysis), culture, and sensitivity tests were done following the standard operating procedure of urine collection and analysis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^ab504889]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of giardiasis in children include an incubation period that usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks and averages 7 days, with presentations ranging from short-lasting, acute watery diarrhea with or without low-grade fever, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain to a more protracted intermittent course with foul-smelling stools, flatulence, abdominal distension, and anorexia. Stools can initially be profuse and watery then become greasy and foul smelling, with blood, mucus, and fecal leukocytes absent; malabsorption with anorexia can lead to significant weight loss, failure to thrive, and malnutrition in children. Post-Giardia infection lactose intolerance can occur in 20% to 40% of patients and this syndrome may take several weeks to resolve, while asymptomatic Giardia infection is common. Extraintestinal features include invasion into bile or pancreatic ducts, long term extraintestinal symptoms in one third of patients, and subsequent development of reactive arthritis associated with giardiasis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^0cb42735]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Giardia clinical manifestations in children are characterized by an incubation period that usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks and averages 7 days, with children usually presenting with short-lasting, acute watery diarrhea with or without low-grade fever, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain; others may have a protracted intermittent course with foul-smelling stools, flatulence, abdominal distension, and anorexia. Malabsorption combined with anorexia can lead to significant weight loss, failure to thrive, and malnutrition in children, and stools can initially be profuse and watery and later become greasy and foul smelling with blood, mucus, and fecal leukocytes absent. Post-Giardia infection lactose intolerance can occur in 20% to 40% of patients, asymptomatic Giardia infection is common, and extraintestinal invasion can occur with trophozoites migrating into bile or pancreatic ducts; recent evidence demonstrates that one third of patients will express long term extraintestinal symptoms, including ocular, muscular and metabolic complications, and reactive arthritis has also been associated with giardiasis.

### Surgical source control in a patient with septic shock due to severe emphysematous pyelonephritis [^9d07fe46]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

What we did and why

The patient was brought to the operating room by the acute care surgery team for exploratory laparotomy. As the ascending colon was mobilized, swelling in Gerota's fascia was evident. Opening Gerota's fascia resulted in the release of foul-smelling gas. The renal parenchyma was spongy and drained purulent material (figure 3) and a right nephrectomy was performed. After copious irrigation, the abdomen was closed. She was returned to the ICU postoperatively. Subsequent cultures of blood, urine and the purulent material in the right renal parenchyma revealed Escherichia coli. Antibiotics were continued for 14 days until leukocytosis and fever subsided. Postoperatively, she developed acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. She underwent tracheostomy due to the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation. Eventually, she was weaned from hemodialysis and mechanical ventilation. She was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital 21 days after surgery.

### Purple urine bag: think of urinary tract infection [^b883c472]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discoloration of urine can be alarming and may indicate a serious underlying pathology. However, majority is benign and occur as a result of ingestions of substances such as medications or food dye or trauma postinstrumentations. Purple discoloration of the urinary catheter bag is uncommon and is caused by urinary tract infection with certain organisms. Unfortunately, most clinicians including the frontline clinicians are not aware of this syndrome, and despite the striking features, purple urine bag discoloration may be overlooked and not be given appropriate treatment. We present a case of this rare phenomenon with urosepsis that was not diagnosed on 2 occasions when the patient presented to the accident and emergency department.

What are the possible side effects of PHEXX?

PHEXX may cause serious side effects, including:

Bladder infection (cystitis) and acute kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Urinary tract infections are common but can also be serious. You should not use PHEXX if you have a history of urinary tract infections that keep coming back or other problems with your urinary tract. Call your healthcare provider if you have burning with urination or other signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection such as: burning feeling when passing urine, urine that looks cloudy, pain in the pelvis, or back pain.
Allergic reactions. Avoid using PHEXX if you are a female who can become pregnant and are allergic to lactic acid, citric acid, potassium bitartrate or any of the ingredients in PHEXX; or your sexual partners are allergic to any of the ingredients in PHEXX. Stop using PHEXX if you have a local vulvovaginal reaction.

The most common side effects of PHEXX include:

vaginal burning
vaginal itching
vaginal yeast infection
discomfort around the vaginal area
bacterial vaginosis
vaginal discharge
discomfort in the genital area
pain while passing urine

These are not all the possible side effects of PHEXX.

### CAUTIon-not all UTIs are the same [^76dd1cc8]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for ~400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments - which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs - often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically, by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

### Teamwork and safety climate affect antimicrobial stewardship for asymptomatic bacteriuria [^c7bab799]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

In preparation for a multisite antibiotic stewardship intervention, we assessed knowledge and attitudes toward management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) plus teamwork and safety climate among providers, nurses, and clinical nurse assistants (CNAs).

Design

Prospective surveys during January-June 2018.

Setting

All acute and long-term care units of 4 Veterans' Affairs facilities.

Methods

The survey instrument included 2 previously tested subcomponents: the Kicking CAUTI survey (ASB knowledge and attitudes) and the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ).

Results

A total of 534 surveys were completed, with an overall response rate of 65%. Cognitive biases impacting management of ASB were identified. For example, providers presented with a case scenario of an asymptomatic patient with a positive urine culture were more likely to give antibiotics if the organism was resistant to antibiotics. Additionally, more than 80% of both nurses and CNAs indicated that foul smell is an appropriate indication for a urine culture. We found significant interprofessional differences in teamwork and safety climate (defined as attitudes about issues relevant to patient safety), with CNAs having highest scores and resident physicians having the lowest scores on self-reported perceptions of teamwork and safety climates (P < .001). Among providers, higher safety-climate scores were significantly associated with appropriate risk perceptions related to ASB, whereas social norms concerning ASB management were correlated with higher teamwork climate ratings.

Conclusions

Our survey revealed substantial misunderstanding regarding management of ASB among providers, nurses, and CNAs. Educating and empowering these professionals to discourage unnecessary urine culturing and inappropriate antibiotic use will be key components of antibiotic stewardship efforts.

### Multidetector CT imaging of complications after laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery [^c83194ff]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Sometimes, to improve haemostasis, surgeons may pack the SSR intraoperatively with perinephric fat, which should not be mistaken for a fatty mass. Localised non-enhancing fluid collections corresponding to seroma (sometimes with fat-fluid level) may be visualised. In some patients, biologically absorbable haemostatic agents such as Gelfoam (absorbable gelatine compressed sponge; Pfizer, NY, USA) or Surgicel (oxydised cellulose polymer; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) may be used to control intraoperative bleeding. Within a few weeks, these bolster agents may show near-water attenuation with interspersed gas foci and can potentially be confused with an abscess; differentiation should rely on knowledge of surgical details, visualisation of gas bubbles arranged in linear fashion and stable appearance or regression on serial scanning. Conversely, abscess should be suspected if a localised fluid collection shows a CM-enhancing rim and contains a gas-fluid level or moving bubbles.

Subcutaneous emphysema (Figs. 4, 5) is a common finding after laparoscopic surgery, and results from prolonged insufflation with the Trocar displaced into the abdominal wall. Emphysema is always non-dependent and most prominent immediately after surgery, and should not be misinterpreted as necrotising fasciitis, which usually occurs later and is associated with erythema, foul-smelling drainage from the wound, fever and pain.

### When is red urine not hematuria? a case report [^54f101cc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The definition of gross hematuria is "the presence of blood in the urine in sufficient quantity to be visible to the naked eye". Certainly red urine, especially after trauma, immediately sparks the concern for genitourinary trauma. However, we report the unique case of a 19-year-old male who presented with "gross hematuria" after a motorcycle accident that turned out not to be hematuria but rather urine discoloration caused by the liberal use of a topical sulfa ointment containing an azo dye obtained in Mexico. We discuss the differential diagnosis of pigmenturia due to drugs or food ingestion, which is sparsely reported in the literature, as well as the frequency of alternative treatments used by patients presenting to the Emergency Department and the impact that can have on their evaluation.

### Reducing unnecessary urine culture testing in residents of long term care facilities [^d89f8d9c]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a positive result from a urine culture test in the absence of minimum symptoms of urinary tract infection, and is present in 30–50% of residents in long term care homes
Indiscriminate testing leads to detection of asymptomatic bacteriuria and prompts unnecessary antibiotic treatment
Strategies to reduce unnecessary urine cultures include targeted education supported by system changes such as modification of order sets and routine panels, elimination of urine dipsticks, and changes to laboratory processing and reporting

An older woman with moderate stage dementia living in a long term care home has new confusion and slurred speech. Her nurse notes an "unusual smell" while collecting a urine specimen and sends it for culture testing to the microbiology laboratory. The care home physician is notified that afternoon of the clinical finding and performs a focused examination, which is unremarkable, and then signs off the urine culture order. The urine culture returns with significant growth of Escherichia coli and the woman is prescribed a course of antibiotics. Five days later, she experiences an acute decline in her clinical status, including worsening dysarthria and right sided weakness, and is transferred to hospital, where a stroke is diagnosed. Focusing on a diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), despite the absence of correlating symptoms, has resulted in delayed recognition of stroke symptoms and timely treatment.

Overdiagnosis of UTI is one of the most common reasons for unnecessary use of antibiotics in long term care, including nursing and care homes. Most residents in these settings who have a positive result on urine culture testing do not actually have a UTI but rather asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), defined as the presence of significant levels of bacteria isolated in the urine (greater than 10 5 colony forming units/mL) in the absence of localising symptoms of UTI, and regardless of the presence of pyuria. Surveillance studies across North America and Europe that systematically assessed symptoms and urine cultures consistently show that in residents of long term care who do not have a catheter, the prevalence of ASB is 30–50%, whereas UTI is far less common, with prevalence of less than 2%. Residents with a catheter have at least a twofold increased risk of UTI, but also have higher rates of ASB that are nearly 100% by the time a urinary catheter has been in place for four weeks.

### Neomycin-polymyxin or gentamicin bladder instillations decrease symptomatic urinary tract infections in neurogenic bladder patients on clean intermittent catheterization [^3314114f]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in patients with neurogenic bladder (NGB) performing clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) treated with or without oral antibiotic prophylaxis.

Objective

The authors aim to determine if daily neomycin-polymyxin or gentamicin bladder instillations reduce the rate of symptomatic UTIs, the need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis, emergency department (ED) visits for UTI, and inpatient hospitalizations for UTI in patients with NGB on CIC. The authors also aim to investigate resistance patterns in urine microorganisms in patients treated with antibiotic bladder instillations.

Study Design

The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of all-age patients cared for in the pediatric urology clinic with NGB on CIC having symptomatic UTIs and on daily intravesical instillations of neomycin-polymyxin or gentamicin between 2013 and 2017. Symptomatic UTIs were defined as a positive urine culture with greater than 10,000 colony forming units/mL associated with one or more of the following patient complaints: cloudy/foul-smelling urine, fevers, chills, increase in bladder spasms, pain, urinary leakage, or physician decision for antibiotic treatment. Multidrug-resistant organisms were resistant to two or more classes of antibiotics.

Results

Fifty-two patients with a median age of 14.5 years and 192 distinct urine cultures were identified. 90.4% and 9.6% of patients received neomycin-polymyxin and gentamicin instillations, respectively. After initiation of intravesical antibiotics, the rate of symptomatic UTIs was reduced by 58% (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31–0.56; P < 0.001), the rate of ED visits was reduced by 54% (IRR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.30–0.71; P < 0.001), and the rate of inpatient hospitalizations for UTI was reduced by 39% (IRR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.37–0.98; P = 0.043). Fewer patients received oral antibiotic prophylaxis after initiation of antibiotic instillations (odds ratio: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02–0.067; P = 0.016). There was a trend toward a decrease in multidrug resistance and no change in gentamicin resistance in urine microorganisms.

Discussion

This study describes a feasible alternative treatment for patients with NGB on CIC who have persistent UTIs despite oral antibiotic prophylaxis, and for some patients, it may suggest a possibility of discontinuing oral prophylaxis. Limitations include a retrospective design with a small cohort of patients and varying dosages of neomycin-polymyxin.

Conclusions

Antibiotic bladder instillations appear to decrease frequency of symptomatic UTIs, ED visits for UTI, inpatient hospitalizations for UTI, and the need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with NGB on CIC. There was no increase in multidrug resistance or gentamicin resistance in UTI organisms with use of intravesical antibiotic instillation.

### A case of black urine and dark skin-cresol poisoning [^3b04ebed]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cresol is a phenol derivative used as a disinfectant worldwide. Acute cresol poisoning is potentially fatal as it may cause multiple organ failure. We present a case of acute cresol intoxication in a male patient to illustrate the effects of cresol poisoning.

Case

A 42-year-old male presented with black urine, painless brownish dermal burns, and a strong carbolic acid odor. The patient was immediately resuscitated with adequate oxygenation and aggressive fluid resuscitation. He was subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit, where his treatment course was complicated by pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic dysfunction, and acute renal failure. After receiving supportive intensive care, the patient recovered and was discharged with no sequelae.

Conclusion

The distinctive clinical features of this case may be useful in diagnosis, because laboratory analytical methods for cresols are not routinely available at most hospitals.

### Utility of a routine urinalysis in children who require clean intermittent catheterization [^957e452e]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Children who require clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) frequently have positive urine cultures. However, diagnosing a urinary tract infection (UTI) can be difficult, as there are no standardized criteria. Routine urinalysis (UA) has good predictive accuracy for UTI in the general pediatric population, but data are limited on the utility of routine UA in the population of children who require CIC.

Objective

To determine the utility of UA parameters (e.g. leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and pyuria) to predict UTI in children who require CIC, and identify a composite UA that has maximal predictive accuracy for UTI.

Methods

A cross-sectional study of 133 children who required CIC, and had a UA and urine culture sent as part of standard of care. Patients in the no-UTI group all had UA and urine cultures sent as part of routine urodynamics, and were asymptomatic. Patients included in the UTI group had growth of ≥ 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of a known uropathogen on urine culture, in addition to two or more of the following symptoms: fever, abdominal pain, back pain, foul-smelling urine, new or worse incontinence, and pain with catheterization. Categorical data were compared using Chi-squared test, and continuous data were compared with Student's t-test. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for individual UA parameters, as well as the composite UA. Logistic regression was performed on potential composite UA models to identify the model that best fit the data.

Results

There was a higher proportion of patients in the no-UTI group with negative leukocyte esterase compared with the UTI group. There was a higher proportion of patients with UTI who had large leukocyte esterase and positive nitrites compared with the no-UTI group (Summary Figure). There was no between-group difference in urinary white blood cells. Positive nitrites were the most specific (84.4%) for UTI. None of the parameters had a high positive predictive value, while all had high negative predictive values. The composite model with the best Akaike information criterion was > 10 urinary white blood cells and either moderate or large leukocyte esterase, which had a positive predictive value of 33.3 and a negative predictive value of 90.4.

Conclusion

Routine UA had limited sensitivity, but moderate specificity, in predicting UTI in children who required CIC. The composite UA and moderate or large leukocyte esterase both had good negative predictive values for the outcome of UTI.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^d79f0302]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of different management strategies in urinary tract infections.

Design

Randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Primary care.

Participants

309 non-pregnant women aged 18–70 presenting with suspected urinary tract infection.

Intervention

Patients were randomised to five management approaches: empirical antibiotics; empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics; or targeted antibiotics based on a symptom score (two or more of urine cloudiness, urine smell, nocturia, or dysuria), a dipstick result (nitrite or both leucocytes and blood), or a positive result on midstream urine analysis. Self help advice was controlled in each group.

Main Outcome Measures

Symptom severity (days 2 to 4) and duration, and use of antibiotics.

Results

Patients had 3.5 days of moderately bad symptoms if they took antibiotics immediately. There were no significant differences in duration or severity of symptoms (mean frequency of symptoms on a 0 to 6 scale: immediate antibiotics 2.15, midstream urine 2.08, dipstick 1.74, symptom score 1.77, delayed antibiotics 2.11; likelihood ratio test for the five groups P = 0.177). There were differences in antibiotic use (immediate antibiotics 97%, midstream urine 81%, dipstick 80%, symptom score 90%, delayed antibiotics 77%; P = 0.011) and in sending midstream urine samples (immediate antibiotics 23%, midstream urine 89%, dipstick 36%, symptom score 33%, delayed antibiotics 15%; P < 0.001). Patients who waited at least 48 hours to start taking antibiotics reconsulted less (hazard ratio 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89), P = 0.014) but on average had symptoms for 37% longer than those taking immediate antibiotics (incident rate ratio 1.37 (1.11 to 1.68), P = 0.003), particularly the midstream urine group (73% longer, 22% to 140%; none of the other groups had more than 22% longer duration).

Conclusion

All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for testing, and antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription, can help to reduce antibiotic use.

There were no significant differences in duration or severity of symptoms (mean frequency of symptoms on a 0 to 6 scale: immediate antibiotics 2.15, midstream urine 2.08, dipstick 1.74, symptom score 1.77, delayed antibiotics 2.11; likelihood ratio test for the five groups P = 0.177). There were differences in antibiotic use (immediate antibiotics 97%, midstream urine 81%, dipstick 80%, symptom score 90%, delayed antibiotics 77%; P = 0.011) and in sending midstream urine samples (immediate antibiotics 23%, midstream urine 89%, dipstick 36%, symptom score 33%, delayed antibiotics 15%; P < 0.001). Patients who waited at least 48 hours to start taking antibiotics reconsulted less (hazard ratio 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89), P = 0.014) but on average had symptoms for 37% longer than those taking immediate antibiotics (incident rate ratio 1.37 (1.11 to 1.68), P = 0.003), particularly the midstream urine group (73% longer, 22% to 140%; none of the other groups had more than 22% longer duration).

Conclusion All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for testing, and antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription, can help to reduce antibiotic use.

### Does this woman have an acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection? [^abb92430]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Symptoms suggestive of acute urinary tract infection (UTI) constitute one of the most common reasons for women to visit clinicians. Although the clinical encounter typically involves taking a history and performing a physical examination, the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical assessment for UTI remains uncertain.

Objective

To review the accuracy and precision of history taking and physical examination for the diagnosis of UTI in women.

Data Sources

We conducted a MEDLINE search for articles published from 1966 through September 2001 and manually reviewed bibliographies, 3 commonly used clinical skills textbooks, and contacted experts in the field.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they contained original data on the accuracy or precision of history or physical examination for diagnosing acute uncomplicated UTI in women. One author initially screened titles and abstracts found by our search. Nine of 464 identified studies met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data from the included studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly increased the probability of UTI: dysuria (summary positive likelihood ratio [LR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–2.0), frequency (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.0), hematuria (LR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3–2.9), back pain (LR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2–2.1), and costovertebral angle tenderness (LR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5). Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly decreased the probability of UTI: absence of dysuria (summary negative LR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.7), absence of back pain (LR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7–0.9), history of vaginal discharge (LR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9), history of vaginal irritation (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9), and vaginal discharge on examination (LR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–0.9). Of all individual diagnostic signs and symptoms, the 2 most powerful were history of vaginal discharge and history of vaginal irritation, which significantly decreased the likelihood of UTI when present (LRs, 0.3 and 0.2, respectively). One study examined combinations of symptoms, and the resulting LRs were more powerful (24.6 for the combination of dysuria and frequency but no vaginal discharge or irritation). One study of patients with recurrent UTI found that self-diagnosis significantly increased the probability of UTI (LR, 4.0).

Conclusions

In women who present with 1 or more symptoms of UTI, the probability of infection is approximately 50%. Specific combinations of symptoms (eg, dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge or irritation) raise the probability of UTI to more than 90%, effectively ruling in the diagnosis based on history alone. In contrast, history taking, physical examination, and dipstick urinalysis are not able to reliably lower the posttest probability of disease to a level where a UTI can be ruled out when a patient presents with 1 or more symptoms.

### Evaluation of the association between asthma and non-neurogenic urinary incontinence in children; a case-control study [^dfe06c80]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

MNE is a condition in which a child or adult experiences involuntary urination during sleep at least twice a week, without any other urinary symptoms during the day or any other medical conditions. Nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE) consists of nocturnal symptoms along with lower urinary tract symptoms, such as urgency, changes in voiding frequency, and holding maneuvers, with or without daytime incontinence. Nocturnal enuresis with any severity (mild: less than once a day or less than 7 times a week, moderate: more than once a day or 8–20 times a week, severe: more than 20 times a week) was considered positive. Giggle incontinence (GI) is described by total or involuntary bladder emptying while giggling or laughing, with normal bladder function at other times. vaginal reflux (VR) or intravaginal urination is one of the causes of UI in prepubescent girls, which is accompanied by post-void dribbling, vulvovaginitis, vaginal discharge and foul smell around the vagina. Pollakiuria is defined by extremely frequent daytime urination, urinating every 15 to 20 min without nocturnal enuresis, dysuria, and urinary tract infections. Children with infrequent voiding (underactive bladder) are usually female, and they urinate just twice per day, whereas the normal frequency of urination is 4–7 times per day. Overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome characterized by urinary urgency, associative with urinary frequency and nocturia, in the absence of any local pathological causes.

The presence or absence of UI in children was determined by the child's or parents' perception. The researcher then entered the resulting data, which included the child's asthma status, UI status and type, age, and gender, into a checklist.

The analysis was performed by the stata software version 16. In the descriptive section of this study, frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation were utilized. In addition, to compare quantitative and qualitative variables, the independent t-test and analysis of variance were considered if the data had a normal distribution, whereas the Mann-Whitney U test was used if the data did not have a normal distribution. To compare two qualitative variables, Chi-Square test or Fisher's exact test were used. Additionally, logistic regression was utilized to calculate the odds ratio.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^2b486d17]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Observed urine sample collection — The primary method used to prevent urine sample tampering is direct observation of urination by a staff member of the same gender during collection, and observation prevents several common ex vivo methods of substitution, dilution and adulteration at the time of collection. Providers should choose a urine sample collection method that will protect patients' dignity and privacy while minimizing opportunities for tampering, and each clinic should have clear specimen tampering and diversion control strategies in place and these should be discussed with patients; in order for sample tampering policies to have their intended effect, providers should be trained appropriately in these measures. A patient can dilute a sample by adding liquids such as water or colored fluids (apple juice, lemonade) to the sample container, and the most commonly used chemicals include table salt (sodium chloride), vinegar, Drano, dish soap, hand soap, liquid laundry bleach, denture cleansing tablets, lemon juice, ascorbic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) [34].

### Sniffing out significant "Pee values": genome wide association study of asparagus anosmia [^87846402]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

In 1781 Benjamin Franklin remarked, "a few stems of asparagus eaten, shall give our urine a disagreeable odour". The consequence of asparagus consumption has been a topic of both public and private discussion, with Proust's observation of asparagus spears perhaps the most poetic, "they played. at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic perfume". For those who can detect the distinctive sulfurous odor it must seem, as the French botanist and chemist Louis Lémery wrote in 1702, "They [asparagus spears] cause a filthy and disagreeable smell in the urine, as everybody knows".

But not everybody does seem to know, as a subset of the population is unable to smell the methanethiol and S-methyl thioesters metabolites produced by asparagus consumption. It was uncertain whether this inability to detect the metaboliteswas related to a failure to produce the metabolites or to a specific anosmia. Foundational research found that the prevalence differs between people and across populations. Studies have shown that people who cannot smell the odor in their own urine are also unable to smell it in the urine of known producers, lending credence to the anosmia hypothesis. Regardless of whether the inability to detect the odor is a problem of perception or production, the phenotypic distribution suggests a potential genetic component.

Few scientists have sought to examine the inherited factors associated with asparagus anosmia. In 2010 the results of a genome wide association study in 4727 participants was reported. The study found that a single nucleotide polymorphism — an individual genetic variation in DNA — rs4481887 located near olfactory receptor 2M7 (OR2M7) was statistically significantly associated with participant reported anosmia to asparagus.

Given the complexity of olfactory receptors it is likely that additional genetic variations contribute to the differences in humans' ability to detect the odor of asparagus metabolites. We therefore carried out a genome wide association study of asparagus anosmia among two large and well characterized US based cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.

### Outcomes of incontinent ileovesicostomy in the pediatric patient [^ff6ee2a9]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Ileovesicostomy is a reconstructive option in complex urological cases but pediatric specific outcomes are lacking. We report our results with pediatric ileovesicostomy.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively evaluated patients younger than 18 years undergoing incontinent ileovesicostomy at Vanderbilt University. History, urinary tract management and operative course were reviewed in the electronic medical record. Particular attention was given to immediate and long-term postoperative complications.

Results

Nine patients underwent incontinent ileovesicostomy between 2000 and 2013 at a mean age of 10.3 years (range 1.4 to 15.5). Surgical indication was sequelae of neurogenic or nonneurogenic neurogenic bladder (such as infection or worsening hydronephrosis) in 5 patients, reversal of vesicostomy in 3 and closure of cloacal exstrophy in 1. All 9 patients were thought incapable of reliable clean intermittent catheterization due to family unwillingness, poor social support or patient refusal. Median followup was 11.5 months (mean 48.2, range 1.3 to 144.8). Immediate postoperative complications included ileus requiring total parenteral nutrition and a wound infection in 1 patient. Long-term complications included urinary tract infection in 2 patients (febrile in 1 and positive culture for foul smelling urine in 1), stomal issues in 2 and temporary urethral leakage in 1. Constipation affected 3 children in long-term followup (all with neurogenic bowel preoperatively). Postoperative creatinine was stable or improved in all patients.

Conclusions

Ileovesicostomy is a viable approach in children left with few other options, particularly those who are noncompliant or physically/socially unable to handle catheterization. This operation can help keep such patients out of diapers.

Signs of maldigestion and malabsorption in people with cystic fibrosis include poor weight gain despite a good appetite, frequent loose and/or large bowel movements, foul-smelling bowel movements, mucus or oil in the bowel movement, excessive gas and/or stomach pain, and distention or bloating. Persons with CF who have not yet started taking enzymes may have any or all of the symptoms listed above, and improvement is generally noted once enzymes are started; sometimes, people with CF who already take enzymes experience these symptoms and this may suggest that the dose or type of enzymes may need to be adjusted. Do not increase or decrease the dose of enzymes without talking to your CF dietitian or care provider, and always give the prescribed dose of enzymes. Enzymes are essential in the care of CF. Talk with your CF dietitian or care provider if taking enzymes has become a problem.

8 THE ROLE OF CHOLINE IN MALODOR

Gut microbiota specifically processes choline, PC, carnitine, and other dietary nutrients to produce trimethylamine (TMA). TMA is absorbed in the gut and converted in the liver to TMA N‐oxide (TMAO) by hepatic flavin‐containing monooxygenases (eg, FMO3). Autosomal recessive variants in FMO3 (MIM #602079) were shown to underlie trimethylaminuria or fish odor syndrome. 37 Affected individuals suffer from a strong, fishy body odor as the excess TMA is released in the person's sweat, urine, reproductive fluids, and breath. There are no other organic signs, but from a psychosocial perspective the condition can be devastating for affected individuals, attempted suicides have been reported. 38, 39

### Hypocitraturia: diagnosis and treatment [^51ab8752]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypocitraturia is one of the most common and correctable risk factors for nephrolithiasis. It is primarily caused by alterations in acid-base status, with several identified etiologies driving its pathogenesis. Diagnosis is made by at least one 24-hour urine study. Treatment involves identifying and reversing potential causes, followed by dietary modifications and alkali supplementation. Numerous new supplements have emerged in this space, gaining availability and popularity with patients. This article reviews pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hypocitraturia in the context of urolithiasis.

### Altered mental status due to pruno intoxication [^1edeeec5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of alcohol intoxication might not be considered in patients coming from locations where access to alcohol is severely restricted or not permitted.

Objective

We present a case of alcohol intoxication in a patient presenting from a military prison. The patient ingested an alcoholic beverage made in his prison cell with produce stolen from the prison cafeteria. We also discuss potential complications of "prison-brewed" alcoholic beverages.

Case Report

A 22-year-old male presented to the emergency department after being found in his cell with a depressed level of consciousness and next to a mouthwash bottle filled with a foul-smelling liquid. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 111 beats/min, a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 11, no signs of injury or track marks on the skin, and intermittent agitation alternating with somnolence. Laboratory evaluation was significant for a serum ethanol level of 279 mg/dL. After a period of observation, mental status returned to normal and the patient admitted to making "pruno".

Conclusions

Alcohol intoxication might be unexpected or not considered in patients that should have no access to common sources of ethanol. Awareness of methods of novel fermentation, even in incarcerated individuals, can assist in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with altered mental status.

### Interrupting the mechanisms of brain injury in a model of maple syrup urine disease encephalopathy [^6d5afac9]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) was first recognized as an inherited lethal encephalopathy beginning in the first week of life and associated with an unusual odor in the urine of affected children. It was later confirmed as a deficiency of branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), which is the second step in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) breakdown. MSUD is characterized by BCAA and branched-chain keto acid (BCKA) accumulation. BCAAs are essential amino acids and powerful metabolic signals with severe consequences of both deprivation and accumulation. Treatment requires life-long dietary restriction and monitoring of BCAAs. However, despite excellent compliance, children commonly suffer metabolic decompensation during intercurrent illness resulting in life-threatening cerebral edema and dysmyelination. The mechanisms underlying brain injury have been poorly understood. Recent studies using newly developed mouse models of both classic and intermediate MSUD have yielded insight into the consequences of rapid BCAA accumulation. Additionally, these models have been used to test preliminary treatments aimed at competing with blood-brain barrier transport of BCAA using norleucine. Assessment of biochemical changes with and without treatment suggests different roles for BCAA and BCKA in the mechanism of brain injury.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^ed0ec4c3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

### Lactate: creatinine ratio in babies with thin meconium staining of amniotic fluid [^8877fb20]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Methods

The study was conducted at St Stephen's Hospital, Delhi India. It is a 600 bedded tertiary level postgraduate teaching hospital, conducting 5000 deliveries annually, equipped with a 75 bedded nursery and level III neonatal intensive care unit.

Of 1415 deliveries between January to March 2000 at our hospital, 212 babies were born through MSAF. Some of these mothers were referred from other centers in labor and antenatal records were not available. These mothers were excluded. The number of eligible mothers was thus 112. From among these, post term mothers and mothers with a history suggestive of infection were excluded. 86 consecutive newborns of 36–42 weeks of gestation with meconium staining of amniotic fluid, without evidence of maternal infection (indicated by fever, premature rupture of membranes, or foul smelling vaginal discharge), were thus subjects of the study. None of the babies had any renal abnormality, or other congenital anomalies detected at antenatal ultrasonographic examination. 28 babies did not pass urine within six hours. Urine from 6 babies could not be analyzed as volume available, after centrifugation (to remove the heavy precipitates in neonatal urine), storage, and transportation to the laboratory was found inadequate. Finally more than 1 mL of clear supernatant urine passed within six hours of birth was available for testing from 52 babies and this group of samples was analyzed. Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of how the cases were recruited.

### Medium-chain acyl-COA dehydrogenase deficiency: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^bf980c0a]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

6.3 supplementation

Dietary supplementation of L‐carnitines is controversial.L‐carnitines have historically been prescribed as a supplement to MCADD patients as part of a long‐term management plan at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day; some patients require a lower dose of 50 mg/kg/day due to the side effect of fish‐smelling body odour resulting from the drug. It has been theorized that L‐carnitine supplementation may alleviate the secondary carnitine deficiency from acylcarnitine ester accumulation. The benefits of such supplementation remain unclear and are largely unverified. One study evaluating the impact of L‐carnitine supplementation at 50 mg/kg/day on performance of moderate intensity exercise found that while the carnitine group had significantly higher plasma concentrations of octanoylcarnitine, suggesting that supplemented patients had increased clearance of accumulated acylcarnitines, both groups had elevated free carnitine levels in plasma and urine; thus, they found no significant biochemical advantage for carnitine supplementation in MCADD patients. Further, L‐carnitine supplements have been shown to have no preventative effect on the development of complications or comorbidities such as obesity.

### Community awareness about risk factors, presentation and prevention and obstetric fistula in nabitovu village, iganga district, Uganda [^b3367848]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Community's awareness about presentation (symptoms and signs) of obstetric fistula

While most male participants reported that they had never heard of the condition of obstetric fistula. On probing, some participants reported that they were aware of a condition characterized by leakage of urine, persistent smell of urine following difficult delivery, or women who constantly used clothes pads to prevent leakage of urine. Locally, the condition was referred to as "Okudhabada" or "Kayisameinhe". Literally, this means 'constant leakage of urine by an unfortunate woman after giving birth'. While participants reported uncontrolled leakage of urine, there was no comment about any other leakage, such as faeces. Either the participants were not aware of this related condition or could not relate it to leakage of urine. Victims of obstetric fistula are ever uncomfortable as almost all the time, their knickers and skirts are ever wet because of the continuous leakage of urine, as exemplified by one participant:

"These women usually suffer as every time they get up, the position/seats which they had occupied before gets wet, plus their skirts, so they end up changing and washing their clothes many times in a day".

Another participant from the older men's focus group reported that the problem (of obstetric fistula) occurred to his own wife:

"Because of over leaking of urine, my wife used to walk with a sisal sack so that she could cover the wet skirts".

Victims of obstetric fistula were reported to have a persistent bad odor. Due to this odor, fistula patients are always isolated by the community and close family members. They were often abandoned, and huts were constructed for them far away from the family home. If it was a married woman who happened to have the condition, the husband abandoned and got another wife:

Larvae (myiasis) and larval debridement therapy — definitions, risk factors, and evidence are summarized: Myiasis is the condition wherein a live vertebrate host is infested by fly larvae (maggots), and healthcare-associated myiasis has been described as generally associated with warm weather, open, unscreened windows, foul-smelling wounds, draining body fluids, and depressed mental status. In urban and suburban regions of the United States, most cases of myiasis are caused by the relatively benign facultative green blowfly, and in one prospective study, only 5% of the cases were hospital-acquired. Larval debridement therapy has been used around the world to promote wound healing and generally has used the disinfected fly larvae of Lucilia sericata in the treatment of wounds resistant to conventional therapy; however, large controlled clinical trials assessing benefits and risks of this therapy have not been performed.

### Penile gangrene induced by colovesical fistula: a case report [^2b84cd8e]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case description

Patient, male, 83 years old, was urgently admitted to our hospital with penile swelling and blackening for 2 days. The patient presented with emaciation but had maintained complete independence in activities of daily living prior to symptom onset, with no previous history of diabetes, hypertension, liver cirrhosis, or malignancy. The patient had a 5-year history of persistent urinary excretion of food particles and pus, a condition diagnosed as a colovesical fistula; however, the patient declined further investigation and treatment due to refusal of the treatment process. Two days ago, he developed symptoms of penile blackening and swelling without any obvious trigger, accompanied by purulent discharge and a foul odor. An initial diagnosis of penile gangrene was made upon emergency examination. Upon admission, his temperature was 36.7℃, heart rate was 76 bpm, and blood pressure was 94/46 mmHg. Physical examination revealed a swollen, blackened, foul-smelling penis with palpable crepitus (Fig. 1 a). Abdominal CT scan showed multiple gas pockets in the penis and surrounding areas, indicating scrotal gas gangrene (Fig. 2 a). Laboratory findings on admission revealed:Elevated serum procalcitonin (2.63 ng/mL); Leukocytosis (38.18 × 10⁹/L) with neutrophilic predominance (97.40%) and anemia (hemoglobin 63.00 g/L); Significant hypoalbuminemia (26.0 g/L), elevated serum creatinine (236 μmol/L), and hyperuricemia (534.0 μmol/L); Enterococcus faecium was isolated from both pus and urine cultures. The patient was immediately initiated on combined antibiotic therapy with imipenem-cilastatin and linezolid.and underwent emergency surgery under lumbar anesthesia. Necrotic skin and subcutaneous fascial tissue were debrided, with removal of necrotic tissue and purulent discharge. Intraoperative examination revealed necrotic changes with defect in the penile urethra, prompting placement of a 16 F indwelling catheter. Due to the severe infectious status of the penile tissues and concerns regarding potential progression of necrosis in the residual urethra, urethral meatusplasty was deliberately deferred. (Fig. 1 b). The wound was repeatedly irrigated with hydrogen peroxide, normal saline, and diluted povidone-iodine.

### "We shall count it as a part of kyogero": acceptability and considerations for scale up of single dose chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care in central Uganda [^e2089d7f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

It reduces bad smell

Participants reported that chlorhexidine was better at dealing with foul umbilical cord smell compared to alternatives. Mothers reported that the umbilical cord usually produced a foul smell (both when on the baby and off the baby), which they disliked because it gave an impression that the mother was unhygienic. The smell also hindered visitors from holding the baby. Some mothers also attributed the hesitancy of their husbands to hold the newborn to the foul smell from the umbilical cord. When the umbilical cord was off the baby, the smell attracted rats to the cord remnant and sometimes the rats took it. Anything that could prevent the umbilical cord from smelling was very welcome. Chlorhexidine seemed to do just that and was hence appreciated by most mothers. The umbilical cord smell could also predispose the child to harm and dangers as a grandmother told us:

Now I realized is that this drug is better than our herbal medicine. With our herbal medicine the cord lasts for four days but the cord smells a lot. There is a friend of mine whose child was killed by the rat because it ate the cord. If you have rats and you are not clean, that foul smell attracts the rats and they can bite the umbilical cord (Grandmother IDI).

In addition to the reduced smell, participants felt that the cord dried up faster and looked less slimy as one health worker noted:

When you put it on the baby's umbilical cord, you see the changes immediately (Health worker IDI).

This quickened drying was beneficial as it encouraged some husbands to participate in newborn care early on as a mother told us:

When I told him that the cord had dried up he was surprised, he asked whether he was not going to harm the baby and I told him that there was no problem, so he carried him because he was also seeing that it was already dry (Mothers FGD).

### Urinary tract infection in children: when to worry [^914d7df5]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent diagnosis in children who are referred to the urologist. Although most infections will resolve without complication after appropriate treatment, a wide array of potential complicating factors exists, which can make difficult the rapid resolution of a UTI. Clinical scenarios involving these factors require a high index of suspicion and prompt initiation of appropriate therapy.
