## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to find the product of 5.7 multiplied by 8 mentally using the distributive property. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to decompose 5.7 into a sum that makes multiplication by 8 easier. Then, I should apply the distributive property to multiply each part by 8. Next, I will add the partial results and verify the decimal placement. Finally, I will check the answer against the provided choices and confirm the correct option.

> Let me first confirm the decomposition. 5.7 can be written as 5 plus 0.7, which are numbers I can multiply by 8 mentally without much trouble, so I will use 5.7 = 5 + 0.7 as my split.

> Now, I will apply the distributive property: 5.7 × 8 = (5 + 0.7) × 8 = 5 × 8 + 0.7 × 8. Wait, let me verify the partial products: 5 × 8 is 40, and 0.7 × 8 is 5.6, so the expression becomes 40 + 5.6.

> Next, I should add the partial results. 40 plus 5.6 equals 45.6. Hold on, I should verify the decimal placement: 0.7 has one decimal place, 8 is a whole number, so 0.7 × 8 should indeed be 5.6, and adding that to 40 gives 45.6, which preserves one decimal place as expected.

> I will now examine the answer choices to match the result. 45.6 corresponds to option E, so my initial conclusion is that E is correct. But wait, what if I misread the choices? Let me double-check: yes, E is 45.6, which matches my calculation.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 5.7 × 8 might be 56.4, but that would be 7 × 8 = 56 with a misplaced decimal, which is incorrect. Hold on, I should verify that 5.7 is less than 6, so 5.7 × 8 must be less than 48, which confirms that 45.6 is the right magnitude and 56.4 is too high.

> Final answer: E. 45.6.

---

The product of 5.7 × 8 using the distributive property is **45.6**. Here's the mental math: 5.7 × 8 = (5 + 0.7) × 8 = 5 × 8 + 0.7 × 8 = 40 + 5.6 = **45.6**. The correct answer is **E. 45.6**.

---

## Step-by-step solution using the distributive property

The distributive property states that **a(b + c) = ab + ac**. Here, we apply it to 5.7 × 8 by splitting 5.7 into 5 + 0.7:

- **Step 1**: Decompose 5.7 into 5 + 0.7.
- **Step 2**: Apply the distributive property: (5 + 0.7) × 8 = 5 × 8 + 0.7 × 8.
- **Step 3**: Calculate 5 × 8 = 40.
- **Step 4**: Calculate 0.7 × 8 = 5.6.
- **Step 5**: Add the partial results: 40 + 5.6 = 45.6.

Thus, 5.7 × 8 = **45.6**.

---

## Verification of the answer

To ensure accuracy, we can verify by **multiplying directly**: 5.7 × 8 = 45.6, confirming the result.

---

## Conclusion

The product of 5.7 × 8 using the distributive property is **45.6**, which corresponds to option **E**.

### Triplet-driven chemical reactivity of β-carotene and its biological implications [^6f2fd090]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The computations of the ground state structures indicate that an 3 O 2 attack on positions 5 or 7 (Fig. 4a) in the large allylic -like radical system of 3 βCar(T 1), which extends from C 5 in the ionone ring up to C 10, is more probable than an attack on positions 8 or 10, due to the higher stability of 1 and 2 (Supplementary Table 1). The structures of the final products imply the sequence of steps leading to the closure of the -O-O- bridges. As no rearrangement around C 5 is possible, βCar-5,8-EPO must be formed while retaining the original conformation. In contrast, the formation of the 7,10-O 2 bridge requires an 8-s- trans to 8-s- cis change in geometry at the C 8 –C 9 bond. This is achieved by the rehybridization (sp 2 → sp 3) of two respective carbon atoms and two rotations around the C–C bonds (see Fig. 4a). Due to these extra steps, the overall rate of the 7,10-product formation is necessarily slow, which is highly consistent with the reaction yield, which is lower by a factor of 3–4 with respect to the 5,8-product. The 7,10-product is energetically less stable than the 5,8-product, by ∼44 kJ/mol, and a major contribution to this value comes from the steric interactions between the O 2 bridge and the skeleton (Supplementary Table 1). This strain is rather confined because of the protective effect of side methyls on the skeletal conformation. The computations on the truncated βCar-EPOs, which show deviations from the sp 2 geometry on C 11 after the methyl group has been removed, confirm this notion (Supplementary Table 2). Concerning the driving force for oxygenation, a simple comparison of the changes in the reactants/products total energies in the O 2 −βCar−βCar-EPO system show that it is greater for the 5,8-product (Supplementary Table 1). Thus, the formation of βCar-EPOs is under both kinetic and thermodynamic control, favoring βCar-5,8-EPO as the main product, which is consistent with the experiment. Additionally, in vivo βCar-5,8-EPO is the major product of βCar oxygenation and its accumulation in light-stressed photosynthetic tissues is well documented,. In contrast to our conclusions (see below), it is regarded as an early index of 1 O 2 production in leaves, and its low-mass breakdown products, in particular β-cyclocitral and apo-10'-carotenal, are considered to be markers of oxidative stress, which participate in stress signaling and the induction of acclimation genes –. In Fig. 4, the plausible pathways of light-induced βCar-EPO decomposition into O 2 and carotenes (Fig. 4b) and the breakdown to low-mass products (Fig. 4c) are shown. βCar-7,10-EPO, owing to its photolability and the retention of oxygen atoms on C 7 in the former and on C 10 in the latter, appears to be their parental molecule (Fig. 4c). The βCar-7,10-EPO breakdown begins with a Kornblum–De La Mare rearrangement favored by protic media, followed then by photochemical processes or, alternatively, with a photolytic cleavage of the -O-O- bridge. In either case, an allylic -like 1,4-biradical intermediate is formed, additionally resonance-stabilized by a large π-electron system. This intermediate in the excited state cleaves into a variety of lower mass free radical and biradical products in a Norrish type II reaction,,. This mechanism explains the formation of β-cyclocitral and apo-10'-carotenal as the end products. Consequently, apo-8'-carotenal is expected to be among the products of βCar-5,8-EPO breakdown.

### Adalimumab-ryvk (simlandi) [^9a58daa2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Increased Risk of Infection when Used with Anakinra

Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of SIMLANDI and anakinra is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] .

5.8 Heart Failure

Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with adalimumab products. Adalimumab products have not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHF-related adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using SIMLANDI in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully.

5.9 Autoimmunity

Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome. If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with SIMLANDI, discontinue treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

5.10 Immunizations

In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with RA, no difference was detected in anti-pneumococcal antibody response between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with adalimumab. Similar proportions of patients developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving adalimumab. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on SIMLANDI may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab products.

It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating SIMLANDI therapy. Patients on SIMLANDI may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines.

The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.4)] .

### Highly oxidized products from the atmospheric reaction of hydroxyl radicals with isoprene [^37614d35]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

C 5 H 8 O 2 concentrations, very similar to those of the HPALDs 15, linearly increased with rising isoprene conversion in an almost identical way to all 1,6 H-shift products. C 5 H 8 O 2 ´s structure and possible formation routes, however, are speculative at the moment. Reactions of δ-RO 2 radicals 4 and 6 with background NO can only partly explain the C 5 H 8 O 2 production if formation of the hydroxy carbonyl 24 is assumed. Moreover, significant contributions from HO-C 5 H 8 O 2 radical self- and cross-reactions are unlikely, because of the 2 nd order kinetics of this process, which is contrary to the observed linear increase of C 5 H 8 O 2 with rising isoprene conversion.

The molar yields of 1,6 H-shift products (regarding reacted C 5 H 8) measured in the LFT are similar or slightly higher compared to the previous results obtained in the free-jet flow system for a reaction time of 7.9 s. Rising importance of 1,6 H-shift isomerization of 6 with time can be expected for sufficiently low NO and HO 2 radical levels according to the current mechanistic and kinetic description of the HO-C 5 H 8 O 2 radical system (Fig. 1) –,, which would justify raising product yields. The molar HPALD yield is also in reasonable agreement with the result of an earlier study performed in the LFT reporting a HPALD yield of% regarding reacted isoprene. Furthermore, the formation of C 4 H 8 O 5 20, the expected decomposition product of C 5 H 9 O 7 radicals 18 (Fig. 2), was only a minor process (Fig. 4) being in line with our former findings. This is in contradiction to conclusions based on high-temperature OH radical recycling experiments (480–584 K) stating the formation and subsequent decomposition of C 5 H 9 O 7 18 as the main process of 1,6 H-shift product formation for atmospheric conditions.

### A randomized, open-label, bioequivalence study of lidocaine topical system 1.8% and lidocaine patch 5% in healthy subjects [^dd2b513e]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to characterize drug delivery with lidocaine topical system 1.8% vs lidocaine patch 5% through 2 PK studies.

Patients and Methods

Two Phase 1, single-center, open-label, randomized PK studies were performed in healthy adults. In Study 1, 56 subjects received a single intravenous bolus of 0.7 mg/kg of lidocaine as a lead-in to allow for the accurate determination of apparent dose of both products. After a 7-day washout period, subjects were randomized to receive either lidocaine topical system 1.8% or lidocaine patch 5% for 12 hours followed by another 7-day washout period, after which subjects crossed over to receive the other treatment for 12 hours. In Study 2, 54 subjects were randomized to receive either lidocaine topical system 1.8% or lidocaine patch 5% for 12 hours. After a 7-day washout period, subjects crossed over to receive the other treatment. Adhesion and skin irritation assessments were performed after application of the products in Study 2. In both studies, serial blood samples were collected to measure the plasma concentration of lidocaine after product application. Safety assessments and adverse events were monitored in both studies.

Results

The comparative PK analysis demonstrated that the two products, despite their difference in drug load and strength, are bioequivalent. Both products were well tolerated. In Study 2, dermal response scores (skin tolerability after removal) were similar between lidocaine topical system 1.8% and lidocaine patch 5%, with a mean irritation score per patch <1 (barely perceptible erythema), which is not considered to be clinically significant.

Conclusion

Bioequivalence was demonstrated between lidocaine topical system 1.8% and lidocaine patch 5%. A comparison of the single-time adhesion scores at 12 hours in Study 2 favored lidocaine topical system 1.8% over lidocaine patch 5%. Both products were well tolerated as a single application in healthy adult human subjects.

### ASPEN lipid injectable emulsion safety recommendations, part 1: background and adult considerations [^893c3284]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

Table 7. Adult ILE dosing to meet essential fatty acid (EFA) requirements—adult EFA targets are “At least 2%–4% of energy from LA” and “0.25%–0.5% of energy from ALA,” with product LA/ALA contents used for calculations as follows: “SO-ILE contains 85–124 mg/mL LA and 8–22 mg/mL ALA” (means “108 mg/mL LA and 16 mg/mL ALA”), “SO,MCT,OO,FO-ILE contains 28–50 mg/mL LA and 3–7 mg/mL ALA” (means “35 mg/mL LA and 4.5 mg/mL ALA”), and “OO,SO-ILE contains 27.6–44 mg/mL LA and 1.0–8.4 mg/mL ALA” (means “35.8 mg/mL LA and 4.7 mg/mL ALA”). The calculation method states, “The daily dosing amount is calculated by dividing the lowest EFA daily dose in mg by the mean value of EFA provided by the ILE product to yield the daily amount in mL,” and “The gram dose is then determined by multiplying the mL dose by the ILE content (200 mg/mL for a 20% ILE) and converting this mg value to grams.”

Labeling experiments

For CD 3 -SAM related experiments, CD 3 -SAM was used instead of regular SAM during in vitro enzyme activity assays, the products CC-1065, 7, SAH, and 5′-dA were purified by HPLC and subjected to HR-MS, it turned out that the majority of the product CC-1065 showed a mass shift of +2 m/z (C 37 H 32 D 2 N 7 O 8 + 706.2518) while the minority remained unchanged, the majority of the product 7 showed a mass shift of +2 m/z (C 37 H 32 D 2 N 7 O 8 + 706.2519) while the minority unchanged, the majority of the product 5′-dA showed a mass shift of +1 m/z (C 10 H 13 DN 5 O 3 + 253.1084) and the minority unchanged while the molecular mass of the product SAH remained unchanged (C 14 H 21 N 6 O 5 S + 385.1293). Observing these small amount of unlabeled products is in good agreement with the fact that C10P and Swoo_2002 can co-purified with a small amount of unlabeled SAM showed by HPLC analysis.

For D 2 O experiments, all chemical reagents for enzyme assays were dissolved in D 2 O and proteins were exchanged into Tris•HCl buffer prepared in D 2 O. The products CC-1065, 7, SAH, and 5′-dA were purified by HPLC and subjected to HR-MS, it turned out that the majority of the product CC-1065 showed a mass shift of +1 m/z (C 37 H 33 DN 7 O 8 + 705.2458) while the minority stayed unchanged, the majority of the product 7 showed a mass shift of +1 m/z (C 37 H 33 DN 7 O 8 + 705.2459) while the minority unchanged, the molecular mass of the product 5′-dA and SAH remained the same (C 10 H 14 N 5 O 3 + 252.1090 for 5′-dA and C 14 H 21 N 6 O 5 S + 385.1293 for SAH).

### Enantioselective three-component aminomethylation of α-diazo ketones with alcohols and 1, 3, 5-triazines [^44b1413c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Mechanistic studies

To gain some insights into the pathway of this transformation, two control experiments were conducted. First, the O–H insertion product 7 derived from 1j and 2b was allowed to react with 3a under the optimal conditions, and the Mannich-type product 5j was not detected (Fig. 7a). This result indicated that a stepwise O–H insertion/Mannich reaction pathway is unlikely involved in current transformation. On the other hand, the [4 + 1] cycloaddition product 8 derived from 2b and 3a, which has been observed as the major product when Rh(II) alone was used as the catalyst, failed to react with 1j under the optimal reaction conditions (Fig. 7b), thus extruding the involvement of 8 as the intermediate for this transformation.

Mechanistic studies.

a Control reaction to exclude the formation of product 5j from insertion product 7. b Control reaction to exclude the formation of product 5j from cycloaddition product 8. c, d Control reactions to verify the involvement of enol intermediate with diazo ketone 2e and 2e’.

In previously reported O–H insertion and rearrangement transformations between α -diazo ketones and alcohols, an enol intermediate has been proposed and characterized as the key intermediate,. Recent related DFT studies also supported the involvement of an enol intermediate in these processes –. To verify whether an enol intermediate was also involved for the current transformation, parallel experiments starting from 2-diazo-1-tetralone (2e) or 1-diazo-2-tetralone (2e’) were conducted. For both reactions, the same three-component product 9 whose tertiary carbon was located at the 2-position were obtained as the major product (Fig. 7c, d), indicating that an enol intermediate, rather than an oxonium ylide, might be involved for this transformation.

### Triaminopyrimidine is a fast-killing and long-acting antimalarial clinical candidate [^4ae33afa]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Generic synthetic route for the synthesis of key compounds (7, 8, 9 and 12) are illustrated in Fig. 1. The synthesis of compounds 1 –6, 10 and 11 are provided in Supplementary Note 1 using chemical scheme analogues to the one illustrated in Fig. 1 in the supplementary section.

A mixture of 5-bromouracil (90 g, 471 mmol, Aldrich) and tert-butyl (R)-2-methyl-4l2-piperazine-1-carboxylate (141 g, 706.8 mmol, Aldrich) were taken in pyridine (200 ml) to give a white suspension.

NIH Investment in Applied Research on Drug Products

Figure 1 B shows NIH-funded publications, project years, and NIH costs associated with applied research on 356 drugs through the year of approval. Before first approval, 301 of 356 products (84.5%) had NIH research funding (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Figure 2 B shows cumulative NIH costs for applied research with no discount rate or 3% and 7% discount rates. After 95th percentile outlier elimination, the mean (SD) NIH cost for applied research before approval was $51.8 ($96.8) million (3% discount, $58.5 [$111.9] million; 7% discount, $69.4 [$137.8] million; 10.5% cost of capital, $81.4 [$168.3] million) (Table 2). Outliers included searches failing to distinguish applied research on the approved product from basic research on the corresponding natural compound (ie, clotting factors, hormones, α-1 antitrypsin). Results without outlier elimination are shown in eTable 3 in Supplement 1.

Accounting for NIH Funding for Failed Product Candidates

The NIH costs calculation associated with failed clinical trials is shown in eTable 5 in Supplement 1. Based on reported phase transition rates,8.53 phase 1 trials, 5.08 phase 2 trials, and 1.79 phase 3 trials were conducted for each product approved. With NIH costs of $5.7 million for phase 1, $7.2 million for phase 2, and $3.9 million for phase 3,estimated NIH costs for clinical trials of failed candidates were $75.4 million for each product approval (3% discount, $80.6 million; 7% discount, $88.6 million; 10.5% cost of capital, $96.8 million) (Table 2).

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7 . 2 mg in adults with obesity (STEP UP): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^e15e4726]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg is approved for weight management in people with obesity and related complications; however, some individuals do not reach their therapeutic goals with this dose. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of a higher dose of semaglutide (7·2 mg) in people with obesity.

Methods

STEP UP was a phase 3b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial conducted across 95 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in 11 countries in adults with BMI 30 kg/m 2 or greater, without diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (5:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7·2 mg, 2·4 mg, or placebo, with a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants with a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater for semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo from baseline to week 72 (treatment policy estimand). Confirmatory secondary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight with 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg, change in waist circumference (cm), and proportion of participants with bodyweight reductions of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, 20% or greater, and 25% or greater versus placebo, and 20% or greater and 25% or greater versus 2·4 mg. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05646706) and is now completed.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, 1407 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 7·2 mg (n=1005), semaglutide 2·4 mg (n=201), or placebo (n=201). 1037 (73·7%) of 1407 participants were female, the mean age was 47 (SD 12) years, mean bodyweight was 113·0 (24·1) kg, and mean BMI was 39·9 (7·1) kg/m 2 . The mean change in bodyweight was greater with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg (-18·7% [SE 0·4] vs -15·6% [0·7]; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -3·1% [95% CI -4·7 to -1·6]; p<0·0001) and with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (-18·7% [0·4] vs -3·9% [0·6]; -14·8% [-16·2 to -13·4]; p<0·0001). Participants in the semaglutide 7·2 mg group were more likely than those in the placebo group to reach bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 12·1 [95% CI 8·3 to 17·6]; p<0·0001), 10% or greater (14·5 [9·6 to 21·9]; p<0·0001), 15% or greater (20·3 [11·2 to 36·8]; p<0·0001), 20% or greater (27·3 [10·9 to 68·0]; p<0·0001), and 25% or greater (127·4 [36·8 to 441·4]; p<0·0001); and more likely than those in the 2·4 mg group to reach bodyweight reductions of 20% or greater (1·8 [1·3 to 2·4]; p=0·0006) and 25% or greater (2·4 [1·6 to 3·5]; p<0·0001). Improvements in waist circumference were observed with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (ETD -11·7 cm [95% CI -13·0 to -10·4]; p<0·0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with semaglutide 7·2 mg (711 [70·8%] of 1004) versus 2·4 mg (123 [61·2%] of 201) or placebo (86 [42·8%] of 201), as was dysaesthesia (230 [22·9%], 12 [6·0%], and one [0·5%], respectively). Serious adverse events were reported by 68 (6·8%) of 1004 participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, 22 (10·9%) of 201 with semaglutide 2·4 mg, and 11 (5·5%) of 201 with placebo.

Interpretation

Semaglutide 7·2 mg was superior to placebo and 2·4 mg for bodyweight reduction in adults with obesity, while retaining a favourable risk-benefit profile.

### Six steps in quality intervention development (6SQuID) [^221654f2]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In order to improve the effectiveness of public health interventions, a systematic approach to intervention development is required, as well as rigorous evaluation. However, little practical guidance exists for public health practitioners and researchers that explains the essential stages of intervention development. We argue that this process can be broken down into six key steps: defining and understanding the problem; identifying modifiable determinants; deciding on the mechanisms of change; clarifying how these will be delivered; testing and adapting the intervention; and collecting initial evidence of effectiveness. This model imposes somewhat arbitrary cut-offs in the process of intervention development and suggests a linear progression. In practice developers often return to an earlier step in the sequence before reaching step 6, and subsequently ‘definitive trials’ can lead to further revisions of the intervention. However, we hope that if each of these six steps is carefully addressed in the design of interventions better use will be made of scarce public resources by avoiding the costly evaluation, or implementation, of unpromising interventions.

What is already known on this subject?

There is little practical guidance for researchers or practitioners on how best to develop public health interventions. Existing models are generally orientated towards individual behaviour change and some are highly technical and take years to implement.

What this study adds?

This paper provides a pragmatic six-step guide to develop interventions in a logical, evidence-based way to maximise likely effectiveness. If each step is carefully addressed, better use will be made of scarce public resources by avoiding the costly evaluation, or implementation, of unpromising interventions.

### Fresh frozen plasma versus crystalloid priming of cardiopulmonary bypass circuit in pediatric surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^dd3a2c32]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In congenital cardiac surgery, priming cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is performed to prevent coagulation abnormalities. The hypothesis was that CPB priming with crystalloids would be different compared with FFP in terms of bleeding and/or need for blood product transfusion.

Methods

In this parallel-arm double-blinded study, patients weighing between 7 and 15 kg were randomly assigned to a CPB priming with 15 ml · kg PlasmaLyte or 15 ml · kg FFP in addition to a predefined amount of packed red blood cells used in all patients. The decision to transfuse was clinical and guided by point-of-care tests. The primary endpoints included postoperative bleeding tracked by chest tubes, number of patients transfused with any additional blood products, and the total number of additional blood products administered intra- and postoperatively. The postoperative period included the first 6 h after intensive care unit arrival.

Results

Respectively, 30 and 29 patients in the FFP and in the crystalloid group were analyzed in an intention-to-treat basis. Median postoperative blood loss was 7.1 ml · kg (5.1, 9.4) in the FFP group and 5.7 ml · kg (3.8, 8.5) in the crystalloid group (P = 0.219); difference (95% CI): 1.2 (-0.7 to 3.2). The proportion of patients additionally transfused was 26.7% (8 of 30) and 37.9% (11 of 29) in the FFP and the crystalloid groups, respectively (P = 0.355; odds ratio [95% CI], 1.7 [0.6 to 5.1]). The median number of any blood products transfused in addition to priming was 0 (0, 1) and 0 (0, 2) in the FFP and crystalloid groups, respectively (P = 0.254; difference [95% CI], 0 [0 to 0]). There were no study-related adverse events.

Conclusions

The results demonstrate that in infants and children, priming CPB with crystalloids does not result in a different risk of postoperative bleeding and need for transfusion of allogeneic blood products.

Number of L. monocytogenes Cells Consumed by the Population

Sales data suggested widespread distribution of contaminated products to hospitals and the general population (e.g. schools, grocery stores, restaurants). We estimated that the general population ingested a total of 1.5 × 10 9 (low-exposure scenario) to 1.4 × 10 10 (high-exposure scenario) L. monocytogenes cells (Table 2). We estimated that, overall, the highly susceptible population ingested 7.2 × 10 6 (low-exposure scenario) to 3.3 × 10 7 (high-exposure scenario) L. monocytogenes cells.

Among hospitals that received > 1 products from the production line of factory 1 known to produce contaminated ice cream, the median percentage of total beds constituting ICU beds (severity of illness score) was 8.7% (range 0%–70.7%; mean 10%). The median number of servings per bed (supply score) over the recorded distribution period (16 months) was 2 (range 0.1–93.7; mean 4.3). The Kansas hospital with the 4 cases of ice cream–associated listeriosis had 62.2 servings of the implicated products per bed (13.5% of beds in the hospital were ICU beds); the servings per bed value for the hospital was exceeded by only 1 other hospital (93.7 servings/bed; 6.5% ICU beds). After combining the severity of illness and supply scores for each hospital, we found the median value was 5 (range 2–7; mean 4.6); a combined score of 7 was achieved by 9% of hospitals, of which 1 was the Kansas hospital with the 4 cases (the hospital with 93.7 servings/bed had a combined score of 6).

2.1    Conditions for Distribution and Use of
Methadone Products for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction

Code of Federal Regulations, Title 42, Sec 8 : Methadone products when used for the treatment of opioid addiction in detoxification or maintenance programs, shall be dispensed only by opioid treatment programs (and agencies, practitioners or institutions by formal agreement with the program sponsor) certified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and approved by the designated state authority. Certified treatment programs shall dispense and use methadone in oral form only and according to the treatment requirements stipulated in the Federal Opioid Treatment Standards (42 CFR 8.12). See below for important regulatory exceptions to the general requirement for certification to provide opioid agonist treatment.

Failure to abide by the requirements in these regulations may result in criminal prosecution, seizure of the drug supply, revocation of the program approval, and injunction precluding operation of the program.

Regulatory Exceptions to the General Requirement for Certification to Provide Opioid Agonist Treatment :

During inpatient care, when the patient was admitted for any condition other than concurrent opioid addiction (pursuant to 21 CFR 1306.07(c)), to facilitate the treatment of the primary admitting diagnosis.
During an emergency period of no longer than 3 days while definitive care for the addiction is being sought in an appropriately licensed facility (pursuant to 21 CFR 1306.07(b)).

2.2    Important Dosage and
Administration Information

Methadone hydrochloride tablets for oral suspension are for oral administration only. The preparation must not be injected. Methadone should be kept out of reach of children to prevent accidental ingestion .

Consider the following important factors that differentiate methadone from other opioids:

The peak respiratory depressant effect of methadone occurs later and persists longer than its peak pharmacologic effect.
A high degree of opioid tolerance does not eliminate the possibility of methadone overdose, iatrogenic or otherwise. Deaths have been reported during conversion to methadone from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists and during initiation of methadone treatment of addiction in subjects previously abusing high doses of other opioid agonists.
There is high interpatient variability in absorption, metabolism, and relative analgesic potency. Population-based conversion ratios between methadone and other opioids are not accurate when applied to individuals.
With repeated dosing, methadone is retained in the liver and then slowly released, prolonging the duration of potential toxicity.
Steady-state plasma concentrations are not attained until 3 to 5 days after initiation of dosing.

Methadone hydrochloride tablets for oral suspension have a narrow therapeutic index, especially when combined with other drugs.

### Trazodone hydrochoride (trazodone hydrochloride) [^7e0ad5bf]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Because the frequency of adverse drug effects is affected by diverse factors (e.g., drug dose, method of detection, physician judgment, disease under treatment, etc.) a single meaningful estimate of adverse event incidence is difficult to obtain. This problem is illustrated by the variation in adverse event incidence observed and reported from the inpatients and outpatients treated with trazodone HCl. It is impossible to determine precisely what accounts for the differences observed.

Clinical Trial Reports

Table 2 below is presented solely to indicate the relative frequency of adverse events reported in representative controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of trazodone HCl.

The figures cited cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors often differ from those which prevailed in clinical trials. These incidence figures, also, cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products and placebo as each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions.

### The 5S-5M-5C schematic: transforming primary care inputs to outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries [^02278e17]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Historically, efforts to strengthen health system performance have overly focused on input-driven initiatives that fund the 4S’s, often through disease-specific vertical programmes. However, adopting a business-as-usual approach will be insufficient to achieve the global goal of UHC in a sustainable, efficient and equitable manner. The path towards UHC is dependent on strong, high-quality PC to support overall PHC goals. In turn, the path towards improving PC systems involves first acknowledging the centrality of the 5M mechanisms for effective service delivery. A research and policy agenda focused on better measuring and strengthening the 5M mechanisms is necessary to discern new ways to drive improvement in PC service delivery, coupled with meaningful support to LMICs to build evidence-informed systems. To address these gaps, PHCPI has launched a research consortium dedicated to developing actionable knowledge and policy recommendations to achieve these goals.

In addition to further clarifying how and what to measure to strengthen PHC, further investments in stronger data and performance monitoring systems are needed as well as analytical tools to use this information to drive improvement. This requires more robust health information systems capable of aggregating data from multiple sources, including both public and private care delivery systems and providing timely and actionable data to decision makers and health workers to modify services at the local level. Initiatives such as the Health Data Collaborativehave started this important work, but there is still much progress to be made.

Finally, while much of PC in LMICs is provided by the public sector, there is a large role for private sector engagement and innovation, both as direct service providers and through public–private partnerships.There are many insights to be taken from private sector systems’ design and management, particularly related to the 5M mechanisms, that can improve efficiencies and scale strategies, while also ensuring that equity is prioritised in both public and private sector service delivery. Without incorporating these lessons and innovations and directly including private sector partners in the delivery of PC, the goal of UHC will likely be unachievable.

### Practice parameter for the psychiatric assessment and management of physically ill children and adolescents [^9de591f4]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Principle 8—adherence to the medical treatment regimen should be evaluated and optimized, highlighting prevalence, consequences, and risk factors. Failure to follow through with treatment regimens is a major health concern, and reviews suggest that 33% of patients with acute health conditions, and 50% to 55% of those with chronic illnesses fail to adhere to their treatment regimens. Nonadherence may result in poor medical outcome, increased financial costs, and decreased quality of life. Individual, family, disease, and treatment correlates have been identified as important risk factors for treatment nonadherence; Table 5 enumerates individual factors (history of poor adherence, adolescence, history of behavioral difficulties, past emotional difficulties, presence of denial regarding illness, low self-esteem, internal locus of control), family factors (lack of parental supervision, parent conflict, parental psychopathology, poor family support, low socioeconomic status, lack of family cohesion, poor pattern of family communication), disease factors (long duration of illness, illnesses with few symptoms, feelings of pessimism regarding illness), and treatment factors (complexity of the treatment regimen, unpleasant medication side effects, low level of perceived efficacy of treatment, treatment with high financial costs). Studies on the efficacy of treatment interventions responding to these correlates have been limited by small sample sizes, inability to generalize findings, and difficulties standardizing adherence measurement, and based on etiologic factors, current treatment approaches involve educational, organizational, behavioral, and psychotherapeutic interventions.

### Carbon dioxide rebreathing induced by crib bumpers and mesh liners using an infant manikin [^49cae878]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Results

CO 2 RB Studies

Eighteen products were tested including 5 MLs, 3 ALTs and 10 CBs. Differences in CO 2 RB in ML (median [m]=8.2%, 25th percentile [P25]=6.8, 75th percentile [P75]=8.6), ALT (m=10.5%, P25=9.8, P75=10.7) and CB (m=11.6%, P25=10.2, P75=14.3) were statistically significant (p<0.0001). Ranges of CO 2 RB overlapped between product categories (figure 3, top). CO 2 RB values vary widely in CB products, compared with ML and ALT products (figure 3, top). The supine infant centred in the crib with a pacifier in its mouth yielded CO 2 RB measurements of 5.6%, 5.85%, 5.8% and 5.55%, and the condition with the receiving blanket draped over the entire face and torso yielded CO 2 RB values of 7.7%, 7.7% and 8.55%. The stuffed animal yielded the following results: when positioned on the nose of the infant CO 2 RB was 7.4%, 6.4% and 6.55%; proximal to the face CO 2 RB was 6.1% and 6.2%, and on the face CO 2 RB was 11.65%, 8.55% and 16.1%.

### Elranatamab-bcmm (Elrexfio) [^ad17527e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosing Information

Administer ELREXFIO subcutaneously according to the step-up dosing schedule to reduce the incidence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

Administer pre-treatment medications prior to each dose in the ELREXFIO step-up dosing schedule, which includes step-up dose 1, step-up dose 2, and the first treatment dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)] .

ELREXFIO should only be administered by a qualified healthcare professional with appropriate medical support to manage severe reactions such as CRS and neurologic toxicity, including ICANS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)] .

Due to the risk of CRS, patients should be hospitalized for 48 hours after administration of the first step-up dose, and for 24 hours after administration of the second step-up dose.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

For subcutaneous injection only.

The recommended dosing schedule for ELREXFIO is provided in Table 1. The recommended dosages of ELREXFIO subcutaneous injection are: step-up dose 1 of 12 mg on Day 1, step-up dose 2 of 32 mg on Day 4, followed by the first treatment dose of 76 mg on Day 8, and then 76 mg weekly thereafter through week 24.

For patients who have received at least 24 weeks of treatment with ELREXFIO and have achieved a response [partial response (PR) or better] and maintained this response for at least 2 months, the dose interval should transition to an every two-week schedule. For patients who have received at least 24 weeks of treatment with ELREXFIO at the every two-week dosing schedule and have maintained the response, the dose interval should transition to an every four-week schedule.

Continue treatment with ELREXFIO until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Administer pre-treatment medications prior to each dose in the ELREXFIO step-up dosing schedule, which includes step-up dose 1, step-up dose 2, and the first treatment dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] .

### Choosing wisely® in preventive medicine: the American College of Preventive Medicine's top 5 list of recommendations [^9b3533e3]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation #4—Don’t Use Expensive Medications When an Equally Effective and Lower-Cost Medication Is Available highlights that, on average, the cost of a generic drug is 80%—85% lower than the brand name product while having the same active ingredients, strength, and similar effectiveness. Physicians’ cost accuracy is low, with less than 50% of estimates accurate by any definition of cost accuracy, and patient preference for generics is limited, with only 37.6% preferring generics for their own health. Increasing generic utilization can yield large savings; for every 10% increase in the use of generic cholesterol drugs, Medicare costs could be reduced by $1 billion annually. Adherence data from more than 90,000 Medicare beneficiaries showed higher adherence to generic statins compared with brand name statins and a lower composite outcome of hospitalization and death.

### Demography and the emergence of universal patterns in urban systems [^7402110a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

City size distributions in different environments

A number of important ergodic theoremsin population dynamics tell us about the properties of the solutions under different conditions on the environments A (t). These results rely on some constraints on the properties of A ; specifically, that the product of matrices in Eq. (5) is positive for sufficiently long times,.

First, the weak ergodic theorem guarantees that for a dynamical sequence of environments, the difference between two different initial population structure vectors decays to zero over time. This means that there is typically an asymptotic city size “distribution”, which is a function of environmental dynamics only, independent of initial conditions. When the environment is stochastic but otherwise time independent, the strong stochastic ergodic theorem states that the structure vector becomes a random variable whose probability distribution converges to a fixed stationary distribution, regardless of initial conditions. This is the sense in which most derivations of Zipf’s law apply,. For stochastic environments, only probability distributions of structure vectors, not vectors themselves, can be predicted. Finally, in situations where the environment is time dependent and stochastic, the weak stochastic ergodic theorem states that the difference between the probability distributions for the structure vector resulting from any two initial populations, exposed to independent sample paths, decays to zero. Again, in cases where the environment is explicitly dynamic, besides being stochastic in a stationary sense, we cannot say much about the actual probability distribution of city sizes, only that the importance of initial conditions vanishes for sufficiently long times.

### Talquetamab (Talvey) [^c4a4fe0b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)

TALVEY can cause cytokine release syndrome, including life-threatening or fatal reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

In the clinical trial, CRS occurred in 76% of patients who received TALVEY at the recommended dosages, with Grade 1 CRS occurring in 57% of patients, Grade 2 in 17%, and Grade 3 in 1.5%. Recurrent CRS occurred in 30% of patients. Most events occurred following step-up dose 1 (29%) or step-up dose 2 (44%) at the recommended dosages. CRS occurred in 33% of patients with step-up dose 3 in the biweekly dosing schedule (N=153). CRS occurred in 30% of patients with the first 0.4 mg/kg treatment dose and in 12% of patients treated with the first 0.8 mg/kg treatment dose. The CRS rate for both dosing schedules combined was less than 3% for each of the remaining doses in Cycle 1 and less than 3% cumulatively from Cycle 2 onward. The median time to onset of CRS was 27 (range: 0.1 to 167) hours from the last dose, and the median duration was 17 (range: 0 to 622) hours. Clinical signs and symptoms of CRS include but are not limited to pyrexia, hypotension, chills, hypoxia, headache, and tachycardia. Potentially life-threatening complications of CRS may include cardiac dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, neurologic toxicity, renal and/or hepatic failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Initiate TALVEY therapy with step-up dosing and administer pre-treatment medications (corticosteroids, antihistamine, and antipyretics) prior to each dose of TALVEY in the step-up dosing schedule to reduce the risk of CRS. Monitor patients following administration accordingly. In patients who experience CRS, pre-treatment medications should be administered prior to the next TALVEY dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

Counsel patients to seek medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur. At the first sign of CRS, immediately evaluate patient for hospitalization and institute treatment with supportive care based on severity and consider further management per current practice guidelines. Withhold TALVEY until CRS resolves or permanently discontinue based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] .

TALVEY is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

MAS-ER Capsules contains amphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

MAS-ER Capsules have a high potential for abuse and misuse which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . MAS-ER Capsules can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.

Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

Misuse and abuse of amphetamine may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including MAS-ER Capsules, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

9.3 Dependence

Physical Dependence

MAS-ER Capsules may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction following prolonged use of CNS stimulants including MAS-ER Capsules include dysphoric mood; depression; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.

Tolerance

MAS-ER Capsules may produce tolerance. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).

### Dietary proteins contribute little to glucose production, even under optimal gluconeogenic conditions in healthy humans [^094fe91e]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Plasma glucose and EGP.

Plasma glucose concentrations did not change significantly for the first 6 h after meal ingestion (Fig. 4 A) and then decreased significantly.

Plasma glucose concentrations (A), total EGP rate (B, black circles), and contribution of dietary AAs to this production (B, open circles) in human subjects during the 8 h after the ingestion of four eggs containing 23 g of doubly [15 N]-[13 C]–labeled proteins. Data are means ± SD (n = 8 at each time point). * indicates a significant difference from the initial value: * P < 0.05.

EGP did not change significantly after meal ingestion and remained constant until 4.5 h, fluctuating between 0.6 and 0.7 mmol · min −1 (i.e. 8–10 µmol · kg · min −1) (Fig. 4 B). The level started to fall off from 5 h after meal ingestion to reach 0.5 ± 0.1 mmol · min −1 at 8 h. Total glucose production over the 8-h postprandial period was 50.4 ± 7.7 g glucose. The contribution of dietary AA to this glucose production rose sharply until 3 h after meal ingestion and peaked between 3.5 and 5 h, the maximum contribution being 12.1 ± 3.3% of total glucose production at 4.5 h after the meal (Fig. 4 B). From 5–8 h after the meal, this contribution decreased to reach 8 ± 2% at the end of the postmeal period. Finally, only 3.9 ± 0.7 g of EGP originated from dietary AAs.

### Broad concepts and messy realities: optimising the application of mental capacity criteria [^2363f46a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Optimising the typology

Can the situation be remedied? Our ‘critically normative’ approach addresses this question as follows. We begin with the courts’ practice—as reflected in the typology of rationales—and critically interpret that typology so that each MCA criterion has as distinct a boundary as possible, minimising the overlaps between MCA criteria. In order to do this, we need to first understand why the court judgements contain multiple MCA criteria linked to a given rationale.

One reason why there seems to be an overlap in MCA criteria for some rationales is that, in many instances, the overlap is more apparent than real. This reflects suboptimal practices and/or artefacts of our method of qualitative analysis. The courts are not always meticulous in how they talk about a rationale in relation to the MCA criteria. Indeed, the most common manifestation of this is when judges provide rationales to justify their decisions without naming (and therefore do not explicitly link) the MCA criteria that they are presumably applying; this happens in 42% of the times that they give rationales for capacity judgements.

When judges do state the MCA criteria with their rationales, they often recite two or more MCA criteria in the discussion of a rationale but do so in ways that make the linkage more an artefact than a genuine conceptual link. For example, a judge might mention two MCA criteria together as a turn of phrase (eg, ‘understand and retain’) so that some MCA criteria are ‘swept up’ in the coding. In other instances, misleading links between rationales and MCA criteria are made because the judgements sometimes do not make explicit the hierarchical relationships between the criteria.For example, if P fails to comprehend some information (rationale 1), P cannot use or weigh it either, but the latter failure is secondary to the fact that P fails to understand. To state in such cases that P fails to use or weigh the relevant information in association with rationale 1 is true but superfluous. A similar point can be made about rationale 8 in table 1 (ability to give coherent reasons) where reason-giving is a downstream marker, that is, without being able to understand one would not be able to give coherent reasons.Here, the link with the understanding criterion is superfluous since the question of whether a person can give a coherent reason for a choice does not even become a live question if the person cannot absorb basic relevant information in the first place.

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^714a0d64]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Choice of parameters

The parameter values used for all of the numerical simulations, which are given in the Source Data file, are within their realistic ranges. The rate of technological growth is around 1.5–2.0% year −1 in developed countries and is higher in some developing countries,. In turn, the rate of growth in the yield per unit of sustainable harvest, g f, depends on the specific natural resource, where values that were considered in the literature vary from g c down to much lower (even negative) values,. Next, the value of 0 ≤ a ≤ 1 (unitless) also depends on the particular system. In a fishery, for example, if non-sustainable harvest would imply catching all the fish and sustainable harvest would imply keeping the fish population size fixed, then a would be the growth rate of the fish (i.e. 2% year −1 for large fish and higher rates for smaller fish); In agriculture, sustainable management implies the use of environmentally friendly pest control methods and effective water management, which may result in a comparable crop yield (α ≲ 1), but may be more expensive (λ > 1),. In turn, the ratio between c (t) and the direct costs, C 1 and C 2 (Eq. 9), determines the relative portion of c that is needed per unit of harvest. Specifically, c (and thus the ratio) is initially small but increases due to technological changes. Also, C 1 and C 2 may vary with x 1 and x 2 if the cost varies among regions (e.g. if near-shore regions are depleted, the average direct cost of harvest may increase). Next, note that 0 ≤ μ ≤ 1 (unitless) can be chosen arbitrarily by the policymaker, as it does not affect the harvest strategy and the future value of the natural resource; rather, it determines the currency unit, which, in turn, determines the relative role of the discount and the price in determining the future value of the natural resource. A reasonable choice would be the portion in the basket of goods of the natural resource (e.g. the portion of agricultural products in consumption is ~5% in the United States and is higher in various developing countries), but μ may be higher if non-market goods are incorporated. Finally, a variety of utility functions that incorporate both c and f were suggested in the literature,,, including the two that are used here (Eqs.

### Dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine sulfate and amphetamine aspartate (Adderall) [^a8a64f9d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

ADDERALL XR contains amphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

ADDERALL XR has a high potential for abuse and misuse which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . ADDERALL XR can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.

Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

Misuse and abuse of amphetamine may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including ADDERALL XR, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

9.3 Dependence

Physical Dependence

ADDERALL XR may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction following prolonged use of CNS stimulants including ADDERALL XR include dysphoric mood; depression; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.

Tolerance

ADDERALL XR may produce tolerance. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).

### Irreversibility in dynamical phases and transitions [^be96845e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In summary, we have introduced the entropy production factor,, a dimensionless, scalar function that quantifies irreversibility in macroscopic, non-equilibrium dynamics by measuring time-reversal symmetry breaking in the cross-covariances between multiple variables. Integratinggives a lower bound on the net entropy production rate,. Calculatingdoes not require knowledge about the form of the underlying dynamics and is easy to calculate for many types of data, including both random variables, such as the positions of driven colloidal particles(Supplementary Note 9, Supplementary Fig. 8 and 9, Supplementary Table 5), and random fields, such as spatially heterogeneous protein concentrations in cells. Furthermore, we stress that we are only able to resolve the irreversibility present in the observable dynamics of our chemical example. As discussed above, the presence of hidden dynamics will provide underestimates of irreversibility measured via Eq. (1) due to the data processing inequality. Using other observable information, such as asymmetric transition ratesor the ratio of populations in observed states under stalled conditionsin Markov jump processes, can give tighter bounds on the entropy produced when unobserved, dissipative processes are present. While the examples considered here are simulations of 1+1 dimensional fields, there is nothing inherently different in the methodology if one were to analyze experimental data in 2 or 3 spatial dimensions, such as the 3+1 dimensional time series data attained using lattice-light sheet microscopy.

In active matter, both living and non-living, the non-equilibrium dissipation of energy manifests in both time and space. With the method introduced here, compatible with widely-used computational and experimental tools, we provide access to these underexplored modes of irreversibility that drive complex spatiotemporal dynamics.

### Olsalazine sodium (Dipentum) [^fc1efaa7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)

Absorption

Serum concentrations of 5-ASA are detected after 4 to 8 hours. The peak levels of 5-ASA after an oral dose of 1 g olsalazine range from 0 to 4.3 micromol/L. No accumulation of 5-ASA or Ac-5-ASA (the major metabolite of 5-ASA) in plasma has been detected.

Distribution

5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA are 74 and 81%, respectively, bound to plasma proteins.

Elimination

Metabolism

N-acetyl-5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA), the major metabolite of 5-ASA found in plasma and urine, is acetylated (deactivated) in at least two sites, the colonic epithelium and the liver. Ac-5-ASA is found in the serum, with peak values of 1.7 to 8.7 micromol/L after a single 1.0 g dose. Pharmacological activities of Ac-5-ASA are unknown.

Excretion

Approximately 20% of the total 5-ASA is recovered in the urine, where it is found almost exclusively as Ac-5-ASA. Of the total 5-ASA found in the urine, more than 90% is in the form of Ac-5-ASA. Only small amounts of 5-ASA are detected. The remaining 5-ASA is partially acetylated and is excreted in the feces. From fecal dialysis, the concentration of 5-ASA in the colon following olsalazine has been calculated to be 18 to 49 micromol/L.

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7 . 2 mg in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes (STEP UP T2D): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^dbcd09f6]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Semaglutide 2·4 mg is approved for weight management in adults with obesity or overweight in the presence of at least one obesity-related complication; however, many people with obesity and type 2 diabetes do not reach their bodyweight reduction goals with this dose. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of a new 7·2 mg maintenance dose of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Methods

STEP UP T2D was a randomised, phase 3b, double-blind controlled, three-arm, parallel-group trial conducted at 68 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in Bulgaria, Canada, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, South Africa, and the USA. Adults aged 18 years or older (BMI ≥30·0 kg/m 2 , HbA 1c 7·0-10·0% [53-86 mmol/mol]) were randomly assigned (3:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7·2 mg, 2·4 mg, or placebo, alongside a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were the percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants reaching a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo. Confirmatory secondary endpoints were the proportion of participants reaching a bodyweight reduction of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, and 20% or greater, and changes in waist circumference (cm) and HbA 1c (%) with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo. Efficacy was assessed in all randomly assigned participants, and safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05649137) and is now closed and completed.

Findings

Between Jan 4 and May 4, 2023, 512 participants were randomly assigned to receive semaglutide 7·2 mg (n=307), semaglutide 2·4 mg (n=103), or placebo (n=102). 265 (51·8%) of 512 participants were female, the mean age was 56 (SD 10) years, mean bodyweight was 110·1 (22·9) kg, mean BMI was 38·6 (7·1) kg/m 2 , and mean HbA 1c was 8·1% (0·9). Compared with placebo, semaglutide 7·2 mg led to greater reductions in mean bodyweight (-13·2% vs -3·9%; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -9·3% [95% CI -11·0 to -7·7]; p<0·0001); more participants reaching bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 10·0 [95% CI 6·0 to 16·9]; p<0·0001), 10% or greater (11·3 [5·9 to 21·4]; p<0·0001), 15% or greater (8·1 [3·7 to 17·7]; p<0·0001), and 20% or greater (12·3 [3·0 to 51·0]; p=0·0006); and reduced waist circumference (ETD -6·5 cm [95% CI -9·0 to -4·1]; p<0·0001) and HbA 1c (ETD -1·5% [95% CI -1·8 to -1·2]; p<0·0001). Level 2-3 hypoglycaemia risk was low and comparable between semaglutide doses and placebo. Gastrointestinal events were reported by 163 (53·1%) of 307 participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, 53 (51·5%) of 103 participants with semaglutide 2·4 mg, 26 (25·5%) of 102 participants with placebo; and serious adverse events were reported by 28 (9·1%) participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, nine (8·7%) participants with semaglutide 2·4 mg, and nine (8·8%) participants with placebo. Dysaesthesia was more common with semaglutide 7·2 mg (58 [18·9%] of 307) versus 2·4 mg (five [4·9%] of 103) and placebo (none).

Interpretation

Among people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, semaglutide 7·2 mg was superior to placebo in reducing bodyweight, waist circumference, and HbA 1c . Safety and tolerability were comparable between semaglutide 7·2 mg and 2·4 mg, except for the imbalance in dysaesthesia.

### Adjusting 1.5 degree C climate change mitigation pathways in light of adverse new information [^0ddc4793]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 8 
Carbon price in scenarios.

Panels group scenarios as those adjusting their pathway from 2025 (top), and from 2030 (middle) with bottom panel comparing “all adverse information” scenarios with low energy demand variants. In the top panel, the “1p5_lowBudget_25” and “1p5_limAFOLU_25” lines overlap. In the middle panel, the “1p5_ref” and “1p5_limRNW_30” lines, and the “1p5_lowBudget_30” and “1p5_limAFOLU_30” lines overlap. All scenario names are explained in Table 1.

Mitigation costs (as expressed as a share of GDP in a scenario in which only current policies are simulated) reflect these carbon price variations. Where the pathway adjustment occurs in 2025, the mitigation cost is 0.25–0.45% of GDP by 2030 for each scenario in which a single adverse piece of information is received, compared to 0.24% of GDP in the 1.5 °C reference scenario (Supplementary Fig 2). When all adverse information is received in 2025, the mitigation cost is 1.62% of GDP in 2030. When the pathway adjustment occurs in 2030, then each individual adverse piece of information leads to a mitigation cost of 0.47–0.82% of GDP by 2040, compared to 0.47% of GDP in the 1.5 °C reference scenario. When all adverse information is received together and the pathway is adjusted from 2025, the cost is 3.9% of GDP by 2050—around four times the cost of the 1.5 °C reference scenario. With a pathway adjustment from 2030, by 2050 the mitigation cost is 5.0% of GDP. Clearly, this is a considerable cost increase compared to the 1.5 °C reference scenario, but it is important to place it in the context that it doesn’t account for any co-benefits to climate action, any policy mechanisms that might resolve distortions in the economy, nor (most importantly) the costs deriving from climate impacts associated with less aggressive mitigation.

COLUMVI Step-up Dose Schedule

COLUMVI dosing begins with a step-up dose schedule. Following completion of pretreatment with obinutuzumab on Cycle 1 Day 1, administer COLUMVI as an intravenous infusion according to the step-up dose schedule in Table 1 . Administer premedications for each dose of COLUMVI as described in Table 3 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Continue COLUMVI for a maximum of 12 cycles (inclusive of Cycle 1 step-up dosing) or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.

Monitoring for Cytokine Release Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

Administer the COLUMVI infusions intravenously in a healthcare setting with immediate access to medical support to manage CRS, including severe CRS.
For the first COLUMVI step-up dose (2.5 mg on Cycle 1 Day 8), patients should be hospitalized during and for 24 hours after completion of the COLUMVI infusion.
Patients who experienced any grade CRS during step-up dose 1 should be hospitalized during and for 24 hours after completion of step-up dose 2 (10 mg on Cycle 1 Day 15). CRS with step-up dose 2 can occur in patients who did not experience CRS with step-up dose 1.
For subsequent infusions (30 mg on Day 1 of Cycle 2 or subsequent cycles), patients who experienced Grade ≥ 2 CRS with their previous infusion should be hospitalized during and for 24 hours after completion of the next COLUMVI infusion.
For monitoring after delayed or missed doses of COLUMVI, follow the recommendations in Table 2 .

Delayed or Missed Doses

If a dose of COLUMVI is delayed, restart therapy based on the recommendations made in Table 2, then resume the treatment schedule accordingly.

For repeat of the 2.5 mg dose patients should be hospitalized during and for 24 hours after completion of the COLUMVI infusion. For the repeat of the 10 mg dose, patients should be hospitalized during and for 24 hours after completion of the COLUMVI infusion if any grade CRS occurred during the most recent 2.5 mg dose.

A positive control using histamine phosphate identifies patients whose skin may not react due to medications, metabolic or other reasons. A negative control (50% glycerine for prick-puncture testing) would exclude false-positive reactions due to ingredients in diluent or patients who have dermatographism.

SINGLE DILUTION INTRADERMAL TESTING: The surface of the upper and lower arm is the usual location for skin testing. It is important that a new, sterile, disposable syringe and needle be used for each extract tested. Intracutaneous test dilutions, five-fold or ten-fold, may be prepared from stock concentrate using physiologic saline as a diluent. (1) Start testing with the most dilute allergenic extract concentration. (2) A volume of 0.02-0.05 ml should be injected slowly into the superficial skin layers making a small bleb (superficial wheal). (3) For patients without a history of extreme sensitivity, or a negative or weakly reactive prick-puncture test, the initial dilution for skin testing should be a dilution at least 1:12,500 w/v. This initial dilution can be prepared by diluting 1:20 to 1:50 w/v (2%-5%) extracts five-fold to 5-4or 1:10 w/v (10%) extracts to 5-5. See “Serial Dilutions Titration Test Dilutions” chart on the next page. Dilute 1:10 w/v (10%) extracts to 10-3if using ten-fold dilutions. (4) Sensitive patients with a positive prick-puncture test require a further dilution to at least 1:312,500 w/v. This dilution can be prepared by diluting 1:20 to 1:50 w/v (2% - 5%) extracts to 5-6or 1:10 w/v (10%) extracts to 5-7(five-fold dilutions). Ten-fold dilution to 10-6of a 1:10 w/v (10%) extract would be a safe starting dilution. Size of reactions are quantitated based on size of wheal and erythema. For interpretation of skin reactions, refer to chart below. If after 20 minutes no skin reaction is observed, continue testing using increasing increments of the concentration until a reaction of 5-10 mm wheal and 11-30 mm erythema is obtained, or a concentration of 5-2or 10-1has been tested. A negative control, 50% glycerine diluted with diluent to 5-2(1:25) or 10-1(1:10) dilution and a positive control of histamine phosphate, should be tested and included in interpretation of skin reactions.1, 13

### Bench assessment of expiratory valve resistance of current ICU ventilators in dynamic conditions [^6dfa6bb9]. Respiratory Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

We hypothesized that the lack of benefit of setting a low versus a high PEEP in patients with ARDS may be due in part to differences in the dynamic behavior of the expiratory valve in ventilators. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a bench comparison of the dynamic behavior of expiratory valves on ICU ventilators currently in use.

Methods

We attached 7 ICU ventilators (C5, C6, Carescape, PB980, ServoU, V500, and V680) to the ASL 5000 lung model (passive condition with compliance 20 mL/cm H 2 O and resistance 5 cm H 2 O/L/s) and set in volume controlled mode (tidal volume 0.8 L, breathing frequency 10 breaths/min). Flow and pressure were measured just before the exhalation valve. At PEEP of 5, 10, and 15 cm H 2 O, the median instantaneous expiratory resistance, the time to valve opening, and the pressure time products above or below the values of PEEP (expressed in cm H 2 O × s) were determined.

Results

Median instantaneous expiratory resistance values differed between the ventilators and PEEP settings with a significant interaction: at PEEP 5 cm H 2 O, the median (interquartile range) expiratory resistance values were 3.9 (3.5-4.7), 3.0 (3.0-3.1), 20.9 (15.8-24.9), 27.4 (26.5-43.2), 13.8 (13.6-13.9), 4.4 (4.0-4.6), and 34.3 (33.7-33.8) cm H 2 O/L/s, for the C5, C6, Carescape, PB980, ServoU, V500, and V680, respectively. For all the PEEP settings, the corresponding times to valve opening were 0.080 (0.077-0.082), 0.082 (0.080-0.085), 0.110 (0.105-0.110), 0.100 (0.085-1.05), 0.072 (0.062-0.072), 0.145 (0.115-0.150), and 0.075 (0.070-0.080) s, respectively, and pressure-time products were 2.8 (2.1-7.4), 6.8 (6.7-7.3), 2.4 (2.1-2.4), 3.5 (2.7-3.6), 1.8 (1.8-2.1), 2.8 (2.7-2.9), and 5.7 (5.4-5.9) cm H 2 O × s, respectively.

Conclusions

The resistance of active expiratory valves differed significantly between the 7 ICU ventilators tested.

### A role for helminth parasites in achieving immunological tolerance in transplantation [^69b6c4bd]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Helminths infect more than a quarter of the world's population. Their success as parasites is the result of active immunomodulation of the host immune response, which can have benefits for the host, particularly in suppressing harmful allergic and autoimmune responses. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that helminth infection reduces the immune response to allograft transplantation.

Methods

C57BL/6 mice were implanted with a subcutaneous minipump that delivered a continuous infusion of secreted products from the model mouse intestinal parasite, Heligmosomoides polygyrus (equivalent to 7 μg of protein per day). Simultaneously, fully allogeneic skin grafts from BALB/c donors were performed. 7 days later, lymphocytes were isolated from allograft draining lymph nodes and analysed by flow cytometry.

Findings

Flow cytometric analysis showed a 41·7% increase in the mean percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (of total CD4 cells) from a baseline of 8·1% (95% CI 7·4-8·8) in untreated mice to 11·5% (8·8-14·2) in the treatment group (p=0·0085). Treatment with parasite products also increased mean expression of the regulatory cell surface receptor PD1 by 62·2% in the effector CD4 T-cell population from a baseline of 7·7% (5·7-9·6) to 12·5% (7·5-17·4) (p=0·03).

Interpretation

The results show that helminth-derived products can powerfully induce regulatory immunological mechanisms in the presence of a fully allogeneic transplant. Identification of the specific mechanisms involved in suppression of allograft rejection by helminth parasites could lead towards development of safe and effective novel therapeutic strategies.

The study STEP 8 was published by Domenica M Rubino and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 8 study, the trial question was: is weekly subcutaneous semaglutide superior to daily liraglutide in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes? In the STEP 8 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STEP 8 study, the population was: 338 patients (265 female, 73 male). The inclusion criteria were non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30, or BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol; history of type 1 or T2DM mellitus; self-reported change in body weight ≥ 5 kg at 90 days of screening. In the STEP 8 study, the interventions were: n=126 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, or 1.7 mg once weekly if not tolerated, for a total of 67 weeks) n=127 liraglutide (initiated at 0.6 mg SC daily and titrated over 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 3 mg daily for a total of 67 weeks). In the STEP 8 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in body weight (15.8% vs. 6.4%; AD 9.4%, 95% CI 6.8 to 12). In the STEP 8 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% (70.9% vs. 25.6%; OR 6.3, 95% CI 3.5 to 11.2) Significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 15% (55.6% vs. 12%; OR 7.9, 95% CI 4.1 to 15.4) Significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 20% (38.5% vs. 6%; OR 8.2, 95% CI 3.5 to 19.1). In the STEP 8 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in gastrointestinal adverse events. In the STEP 8 study, the conclusion was: in non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30, or BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity, semaglutide was superior to liraglutide with respect to reduction in body weight.

Expert Consensus Decision Pathway timeline and scope—The timeline for development is more compressed than a Clinical Practice Guideline, usually in the range of 8 to 12 months, during which time the Work Group tracks emerging evidence and incorporates it into the pathway. Determination of the scope is a critical early step, and the Work Group should keep the scope wide enough to provide guidance on the most important clinical questions yet not so broad as to be unmanageable within the narrow timeframe typically allotted for content development.

### Combination of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic information identifies individuals prone to a progressive increase in left ventricular mass over 5 years [^01d581f4]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

We assessed whether the relationship between electrocardiographic and echocardiographic information on left ventricular hypertrophy predicts the development of left ventricular mass over 5 years.

Methods

Linear regression analyses between various electrocardiographic indices of left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular mass (echocardiography) indexed to height2.7 (LVMI(ht)) was performed in 1488 individuals in each gender subgroup (45-79 years, 841 female, exclusion of intraventricular conduction defects) from the population-based, longitudinal 'Study of Health in Pomerania'. A parameter expressing the difference between observed ECG indices of left ventricular hypertrophy and ECG indices predicted on the basis of echocardiographic readings was calculated in each individual at the baseline visit.

Results

In individuals with complete echocardiographic data at baseline and 5-year-follow-up (n = 1031, exclusion of aortic valve disease), LVMI(ht) at 5-year-follow-up was significantly correlated with the parameter derived from the Cornell product (P < 0.001), the Cornell voltage (P < 0.001), the Gubner-Ungerleider-product (P < 0.001), the Gubner-Ungerleider-voltage (P < 0.001), Lewis voltage (P < 0.001) and aVL voltage (P < 0.001), but not with Sokolow-Lyon-index-derived parameters. LVMI(ht) at baseline did not significantly correlate with any of these ECG-derived parameters. In female individuals with Cornell products higher than expected based on echocardiographic readings, left ventricular mass increased from 162.3 +/- 2.6 g to 180.5 +/- 2.8 g (males: 213.1 +/- 3.7 g to 236.3 +/- 4.2 g), whereas left ventricular mass increased only from 161.8 +/- 2.5 g to 173.5 +/- 2.8 g (males: 209.7 +/- 3.7 g to 215.8 +/- 3.7 g) in individuals with lower than expected Cornell products (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

The relationship of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic information on left ventricular mass may identify individuals at risk for developing progressive increase in left ventricular mass.

### Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) [^0933df30]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3	Recommended Dosage and Dose Administration

Administer OCREVUS under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare professional with access to appropriate medical support to manage severe reactions such as serious infusion reactions.

Initial dose: 300 mg intravenous infusion, followed two weeks later by a second 300 mg intravenous infusion.
Subsequent doses: single 600 mg intravenous infusion every 6 months.
Observe the patient for at least one hour after the completion of the infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

2.4	Delayed or Missed Doses

If a planned infusion of OCREVUS is missed, administer OCREVUS as soon as possible; do not wait until the next scheduled dose. Reset the dose schedule to administer the next sequential dose 6 months after the missed dose is administered. Doses of OCREVUS must be separated by at least 5 months [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] .

2.5	Dose Modifications Because of Infusion Reactions

Dose modifications in response to infusion reactions depends on the severity.

Life-threatening Infusion Reactions

Immediately stop and permanently discontinue OCREVUS if there are signs of a life-threatening or disabling infusion reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Provide appropriate supportive treatment.

Severe Infusion Reactions

Immediately interrupt the infusion and administer appropriate supportive treatment, as necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Restart the infusion only after all symptoms have resolved. When restarting, begin at half of the infusion rate at the time of onset of the infusion reaction. If this rate is tolerated, increase the rate as described in Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . This change in rate will increase the total duration of the infusion but not the total dose.

Mild to Moderate Infusion Reactions

Reduce the infusion rate to half the rate at the onset of the infusion reaction and maintain the reduced rate for at least 30 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . If this rate is tolerated, increase the rate as described in Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . This change in rate will increase the total duration of the infusion but not the total dose.

The study STEP 9 was published by Henning Bliddal and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Knee osteoarthritis. In the STEP 9 study, the trial question was: what is the role of semaglutide in patients with obesity and knee osteoarthritis? In the STEP 9 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 9 study, the population was: 407 patients (332 female, 75 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with obesity and knee osteoarthritis with moderate-to-severe pain. The key exclusion criteria were joint replacement in the target knee; arthroscopy or injections into the target knee in the past 3 months; any other joint disease in the target knee. In the STEP 9 study, the interventions were: n=271 semaglutide (initiated at 0.24 mg SC once weekly, titrated to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, and continued for a total of 68 weeks) n=136 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 68 weeks). In the STEP 9 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean reduction in body weight at week 68 (13.7% vs. 3.2%; ARD 10.5, 95% CI 8.6 to 12.3). In the STEP 9 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mean reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score at week 68 (41.7 points vs. 27.5 points; AD 14.1 points, 95% CI 8.3 to 20) Significant increase in improvement in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical-function score at week 68 (12 points vs. 6.5 points; AD 5.6 points, 95% CI 3.1 to 8) Significant increase in mean reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index physical function score at week 68 (41.5 points vs. 26.7 points; AD 14.9 points, 95% CI 9.3 to 20.4). In the STEP 9 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the STEP 9 study, the conclusion was: in patients with obesity and knee osteoarthritis with moderate-to-severe pain, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to mean reduction in body weight at week 68.

Boil water advisory—household water preparation and disinfection steps include boiling instructions and bleach-based alternatives when boiling is not possible. For boiling, "Once the water reaches a rolling boil, let it boil for 1 minute." If you are unable to boil, the document states to "disinfect it instead" and to "Use unscented bleach (bleach that does not have an added scent)." For clear tap water, add "1/8 teaspoon (8 drops or about 0.75 milliliters)" of unscented household liquid bleach to "1 gallon (16 cups)" of water and "Mix well and wait 30 minutes or more before drinking." For cloudy water, first "Filter water using clean cloth," then add "1/4 teaspoon (16 drops or 1.5 milliliters)" per "1 gallon (16 cups)" and again "Mix well and wait 30 minutes or more before drinking." For container sanitation, make a sanitizing solution by mixing "1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of unscented household liquid bleach in 1 quart (32 ounces, 4 cups, or about 1 liter) of water" and "Pour this sanitizing solution into a clean storage container and shake well, making sure that the solution coats the entire inside of the container."

### Enhancing the value of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies by identifying patients most likely to benefit. A consensus statement from the National Lipid Association [^71b52af0]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness modeling and assumptions—Event-rate and NNT estimates were derived by considering patient subgroups and limiting the horizon of benefit to 5 years with a focus on “hard” ASCVD events; examples referenced specific 10-year absolute risk levels (eg, 45%, 30%, and 20%). Annualized placebo event rates were extrapolated to 10-year risk consistent with linear rates over 5 to 7 years, while NNT benefits were calculated for a 5-year time period. Higher ASCVD risk and greater LDL-C–lowering efficacy are anticipated to yield lower NNTs, and conservative ICER-based modeling indicated reasonable to high value at approximately $5400/y.

Table 2 
Key stakeholders involved in introducing diagnostic products to low-resource settings

Market research is conducted to better understand the projected growth, size and share of the market(s) in which the product will be sold, how the product will be distributed to the end user, customer needs and preferences and the product’s competitive advantage.These activities inform others, such as development of the marketing plan, user-requirements document and the business case. The business case provides evidence to justify the need for the new diagnostic product and why pursuing its development will be a viable business opportunity. Developers also prepare a financial model that provides details around the initial investment cost, projected sales, payback period and breakeven point and other investment performance considerations, such as whether the efforts of developers, are likely to yield an acceptable return on investment. Typically, the business case and financial model are updated throughout the development process as more information becomes available and the decision to continue with development is re-evaluated at the end of each development phase.
