## Question

In dermatology, what is the most likely root cause of a wrong-site surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what is the most likely root cause of wrong-site surgery in dermatology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how dermatologic surgery workflow differs from other surgical fields and why that might predispose to site misidentification. Then, I should quantify the frequency and nature of biopsy site identification failures in real-world dermatologic surgery settings. Next, I will examine specific modifiable risk factors — especially documentation quality and photography — and their measured effect sizes. After that, I need to compare dermatology-specific drivers with the broader surgical literature that emphasizes communication failures, to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. Finally, I'll synthesize an ultimate root cause and cross-check it against consensus recommendations and near-miss data to make sure the conclusion is both accurate and actionable [^11452LCu] [^112ZNtu7] [^1134Uzn9] [^112MMVbu].

> Let me first confirm the workflow vulnerability unique to dermatologic surgery. Unlike surgeries performed immediately after diagnosis, many cutaneous cancers are biopsied in one encounter and definitively excised weeks to months later — often by a different surgeon — so the index lesion may have healed and become visually ambiguous, especially on the head and neck where landmarks are complex and patients often cannot directly visualize the site; this temporal separation creates an identification hazard that is repeatedly highlighted in the dermatology literature and amplified by obscured landmarks in pandemic-era masking scenarios [^11452LCu] [^112UFq3Q].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of the identification problem before I draw conclusions. Prospective data show that roughly 9% of patients presenting for Mohs are unable to identify their surgical site at the day of treatment, and surveys indicate that most Mohs surgeons report that more than 5% of their patients struggle with localization; importantly, even when photographs are available, near-miss wrong-site events can still occur, implying a baseline error pressure that would likely be higher in the absence of photography [^11452LCu] [^112ZNtu7] [^1121L62N].

> I should now examine specific risk factors and their effect sizes. Hold on, I should verify the odds ratios carefully: a delay of six weeks or more between biopsy and surgery increases both patient and physician misidentification, inability of the patient to see the site markedly raises risk, and multiple concurrent biopsy sites further confound localization; critically, absence of a biopsy-site photograph is strongly associated with postponement of surgery, suggesting that photographs are operationally pivotal to avoid decisional uncertainty on the day of surgery [^1121L62N].

> Next, I need to check the quality and availability of documentation arriving to the operating dermatologist. Let me think about this: only a small fraction of chart notes contain photographs and less than a quarter have high-quality diagrams in prospective series, academic and multispecialty settings are more likely than private practice to transmit photographs, and a large majority of Mohs surgeons consider a photograph the most useful tool; I should double-check the timing effect — one study suggested longer delays trended toward more difficulty without reaching significance at greater than three months, likely due to sample size limitations, which doesn't negate the stronger six-week risk signal seen elsewhere [^11452LCu] [^112ZNtu7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions by importing assumptions from general surgery without corroboration. I initially assumed, based on broader surgical safety literature, that communication breakdown would be the primary root cause as it often is for wrong-site events across disciplines; but wait, when I reconsider the dermatology-specific data, the fundamental problem is frequently more proximal: the site cannot be confidently identified at all, which precedes and arguably eclipses downstream communication failures as the dominant precipitant in cutaneous surgery wrong-site risk [^1134Uzn9] [^111MJeto] [^1128nxAH] [^11452LCu] [^112MMVbu].

> I will now synthesize the most plausible root cause from a systems perspective at the biopsy point-of-care. Let me first confirm consensus guidance and observational signals: the strongest modifiable driver is failure to obtain and transmit high-quality, landmark-anchored biopsy-site photography at the time of initial diagnosis, compounded by inconsistent mapping/measurements, time-dependent scar remodeling and memory decay, and gaps at the referral interface; expert Delphi consensus and cohort data converge on multidisciplinary behaviors that prioritize standardized photography and documentation as the keystone mitigation [^112YN65L] [^1121L62N] [^112MMVbu].

> But wait, what if photography alone is imperfect? I need to ensure the mitigation bundle is comprehensive. Near-miss analyses emphasize that photographs must include fixed anatomic landmarks, be taken without obstructions like face masks over facial landmarks, and be complemented by measured distances from stable reference points, patient verification with a mirror or patient-taken "selfie" when needed, and escalation to the referring clinician if any residual ambiguity persists; protocolized preoperative verification in dermatologic offices has been associated with zero wrong-site cases over thousands of encounters, although failures to identify still occurred when documentation was inadequate, reinforcing the centrality of high-quality site capture at biopsy [^112UFq3Q] [^117P6GJW] [^1115NyjT].

> Next, I should review how this dermatology-specific root cause aligns with or diverges from checklist-based safety frameworks. Hmm, wait a minute, the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist and Universal Protocol improve safety culture and reduce some complications, but their effectiveness for preventing rare wrong-site events is inconsistent, and checklists cannot substitute for absent primary information about where to operate; in cutaneous surgery, the upstream availability of definitive site documentation is the gating factor upon which later checklist steps depend, so checklists should be viewed as necessary but insufficient without robust biopsy-site capture [^112EwnfG] [^1159GHyE] [^111MJeto] [^1115NyjT].

> Let me reconsider competing explanations one more time to avoid premature closure. Communication errors undeniably contribute across surgery, but in dermatology the most consistent, high-leverage, and modifiable root cause is a documentation failure at the time of biopsy — specifically, not obtaining and transmitting high-quality, landmark-inclusive photographs — after which delays, multiple sites, and limited patient visualization compound the identification deficit over time; exceptions exist when surgery is immediate or single-site and clearly visible, in which case general communication factors may predominate, but the weight of dermatology-specific evidence supports photography-driven documentation as the primary root cause to address [^1121L62N] [^11452LCu] [^112ZNtu7] [^112MMVbu].

---

The likely root cause of wrong-site surgery in dermatology is **inadequate documentation and communication of the biopsy site** [^112MMVbu], especially when initial site photography is missing or obscured [^112ZNtu7] [^112UFq3Q], and when there is a long delay between biopsy and definitive surgery [^1121L62N]. Additional contributors include patient inability to visualize the site [^11452LCu], multiple biopsy sites [^1121L62N], and reliance on patient recall without objective confirmation [^112YN65L]. These factors are preventable with **standardized site photography** [^112YN65L], clear documentation [^112MMVbu], and strict adherence to verification protocols [^1134Uzn9] [^112EwnfG].

## Contributing factors to wrong-site surgery in dermatology

Key factors **contributing to wrong-site surgery** in dermatology include:

- **Inadequate documentation**: Poor or missing documentation of the biopsy site [^1121L62N], including lack of photographs [^112ZNtu7] or detailed descriptions, significantly increases the risk of wrong-site surgery [^112MMVbu].

- **Communication breakdowns**: Miscommunication between healthcare providers [^1134Uzn9], patients, and staff can lead to confusion regarding the correct surgical site [^112okYmi].

- **Patient-related factors**: Patients' inability to visualize or recall the biopsy site accurately [^1121L62N], especially when the site is not visible to them [^112UFq3Q], contributes to misidentification [^11452LCu].

- **Multiple biopsy sites**: Performing biopsies at multiple sites [^1121L62N] without clear documentation increases the likelihood of confusion and errors [^112YN65L].

- **Delays between biopsy and surgery**: Longer intervals between the initial biopsy and definitive surgery [^1121L62N] make it more difficult to accurately identify the correct site [^11452LCu].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Clinical studies highlight the **importance of accurate documentation and communication** in preventing wrong-site surgery:

- **Absence of site photos increases risk**: A prospective observational cohort study found that the absence of biopsy site photographs [^1121L62N] significantly increased the risk of postponed surgeries and decreased patient confidence in site identification.

- **Photographs aid localization**: A survey of Mohs surgeons revealed that difficulty identifying biopsy sites is a common challenge [^112ZNtu7], with photographs being the most useful documentation for site localization [^112MMVbu].

- **Visibility and documentation quality drive identification**: A prospective study on Mohs cases found that patients' inability to identify their surgical sites [^11452LCu] was significantly associated with the site's visibility and the quality of documentation [^112UFq3Q].

---

## Preventive measures

To **prevent wrong-site surgery** in dermatology, recommended measures include:

- **Standardized documentation**: Implementing standardized protocols for documenting biopsy sites [^112YN65L], including detailed descriptions and photographs [^112ZNtu7], is essential [^1121L62N] [^112MMVbu].

- **Clear communication**: Ensuring clear communication among healthcare providers [^1134Uzn9], patients, and staff regarding the surgical site [^112EwnfG].

- **Patient involvement**: Actively involving patients [^1121L62N] in site identification, including providing them with photographs and clear instructions [^112YN65L], can improve accuracy [^112UFq3Q].

- **Verification protocols**: Strict adherence to verification protocols [^1134Uzn9], such as the Universal Protocol and surgical safety checklists, can reduce errors [^111MJeto].

---

The primary root cause of wrong-site surgery in dermatology is **inadequate documentation and communication of the biopsy site**. This issue is preventable through standardized documentation, clear communication, patient involvement, and adherence to verification protocols.

### Site identification challenges in dermatologic surgery: A physician survey [^112ZNtu7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Previous single-institution studies have shown that patients and physicians struggle to identify biopsy sites requiring surgery on the day of treatment. At the time of writing, no studies have been done to assess if this is a widespread challenge faced by many dermatologic surgeons.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine if site identification is an issue among Mohs surgeons and to identify which practice environments have the best supplementary data available to surgeons for site localization.

- **Methods**: We conducted an online survey of 722 members of the American College of Mohs Surgery inquiring about site identification and documentation typically received from referring physicians.

- **Results**: Of 325 surveys completed (45% response rate), 71% reported that more than 5% of their patients have difficulty identifying their surgery site. The majority (89%) responded that a photograph is most useful for identifying biopsy sites. Surgeons in academic centers and multispecialty group practices were more likely to receive a photograph compared to those in private practice.

- **Limitations**: Individual survey responses may be subject to recall bias.

- **Conclusion**: Difficulty identifying biopsy sites needing surgery is a common challenge faced by Mohs surgeons. The majority of Mohs surgeons surveyed find photographs the most useful documentation for decreasing the risk of wrong-site dermatologic surgery.

### Difficulty with surgical site identification: What role does it play in dermatology [^11452LCu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

The potential for wrong-site surgery is a growing concern in dermatology.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of difficulty with surgical site identification and possible confounding factors.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective study on 333 Mohs cases performed between April 1, 2009, and February 9, 2010. Data collection forms were used on the day of surgery to record the difficulty associated with surgical site identification and potential confounding factors.

- **Results**: Of the 333 patients evaluated, 9% were unable to identify their surgical sites. The majority of cases (88.5%) were located on the head and neck. When comparing patients who were able to identify their site and those who were not, there was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.035) in the percentage of lesions residing in a location visible to the patient. Those who were able to see their biopsy sites were 3.5 times more likely to identify their surgical site. Of the 47.6% of patients with chart notes, only 5% of these cases were photographs and 23% had high-quality diagrams. Although a delay in treatment of greater than 3 months from the original biopsy site was higher among those with difficulty in identifying their surgical site, this was not found to be statistically significant.

- **Limitations**: We believe our sample size was not large enough to show a significant link between difficulty with surgical site identification and several likely confounding factors.

- **Conclusion**: We have shown that at least 9% of patients presenting for Mohs micrographic surgery are not able to identify their surgical site.

### Factors associated with biopsy site identification, postponement of surgery, and patient confidence in a dermatologic surgery practice [^1121L62N]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Biopsy site identification is critical to avoid wrong-site surgery and may impact patient-centered outcomes. We sought to evaluate risk factors for biopsy site misidentification, postponement of surgery, and patient confidence in surgical site selection and to assess the near-miss rate for wrong-site surgeries.

This was a prospective observational cohort study. Near-miss wrong-site surgeries were detected and averted in 1.3% (3 of 239) of patients with biopsy site photographs.

- **Risk factors for biopsy site misidentification by patients**: 6 weeks or longer between biopsy and surgery (odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–4.27; p = 0.028) and patient inability to see biopsy site (OR 3.95, 95% CI 1.50–10.37; p = 0.002).

- **Risk factors for physician misidentification**: 6 or more weeks between biopsy and surgery (OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.40–9.66; p = 0.007) and biopsy specimens from multiple sites (OR 4.39, 95% CI 1.67–11.54; p = 0.003).

- **Postponement of surgery**: Associated with absence of a biopsy site photograph (OR 12.5, 95% CI 2.79–62.21; P < .001).

- **Patient confidence in surgical site identification**: Associated with the presence of a biopsy site photograph (OR 5.48, 95% CI 1.96–15.30; p = 0.001).

This was a single-site observational study. Biopsy site photography is associated with reduced rates of postponed surgeries and improved rates of patient confidence in surgical site selection. Risk factors for biopsy site misidentification should be considered before definitive treatment.

Wrong site surgery is a serious safety event that can result in temporary or even permanent harm. Various safety checklists and procedures have been added to our standard work in the operating room, but errors still get through our safety nets and patients are harmed. In this case report, we describe a wrong site frenulectomy in a child and discuss the root cause analysis of this error, along with SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, timed) preventative actions that could be implemented to prevent a recurrence.

### 2015 Arte poster competition first place winner: Assessing the correlation between patient anxiety and satisfaction for Mohs surgery [^113Aj8jh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Skin cancer and the surgical treatment thereof have the potential to be sources of great anxiety for patients. Examination of patient satisfaction, anxiety, and contributing factors has the potential to provide information surgeons can use to implement practices that have an impact on patient anxiety and satisfaction regarding dermatologic surgery. This study used a prospective interview to catalog patients' anxiety and experiences before and during the surgical process. Our results indicate that several pre- and perioperative factors have the potential to decrease a patient's overall anxiety.

Notably, 33% of surgical patients reported a decrease in anxiety from the time of diagnosis until the day of surgery. Factors that contributed to this included a call discussing the diagnosis and what to expect on the day of surgery as well as reading written material or searching the internet for more information regarding the procedure. Furthermore, a call from the physician compared to a call from a nurse or other team member showed a greater effect on decreasing anxiety.

During the surgical procedure, our results highlight several factors that can decrease a patient's anxiety. Most notably, eating, watching TV, bringing a guest, and engaging in small talk with the surgeon and staff during the procedure subjectively decreased patients' anxiety. In summary, our results suggest that patients respond to a variety of factors to reduce anxiety and that each patient derives relief from anxiety in different manners. Therefore, offering a spectrum of comforting or distracting activities during dermatologic surgery might be beneficial.

### Avoiding wrong-site surgery in the era of Covid-19 and face masks [^117P6GJW]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Herein represents a case of a "near miss". Even without face masks, biopsy site identification can present a challenge for providers, especially when photographs are poorly lit, taken without fixed anatomic landmarks, or not taken at all. Risk factors associated with wrong-site surgery include, but are not limited to, the following factors: miscommunication between members of a team, lack of established safety protocols, poor description of the surgical site, dependence on a single provider to correctly identify the site, and misinterpreted preoperative photography. Solutions for avoidance of wrong-site surgeries have been cited in the literature and include the following: recording measurements from fixed anatomic landmarks, asking the patient to confirm the biopsy site with a mirror, using photography and descriptive biopsy site documentation, asking the patient to take a biopsy site "selfie" if a photograph was not originally taken, and obtaining input and verification from family members. Finally, as in our case, if the biopsy site remains unidentifiable, the referring physician should be consulted.

When face masks are worn by patients, the authors recommend the following actions to help mitigate the potential risk for wrong-site surgeries: when possible, photos of biopsy sites should be taken with the face mask lowered, exposing the nasal ala and distal nasal tip for orientation. When this is not possible, coordinated measurements should be obtained and recorded from stable structures such as the tragus, medial canthus, or medial aspect of the eyebrow with the patient.

### Postoperative adverse events inconsistently improved by the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist: A systematic literature review of 25 studies [^117JZLzn]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials were assessed using the Cochrane RevMan Risk of Bias tool. Non-randomized controlled trials were assessed using a modified version of the previously validated Methodological Index for Non-Randomised Studies (MINORS). The original 12-item index had two items, six and seven, removed by the authors. A similar modification has previously been reported. These items relate to an adequate duration of follow-up after the implementation of the checklist.

There is currently no consensus about the most appropriate duration of follow-up. There may be an increased emphasis on surgical safety and higher levels of compliance with checklist use early after the intervention, resulting in falsely encouraging outcomes in studies with short follow-up periods. Alternatively, the checklist-induced cultural change may take time to develop, thus studies with a short follow-up period may not show the full effects of the checklist's use. As such, an appropriate length of follow-up could not be defined.

### Prevalence of wound complications following Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS): a cross-sectional study of 1000 patients undergoing MMS and wound repair in a UK teaching hospital [^111e1wJ3]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Personalized medicine/surgery refers to the process of predicting, preventing, and treating a patient based on that individual's specific needs rather than on a population average. Given that MMS has such high cure rates, the application of personalized healthcare within the MMS arena is suited to predicting postoperative complications that require clinical management, thereby allowing postoperative reviews to be tailored to an individual. In our study, patients who developed an intermediate or major complication required a clinical intervention, suggesting that this cohort of patients may require greater postoperative monitoring.

Despite this being a single-centre retrospective study, we were able to create a robust database containing multiple data points per patient/lesion, enabling us to perform an analysis that not only took account of clustering by patient but also ascertained the risk of complication per basal cell carcinoma (BCC). After adjusting for confounders and mediators, we found that there was an increased risk of developing a complication necessitating a clinical intervention if the patient received a graft or had surgery on the forehead. An increased risk of complications from surgery on the nose was also observed after adjusting for confounders but not mediators, suggesting that the increased risk of complications in this location was more likely due to the type of repair being performed rather than the anatomical location. However, the increased risk of complications for MMS performed on the forehead persisted after adjusting for the repair method.

### No surgical innovation without evaluation: The IDEAL recommendations [^11343w5r]. Lancet (2009). Low credibility.

Surgery and other invasive therapies are complex interventions, challenged by factors dependent on the operator, team, and setting, such as learning curves, quality variations, and perception of equipoise. We propose recommendations for the assessment of surgery, based on a five-stage description of the surgical development process. We also encourage the widespread use of prospective databases and registries. Reports of new techniques should be registered as a professional duty, anonymously if necessary when outcomes are adverse. Case series studies should be replaced by prospective development studies for early technical modifications, and by prospective research databases for later pre-trial evaluation. Protocols for these studies should be registered publicly.

Statistical process control techniques can be useful in both early and late assessment. Randomised trials should be used whenever possible to investigate efficacy, but adequate pre-trial data are essential to allow power calculations, clarify the definition and indications of the intervention, and develop quality measures. Difficulties in conducting randomised clinical trials should be addressed by measures to evaluate learning curves and alleviate equipoise problems.

Alternative prospective designs, such as interrupted time series studies, should be used when randomised trials are not feasible. Established procedures should be monitored with prospective databases to analyze outcome variations and identify late and rare events. Achievement of improved design, conduct, and reporting of surgical innovations is crucial.

### Interventions for reducing wrong-site surgery and invasive clinical procedures [^114jntbW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Specific clinical interventions are needed to reduce wrong-site surgery, which is a rare but potentially disastrous clinical error. Risk factors contributing to wrong-site surgery are variable and complex. The introduction of organizational and professional clinical strategies plays a role in minimizing wrong-site surgery.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of organizational and professional interventions for reducing wrong-site surgery. This includes wrong-side, wrong-procedure, and wrong-patient surgery, as well as non-surgical invasive clinical procedures such as regional blocks, dermatological, obstetric, and dental procedures, and emergency surgical procedures not undertaken within the operating theatre.

- **Search methods**: For this update, we searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register (January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2014), MEDLINE (June 2011 to January 2014), EMBASE (June 2011 to January 2014), CINAHL (June 2011 to January 2014), Dissertations and Theses (June 2011 to January 2014), African Index Medicus, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences database, Virtual Health Library, Pan American Health Organization Database, and the World Health Organization Library Information System. Database searches were conducted in January 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials, and controlled before-after studies (CBAs) with at least two interventions.

### Avoiding wrong-site surgery in the era of COVID-19 and face masks [^112UFq3Q]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

As COVID-19 and its variants persist, universal pandemic precautions remain in place to protect both patients and healthcare personnel. With the implementation of these necessary precautions, dermatologic surgeons now face the challenge of biopsy site identification using photographs of patients wearing face masks. When worn properly, face masks conceal anatomical landmarks, thereby increasing the risk of wrong-site surgery. Herein, we describe a "near miss" case involving a patient presenting for Mohs micrographic surgery, who had biopsy site photographs taken while wearing a face mask.

### Quality of reporting in systematic reviews of adverse events: Systematic review [^1174U31s]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the quality of reporting of harms in systematic reviews and determine the need for a reporting guideline specific to reviews of harms.

- **Design**: Systematic review.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE).

- **Review methods**: Databases were searched for systematic reviews with an adverse event as the main outcome, published between January 2008 and April 2011. Adverse events included adverse reactions, harms, or complications associated with any healthcare intervention. Articles with a primary aim to investigate the complete safety profile of an intervention were also included. A list of 37 items was developed to measure the quality of reporting on harms in each review; data were collected as dichotomous outcomes ("yes" or "no" for each item).

- **Results**: Of the 4644 reviews identified, 309 were systematic reviews or meta-analyses primarily assessing harms (13 from CDSR; 296 from DARE). The comparison between the years 2008 and 2010–2011 showed no difference in the quality of reporting over time (P = 0.079). Titles in fewer than half the reviews (proportion of reviews 0.46 (95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.52)) did not mention any harm-related terms. Almost one-third of DARE reviews (0.26 (0.22 to 0.31)) did not clearly define the adverse events reviewed, nor did they specify the study designs selected for inclusion in their methods section. Almost half of the reviews (n = 170) did not consider patient risk factors or length of follow-up when reviewing harms.

### Surgical site infections: epidemiology, microbiology and prevention [^114wN9BA]. The Journal of Hospital Infection (2008). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on surgical site infection:

- **Definition**: SSI is an infection that develops within 30 days after surgery, or within one year if an implant is involved, impacting either the incision or the deeper tissues at the surgical site.

- **Pathophysiology**: SSIs result from the contamination of the surgical site with microorganisms, which can occur during the procedure or postoperatively. The pathogens responsible vary by surgery type, with the most commonly isolated organisms including S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus species, and E. coli.

- **Epidemiology**: SSIs are estimated to occur in 2–4% of inpatient surgical procedures in the US, accounting for 20–31% of all hospital-acquired infections.

- **Risk factors**: Numerous patient-related and procedure-related factors influence the risk of SSI.
	- **Patient-related factors**: Longer hospital stay, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
	- **Additional patient-related factors**: Neurologic diseases, tobacco use, alcohol use, depression, dementia, anemia, HIV/AIDS, hypoalbuminemia, postoperative hyperglycemia
	- **Procedure-related factors**: Use of immunosuppressive agents

- **Disease course**: SSI typically presents with signs of inflammation such as localized redness, warmth, swelling, and pain at the incision site. Fever and purulent discharge may also be present. In severe cases, SSI can lead to wound dehiscence or abscess formation.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: SSI can lead to significant morbidity, prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and in severe cases, can be life-threatening. SSIs are associated with significant morbidity and healthcare burdens.

### A multistep approach to improving biopsy site identification in dermatology: physician, staff, and patient roles based on a Delphi consensus [^112YN65L]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Excisional skin cancer surgery is a common procedure, yet there is no formal consensus for mitigating the risk of wrong-site cutaneous surgery. This study aims to systematically consider the usefulness and feasibility of proposed methods for correct biopsy site identification in dermatology.

The evidence review involved a survey study with a formal consensus process. Item development was conducted via a literature review and expert interviews, followed by two stages of a Delphi process to develop consensus recommendations.

A total of 2,323 articles were reviewed in the literature search, with data extraction from 14. Twenty-five experts participated in 30-minute structured interviews, which were transcribed and coded. The resulting survey included 42 proposed interventions by multiple stakeholders, including biopsying physicians, operating physicians, nurses, ancillary staff, patients, caregivers, and family members, at three time points: the day of biopsy, the delay and consultation period, and the day of definitive surgery. Two rounds of a Delphi process with 59 experts (25 academic and 34 private practice) scored the survey. Strong consensus was obtained on 14 behaviors, and moderate consensus was obtained on 21 other behaviors. Additionally, a two-state simultaneous algorithm was developed to model surgeon behavior on the day of definitive surgery based on surgeon and patient perceptions.

When definitive surgery is performed after the initial biopsy and by a different surgeon, procedures can be implemented at several time points to increase the likelihood of correct site identification.

### Management of surgical site infections [^117H2sAV]. AAOS (2018). High credibility.

In the context of surgical site infections, particularly for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, the AAOS 2018 guidelines indicate that several factors are associated with an increased risk of infection:

- **Longer hospital stay**: Extended hospitalization is linked to a higher incidence of infections.
- **Obesity**: Excess body weight can complicate surgery and recovery.
- **Alcohol abuse**: Habitual alcohol misuse may impair immune function.
- **Depression**: This mental health condition can negatively impact recovery.
- **Dementia**: Cognitive impairments may lead to increased risk.
- **Anemia**: Reduced red blood cell count can affect healing.
- **Congestive heart failure (HF)**: Heart conditions may complicate surgical outcomes.
- **Immunosuppressive agents**: Medications that suppress the immune system can elevate infection risk.
- **HIV/AIDS**: These conditions are associated with immune system compromise.

### Effect of using a safety checklist on patient complications after surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159GHyE]. Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Previous before-and-after studies indicate that the use of safety checklists in surgery reduces complication rates in patients.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of studies was undertaken using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Proquest, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies that evaluated the effects of checklist use in surgery on complication rates. Study quality was assessed using the Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies. The pooled risk ratio (RR) was estimated using both fixed and random effects models. For each outcome, the number needed to treat (NNT) and the absolute risk reduction (ARR) were also computed.

- **Results**: Of the 207 intervention studies identified, 7 representing 37,339 patients were included in meta-analyses, and all were cohort studies. Results indicated that the use of checklists in surgery compared with standard practice led to a reduction in any complication (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.72; P < 0.0001; ARR, 3.7%; NNT, 27) and wound infection (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.72; P = 0.0001; ARR, 2.9%; NNT, 34) and also reduction in blood loss (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70; P = 0.0001; ARR, 3.8%; NNT, 33). There were no significant reductions in mortality (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.11; P = 0.191; ARR, 0.44%; NNT, 229), pneumonia (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.4; P = 0.857; ARR, 0.04%; NNT, 2,512), or unplanned return to the operating room (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.02; P = 0.068; ARR, 0.52%; NNT, 192).

- **Conclusion**: Notwithstanding the lack of randomized controlled trials, synthesis of the existing body of evidence suggests a relationship between checklist use and reduced surgical complications.

### Wrong-site craniotomy: Analysis of 35 cases and systems for prevention [^115x1r34]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this case review was to identify and analyze existing wrong-site craniotomy (WSC) cases to determine the factors that contributed to the errors and to suggest preventative strategies for WSC. Wrong-site surgery (WSS) is a devastating surgical error that has gained increased public attention in recent years due to some high-profile cases. Despite the implementation of preventative methods such as preoperative checklists and surgical time-outs, WSS still occurs to this day. The clinical consequences of WSC are distinct compared with other types of WSS due to the unique function of the brain.

The authors searched medical, legal, and media databases and contacted state medical licensing boards to identify and gather information about WSC cases. The cases were reviewed and analyzed for factors that contributed to the errors.

- **Results**: Four major categories of contributing factors were found: 1) communication breakdown; 2) inadequate preoperative checks; 3) technical factors and imaging; and 4) human error. The WSC cases are used to illustrate how these types of factors can precipitate the surgical error. Clinical outcomes and disciplinary actions are summarized. Obtaining information about the cases discovered was very challenging, in part because WSS reporting is inadequate.

- **Conclusions**: This case review demonstrates that a broad range of events and factors can cause human errors to breach patient safeguards and lead to a WSC; however, in essentially all cases, the WSCs were preventable with strict adherence to comprehensive and thorough protocols.

### A prospective study of the incidence of complications associated with dermatological surgery [^1148Ric3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Dermatological surgery is a relatively new and expanding subspecialty within dermatology. Little information is available about complications in this kind of surgery in the European setting.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of anaesthetic, haemorrhagic, and infectious complications in dermatological surgery and to highlight the factors associated with these complications.

- **Methods**: Data were collected prospectively over a 3-month period for all surgical procedures performed by a network of dermatologists (n = 84 dermatologists) in France, including the excision of all benign or malignant tumors but excluding sebaceous cysts and pyodermas. Information was collected regarding dermatologists, patients, procedures, and complications.

- **Results**: A total of 3,788 surgical procedures were available for review; 236 complications, mostly minor, occurred in a total of 213 surgical procedures (6%), with bleeding being the most common (3%). Vaso-vagal syncope was the main anaesthetic complication (51 of 54). Infectious complications occurred in 79 patients (2%). Superficial suppuration accounted for 92% of surgical site infections. Only one patient had a systemic infection. Complications requiring additional antibiotic treatment or repeat surgery accounted for only 22 cases of 3,788 (1%). No statistically significant correlation was found with the characteristics of the dermatologists, especially with respect to their training or amount of surgical experience. Similarly, no link could be established between complications and surgical conditions.

### Avoiding wrong-site surgery in the era of COVID-19 and face masks [^111wAewR]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old man presented to his dermatologist for a spot of concern on his right nasal sidewall. Physical examination revealed a 3-mm pink papule in that location. A gentian violet marker was used to mark the biopsy site, and a photograph was obtained with the patient's face mask in place (see Figure 1). Pathology revealed a basal cell carcinoma, and the patient was scheduled for Mohs micrographic surgery.

Four weeks later, the patient presented to the dermatologic surgeon for definitive treatment. The presumed biopsy site was initially marked by a member of the surgical team (see Figure 2). Prior to administering anesthesia, photographs from the initial biopsy were printed and utilized by the surgeon to identify the biopsy site. The photograph captured the initial biopsy site of the right nasal sidewall; however, the patient's face mask obscured all anatomic landmarks.

The Mohs surgeon noted a pink scar inferomedial to the initially marked site, and the referring dermatologist was called to the surgery suite for confirmation. The patient and providers agreed that the biopsy site was indeed inferomedial to the initially marked site. Additionally, the patient confirmed the biopsy site using a handheld mirror and then underwent Mohs micrographic surgery.

- **Figure 1**: The biopsy site of the right nasal sidewall marked with gentian violet at the initial visit to the referring dermatologist. The patient was photographed while wearing his face mask, and the biopsy site photograph was uploaded directly to the electronic medical record.
- **Figure 2**: Four weeks later, the patient arrives for the definitive treatment.

- **Step 9**: Gently pinch and hold a fold of skin where you cleaned the injection site with one hand. With the other hand, insert the needle into your skin at about a 45-degree angle. Push the needle all the way in to make sure that you inject your full dose. Then gently let go of your skin. Ensure the needle is in place (see Figure F).

- **Step 10**: Firmly push the plunger head all the way down until all the medicine is injected (see Figure G). All the medicine is injected when you cannot push the plunger head any further (see Figure H).

- **Step 11**: Lift your thumb off the plunger head (see Figure I). The needle will automatically move back in and lock in place. Press a clean cotton ball or gauze pad over the injection site for a few seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You may see slight bleeding or a drop of liquid; this is normal. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if needed.

- **Step 12**: Dispose of the used BIMZELX prefilled syringe (see Figure J). Put the used BIMZELX prefilled syringe in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away the BIMZELX prefilled syringe in your household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is made of heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid without sharps being able to come out, is upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full…

### Surgical checklists: A systematic review of impacts and implementation [^111MJeto]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Low credibility.

We identified four sites describing checklists based on the Joint Commission's Universal Protocol (UP). The Swiss study focused on verifying patient identity and surgical site. Compared with the first three months of implementation, the next three months saw better compliance in checking patient identity and the proportion of surgical site checks performed. Barriers to implementation included surgeons saying they already knew the patients or the surgical site was obvious, and the failure to include the input of all surgical services in developing the protocol.

- **Studies of wrong-site-surgery checklists**:

	- The Swedish study involved two hospitals, each of which had a recent wrong-site surgery incident, and a root-cause analysis suggested that a time-out procedure might help. A time-out checklist was implemented, and one year later, a questionnaire showed that 93% of team members believed the checklist contributed to patient safety.

	- The English study was conducted at a children's hospital where staff had incorporated an eight-item correct-site surgery checklist into an existing surgical checklist. Comparing 2008 with 2006, correct completion was improved for four of the eight checklist items.

	- The North Carolina study implemented a checklist to prevent wrong-site surgery that was tailored to the hospital's preferences and procedures. Staff commented favorably that they no longer had to remember everything on a cumbersome form.

No implementation advice was found on the Joint Commission website or in other published documents.

### Postoperative adverse events inconsistently improved by the World Health Organization surgical safety checklist: A systematic literature review of 25 studies [^112RyBhD]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

One in 25 people undergo a surgical procedure every year. Surgery is intended to save lives, but unsafe surgical care can cause substantial harm; complications after inpatient operations occur in 25% of patients, and the reported crude mortality rate after major surgery is 0.5–5%. At least half of the cases in which surgery leads to harm are considered preventable. Most surgical errors are caused by failures of non-technical skills, such as communication, leadership, and teamwork.

In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a surgical safety checklist (SSC) in an attempt to minimize surgical adverse events. The three-phase, 19-item checklist comprises various perioperative items directly targeted to assure the execution of specific safety measures.

- **Direct factors**: Ensuring timely administration of prophylactic antibiotics may result in decreased rates of postoperative infections.
- **Indirect factors**: The checklist is reported to increase the 'safety culture' in operating theatres and thus decrease non-technical surgical errors, resulting in a positive effect on all postoperative adverse events.

The checklist has been implemented as a standard of care in thousands of operating rooms worldwide, as it is relatively easy to implement and unlikely to cause harm. However, there is emerging evidence that for the checklist to be effective, it requires a deliberate implementation process, continual monitoring, and learning within frontline teams.

### Two cases of a wrong-site peripheral nerve block and a process to prevent this complication [^114y2jgT]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to develop a system to prevent laterality errors while performing peripheral nerve blockade.

The report depicts two cases of peripheral nerve blocks being performed on the wrong (nonoperative) extremity. An analysis of the circumstances in each case reveals distractions, schedule changes, and communication breakdown, which contributed to the error. A protocol to prevent these errors from occurring in the future is developed and discussed, based on the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations guidelines, to eliminate "wrong-site" surgical procedures.

The anesthesiologist plays an important role in preventing wrong-site peripheral nerve blockade and surgery. The protocol developed for "Pre-Anesthetic Site Verification" as a supplement to our preoperative site verification policy is invaluable in preventing wrong-site anesthesia and surgery.

### Wrong-side thoracentesis: Lessons learned from root cause analysis [^112okYmi]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the recognized value of the Joint Commission's Universal Protocol and the implementation of time-outs, incorrect surgical procedures are still among the most common types of sentinel events and can have fatal consequences.

- **Objectives**: To examine a root cause analysis database for reported wrong-side thoracenteses and to determine the contributing factors associated with their occurrence.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: We searched the National Center for Patient Safety database for wrong-side thoracenteses performed in ambulatory clinics and hospital units other than the operating room, reported from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2011.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Data extracted included patient factors, clinical features, team structure and function, adherence to bottom-line patient safety measures, complications, and outcomes.

- **Results**: Fourteen cases of wrong-side thoracenteses were identified. Contributing factors included failure to perform a time-out (n = 12), missing indication of laterality on the patient's consent form (n = 10), absence of a site mark on the patient's skin within the sterile field (n = 12), and absent verification of medical images (n = 7). Complications included pneumothoraces (n = 4), hemorrhage (n = 3), and death directly attributable to the wrong-side thoracentesis (n = 2). Teamwork and communication failure, unawareness of existing policy, and a deficit in training and education were the most common root causes of wrong-side thoracentesis.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Prevention of wrong-site procedures and accompanying patient safety measures are crucial in minimizing such events.

### Spinal surgery and patient safety: A systems approach [^116efUfd]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

In every spinal procedure, identifying the specific patient, proper surgical site, and pathologic lesion for surgical intervention are crucial patient safety concerns. The 1999 Institute of Medicine report "To Err is Human" identified adverse events associated with surgery. Both the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the North American Spine Society have had voluntary, systems-based programs in place for several years to address wrong patient, wrong procedure, and wrong site surgery. Beginning July 1, 2004, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations mandated that hospitals comply with the JCAHO Universal Protocol. In addition to surgical site marking, the protocol incorporates additional factors, such as calling a time out before the skin incision to do a final systems check of patient identification, surgical site, records, imaging studies, equipment, and review of preoperative medication.

### Unplanned sarcoma excisions: Understanding how they happen [^1175PmV2]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

A root cause analysis (RCA) of all the unplanned procedures was conducted by analyzing outside records. An Ishikawa diagram was employed as a problem-solving quality tool. The first challenge encountered was the incorrect presumption of a diagnosis without additional investigation (45.8%). Physicians often erred towards a benign diagnosis and elected to operate without ancillary examinations. Subsequently, 76.6% of the patients did not undergo an MRI with and without contrast. Among those who had preoperative imaging, 67.6% received an incorrect report.

In 70 cases (65.4%), tumors were larger than 5 cm; only eight of these patients had an attempted biopsy. Six of the eight sarcomas were incorrectly reported as benign or had an inconclusive diagnosis. When conducting a RCA specifically for orthopaedic surgeons, the errors or events leading to the undesirable outcome, the unplanned excision, were consistent with those of the entire sample, although with differences in incidence.

The first event in the RCA was a physician assuming a benign diagnosis without obtaining ancillary examinations. This was more frequent among orthopedic surgeons (n = 11, 57.9%) compared to other physicians (n = 38, 43.2%); however, this higher rate was not statistically significant. Furthermore, orthopaedic surgeons were more likely to order an MRI with and without contrast (47.3%, n = 9 versus 18.2%, n = 16) and more likely to order a biopsy when indicated for tumors larger than 5 cm (25.0%, n = 3 versus 8.6%).

### Evidence for a standardized preadmission showering regimen to achieve maximal antiseptic skin surface concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate, 4%, in surgical patients [^112k7Mqr]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: To reduce the amount of skin surface bacteria for patients undergoing elective surgery, selective health care facilities have instituted a preadmission antiseptic skin cleansing protocol using chlorhexidine gluconate. A Cochrane Collaborative review suggests that existing data do not justify preoperative skin cleansing as a strategy to reduce surgical site infection.

- **Objectives**: To develop and evaluate the efficacy of a standardized preadmission showering protocol that optimizes skin surface concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate and to compare the findings with the design and methods of published studies on preoperative skin preparation.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized prospective analysis in 120 healthy volunteers was conducted at an academic tertiary care medical center from June 1, 2014, to September 30, 2014. Data analysis was performed from October 13, 2014, to October 27, 2014. A standardized process of dose, duration, and timing was used to maximize antiseptic skin surface concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate applied during preoperative showering. The volunteers were randomized to two chlorhexidine gluconate, 4%, showering groups (two vs. three showers), containing 60 participants each, and three subgroups (no pause, 1-minute pause, or 2-minute pause before rinsing), containing 20 participants each. Volunteers used 118 mL of chlorhexidine gluconate, 4%, for each shower. Skin surface concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate were analyzed using a colorimetric assay at five separate anatomic sites. Individual groups were analyzed using a paired t-test.

### Outcome of 6 years of protocol use for preventing wrong site office surgery [^1115NyjT]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Patient safety is emerging as an integral part of the overall strategy to improve health care in the United States. Wrong site surgery is correctly noted to be a sentinel event and great efforts must be made to avoid it.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine the incidence of wrong site surgery after implementation of a preoperative protocol in patients presenting for treatment of skin cancer at a high-volume, Joint Commission-accredited, tertiary referral center for dermatologic surgery.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed of 7,983 cases in patients presenting for treatment of skin cancer in the office setting.

- **Results**: There were no cases of wrong site surgery; however, there were 18 cases of failure to identify the original biopsy site (cancer site).

- **Limitations**: This was a retrospective study conducted at one cancer center.

- **Conclusion**: Integration of a correct surgery site protocol into a daily patient care model is a useful step in preventing occurrences of wrong site dermatologic surgery.

### Wrong-site nerve blocks: 10 yr experience in a large multihospital health-care system [^116F2Qfp]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Although wrong-site surgery has garnered extensive scrutiny, the incidence of wrong-site blocks remains unknown. Our study thus sought to quantify the incidence of wrong-site blocks and examine some of their associated risk factors within our multihospital healthcare system.

- **Methods**: Using quality-improvement and billing data, we quantified the total number of blocks and wrong-site blocks occurring between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2012, within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health System. The incidence of wrong-site blocks was determined by block type, hospital, and type of service involved in performing the block. The incidence of wrong-site blocks was compared with that of wrong-site surgery. Fisher's exact tests were performed to determine associations between the incidence of wrong-site blocks and any of the aforementioned variables. A root-cause analysis was performed to determine the source of wrong-site blocks after the implementation of a timeout policy.

- **Results**: Of the 85,915 patients receiving blocks, 70,441 received only unilateral blocks, yielding an overall incidence of wrong-site blocks of 1.28 (95% confidence interval 0.43–2.13) per 10,000 patients receiving unilateral blocks. The incidence of wrong-site blocks was highest with femoral blocks and differed from the incidence of wrong-site surgery. All occurrences of wrong-site blocks after the implementation of the timeout policy involved policy violations.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery: Updated guidelines [^1171KR8M]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery is poorly understood, and data on its use are lacking. Prophylaxis is indicated for the prevention of endocarditis and prosthesis infection, as well as surgical site infection.

- **Objective**: We review essential considerations for the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery and provide clear guidelines for practical implementation.

- **Methods**: Guidelines were developed after review of the literature and consultation with infectious disease specialists and subspecialists in the areas of cardiac, orthopedic, and neurosurgical infectious disease at Mayo Clinic.

- **Results**: Three factors affect the decision to use prophylactic antibiotics in dermatologic surgery: (1) the underlying indication for prophylaxis (patient risk stratification), (2) the condition of the skin, and (3) the specific procedure planned. Thorough preoperative evaluation and surgical planning are critical in identifying and optimizing patient and environmental risk factors that may increase the risk of infection. Appropriate antibiotic selections with site-specific consideration and appropriate timing of antibiotic administration are key factors in providing effective prophylaxis.

- **Conclusions**: Low rates of infection associated with dermatologic surgical procedures warrant selective use of antibiotic prophylaxis. The proposed guidelines reflect standards of practice.

### When things go wrong: A guide to the medical, ethical, and legal dimensions of surgical complications [^112or2VP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). High credibility

Immediate response to complications:

Following interventions to stabilize and care for the patient, the surgeon must advise key stakeholders at their practice or hospital system. For private practice physicians, the priority lies in informing risk management specialists, malpractice insurers, and practice administrators to ensure proper communication of the relevant information. Employees of hospital systems must alert the risk management team, although it is typically not necessary for the orthopaedic surgeon to contact legal counsel, as communication with risk management often triggers internal protocols that inform the hospital's legal counsel. In both cases, the malpractice insurer may recruit legal counsel for the management of potential liability issues.

Surgeons must often take simultaneous steps following a complication, synchronizing timing and execution. Contacting risk management promptly is crucial, but the attending surgeon must also swiftly submit an incident report. One of the main drivers of this is the belief that safety enhancement can be achieved by learning from adverse events, rather than denying their occurrence. When done correctly and in a timely manner, the benefit is twofold. Primarily, the process identifies safety hazards and helps create interventions to reduce risks. Promptly submitting an incident report also demonstrates a commitment to patient-centered care and accountability. However, Kingston et al. reported that physicians tend to exhibit a lower inclination to submit incident reports than other medical professionals, such as nurses.

### Impact of the World Health Organization surgical safety checklist on patient safety [^112EwnfG]. Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

The incidence of surgical complications has remained largely unchanged over the past two decades. Inherent complexity in surgery, new technological possibilities, and increasing age and comorbidity in patients may contribute to this issue. Surgical safety checklists are among the tools used to prevent such complications. Their use can reduce critical workload by eliminating issues that have already been controlled for.

The global introduction of the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist aimed to enhance safety in both anesthesia and surgery, reducing complications and mortality by fostering better teamwork, communication, and consistency of care. This review synthesizes literature on the advantages and disadvantages of using surgical safety checklists. It emphasizes checklist development, implementation, and potential clinical effects, using a theoretical framework for quality of healthcare (structure-process-outcome) to understand the checklists' possible impact on patient safety.

### The medicolegal challenges of facial plastic surgery: A systematic review [^1148hnjV]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Across studies, common allegations against surgeons included intraoperative complications such as nerve damage, infection, and scarring. Additionally, poor aesthetic outcomes like dissatisfaction with cosmetic appearance, lack of informed consent, and failure to diagnose or manage complications appropriately were also cited.

A recurring theme across studies was the significance of informed consent in mitigating malpractice claims. Issues surrounding inadequate consent processes were frequently cited as contributing factors to litigation. Many studies assessed patient-reported outcomes, focusing on dissatisfaction post-surgery. The link between aesthetic outcomes and litigation was highlighted, particularly in aesthetic procedures where patient expectations played a crucial role. An upward trend in litigation related to facial plastic surgeries has been observed. The studies indicated that the frequency of claims is increasing, especially in aesthetic surgeries, which were more prone to patient dissatisfaction.

The involvement of various surgical specialties in malpractice cases was significant. The data indicate that plastic surgeons, otolaryngologists, and maxillofacial surgeons frequently faced litigation, often reflecting the complexities of the procedures performed.

Expert witnesses played a critical role in court proceedings, with their involvement documented in 62% to 85% of cases. Their opinion often influenced case outcomes, particularly in establishing whether standard care protocols were followed.

### Wrong site surgery in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery [^112KD6iV]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Wrong site surgery has received high public awareness this past decade, yet discussion specific to otolaryngology is limited.

- **Study design**: Literature review.
- **Methods**: We searched the MEDLINE database on PubMed from 1980 to 2013 and pursued the citations of key references. We conducted a review of the literature and public patient safety reports on the scope, root causes, and prevention of wrong site surgery with emphasis on otolaryngology.
- **Results**: A review of the literature reveals that otolaryngology procedures constitute 0.3% to 4.5% of all wrong site surgery events, and wrong site surgery accounts for 4% to 6% of all medical errors in otolaryngology. A significant proportion (9% to 21%) of otolaryngologists reported experiences with wrong site surgery over their career. The events most frequently resulted in temporary injuries to the patient, with few cases of permanent disability or death. Although otolaryngology procedures have similar root causes for wrong site events as other specialties, inverted imaging and ambiguity in site marking are particular challenges. Site-marking practices are variable among otolaryngologists, as it is not applicable to many otolaryngology procedures, yet these are common procedures that also constitute the majority of wrong site cases reported in otolaryngology.
- **Conclusions**: Future interventions to address these challenges related to otolaryngology-head and neck surgery might involve a standardized protocol to confirm imaging accuracy and a specialty- or procedure-specific checklist.

### Improving surgical and anaesthesia practice: Review of the use of the WHO safe surgery checklist in Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital, Ethiopia [^117XEA8F]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The study involved the review of surgical and anaesthesia practices through the use of the WHO Safe Surgery checklist at the Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital in Ethiopia. The checklist comprises several sections:

- **Surgical**: Patient confirmation, patient consent, site marked, allergies checked, blood loss risk, introductions, surgical pauses, swab counts before and after.
- **Anaesthetic**: Pre-op assessment, anaesthetist pause, airway check, oximeter check.
- **Infection prevention**: Antibiotic prophylaxis, use of PPE, equipment sterility, skin preparation.

Surgical cases from morning sessions were reviewed for checklist completion. The reviewer attended each case to analyze the checklist use. Mornings were selected randomly, with multiple cases reviewed consecutively. At least five different sessions per phase were observed to ensure a variety of theatre teams were surveyed.

The study focused on the checklist's actual use. Phase I review began upon its introduction and measured its development from that point onward.

The initial Phase I review collected data from 30 patients between July 13 and July 24, 2015. Of these, 67% were elective operations and 33% were emergencies. The checklist use was recorded at 50% (27% partial completion and 23% full completion). The least completed checklist components were "site marked" and "allergy", both at 0% completion. Other poorly completed areas included aspects of the surgical pause, such as anaesthetic concerns (7–17%) and "equipment count" (13%). The average completion rates for category groupings were: surgical at 33%, anaesthetic at 69%, and infection prevention at 89%.

At the time of writing, no study to our knowledge has examined the nature and scope of medical error in dermatology practice.

- **Objective**: We sought to collect and categorize physician-reported errors in dermatology practice.

- **Methods**: A survey regarding the most recent and most serious errors was developed and distributed to dermatologists attending US meetings. A total of 150 responses were received, outlining 152 most recent errors and 130 most serious errors. Survey responses, along with classification systems for other specialties, were used to develop a classification system for medical error in dermatology.

- **Results**: The respondents' demographics reflected the specialty: 63% were male, 60% were older than 50 years, and 60% were in solo or group private practice. Of the most recent errors reported, 85% happened once a year or less, and 86% did not result in harm to patients. The most common categories of both most recent and most serious errors were related to assessment (41% and 31%, respectively) and interventions (44% and 52%, respectively). Assessment errors were primarily related to investigations, and commonly involved the biopsy pathway. Intervention errors for the most recent and most serious errors were split between those related to medication (54% and 27%) and those related to procedures (46% and 73%). Notably, 5 and 21 wrong-site surgeries were reported in the most recent and most serious errors groups, respectively.

- **Limitations**: Our findings are subject to respondent and recall bias, and our classification system, although an important first step, is likely incomplete.

### Avoiding wrong site surgery: A systematic review [^1128nxAH]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

A systematic review was conducted to report the incidence and causes of wrong site surgery and to determine effective preoperative measures for its prevention. From 1995 to 2005, the Joint Commission (JC) sentinel event statistics database ranked wrong site surgery as the second most frequently reported event, accounting for 455 of 3,548 sentinel events (12.8%). Although seemingly rare, the incidence of these complications is difficult to measure and quantify. Beyond impacting patients, wrong site surgery has profound medical, legal, social, and emotional implications.

A systematic review of English language literature was conducted for articles published between 1990 and December 2008. Electronic databases and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify those defining wrong site surgery and reporting related events. Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus.

The estimated rate of wrong site surgery varies widely, ranging from 0.09 to 4.5 per 10,000 surgeries performed. There is no literature substantiating the effectiveness of the JC Universal Protocol in reducing the rate of wrong site, wrong level surgery.

Wrong site surgery may be preventable. It is suggested that the North American Spine Society and JC checklists are insufficient on their own.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Squamous cell skin cancer, version 1.2022 [^114pE1vG]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend specific technical considerations for PDEMA. The following PDEMA Checklist is stipulated:

- **Technical considerations**: All categories below must be marked "Yes" for PDEMA to be achieved. If any are marked "No", the procedure does not achieve PDEMA.
	- Is the entire peripheral margin of the surgical specimen microscopically visualized?
	- Is the entire deep margin of the surgical specimen microscopically visualized?
	- Is the surgical specimen oriented to the wound bed and marked such that any positive margin identified in histopathologic analysis can be accurately located and re-excised?
	- Is the process of excision and complete histologic examination repeated until no further cancer is identified or until further excision is no longer in the best interest of the patient?
	- Is the process rapid enough to prevent distortion of the wound bed that would decrease the accuracy of tissue orientation?

### Effect size of contributory factors on adverse events: An analysis of RCA series in a teaching hospital [^116SCHoP]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

The contribution rate related to communication factors was 14%, which increased to 33% for wrong surgery events and 20% for preventable abortions. Communication errors exist between various groups of staff, but these are more probable among physicians and nurses who are primarily responsible for patient care. Organizational procedures and guidelines determining what information should be transferred, by whom, and when, are of great significance. Different providers (physicians, nurses, students, etc) need to be trained in communication skills and safe information transfer, particularly at the time of handover, as well as in how to transfer a telephone order. Imperfect education of inter-professional and staff-patient communication skills are the main threatening factors for patient safety issues. Numerous studies have equated the effects of these failures with failures in accessing patient safety. A study by Gawande found that a lack of effective communication among personnel was responsible for 43% of analyzed errors.

This failure is more profound in communication between physicians and nurses. In Smith's study, 91% of reported medical faults were due to this communication failure. He also pointed out that failures in inter-professional and staff-patient communication were to blame for 66% of adverse events from 1995 to 2004, especially in wrong-site surgeries and medical errors.

In Greenberg's study, the most significant failure was related to poor pre-operation communications with patients and a lack of proper verbal communications.

### The problem with root cause analysis [^115zaDXr]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2017). Low credibility.

Confusion about blame

Though healthcare is often exhorted to embrace a 'no-blame' culture, the extent to which this urging is based on a correct understanding of what happens in other high-risk industries is questionable. Investigators in other industries do not set out with a remit to assign blame, but that does not mean that individual or organizational culpability is forever sequestered.

The vast majority of mistakes and other errors are the result of systems defects that need to be corrected, but when blatant transgressions, neglect, or unacceptable behavior is found, it is clearly wrong to write accountability out of the picture. Nor is 'no-blame' the reality in practice, since disciplinary, institutional, and legal (civil and criminal) processes continue to operate and are highly visible to healthcare practitioners and managers, yet may appear arbitrary and unsatisfactory both to them and to patients and families.

A 'just culture' is increasingly promoted in many organizations to balance the disparity between individual blame and organizational accountability. This approach, however, comes with problems of its own when applied to incident investigation in healthcare. For instance, some of the more visible features of the just culture philosophy in incident investigation include the use of prescriptive algorithms and decision tools (such as a culpability tree) to objectify culpability. Such 'calculus-like logic' may imply that actions committed by staff are binary (either acceptable or unacceptable) without appropriate appreciation of the messiness of the system in which the action occurs.

### Medicolegal issues [^111cuXwx]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The legal landscape in dermatology is constantly evolving. Dermatologists should nurture strong physician-patient relationships with proper informed consent and stay abreast of legal issues as they pertain to today's practice of medicine. Medicolegal issues that have risen to the forefront include wrong-site surgery, delegation of procedures to nonphysician operators, and compounding of medications. Additionally, although the marriage of health care and technology has facilitated our practice of medicine, it has opened doors to new medicolegal pitfalls associated with the use of electronic medical records, teledermatology, and even social media. This contribution will highlight some of the common medicolegal issues in dermatology along with recommendations to minimize exposure to litigation.

### Wrong-site surgery, retained surgical items, and surgical fires: A systematic review of surgical never events [^1134Uzn9]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The significance of addressing serious, preventable surgical events, known as never events, remains critical despite significant patient safety initiatives. This study's objective was to examine the incidence, root causes, and interventions aimed at preventing wrong-site surgery, retained surgical items, and surgical fires in the period following the implementation of the Universal Protocol in 2004.

- **Data sources**: We conducted a search of nine electronic databases for entries spanning from 2004 to June 30, 2014. References were screened, and consultations with experts were made.

- **Study selection**: Two independent reviewers singled out pertinent publications in June 2014.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: A standardized form was employed by one reviewer to extract data, which a second reviewer then verified. The strength of the evidence was established by the review team, with data extraction finalized by January 2015.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The focus was on the incidence of wrong-site surgery, retained surgical items, and surgical fires.

Our results included 138 empirical studies that met the criteria for inclusion. Estimates for the incidence of wrong-site surgery in US settings varied depending on data sources and procedures, with a median estimate of 0.09 events per 10,000 surgical procedures. For retained surgical items, the median estimate was 1.32 events per 10,000 procedures, though variation was noted based on the item and procedure. The per-procedure incidence of surgical fires remains undetermined. A commonly reported root cause was inadequate communication. Methodological challenges in investigating changes in rare events pose limitations to the conclusions of 78 intervention evaluations. Limited evidence was found in support of the Universal Protocol, with only five studies providing such support.

### Strategies to avoid wrong-site surgery during spinal procedures [^112H7SDe]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Wrong-site surgery (WSS) is a rare occurrence that can have devastating consequences for patient care. Several factors inherent to spine surgery increase the risk of WSS compared with other types of surgery. Surgeons may potentially operate on the wrong side of the spine or the wrong level, and there are unique issues related to spinal localization that can be challenging even for the most experienced clinicians. This review discusses important issues that can help prevent WSS during spinal procedures.

### Hympavzi [^114GCZ3o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Step 8 – Remove needle**: Pull the needle and syringe out of your skin at the same angle as inserted. Note: If you see a small drop of medicine on your skin, wait a little longer before removing the needle when you give your next injection.

- **Step 9 – Check syringe**: Check the syringe to make sure the gray plunger stopper is in the position shown. If the gray plunger stopper is not in the position shown, this means you have not received a full dose. Call your healthcare provider for help. Never re-insert the needle. Do not inject another dose.

- **Step 10 – After care**: Press lightly on the injection site for a few seconds with a clean cotton ball or gauze pad if you see a drop of blood. Do not rub the area. Note: If bleeding does not stop, contact your healthcare provider. Note: If your prescribed dose requires 2 injections of Hympavzi, repeat steps 1–10. Change (rotate) the injection site each time you give yourself an injection of Hympavzi. You may use the same area of your body but be sure to choose a different injection site in that area.

### Interventions for reducing wrong-site surgery and invasive procedures [^115NYAXa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Specific clinical interventions are needed to reduce wrong-site surgery, a rare but potentially disastrous clinical error. The risk factors contributing to wrong-site surgery are variable and complex. The introduction of organizational and professional clinical strategies may play a role in minimizing wrong-site surgery.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of organizational and professional interventions in reducing wrong-site surgery, including wrong-site, wrong-side, wrong-procedure, and wrong-patient surgeries. This also encompasses non-surgical invasive procedures such as regional blocks, dermatological, obstetric, dental procedures, and emergency surgical procedures not conducted within the operating theatre.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialized Register (June 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1948-June 2011), EMBASE (1947-June 2011), CINAHL (1980-June 2011), Dissertations and Theses (1861-June 2011), African Index Medicus, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences database, Virtual Health Library, Pan American Health Organization Database, and the World Health Organization Library Information System. A grey literature search was conducted. Database searches were conducted in June 2011.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials, and controlled before-after studies (CBAs) with at least two intervention and control sites.

### Avoiding medical errors in cutaneous site identification: A best practices review [^112MMVbu]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Although the field of dermatology has a relatively low incidence of medical errors, dermatologic surgery is a major area where such errors occur.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this article is to catalog various cutaneous site identification techniques used by practitioners and determine which techniques are most evidence-based.

- **Materials and methods**: A comprehensive literature review of cutaneous surgical site identification techniques and medical errors in dermatology was conducted.

- **Results**: Wrong-site surgery frequently results from an inability to identify the surgical site due to factors such as inadequate documentation from referring physicians, well-healed scars obscuring the biopsy site, and a patient's inability to visualize the surgical site. Practitioners employ techniques like photography, dermabrasion, written descriptions using anatomic landmarks, and site identification protocols for surgical site identification.

- **Conclusion**: Site identification remains a challenge for dermatologists and is a leading cause of medical errors in this field. Patients are often unreliable in their ability to identify biopsy sites; therefore, practitioners must take a proactive role to ensure that medical errors do not occur. This article provides a thorough description and evaluation of site identification techniques used in dermatology with the aim to improve quality of care and reduce medical errors.

### Perseris [^113wE8PH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

This medication is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen or back of the upper arm (Figure 7).

- **Prepare the subcutaneous injection site(s)**: Choose an injection site with adequate subcutaneous tissue that is free of skin conditions (e.g. nodules, lesions, excessive pigment). Do not inject into an area where the skin is irritated, reddened, bruised, infected, or scarred in any way. Clean the injection site well with an alcohol pad. To help minimize irritation, rotate injection sites following a pattern similar to the illustration. If you want to use the same injection site, ensure it is not the same spot you used the last time.

- **Remove excess air from syringe**: Hold the syringe upright for several seconds to allow air bubbles to rise. Remove the needle cover and slowly depress the plunger to push out the excess air from the syringe (Figure 8). If medication is seen at the needle tip, pull back slightly on the plunger to prevent medication spillage. Due to the viscous nature of the medication, bubbles will not rise as quickly as those in an aqueous solution.

- **Pinch injection site**: Pinch the skin around the injection area. Ensure to pinch enough skin to accommodate the size of the needle (Figure 9). Lift the adipose tissue from the underlying muscle to prevent accidental intramuscular injection.

### Does the surgical safety checklist need a co-pilot? Comparing adherence in gynecological surgery through electronic medical records and OR Black Box video observations [^112Guuip]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Despite clear evidence that the Surgical Safety Checklist improves patient safety, the reporting of its use in the literature varies significantly. Consequently, it is crucial to understand the alignment between the reported use of the checklist and its actual application to identify discrepancies that could affect the accuracy of safety reporting and ultimately impact patient safety outcomes. This study aims to examine Surgical Safety Checklist adherence in a gynecological operating room based on video data and compare the findings with its reported use in patient electronic medical records.

- **Method**: An observational study was conducted on elective gynecological surgeries in a single operating room equipped with an OR Black Box from August to October 2021 to assess checklist compliance, quality, and engagement. The checklist's reported use in patient electronic medical records was also reviewed.

- **Results**: Forty-five surgeries were assessed. The video observed compliance score for Sign-in and Time-out was 100%, while it was 80% for Sign-out. Engagement scores, representing the percentage of people pausing during the three checklist phases, had an overall mean score of 76% (range 45–94%). Quality scores, showing the percentage of checklist items completed, differed between video observed (47% (95% CI 43–50)) and electronic medical records reported (89% (95% CI 84–94)) use.

- **Conclusions**: OR Black Box video provides a unique opportunity to assess the actual use of the Surgical Safety Checklist, revealing valuable insights into its application. Data indicated that the checklist was not used as intended.
