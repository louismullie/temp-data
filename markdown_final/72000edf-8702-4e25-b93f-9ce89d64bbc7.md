## Question

How does the anion gap help in differentiating between lactic acidosis and toxic poisoning?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to differentiate lactic acidosis from toxic poisoning using the anion gap and related bedside tests. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the anion gap actually measures and why it rises in lactic acidosis. Then, I should verify which toxic ingestions characteristically cause an anion gap metabolic acidosis and which do not. Next, I will examine the role of the osmolar gap to separate alcohols from other toxins. After that, I should review the bedside pattern of anion gap acidosis without ketonuria or ketonemia as a clue to metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and highlight pitfalls and exceptions that can mislead us, anchoring on FDA labeling and contemporary reviews to keep this clinically grounded.

> Let me first confirm the core concept: the anion gap reflects unmeasured anions, and lactic acidosis raises the anion gap because lactate is a strong acid that dissociates into lactate− and H+, replacing bicarbonate and increasing the gap. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is classically described with an anion gap acidosis, elevated lactate, and often an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio, which aligns with the pathophysiology of lactate accumulation and bicarbonate consumption [^115B6vHC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — toxic ingestions are not uniform in their acid–base pattern. I need to check which toxins specifically cause an anion gap metabolic acidosis. Ethylene glycol and methanol reliably produce anion gap acidosis via toxic metabolites (glycolic/oxalic and formic acids, respectively), and FDA guidance explicitly instructs clinicians to use anion gap and acid–base status to guide diagnosis and treatment of these alcohol poisonings, reinforcing that a high anion gap in this context points toward toxic metabolites rather than endogenous lactate alone [^113mpXCK].

> Wait, let me verify the role of the osmolar gap because it helps separate alcohols from other causes of anion gap acidosis. Ethylene glycol and methanol increase the measured osmolality and thus the osmolar gap early, whereas lactate itself does not meaningfully raise the osmolar gap, so a high anion gap plus a high osmolar gap strengthens the case for toxic alcohol ingestion and supports empiric fomepizole while confirmatory levels are pending [^113uEWNk] [^113mpXCK].

> I should confirm the metformin signal next. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis typically presents with an anion gap acidosis, elevated lactate, and notably without ketonuria or ketonemia, which helps distinguish it from diabetic ketoacidosis when glucose is not severely elevated or when euglycemic presentations occur. FDA labeling repeatedly emphasizes this pattern and recommends immediate metformin cessation and consideration of hemodialysis when suspected, which is a critical management fork in the road [^115B6vHC] [^114fcgtB] [^111xpXvs].

> Let me consider other toxicologic contributors to anion gap acidosis so I don't anchor prematurely. Acetaminophen in overdose can progress to fulminant hepatic failure with marked transaminase elevations and a rising anion gap metabolic acidosis in advanced stages, and fosphenytoin overdose can release formate, mimicking methanol toxicity and producing a severe anion gap acidosis, so medication reconciliation and timing of ingestion matter when interpreting a high anion gap [^114VepHx] [^114APDgt] [^117G5Gw7].

> But wait, what if the anion gap is normal — does that exclude lactic acidosis or toxic poisoning? I need to ensure I don't overinterpret a single value. Some toxins cause non–anion gap (hyperchloremic) acidosis, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors like topiramate can induce a non–anion gap metabolic acidosis, which could coexist with or obscure lactate-related processes, so a normal anion gap does not definitively exclude toxicity or lactic processes, especially with mixed disorders or chronic kidney disease [^111CWBSZ] [^111xqoEf].

> Next, I should review a practical bedside approach. If the anion gap is elevated, I will simultaneously check lactate, glucose, ketones, renal function, and calculate the osmolar gap, because the combination of anion gap > 12 mEq/L with elevated lactate and no significant ketonemia favors lactic acidosis, whereas anion gap acidosis with a marked osmolar gap (> 20–25 mOsm/kg) and clinical clues (visual symptoms, calcium oxalate crystals) point to toxic alcohols and warrants empiric fomepizole. If anion gap acidosis is present without ketosis and there is metformin exposure or risk factors, I should treat as metformin-associated lactic acidosis with drug cessation and early hemodialysis consideration [^113uEWNk] [^115B6vHC] [^114fcgtB].

> Hold on, I should verify exceptions and confounders. Severe renal failure can itself elevate the anion gap via retained organic acids, and albumin correction is necessary in hypoalbuminemia, so a high anion gap in CKD or cirrhosis may reflect underlying disease rather than a new toxin or lactate process. Also, early after ingestion, toxic alcohol levels may be detectable even as the anion gap is only modestly elevated, so serial trends in gap, lactate, and osmolar gap are more informative than a single snapshot [^113uEWNk].

> In summary, I need to ensure the pattern recognition is explicit: an anion gap metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate and no ketosis supports lactic acidosis, particularly metformin-associated disease. An anion gap acidosis with a high osmolar gap and supportive clinical features supports toxic alcohol poisoning. And a normal anion gap does not exclude toxicity or mixed processes, so integrating gap, lactate, osmolar gap, ketones, and exposure history is essential to avoid misclassification and to trigger timely antidotal or dialytic therapy [^115B6vHC] [^113uEWNk] [^111xqoEf].

---

The anion gap helps distinguish lactic acidosis from toxic poisoning by reflecting the acid load: lactic acidosis shows a **high anion gap** from lactate accumulation [^115B6vHC], whereas toxic poisonings such as methanol, ethylene glycol, and propylene glycol also cause a **high anion gap** from organic acid metabolites (formate, glycolate, oxalate, lactate) [^113uEWNk] [^116DjGrf]. A **normal anion gap** suggests non–anion gap acidosis or mixed disorders, not pure lactic acidosis or classic toxic poisonings. Thus, a high anion gap alone cannot differentiate lactic acidosis from toxic poisoning; clinicians must integrate lactate levels, osmolar gap, clinical context, and specific toxin assays to make the distinction [^111xqoEf] [^113mpXCK].

---

## Pathophysiology of lactic acidosis and toxic poisoning

### Lactic acidosis

Lactic acidosis arises from **excess lactate** from anaerobic metabolism or impaired clearance, producing a **high anion gap** metabolic acidosis [^114k4a96]. Common causes include sepsis, hypoperfusion, hepatic dysfunction, and metformin accumulation [^112JrXzC].

---

### Toxic poisoning

Certain toxins are metabolized to **organic acids**, causing a **high anion gap** metabolic acidosis [^113mpXCK]:

- **Methanol**: metabolized to formic acid.
- **Ethylene glycol**: metabolized to glycolic and oxalic acids.
- **Propylene glycol**: metabolized to lactic acid [^notfound].

These organic acids increase the anion gap, mimicking lactic acidosis [^113uEWNk].

---

## Anion gap calculation and interpretation

The anion gap is calculated as **AG = [Na⁺] − ([Cl⁻] + [HCO₃⁻])**; a normal value is 8–12 mEq/L. A **high anion gap (> 12 mEq/L)** indicates the presence of unmeasured anions, such as lactate or toxic organic acids [^111xqoEf].

---

## Differentiating lactic acidosis from toxic poisoning using the anion gap

While both lactic acidosis and toxic poisoning can present with a **high anion gap**, the following features help differentiate them:

| **Feature** | **Lactic acidosis** | **Toxic poisoning** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary acid | Lactate | Organic acids (formate, glycolate, oxalate) |
| Anion gap | Elevated | Elevated |
| Osmolar gap | Normal | Elevated (except for propylene glycol) |
| Specific toxins | Absent | Present (methanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol) |
| Clinical context | Sepsis, hypoperfusion, hepatic dysfunction, metformin use | History of ingestion, exposure to toxins |

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Lactic acidosis**: Management focuses on treating the underlying cause (e.g. sepsis, hypoperfusion), supportive care, and discontinuation of offending agents (e.g. metformin) [^111a5BUv]. Hemodialysis may be considered in severe cases [^114fcgtB].

- **Toxic poisoning**: Management includes specific antidotes (e.g. fomepizole for methanol and ethylene glycol), supportive care, and hemodialysis to remove toxins and correct acid-base disturbances [^113mpXCK].

---

## Limitations of the anion gap

The anion gap is a useful tool but has **limitations**:

- **False positives/negatives**: Albumin abnormalities, laboratory errors, and mixed acid-base disorders can affect accuracy [^notfound].
- **Non-specificity**: A high anion gap alone cannot identify the specific acid responsible [^111xqoEf].
- **Clinical context**: Always interpret the anion gap alongside clinical history, lactate levels, osmolar gap, and specific toxin assays [^113mpXCK].

---

## Conclusion

The anion gap is a valuable tool for identifying high anion gap metabolic acidosis, but it **cannot alone distinguish lactic acidosis from toxic poisoning**. Clinicians must integrate the anion gap with lactate levels, osmolar gap, clinical context, and specific toxin assays to accurately differentiate and manage these conditions.

Large hemispheric infarction — osmotic therapy recommendations support mannitol or hypertonic saline only with clinical evidence of cerebral edema and specify monitoring strategies. We recommend using mannitol and hypertonic saline for reducing brain edema and tissue shifts in LHI only when there is clinical evidence of cerebral edema (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest using osmolar gap instead of serum osmolality to guide mannitol dosing and treatment duration (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). Hypertonic saline dosing should be guided by serum osmolality and serum sodium (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Evidence notes no randomized studies comparing osmotic therapy regimens; both mannitol and hypertonic saline appear to be safe options without exacerbating tissue shifts.

### Fomepizole (Antizol) [^113uEWNk]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Treatment Guidelines: If ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning is left untreated, the natural progression of the poisoning leads to accumulation of toxic metabolites, including glycolic and oxalic acids (ethylene glycol intoxication) and formic acid (methanol intoxication). These metabolites can induce metabolic acidosis, nausea/ vomiting, seizures, stupor, coma, calcium oxaluria, acute tubular necrosis, blindness, and death. The diagnosis of these poisonings may be difficult because ethylene glycol and methanol concentrations diminish in the blood as they are metabolized to their respective metabolites. Hence, both ethylene glycol and methanol concentrations and acid base balance, as determined by serum electrolyte (anion gap) and/or arterial blood gas analysis, should be frequently monitored and used to guide treatment.

Treatment consists of blocking the formation of toxic metabolites using inhibitors of alcohol dehydrogenase, such as Antizol®, and correction of metabolic abnormalities. In patients with high ethylene glycol or methanol concentrations (≥ 50 mg/dL), significant metabolic acidosis, or renal failure, hemodialysis should be considered to remove ethylene glycol or methanol and the respective toxic metabolites of these alcohols.

Treatment with Antizol:

Begin Antizol®treatment immediately upon suspicion of ethylene glycol or methanol ingestion based on patient history and/or anion gap metabolic acidosis, increased osmolar gap, visual disturbances, or oxalate crystals in the urine, OR a documented serum ethylene glycol or methanol concentration greater than 20 mg/dL.

### Anion gap and cancer mortality: insight from NHANES database… [^114a6JZs]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract e13068 Background: The serum anion gap is an effective tool to analyze acid- base disorders for the past 40 years. Anion gap and non-anion gap acidosis is prevalent in cancer patients and contributes to morbidity and mortality The aim of the present study was to investigate the independent association of serum anion gap with cancer mortality. Methods: We examined the 34, 370 participants using National Health and Nutrition Examination survey data combined with National Death Index for mortality status through December 2011. The serum anion gap was calculated by subtracting sum of chloride and bicarbonate from sodium concentrations in meq/l. We divided the data set in to four quartiles of serum anion gap. Cox proportional hazard models were made to estimate the hazard ratios for cancer mortality for each unit increase in serum anion gap. The models were adjusted from demographic and confoundig variables.

In univariate regression model using serum anion gap as continuous variable, we found 6%, increase in cancer mortality with each unit increase in serum anion gap. After adjusting for potential confounders using multivariate regression model we found 8%, increase in cancer mortality with each unit increase in serum anion gap. In univariate regression model using quartiles, we found 47%, increase in cancer mortality with each unit increase in serum anion gap in highest quartile compared to the lowest quartile. After adjusting to the potential confounders the risk for cancer mortality increases to 60% in highest quartile comparison to lowest quartile. Conclusions: We found a linear association between serum anion gap and cancer mortality.

A high serum anion gap is associated with increase in cancer mortality and may be the prognostic indicator of cancer mortality in general population. This should be validated by performing further investigation. Altmetric Citations Article CitationAnion gap and cancer mortality: Insight from NHANES database. JCO 35, e13068-e13068.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^111DjxTm]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Cerebral edema — hypertonic sodium solution (HTS) adverse effects and monitoring: Retrospective cohorts report renal and electrolyte risks, including that both increase in mean serum chloride level (OR 7.39 per 10 mEq/L increase) and use of HTS (OR 2.074) were found to be independently associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), and in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients those who received continuous infusion 3% NaCl and developed hyperchloremia (Cl > 115 mEq/L) had significantly higher rates of AKI, with hyperchloremia and AKI more observed to be more frequent in the continuous infusion cohort. Regarding acid–base balance, a sodium acetate and NaCl mix (to equal a 2 to 3% solution) demonstrated no difference in the rate of metabolic acidosis, and neither the dose nor the use of 23.5% NaCl to achieve 145–155 mEq/L in severe ICH were associated with differences in acid–base balance. The document notes that though the quality of the evidence is low, it suggests that severe hypernatremia and hyperchloremia from HTS are associated with AKI; clinicians should be mindful of the potential for hyperchloremia to induce metabolic acidosis, and clinicians should monitor renal function, electrolytes, and acid–base balance closely when using HTS.

### Mannitol [^117EGyfB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

During and following infusion of Mannitol Injection for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor the patient clinically and laboratory tests for changes in fluid and electrolyte status. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if renal function worsens [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

5.3 Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity

CNS toxicity manifested by, e.g., confusion, lethargy, coma, has been reported in patients treated with mannitol, some resulting in death, in particular in the presence of impaired renal function CNS toxicity may result from high serum mannitol concentrations, serum hyperosmolarity resulting in intracellular dehydration within CNS, hyponatremia or other disturbances of electrolyte and acid/base balance secondary to mannitol administration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].

At high concentrations, mannitol may cross the blood brain barrier and interfere with the ability of the brain to maintain the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid especially in the presence of acidosis.

In patients with pre-existing compromise of the blood brain barrier, the risk of increasing cerebral edema (general and focal) associated with repeated or continued use of Mannitol Injection must be individually weighed against the expected benefits.

A rebound increase of intracranial pressure may occur several hours after the infusion. Patients with a compromised blood brain barrier are at increased risk.

### Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride [^117WQjNg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

In saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.

### Propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen [^115HWuAn]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Blood gases, pH, and electrolytes should be monitored in order that acidosis and any electrolyte disturbance present may be corrected promptly. Acidosis, hypoxia, and generalized CNS depression predispose to the development of cardiac arrhythmias. Ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest may occur and necessitate the full complement of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) measures. Respiratory acidosis rapidly subsides as ventilation is restored and hypercapnia eliminated, but lactic acidosis may require intravenous bicarbonate for prompt correction.

Electrocardiographic monitoring is essential. Prompt correction of hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte disturbance (when present) will help prevent these cardiac complications and will increase the effectiveness of agents administered to restore normal cardiac function.

In addition to the use of narcotic antagonist, the patient may require careful titration with an anticonvulsant to control convulsions. Analeptic drugs (for example, caffeine or amphetamine) should not be used because of tendency to precipitate convulsions.

General supportive measures, in addition to oxygen, include, when necessary, intravenous fluids, vasopressor-inotropic compounds, and when infection is likely, anti-infective agents. Gastric lavage may be useful, and activated charcoal can adsorb a significant amount of ingested propoxyphene. Dialysis is of little value in poisoning due to propoxyphene. Efforts should be made to determine whether other agents such as alcohol, barbiturates, tranquilizers, or other CNS depressants, were also ingested, since these increase CNS depression as well as cause specific toxic effects.

Guidance statements — APAP is a dose-dependent hepatotoxin that leads to acute pericentral liver injury when doses exceeding 4 g are ingested within a 24-h period or excessive doses over several days; APAP overdose is the leading cause of ALF; a diagnosis of APAP hepatotoxicity relies on a history of excessive APAP ingestion, detection of an elevated serum APAP level following single-time-point ingestion, and exclusion of competing causes of acute hepatocellular liver injury; gastric lavage and activated charcoal should be given to all patients presenting within 4 h of a single-time-point APAP overdose; intravenous or orally administered N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can prevent liver injury nearly completely if given within 12 h of ingestion, but is also recommended for patients presenting later; the prognosis in APAP-related ALF is related to the degree of encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and acidosis.

WARNINGS

Lactic Acidosis:

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic
complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with
FORTAMET (metformin hydrochloride) Extended-Release
Tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic
acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant
tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated
blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/ L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte
disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate
ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin
plasma levels > 5 μg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients
receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000
patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years).
Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant
renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal
hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/ surgical
problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart
failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or
acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia,
are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases
with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic
acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of
renal function in patients taking FORTAMET (metformin
hydrochloride) Extended-Release Tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose
of FORTAMET. In particular, treatment of the elderly
should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. FORTAMET treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of
age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function
is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic
acidosis. In addition, FORTAMET should be promptly
withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia,
dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly
limit the ability to clear lactate, FORTAMET should
generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic
disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either
acute or chronic, when taking FORTAMET, since alcohol
potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In
addition, FORTAMET should be temporarily discontinued
prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure
(see also PRECAUTIONS).

BOXED WARNING

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin­-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin­-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), (2.7), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Sodium chloride, sodium lactate, potassium chloride, calcium chloride (Lactated ringers) [^111a3Mde]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS:

Although Lactated Ringer's Injection has a potassium concentration similar to the concentration in plasma, it is insufficient to produce a useful effect in case of severe potassium deficiency; therefore, it should not be used for this purpose.

Lactated Ringer's Injection is not for use for the treatment of lactic acidosis or severe metabolic acidosis.

Lactated Ringer's Injection should not be administered simultaneously with citrate anticoagulated/preserved blood through the same administration set because of the likelihood of coagulation.

The infusion must be stopped immediately if any signs or symptoms of a suspected hypersensitivity reaction develop. Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated. Hypersensitivity reactions are reported more frequently during pregnancy.

Depending on the volume and the rate of infusion, the intravenous administration of Lactated Ringer's Injection can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states, pulmonary edema or acid-base imbalance. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections.

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations may be necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient or the rate of administration warrants such evaluation.

Lactated Ringer's Injection should be administered with particular caution, if at all, to patients with hyperkalemia or conditions predisposing to hyperkalemia (such as severe renal impairment or adrenocortical insufficiency, acute dehydration, or extensive tissue injury or burns) and in patients with cardiac disease.

Lactated Ringer's Injection should be administered with particular caution, if at all, to patients with alkalosis or at risk for alkalosis. Because lactate is metabolized to bicarbonate, administration may result in, or worsen, metabolic alkalosis.

Lactated Ringer's Injection should be administered with particular caution, if at all, to patients with severe renal impairment, hypervolemia, overhydration, or conditions that may cause sodium and/or potassium retention, fluid overload, or edema.

### Canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Invokamet) [^114QqnuT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].
If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride [^111CWBSZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol, and metformin and ibuprofen were not affected when coadministered in single-dose interaction studies.

Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins.

Other

Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors

Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently causes a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients.

Alcohol

Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets.

### Arsenic exposure, assessment, toxicity, diagnosis, and management: guidance for occupational and environmental physicians [^116CPs52]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Arsenic toxicity — chelation and supportive care are outlined as follows: Chelation therapy is typically reserved for patients with severe acute toxicity and is most effective when initiated within minutes to hours; chelation therapy is rarely indicated with less severe acute toxicity, or with chronic toxicity. DMPS and DMSA have a higher therapeutic index than BAL and do not redistribute arsenic to the brain, and an FDA advisory committee has recommended that intravenous DMPS be available for compounding in hospital settings for the treatment of severe acute poisoning by arsenic. Supportive measures for arsenic gas poisoning should focus on maintaining fluid balance with intravenous hydration, and osmotic diuresis with mannitol may be helpful to maintain urine output and decrease the risk of renal failure. Removal from further arsenic exposures, if possible, is important.

### Dapagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Xigduo) [^111xpXvs]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

There have been post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by non‑specific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of XIGDUO XR.

In XIGDUO XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — metabolic abnormalities and mitochondrial evaluation: During vomiting episodes, mild mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested by anion gap metabolic acidosis that "is often 15–20 mg/dL", lactic acidosis, urinary ketosis early in the episode, and/or hypoglycemia, and these findings "by themselves do not necessitate a comprehensive metabolic workup". When present, early testing with quantitative urine organic acids and plasma amino acids "can confirm mild mitochondrial dysfunction" by elevated urine ketones, Krebs cycle intermediates, and/or dicarboxylic acids, while "urine organic acids are typically normal" when asymptomatic or after several hours of intravenous dextrose. In some cases, episodes may reflect mitochondrial disease with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis " > 20 mg/dL", insulin resistance, and/or multisystem failure such as cardiomyopathy or seizures.

### Heart failure related cardiogenic shock: an ISHLT consensus conference content summary [^111B9Fva]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) initial fundamental testing includes markers of hypoperfusion and organ injury, with lactate emphasized for severity assessment and resuscitation tracking. Lactate levels (venous or arterial) are considered integral, and a high lactate with other CS signs should provoke rapid investigation. Serial lactate clearance is increasingly validated as an optimal prognostic marker with greater (6–8 hours) and later (24 hours) clearance associated with outcomes including mortality. Beyond lactate, the severity of acidosis (anion gap, pH, bicarbonate, base excess) is associated with shock severity, non-cardiovascular organ failures and in-hospital mortality, and differentiating CS from other shock can be aided by evaluating mixed venous saturation, systemic vascular resistance, and infections (cultures, imaging, procalcitonin).

### Guidelines for burn care under austere conditions: introduction to burn disaster, airway and ventilator management, and fluid resuscitation [^11367ozX]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Cyanide toxicity in mass burn disasters — oxygen should be administered to all patients with clinical symptoms, and oxygen alone may be sufficient for very mild toxicity when antidote is limited; indications for antidote therapy include decreased mental status, hypotension, apnea, lactic acidosis, or signs of myocardial ischemia. Two available antidotes are hydroxocobalamin, and sodium nitrite with sodium thiosulfate; they can be administered intravenously (IV) or intraosseously, but not intramuscularly. Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate together are effective, sodium nitrite causes methemoglobinemia and hypotension, sodium thiosulfate was ineffective when administered alone in cyanide-induced hypotension, and hydroxocobalamin is also effective but adds a red hue to body fluids and the skin which interferes with some laboratory test methods. In a resource-limited setting, ration both cyanide therapies and oxygen; those with no clinical symptoms may only require observation without oxygen, those with mild symptoms may benefit from low-flow oxygen, and antidotes should be reserved for patients with persistent lactic acidosis and hypotension despite adequate resuscitation and oxygen therapy.

Risk factors include Preterm Infants or Any Neonates Who Have Not Attained a Postmenstrual Age of 42 Weeks and a Postnatal Age of ≥ 14 Days and exposure to propylene glycol used as a diluent in LPV/r oral solution. For Patients With Clinical Signs or Symptoms Consistent With Lactic Acidosis, obtain blood lactate level and additional diagnostic evaluations should include serum bicarbonate, anion gap, and/or arterial blood gas; amylase and lipase; serum albumin; and hepatic transaminases; blood for lactate determination should be collected and processed within 4 hours of collection. Management includes Anecdotal (Unproven) Supportive Therapies — administer bicarbonate infusions, THAM (tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane), high doses of thiamine and riboflavin, and oral antioxidants (e.g. L-carnitine, co-enzyme Q10, vitamin C). Following resolution of abnormalities, resume therapy either with an NRTI-sparing regimen or a revised NRTI-containing regimen, and institute a revised NRTI-containing regimen with caution using NRTIs that are less likely to induce mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e. ABC, TAF, TDF, FTC, or 3TC); lactate should be monitored monthly for ≥ 3 months. Management can be initiated before receiving the results of the confirmatory test.

### Pioglitazone and metformin [^1159rBuH]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

5.2 Lactic Acidosis

Metformin hydrochloride

Lactic Acidosis

Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years. In more than 20,000 patient-years, exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, because alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10, 5.11, 5.12, 5.13)]. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may frequently cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

Stimulant intoxication — dehydration and electrolyte and fluid imbalances are managed according to best practices. Dehydration is a common consequence of stimulant intoxication that can result in electrolyte and fluid imbalances, no studies were identified on managing these concerns specific to stimulant intoxication or withdrawal, and the CGC did not propose any clinical recommendations related to these concerns; dehydration and electrolyte and fluid imbalance should be managed according to standard best practices. In this context, hyponatremia is typically seen with confusion, reduced consciousness, or seizures caused by water intoxication from excessive hydration during 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) intoxication, and the CGC agreed that stimulant-related hyponatremia should be managed according to best practices by replacing sodium.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^1139M4Yt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Table 5 — etiologies of acute liver failure — details typical presentations, laboratory patterns, and timing cues across major causes. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity often follows ingestion of > 10 g and can show marked transaminase elevation with relatively low bilirubin, with rapid progression to ALF accompanied by hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and renal failure within 72–96 hr. Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury is not necessarily dose dependent with highly variable latency, and antimicrobials followed by complementary and alternative medications are common culprits. Viral hepatitis notes that hepatitis A, B, and E virus infections are most common and a viral prodrome often precedes ALF; prognosis is reported as Variable (favorable for HAV, but poor for HBV, and HEV during pregnancy). Pregnancy-related ALF commonly involves HELLP syndrome or acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP), both occurring in the third trimester or immediately postpartum, with a hepatocellular pattern and median AST/ALT > 10× ULN. Autoimmune hepatitis shows a predominantly hepatocellular pattern with marked transaminase elevation and elevated anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle actin antibody, and immunoglobulin G levels. Wilson disease may have modest transaminase elevation with normal or very low alkaline phosphatase and can present with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and rapid progression to renal failure. Mushroom poisoning presents with severe gastroenteritis at 6–12 hr after ingestion, evolving hepatotoxicity within 24–36 hr, and progressive liver and multiorgan failure within 4–7 d. Budd-Chiari syndrome most commonly affects women in their fourth to fifth decades of life; laboratory findings include transaminase elevation in the 1000s and an AST:ALT ratio that often exceeds 1.

### Sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride (Zituvimet XR) [^113s2xcK]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of ZITUVIMET XR. In ZITUVIMET XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue GLUMETZA and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Pediatric acute liver failure — cerebral edema specific therapies are outlined, including hypothermia and ventilatory and osmotherapy measures: Hypothermia (core body temperature 32–33°C) was reported to improve outcome in small case series, but was not found to confer benefit in two randomized trials; indomethacin has been studied but concerns regarding bleeding risk and renal toxicity has likely precluded its acceptance; forced hyperventilation to reduce pCO2 below 34 mmHg with brief (e.g., 20 min) bursts may be most effective as extended hypocapnia may place the patient at risk for hypoxia; hyperosmolar therapy options include mannitol 0.5–1.0 g/kg with attention to cardiovascular status and note of no additional benefit if serum osmolality is > 320 mOsm/kg, and hypertonic saline (2–3.4%) to maintain serum sodium between 145 and 155 meq/L, with transtentorial herniation reported reversed with 23.4% which may extend the window for liver transplantation.

### Fosphenytoin sodium (Cerebyx) [^117G5Gw7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Nausea, vomiting, lethargy, tachycardia, bradycardia, asystole, cardiac arrest, hypotension, syncope, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, and death have been reported in cases of overdosage with CEREBYX.

Because CEREBYX is a prodrug of phenytoin, the following information about phenytoin overdosage may be helpful. Initial symptoms of acute phenytoin toxicity are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs include tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, nausea, vomiting, coma, and hypotension. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. The lethal dose of phenytoin in adults is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The lethal dose in pediatrics is not known.

There are marked variations among individuals with respect to serum phenytoin concentrations where toxicity occurs. Lateral gaze nystagmus usually appears at 20 µg/mL, ataxia at 30 µg/mL, and dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 µg/mL. However, phenytoin concentrations as high as 50 µg/mL have been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic phenytoin dose has been taken, resulting in serum phenytoin concentrations over 100 µg/mL, with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported after overdosage.

Formate and phosphate are metabolites of CEREBYX and therefore may contribute to signs of toxicity following overdosage. Signs of formate toxicity are similar to those of methanol toxicity and are associated with severe anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Large amounts of phosphate, delivered rapidly, could potentially cause hypocalcemia with paresthesia, muscle spasms, and seizures. Ionized free calcium levels can be measured and, if low, used to guide treatment.

Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote to CEREBYX or phenytoin overdosage.

The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed, and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin (the active metabolite of CEREBYX) is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in children.

In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind.

### Mannitol (Osmitrol) [^113Q2biz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances, Hyperosmolarity

Depending on dosage and duration, administration of OSMITROL may result in hypervolemia leading to or exacerbating existing congestive heart failure. Accumulation of mannitol due to insufficient renal excretion increases the risk of hypervolemia. Mannitol-induced osmotic diuresis may cause or worsen dehydration/hypovolemia and hemoconcentration. Administration of OSMITROL may also cause hyperosmolarity [see Description (11)].

Depending on dosage and duration of administration, electrolyte and acid/base imbalances may also result from transcellular shifts in water and electrolytes, osmotic diuresis and/or other mechanisms. Such imbalances may be severe and potentially fatal.

Imbalances that may result from OSMITROL administration include:

Hypernatremia, dehydration and hemoconcentration
Hyponatremia, which can lead to headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy, coma, cerebral edema, and death. Acute symptomatic hyponatremic encephalopathy is considered a medical emergency.
Hypo/hyperkalemia. The development of electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyperkalemia, hypokalemia) associated with mannitol administration may result in cardiac adverse reactions in patients receiving drugs that are sensitive to such imbalances (e.g., digoxin, agents that may cause QT prolongation, neuromuscular blocking agents) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].
Other electrolyte disturbances
Metabolic acidosis/alkalosis

Pediatric patients less than two years of age, particularly preterm and term neonates, may be at higher risk for fluid and electrolyte abnormalities following OSMITROL administration due to decreased glomerular filtration rate and limited ability to concentrate urine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

During and following OSMITROL infusion for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor fluid and electrolyte status and discontinue OSMITROL if imbalances occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

5.5 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests

During and following OSMITROL infusion for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor:

serum osmolarity, serum electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphate) and acid base balance,
the osmol gap
signs of hypo- or hypervolemia, including urine output
renal, cardiac and pulmonary function
intracranial pressure

Discontinue OSMITROL if renal, cardiac, or pulmonary status worsens or CNS toxicity develops [see Contraindications (4)].

PRECAUTIONS

The following cases should be used with caution:

Diabetic patients taking biguanides (especially hypoglycemic), hinder the liver's utilization of lactic acid, easy to cause lactic acid poisoning;
Edema patients with a tendency to sodium retention;
Hypertension patients can increase blood pressure;
Heart dysfunction;
The rate of lactic acid degradation is slowed down when liver function is not complete, so as to delay the correction speed of acidosis;
Hypoxia and shock, insufficient tissue blood supply and hypoxia when lactic acid oxidation into pyruvate into tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism slowed down, so as to delay the correction speed of acidosis;
Alcoholism, salicylic acid poisoning, type I glycogen deposition disease have lactic acidosis tendency, it is not appropriate to use sodium lactate to correct the acid-base balance;
When diabetic ketoacidosis acetoacetic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid and lactic acid are increased, and often accompanied by poor circulation or insufficient blood supply of organs, lactic acid degradation rate is slowed down;
Renal insufficiency, prone to water and sodium retention, increase cardiovascular load.

The following tests and observations should be made during medication:

Blood pH and/or carbon dioxide binding force;
Serum sodium, potassium, calcium, chlorine concentration determination;
Determination of renal function, including creatinine, urea nitrogen, etc.;
Blood pressure;
Cardiopulmonary function status, such as edema, shortness of breath, cyanosis, pulmonary rale, jugular vein filling, hepato-jugular vein regurgitation, venous pressure or central venous pressure measurement as needed;
Liver insufficiency performance jaundice, change of mind, ascites, etc., applied before and after sodium lactate and in the application process, often observed at any time.

### Mannitol (Osmitrol) [^112dBdQK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity

CNS toxicity manifested by, e.g., confusion, lethargy, coma has been reported in patients treated with mannitol, some resulting in death, in particular in the presence of impaired renal function CNS toxicity may result from high serum mannitol concentrations, serum hyperosmolarity resulting in intracellular dehydration within CNS, hyponatremia or other disturbances of electrolyte and acid/base balance secondary to mannitol administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

At high concentrations, mannitol may cross the blood brain barrier and interfere with the ability of the brain to maintain the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid especially in the presence of acidosis.

In patients with preexisting compromise of the blood brain barrier, the risk of increasing cerebral edema (general and focal) associated with repeated or continued use of OSMITROL must be individually weighed against the expected benefits.

A rebound increase of intracranial pressure may occur several hours after the infusion. Patients with a compromised blood brain barrier are at increased risk.

Concomitant administration of neurotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides) with OSMITROL may potentiate neurotoxicity. Avoid concomitant use of neurotoxic drugs, if possible [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

During and following OSMITROL infusion for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor the patient clinically and laboratory tests for changes in fluid and electrolyte status. Discontinue OSMITROL if CNS toxicity develops [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

Metformin

Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with JENTADUETO and is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels of > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin is approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, (with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia due to unstable or acute failure, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children [^115oPwqT]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Tonicity, osmolality, and solution composition considerations for maintenance IVFs: Tonicity is used to describe the net vector of force on cells relative to a semipermeable membrane when in solution, with infused isotonic fluids not resulting in osmotic shifts so the cells stay the same size, cellular expansion occurring during immersion in hypotonic fluids, and in hypertonic fluid immersion free water shifting out of the cells leading to cellular contraction; osmolality is measured as osmoles of solute per kilogram of solvent and serum osmolality can be estimated by the formula 2 × Na(meq/L) + BUN (mg/dL)/2.8 + glucose (mg/dL)/18; the buffer in plasma is bicarbonate but commercially available solutions may include various concentrations of lactate, acetate, and gluconate, and multiple balanced salt solutions can be compared with normal saline (0.9% saline), which has the same sodium concentration as plasma but a supraphysiologic chloride concentration; dextrose (D-glucose) can be added to IVFs and although it affects the osmolality of IVFs, it is not a significant contributor to the plasma osmotic pressure or tonicity.

Hypertonic sodium solutions (HTS) — associations with acute kidney injury (AKI) include that six studies evaluated the relationship between use of HTS, hypernatremia, and AKI, with serum sodium ranges (generally 155–160 mEq/L). In the only study designed to distinguish between serum sodium and serum chloride in predicting AKI, continuous infusion 3% NaCl in a mixed neurocritical care population was reviewed and Sixteen percent of patients developed AKI, which was associated with a longer intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and a greater in-hospital mortality. Five independent risk factors for AKI were identified including severe hypernatremia (serum sodium > 155 mEq/L), and Hyperchloremia (serum chloride > 110 mEq/L), severe hypernatremia, and hyperosmolarity were more common in the AKI group; other studies have conflicting results, and hyperchloremia has been implicated in the development of AKI in several observational studies.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced diabetes mellitus — Case description: A 56-year-old man with unresectable stage III melanoma received 9 doses of Nivo at 240 mg every 2 weeks and presented 2 weeks after the last dose with severe hyperglycemia with a plasma glucose level of > 350 mg/dL, serum ketones, and an anion gap, consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis. At admission HbA1c was 9.0% or 75 mmol/mol, compared with 5.7% or 38 mmol/mol 8 years prior. Autoimmunity testing showed glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibody 6.4 mIU/mL (normal range = 0.0–5.0 mIU/mL) and absent islet cell antibodies (titer < 1:1). Thyroid function was normal with TSH 1.02 mIU/L (normal range = 0.45–5.33 mIU/L) and free T4 1.03 ng/dL (normal range = 0.64–1.42 ng/dL); thyroperoxidase antibody was 13 IU/mL (normal range = 0–34 IU/mL). Morning cortisol was 11 μg/dL with negative 21-hydroxylase antibodies, and the patient was discharged on basal and meal-time insulin.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^1176vRoq]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Mannitol monitoring and acute kidney injury (AKI) risk — clinicians commonly use a serum osmolality of 320 mOsm/kg or an osmolar gap of 20–55 mOsm/kg to estimate the risk of AKI with mannitol. Early publications described a serum osmolality threshold of 320 mOsm/L, whereas recent studies have shown that an osmolality threshold of greater than 320 mOsm/L does not affect the incidence of AKI. In one case series of eight patients with mannitol-induced AKI, an elevated osmolar gap was present in all but two patients (mean osmolar gap 74 mOsm/kg). Clinicians should monitor intravascular volume status, renal function, and some measure of serum osmolarity closely when using mannitol in patients with cerebral edema.

### Metformin hydrochloride (Riomet) [^112FuT6E]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin ‑ associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin ‑ associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue RIOMET and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^113ts8a4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — supportive care and fluids during acute episodes include early intervention and targeted metabolic management. Expert opinion supports the efficacy of early intervention within the first several hours of onset of CVS. Supportive care during acute episodes includes providing a less stimulating environment; replacement of fluids, electrolytes, and energy; use of antiemetics with or without sedation; and provision of analgesia for pain. Some experts recommend higher amounts of intravenous dextrose-containing fluids (D10 0.45 normal saline); the intent of 10% dextrose concentration is to attenuate the incipient metabolic crisis. If late-phase evaluation reveals substantial fluid and/or electrolyte deficits, the task force recommends infusing 0.9% NaCl replacement fluid through a "Y" connecter parallel to the D10. An increased anion gap (> 18–20 mEq/L) may reflect severe dehydration or signal metabolic decompensation and the need for hospital admission. After 2 to 3 days of minimal energy and/or protein intake, illness may be prolonged and can be reversed with nutrition to provide an adequate energy intake and 1.5 g of protein per kilogram per day. In seriously ill patients, administering higher amounts of glucose (eg, 8–12 mg glucose/kg/min) with or without concomitant insulin, close acidosis monitoring, and metabolic consultation are described as critical to management.

### Fomepizole [^113mpXCK]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Do not use polycarbonate syringes or polycarbonate-containing needles (including polycarbonate filter needles) when diluting or administering Fomepizole Injection, 1.5 g/1.5 mL (1 g/mL). Fomepizole can interact with polycarbonate, compromising the integrity of the syringe and/or needle component containing polycarbonate.

Treatment Guidelines: If ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning is left untreated, the natural progression of the poisoning leads to accumulation of toxic metabolites, including glycolic and oxalic acids (ethylene glycol intoxication) and formic acid (methanol intoxication). These metabolites can induce metabolic acidosis, nausea/vomiting, seizures, stupor, coma, calcium oxaluria, acute tubular necrosis, blindness, and death. The diagnosis of these poisonings may be difficult because ethylene glycol and methanol concentrations diminish in the blood as they are metabolized to their respective metabolites. Hence, both ethylene glycol and methanol concentrations and acid base balance, as determined by serum electrolyte (anion gap) and/or arterial blood gas analysis, should be frequently monitored and used to guide treatment.

Treatment consists of blocking the formation of toxic metabolites using inhibitors of alcohol dehydrogenase, such as fomepizole, and correction of metabolic abnormalities. In patients with high ethylene glycol or methanol concentrations (≥ 50 mg/dL), significant metabolic acidosis, or renal failure, hemodialysis should be considered to remove ethylene glycol or methanol and the respective toxic metabolites of these alcohols.

Treatment with fomepizole:

Begin fomepizole treatment immediately upon suspicion of ethylene glycol or methanol ingestion based on patient history and/or anion gap metabolic acidosis, increased osmolar gap, visual disturbances, or oxalate crystals in the urine, OR a documented serum ethylene glycol or methanol concentration greater than 20 mg/dL.

Hemodialysis:

Hemodialysis should be considered in addition to fomepizole in the case of renal failure, significant or worsening metabolic acidosis, or a measured ethylene glycol or methanol concentration of greater than or equal to 50 mg/dL. Patients should be dialyzed to correct metabolic abnormalities and to lower the ethylene glycol concentrations below 50 mg/dL.

Discontinuation of fomepizole Treatment:

Treatment with fomepizole may be discontinued when ethylene glycol or methanol concentrations are undetectable or have been reduced below 20 mg/dL, and the patient is asymptomatic with normal pH.

### Glyburide and metformin [^112JrXzC]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Lactic Acidosis

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with glyburide and metformin; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Glyburide and metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, glyburide and metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, glyburide and metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking glyburide and metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

Lactic Acidosis — There have been post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increases lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets. In Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions).

### Lactic acidosis… [^112ojxts]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

ALTHOUGH endogenous lactic acid has been recognized as a source of metabolic acidosis for many years in a variety of situations, 1–5 it was not until the publication by Huckabee of his clinical observations of the significance of lactic acid acidosis 6, 7 that great interest was stimulated in this condition. The demonstration that severe metabolic acidosis, frequently of fatal outcome, was a significant clinical problem has led to the increasing recognition of this situation in clinical practice. 5, 8–17. The definition of lactic acidosis remains arbitrary. Since the production of lactate is always accompanied by an equivalent appearance of hydrogen ion, significant elevation in blood lactate must be interpreted as lactic acidosis regardless of resultant arterial pH or bicarbonate levels.

Qualifying factors include the degree of compensation for the metabolic acidosis, represented by arterial pH, eventual outcome, the presence or absence of clinical symptoms of metabolic acidosis. TRANQUADA RE, GRANT WJ, PETERSON CR. Lactic Acidosis. Arch Intern Med. 1966; 117: 192–202.
