## Question

Argatroban in AIS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of argatroban in acute ischemic stroke, including its efficacy, safety, guideline positioning, and practical use cases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where argatroban has been tested. Then, I should appraise the highest-quality randomized trials by design, outcomes, and limitations. Next, I will integrate guideline positions and weigh benefits versus risks. After that, I should consider special populations and mechanistic hypotheses. Finally, I will translate this into a cautious, clinically actionable recommendation with monitoring and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts in which argatroban has been evaluated in AIS, because conflating scenarios can mislead conclusions. The main settings are: adjunct to intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5 hours of onset, adjunct to thrombolysis in patients proceeding to thrombectomy, monotherapy in patients with early neurological deterioration, and combination with dual antiplatelet therapy in branch atheromatous disease, with most contemporary data from China and the United States, and some Japanese observational cohorts informing safety signals [^115nU7gA] [^113ZtLS7] [^115BPem3] [^1148NcRG] [^116vrpUj].

> Now, I will examine the highest-quality evidence for adjunct argatroban with IV thrombolysis, starting with ARAIS, a multicenter RCT of 808 patients within 4.5 hours of onset. Wait, let me verify the primary endpoint and results: excellent functional outcome at 90 days was 63.8% with argatroban plus alteplase versus 64.9% with alteplase alone, with no significant difference and similar symptomatic ICH rates, indicating no benefit and acceptable safety in this population [^115nU7gA] [^113phFzo].

> Next, I should review MOST, a phase 3 adaptive RCT that added argatroban or eptifibatide within 75 minutes of IV thrombolysis. Hold on, I should double-check the primary outcome and safety signals: utility-weighted mRS at 90 days showed no benefit for argatroban versus placebo, and critically, 90-day mortality was higher with argatroban at 24% versus 8% with placebo, despite similar sICH rates, which raises a red flag for harm in this strategy [^113ZtLS7] [^116EwaKF] [^112hkHsu].

> I will now examine argatroban monotherapy in early neurological deterioration, the EASE trial in JAMA Neurology. Let me verify the design and primary endpoint: 628 patients with END within 48 hours were randomized to argatroban plus standard antiplatelet therapy versus antiplatelet therapy alone, with a primary outcome of good functional outcome at 90 days. The argatroban group achieved 80.5% versus 73.3% in controls, a statistically significant absolute risk difference of 7.2% and RR 1.10, with no excess symptomatic ICH, suggesting benefit in this narrowly selected population [^115BPem3] [^1169utCd] [^115NJNqY].

> But wait, what if the benefit is confined to a specific stroke mechanism? Let me consider branch atheromatous disease, where END risk is high even on DAPT. A recent randomized trial in BAD showed that argatroban plus DAPT reduced END and improved 90-day functional outcomes versus DAPT alone without increasing bleeding, which mechanistically aligns with the hypothesis that thrombin-driven propagation contributes to deterioration in small-vessel atherothrombotic disease [^1148NcRG] [^115T8thv].

> I should confirm guideline positions before drawing conclusions. The 2019 AHA/ASA guideline update states that the usefulness of argatroban and other thrombin inhibitors for AIS is not well established and recommends against urgent anticoagulation for AIS, reflecting the neutral ARAIS results and the absence of definitive benefit signals at that time. This remains the most authoritative North American position pending newer guideline updates [^113aaDDn] [^116T9EPZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to weigh benefits versus risks across contexts. In IV thrombolysis, ARAIS showed no benefit and MOST suggested increased mortality with argatroban, so routine adjunctive use is not justified. In END, EASE shows a modest but significant functional benefit with reassuring safety, though the open-label design and Chinese population limit generalizability. In BAD, a small RCT suggests benefit, but replication is needed before routine adoption [^115nU7gA] [^113ZtLS7] [^115BPem3] [^1148NcRG].

> Let me consider special populations and mechanistic plausibility. Post hoc analyses of ARAIS suggest potential reductions in early neurological deterioration in patients with higher NIHSS, but these are hypothesis-generating and not definitive. Theoretical advantages of direct thrombin inhibition on microthrombi and reocclusion are plausible, yet translation to improved functional outcomes has been inconsistent across trials and populations [^115vFGSB] [^112KeVnL] [^117JnDCA].

> I should double-check safety nuances, especially hepatic metabolism and monitoring. Argatroban is hepatically cleared and requires dose adjustment and careful aPTT monitoring in hepatic impairment. Across trials, sICH rates have generally been similar to control arms when used as adjuncts or monotherapy, but MOST's mortality signal underscores the need for caution and judicious patient selection rather than blanket use [^115vSfeR] [^115nU7gA] [^115BPem3] [^113ZtLS7].

> Translating this into practice, I need to ensure recommendations are cautious and context-specific. Do not add argatroban to standard IV thrombolysis outside of a trial, given ARAIS neutrality and MOST harm. Consider argatroban in carefully selected patients with early neurological deterioration after excluding hemorrhage and other causes, ideally in a monitored setting, recognizing the open-label design and need for external validation. In BAD, argatroban plus DAPT is promising but should be individualized pending broader confirmation. Always screen for hepatic disease, adjust dosing, and monitor aPTT if used [^115nU7gA] [^113ZtLS7] [^115BPem3] [^1148NcRG] [^115vSfeR].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: argatroban is not indicated as routine adjunct to IV thrombolysis in AIS, shows a signal for benefit in early neurological deterioration in a single RCT, and may have a role in branch atheromatous disease, but current guideline support is limited and practice should remain selective, mechanism-targeted, and safety-conscious until larger confirmatory trials are completed [^115nU7gA] [^113ZtLS7] [^115BPem3] [^1148NcRG] [^113aaDDn].

Argatroban is **not recommended for routine use** in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) [^113aaDDn] because large, high-quality RCTs show no added benefit when combined with IV thrombolysis [^115nU7gA] and increased mortality in some settings [^113ZtLS7]. It may be considered for patients with early neurological deterioration (END) [^115BPem3] or branch atheromatous disease (BAD) [^1148NcRG] who did not receive thrombolysis, but evidence is limited and not guideline-endorsed. Argatroban is not superior to standard care for AIS and should not replace IV thrombolysis or endovascular therapy [^115nU7gA]; use is restricted to research or select cases with careful risk–benefit assessment.

## Clinical evidence for argatroban in AIS

### Adjunctive therapy with intravenous thrombolysis

- **ARAIS trial**: 808 patients within 4.5 hours of onset; argatroban plus alteplase vs alteplase alone showed no significant difference in excellent functional outcomes (63.8% vs 64.9%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88–1.10) [^115nU7gA] and similar symptomatic ICH rates (2.1% vs 1.8%) [^113phFzo].

- **MOST trial**: 514 patients within 3 hours of thrombolysis; argatroban did not improve utility-weighted mRS (5.2 vs 6.8; posterior mean difference −1.51, 95% CI −3.09 to 0.07) and was associated with higher 90-day mortality (24% vs 8%) [^113ZtLS7], despite similar sICH rates (4% vs 2%) [^116EwaKF].

- **ARTSS-2**: 90 patients; argatroban plus alteplase showed no significant difference in excellent outcomes vs alteplase alone (30% vs 21%; RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.68–2.76) and similar sICH rates (13% vs 10%) [^116PndB7].

---

### Monotherapy in AIS without thrombolysis

In the **EASE trial** (628 patients with END within 48 hours) [^115BPem3], argatroban plus antiplatelet therapy improved good functional outcomes at 90 days (80.5% vs 73.3%; RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01–1.20) with similar sICH rates (0.9% vs 0.7%) [^115L4s84]. In **branch atheromatous disease (BAD)** [^1148NcRG], a small RCT showed argatroban plus dual antiplatelet therapy reduced early neurological deterioration and improved 90-day outcomes vs DAPT alone, without excess bleeding [^113Jjwfm].

---

## Safety profile

Argatroban has a **favorable pharmacokinetic profile** with a short half-life (~40–50 min) [^113kqPvt] and hepatic metabolism, allowing rapid reversal on discontinuation. Across trials, sICH rates are similar to controls when used with thrombolysis or as monotherapy, but MOST showed increased mortality with argatroban, warranting caution [^113ZtLS7].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current AHA/ASA guidelines state that the usefulness of argatroban in AIS is **not well established** [^113aaDDn] and recommend against routine use; argatroban is not endorsed as adjunctive therapy with IV thrombolysis or as monotherapy for AIS [^116T9EPZ].

---

## Comparison with standard care

| **Clinical scenario** | **Argatroban** | **Standard care** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Adjunct to IV thrombolysis | No benefit; possible harm | IV alteplase alone | High (ARAIS, MOST) [^115nU7gA] [^113ZtLS7] |
| Monotherapy in AIS | Limited benefit in select subgroups | Antiplatelet therapy | Moderate (EASE, BAD trial) [^115BPem3] [^1148NcRG] |
| Safety | Similar sICH; higher mortality in MOST | Standard care | High (ARAIS, MOST) [^115nU7gA] [^113ZtLS7] |

## Clinical scenarios for potential argatroban use

Argatroban may be considered in **select scenarios**, though evidence is limited:

- **Early neurological deterioration (END)**: EASE suggests benefit when added to antiplatelet therapy, but confirmation is needed [^115BPem3].

- **Branch atheromatous disease (BAD)**: Small RCT suggests reduced progression and improved outcomes with argatroban plus DAPT, but larger trials are needed [^1148NcRG].

- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)**: Argatroban is indicated for HIT and may be used in AIS patients with HIT, though this is not AIS-specific evidence [^114uXE1R].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **Lack of large-scale RCTs**: Most AIS data are from moderate-sized trials; larger, multicenter studies are needed [^notfound].

- **Population heterogeneity**: Many studies are from Asian cohorts; generalizability to Western populations is uncertain [^113CDtmu].

- **Optimal dosing and duration**: Unclear whether different dosing or longer courses could improve outcomes [^117JnDCA].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing studies are evaluating argatroban in **specific AIS subtypes**, including BAD and END, and exploring biomarker-driven selection. Future research should prioritize large, multicenter RCTs to clarify efficacy, safety, and patient selection.

---

Argatroban is **not recommended for routine AIS care** because large RCTs show no added benefit with thrombolysis and increased mortality in some settings [^115nU7gA] [^113ZtLS7]. It may be considered for END or BAD in patients not receiving thrombolysis, but evidence is limited and not guideline-endorsed. Argatroban should not replace standard reperfusion therapies and should be used cautiously in select cases.

Importance

The effect of argatroban in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and early neurological deterioration (END) is unknown.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of argatroban for END in AIS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This open-label, blinded-end point, randomized clinical trial was conducted from April 4, 2020, through July 31, 2022. The date of final follow-up was October 31, 2022. This was a multicenter trial. Eligible patients were adults with AIS who experienced END, which was defined as an increase of 2 or more points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale within 48 hours from symptom onset. Patients who withdrew consent, experienced duplicate randomization, or were lost to follow-up were excluded from the study.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to the argatroban group and control group within 48 hours of symptom onset. Both groups received standard therapy based on guidelines, including oral mono or dual antiplatelet therapy. The argatroban group received intravenous argatroban for 7 days (continuous infusion at a dose of 60 mg per day for 2 days, followed by 20 mg per day for 5 days) in addition to standard therapy.

Main Outcome and Measure

The primary end point was good functional outcome at 90 days, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 3.

Results

A total of 628 patients (mean [SD] age, 65 [11.9] years; 400 male [63.7%]) were included in this study (argatroban group, 314 [50%] and control group, 314 [50%]). Of these, 18 withdrew consent, 1 had duplicate randomization, and 8 were lost to follow-up. A total of 601 patients with stroke were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Finally, 564 patients were included in the per-protocol analysis as 6 participants in the argatroban group and 31 participants in the control group did not follow the complete protocol. The number of patients with good functional outcome at 90 days was 240 (80.5%) in the argatroban group and 222 (73.3%) in the control group (risk difference, 7.2%; 95% CI, 0.6%-14.0%; risk ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01–1.20; P = 0.04). The proportion of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 3 of 317 (0.9%) in the argatroban group and 2 of 272 (0.7%) in the control group (P = 0.78).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with AIS with END, treatment with argatroban and antiplatelet therapy resulted in a better functional outcome at 90 days. This trial provided evidence to support the use of argatroban in reducing disability for patients with END.

### Effect of argatroban plus intravenous alteplase vs intravenous alteplase alone on neurologic function in patients with acute ischemic stroke: the ARAIS randomized clinical trial [^115nU7gA]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Previous studies suggested a benefit of argatroban plus alteplase (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, robust evidence in trials with large sample sizes is lacking.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of argatroban plus alteplase for AIS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter, open-label, blinded end point randomized clinical trial including 808 patients with AIS was conducted at 50 hospitals in China with enrollment from January 18, 2019, through October 30, 2021, and final follow-up on January 24, 2022.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomly assigned within 4.5 hours of symptom onset to the argatroban plus alteplase group (n = 402), which received intravenous argatroban (100 μg/kg bolus over 3–5 minutes followed by an infusion of 1.0 μg/kg per minute for 48 hours) within 1 hour after alteplase (0.9 mg/kg; maximum dose, 90 mg; 10% administered as 1-minute bolus, remaining infused over 1 hour), or alteplase alone group (n = 415), which received intravenous alteplase alone. Both groups received guideline-based treatments.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was excellent functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) of 0 to 1 at 90 days. All end points had blinded assessment and were analyzed on a full analysis set.

Results

Among 817 eligible patients with AIS who were randomized (median [IQR] age, 65 [57–71] years; 238 [29.1%] women; median [IQR] National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 9 [7–12]), 760 (93.0%) completed the trial. At 90 days, 210 of 329 participants (63.8%) in the argatroban plus alteplase group vs 238 of 367 (64.9%) in the alteplase alone group had an excellent functional outcome (risk difference, -1.0% [95% CI, -8.1% to 6.1%]; risk ratio, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.88–1.10]; P = 0.78). The percentages of participants with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, parenchymal hematoma type 2, and major systemic bleeding were 2.1% (8/383), 2.3% (9/383), and 0.3% (1/383), respectively, in the argatroban plus alteplase group and 1.8% (7/397), 2.5% (10/397), and 0.5% (2/397), respectively, in the alteplase alone group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with acute ischemic stroke, treatment with argatroban plus intravenous alteplase compared with alteplase alone did not result in a significantly greater likelihood of excellent functional outcome at 90 days.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Anticoagulants in acute ischemic stroke — The usefulness of urgent anticoagulation in patients with severe stenosis of an internal carotid artery ipsilateral to an ischemic stroke is not well established. The safety and usefulness of short-term anticoagulation for nonocclusive, extracranial intraluminal thrombus in the setting of AIS are not well established. At present, the usefulness of argatroban, dabigatran, or other thrombin inhibitors for the treatment of patients with AIS is not well established. The safety and usefulness of oral factor Xa inhibitors in the treatment of AIS are not well established. Urgent anticoagulation, with the goal of preventing early recurrent stroke, halting neurological worsening, or improving outcomes after AIS, is not recommended for treatment of patients with AIS.

### Effect of argatroban plus intravenous alteplase vs intravenous alteplase alone on neurologic function in patients with acute ischemic stroke: the ARAIS randomized clinical trial [^113phFzo]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study ARAIS was published by Hui-Sheng Chen and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the ARAIS study, the trial question was: what is the role of argatroban plus intravenous alteplase in patients with AIS? In the ARAIS study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ARAIS study, the population was: 760 patients (222 female, 538 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with AIS who were assigned within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The key exclusion criteria were presence of disability in the community before the stroke; history of intracerebral hemorrhage; gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding in the last 30 days; need for concomitant use of anticoagulants other than argatroban. In the ARAIS study, the interventions were: n = 364 argatroban plus alteplase (intravenous argatroban within 1 hour after intravenous alteplase) n = 396 alteplase alone (intravenous alteplase). In the ARAIS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in excellent functional outcome at day 90 (63.8% vs. 64.9%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.1). In the ARAIS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mRS score of 0–2 within 90 (76% vs. 76.3%; RR 1, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.08) No significant difference in early neurologic improvement within 48 hours (69% vs. 67.9%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.27) No significant difference in early neurologic deterioration within 48 hours (3.6% vs. 5.1%; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.4). In the ARAIS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in symptomatic ICH; parenchymal hematoma type 2; major systemic bleeding. In the ARAIS study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with AIS who were assigned within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, argatroban plus alteplase was not superior to alteplase alone with respect to excellent functional outcome at day 90.

### Argatroban in patients with acute ischemic stroke with early neurological deterioration: a randomized clinical trial [^112yvuT2]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Early neurological deterioration (END) within the first 48 hours after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) onset is relatively common, and it consistently predicts poor outcome. Apart from straightforward causes, such as intracerebral hemorrhage and malignant edema, the mechanism of END remains mostly unclear. Medical treatment in the setting of unexplained END in clinical practice may involve approaches such as plasma volume expansion, induced hypertension, and intensified antithrombotic therapy, but none has been formally proved so far.

Most patients with END still experience a significant worsening of their condition even with antiplatelet treatment. This may be attributed to the mixed potential etiologies, some of which are thrombus extension, hemodynamic compromise, and incomplete response to antiplatelet therapy. Theoretically, early use of anticoagulants, by reducing the propagation of a thrombus in an intracerebral artery, may reduce the volume of infarcted cerebral issue and subsequently decrease the risks of disability and death. However, it is noteworthy that anticoagulants also carry the risk of bleeding. Studies have showed that, although anticoagulants prevent stroke progression, the benefit of decreased recurrence by anticoagulants was offset by a similarly sized increase in intracranial hemorrhage. Early warfarin use in transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke was also associated with increased intracranial hemorrhage risk. Guidelines still recommend against urgent anticoagulation for patients with AIS.

As a direct thrombin inhibitor, argatroban is rapid acting, short acting, and has low bleeding rates, which may be useful in preventing thrombus propagation and providing additional benefit after stroke/TIA. Growing preclinical evidence has demonstrated that argatroban was associated with a reduction in ischemic stroke damage. However, the safety and efficacy of argatroban is not well established for AIS treatment, and there is also a lack of robust evidence for the effect of argatroban in patients with AIS who experience END.

We performed a prospective, multicenter, open-label, blinded–end point, randomized clinical trial aiming to explore the efficacy and safety of argatroban combined with antiplatelet therapy for END within 48 hours after symptom onset.

### Argatroban in patients with acute ischemic stroke with early neurological deterioration: a randomized clinical trial [^111qTW8J]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This randomized clinical trial shows that the combination of argatroban and antiplatelet therapy resulted in a significantly greater likelihood of good functional outcome at 90 days in patients with END after AIS, with no additional risk of major intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage.

To date and to the authors' knowledge, the present study was the largest randomized clinical trial to provide robust statistical evidence on the effect of argatroban on END. Early combination of argatroban and antiplatelet use was associated with neurological improvement at 3 months. A subgroup of retrospective study showed that argatroban therapy tended toward superiority over antiplatelet therapy by decreasing stroke severity at discharge, although the difference was not significant in patients with AIS. Argatroban plus dual antiplatelet therapy yield a significant decrease in the NIHSS score of patients with acute minor posterior circulation ischemic stroke during hospitalization, but the benefit disappeared after propensity score matching. However, these studies were not designed to assess treatment effects in patients with stroke in progression. Our study was novel in that we targeted a population with END in the hyperacute stroke and showed the benefit of argatroban combination with antiplatelet therapy in reducing the probability of disability.

The use of anticoagulation therapy in AIS has engendered much controversy. Prospective outcome studies of low-molecular-weight heparin in AIS, including the large Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) study, failed to show any difference in functional outcome in the treated group compared with placebo. Patients allocated to heparin in the International Stroke Trial (IST) had significantly fewer recurrent ischemic strokes within 14 days, but this was offset by a similar-sized increase in hemorrhagic strokes; therefore, the difference in death or nonfatal recurrent stroke was not significant. Due to the excessive hemorrhage transformation rates associated with conventional anticoagulants, most efforts to reduce END have focused on novel anticoagulants combined with antiplatelet therapies. No harmful profile of argatroban was observed even in patients who received intravenous alteplase, suggesting the possible safety of anticoagulants. In our study, a combined regimen of antiplatelet and argatroban in patients with END did not increase the risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and severe systemic bleeding, which is in line with previous studies.

### Argatroban in patients with acute ischemic stroke with early neurological deterioration: a randomized clinical trial [^1169utCd]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The study EASE was published by Xuting Zhang and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the EASE study, the trial question was: what is the role of argatroban in patients with AIS and early neurological deterioration? In the EASE study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the EASE study, the population was: 628 patients (228 female, 400 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AIS and early neurological deterioration. The key exclusion criteria were cardiogenic cerebral embolism; National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score ≥ 21; conversion of ICH; BP ≥ 180/110 mmHg after treatment; hematological diseases and those with bleeding tendency. In the EASE study, the interventions were: n = 314 argatroban (continuous infusion with a dose of 60 mg/day for 2 days followed by a dose of 20 mg/day for 5 days plus standard therapy) n = 314 standard therapy (standard guideline treatment alone). In the EASE study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mRS score < 4 at day 90 (80.5% vs. 73.3%; RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.2). In the EASE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mRS score of 0–2 at day 90 (55.7% vs. 50.2%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.29) No significant difference in National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at day 90 (2 points vs. 2 points; MD -0.74, 95% CI -2.64 to 1.15) No significant difference in Barthel scale score at day 90 (90 points vs. 90 points; MD 4.69, 95% CI -0.5 to 9.86). In the EASE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in symptomatic ICH, parenchymal hematoma, other bleeding events. In the EASE study, the conclusion was: in patients with AIS and early neurological deterioration, argatroban was superior to standard therapy with respect to mRS score < 4 at day 90.

### Adjunctive intravenous argatroban or eptifibatide for ischemic stroke [^116EwaKF]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study MOST (argatroban) was published by Opeolu Adeoye and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the MOST (argatroban) study, the trial question was: what is the role of adjunctive argatroban in patients with AIS? In the MOST (argatroban) study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the MOST (argatroban) study, the population was: 287 patients (138 female, 149 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AIS who had received intravenous thrombolysis within 3 hours after symptom onset. The key exclusion criteria were known allergy or hypersensitivity to argatroban; previous stroke in the past 90 days; previous ICH, neoplasm, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or arterial venous malformation; serious systemic hemorrhage in the past 30 days. In the MOST (argatroban) study, the interventions were: n = 59 argatroban (a bolus of 100 mcg/kg, followed by a 12-hour infusion of 3 mcg/kg/min) n = 228 placebo (matching bolus and 12-hour infusion). In the MOST (argatroban) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in mean utility-weighted mRS score at 90 days (5.2 points vs. 6.8 points; MD -1.51, 95% CI -3.09 to 0.07). In the MOST (argatroban) study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant decrease in mRS score of 0 or 1 or return to prestroke score at 90 days (24% vs. 40%; OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.89) Borderline significant decrease in mRS score of 0–2 or return to prestroke score at 90 days (44% vs. 61%; OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.9) No significant difference in post-thrombectomy grade of 2b or 3 on modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia scale (81% vs. 94%; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.02). In the MOST (argatroban) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in symptomatic ICH. significant difference in death from any cause (24% vs. 8%). In the MOST (argatroban) study, the conclusion was: in patients with AIS who had received intravenous thrombolysis within 3 hours after symptom onset, argatroban was not superior to placebo with respect to mean utility-weighted mRS score at 90 days.

Anticoagulants for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) — urgent anticoagulation and thrombin/factor Xa inhibitors: The usefulness of urgent anticoagulation in patients with severe stenosis of an internal carotid artery ipsilateral to an ischemic stroke is not well established. The safety and usefulness of short-term anticoagulation for nonocclusive, extracranial intraluminal thrombus in the setting of AIS are not well established. At present, the usefulness of argatroban, dabigatran, or other thrombin inhibitors for the treatment of patients with AIS is not well established, and further clinical trials are needed. The safety and usefulness of factor Xa inhibitors in the treatment of AIS are not well established, and further clinical trials are needed. Supporting data include that the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran was studied in 53 patients with TIA or minor stroke (NIHSS score ≤ 3) with no occurrences of sICH up to 30 days, and in the ARTSS-2 phase II study alteplase-treated patients (n = 90) received placebo or argatroban (100-µg/kg bolus) followed by infusion of either 1 or 3 µg/kg per minute for 48 hours with sICH rates 3 of 29 (10%), 4 of 30 (13%), and 2 of 31 (7%), respectively.

### Argatroban in patients with acute ischemic stroke with early neurological deterioration: a randomized clinical trial [^115kfTYL]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

The study protocol is available in Supplement 1, and the statistical analysis plan is available in Supplement 2. The trial was conducted at 28 medical sites in China. The trial protocol was approved by the appropriate regulatory and ethical authorities of the ethics committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine and other participating hospitals. An independent data monitoring committee monitored the progress of the trial every 6 months. Signed informed consent was obtained from patients or their legally authorized representatives. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting statement.

Participants

Eligible patients were adults older than 18 years with AIS within 48 hours and experienced END with an increase of 2 or more points on the total National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is available in the study protocol (Supplement 1). Information regarding participant race and ethnicity was not gathered for this study as most patients in Zhejiang Province were Han Chinese.

Randomization and Masking

Patients were randomly assigned to either treatment or control arms using a secure, web-based randomization system. A dynamic stratification system ensures well-balanced subgroups. The randomization algorithm uses biased-coin minimization and the variance method with stratification weights. The strategy was to balance treatment assignment along the marginal distribution of each stratification factor. The stratification factors used and their hierarchy were as follows: (1) age, (2) sex, and (3) NIHSS score at randomization. Patients and treating physicians were not blinded to treatment assignment, but study outcomes assessors were blinded to treatment assignment.

Trial Population

Between April 4, 2020, and July 31, 2022, a total of 628 patients (mean [SD] age, 65 [11.9] years; 400 male [63.7%]; 228 female [36.3%]) were randomly assigned to the argatroban group (314 [50%]) or the control group (314 [50%]). A total of 27 patients were excluded (18 withdrew consent, 1 had duplicate randomization, and 8 were lost to follow-up). The full analysis set population included 601 patients (298 [49.6%] in the argatroban group and 303 [50.4%] in the control group). The procedure was completed according to the protocol for 564 patients (292 [51.8%] in the argatroban group and 272 [48.2%] in the control group), and the results were included in the per-protocol analysis. The reasons for the incomplete procedures are provided in Figure 1. The trial was completed on October 31, 2022.

### Argatroban in patients with acute ischemic stroke with early neurological deterioration: a randomized clinical trial [^113CDtmu]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, there were more crossover patients in the control group than in the argatroban group, primarily due to the open-label design, which may have biased the study; although, the per-protocol analysis yielded similar results to the full analysis. Second, the current investigation did not conceal the allocated treatment from the participants and physicians because of the open-label design. Nevertheless, blinded–end point assessments were used to mitigate measurement bias and guarantee objective measurement of the primary end point. Third, further confirmation of these conclusions in non-Chinese populations would be welcome, considering the variations in comorbidities and etiology among patients with AIS.

### Thrombolysis alone vs with argatroban or eptifibatide: a prespecified subgroup analysis of the MOST trial [^112hkHsu]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

IV thrombolysis only (IVT-O) is the primary reperfusion therapy for most stroke patients. At least 50% of IVT-O patients remain disabled. We assessed 2 therapies added to IVT-O aimed at increasing clot lysis or preventing arterial reocclusion.

Methods

This 3-arm, adaptive, single-blinded, randomized controlled phase III clinical trial was conducted at 57 US sites. Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) within 3 hours of onset receiving IV tissue plasminogen activator or tenecteplase were randomized to argatroban (100 μg/kg bolus and 12-hour infusion at 3 μg/kg/min), eptifibatide (135 μg/kg bolus and 2-hour infusion at 0.75 μg/kg/min), or placebo (bolus and 12-hour infusion). The primary end point was utility-weighted 90-day modified Rankin Scale score (uwmRS score; worst = 0, best = 10). This prespecified secondary analysis was conducted on the intent-to-treat population in the IVT-O cohort using a Bayesian normal dynamic linear model.

Results

Of 514 patients enrolled into Multi-arm Optimization of Stroke Thrombolysis (MOST) before the study was stopped for futility, 260 were in the IVT-O cohort (118 treated with placebo, 114 with eptifibatide, and 28 with argatroban; mean age 66 years, 46.9% female). Baseline variables were similar across groups (median NIH Stroke Scale score 8, mean time from symptom onset to IVT 105 minutes, mean time from IVT bolus to study drug start 62 minutes). A clot was visible in 30.8% of patients. There was only a 1% or 2.5% chance that argatroban or eptifibatide, respectively, was superior to placebo for the primary outcome (mean uwmRS scores [SD] of 5.5 [3.6], 6.6 [3.2], and 7.4 [2.6] for argatroban, eptifibatide, and placebo, respectively). No secondary outcomes favored either treatment group. The risk difference for symptomatic hemorrhage between the argatroban and eptifibatide arms vs placebo was -0.8% (p = 0.82) and 1.8% (p = 0.36). Mortality was 3.4% with placebo, 14.3% for argatroban (p = 0.03), and 11.4% for eptifibatide (p = 0.02). There was no benefit in any subgroup.

Discussion

Outcomes in patients treated with IVT-O were not improved by adding either argatroban or eptifibatide. Increased bleeding was not observed, but mortality was higher in both investigational arms. Limitations included small sample size in the argatroban subgroup.

Trial Registration Information

This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number: NCT03735979) on November 8, 2018. The first patient was enrolled on October 15, 2019.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class II evidence that in patients with AIS treated with IVT within 3 hours of onset, argatroban or eptifibatide does not improve outcomes vs thrombolysis alone but does increase mortality.

Procedures

Both groups received standard therapy including oral mono or dual antiplatelet therapy, such as aspirin and/or clopidogrel, decided by the attending physicians according to Chinese Stroke Association guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke 2018. The experimental group received intravenous argatroban for 7 days (continuous infusion at a dose of 60 mg per day for 2 days, followed by 20 mg per day for 5 days) in addition to standard therapy. Argatroban infusion was terminated immediately if major systemic bleeding or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was suspected. Patients had to be at least 24 hours postthrombolysis treatment and have no evidence of hemorrhage on computed tomography (CT) scans. The NIHSS was used to assess neurological status at baseline, 7 days, and 90 days after randomization. A detailed flowchart of the assessment schedule is provided in the study protocol (Supplement 1). Data on demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained at randomization. Follow-up data were collected at 7 days or at hospital discharge and 90 days after randomization. Remote and on-site quality control monitoring and data verification were conducted throughout the study.

### Baseline neurological deficit and argatroban plus alteplase in acute ischemic stroke: a post hoc analysis of ARAIS trial [^115vFGSB]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reperfusion therapies, such as intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy, have been standard treatments for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Achieving vessel recanalization was important for patients with AIS to improve functional outcome after reperfusion treatments. However, the proportion of successful recanalization was only about 30% in patients who received intravenous alteplase. Furthermore, vessel reocclusion occurred in one third of the population with initial recanalization, which led to neurological deterioration and poor outcome. Thus, it is crucial to improve vessel recanalization, prevent neurological deterioration, and reduce AIS disability.

Argatroban, which can inhibit thrombin-induced vascular events, has been widely used to treat AIS in Asian countries. Two pilot clinical studies had demonstrated the safety and possible efficacy of argatroban plus alteplase in ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO). However, the Argatroban Plus Recombinant Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator for AIS (ARAIS) study demonstrated that argatroban plus intravenous alteplase compared with intravenous alteplase alone did not significantly improve functional outcome at 90 days. Given that patients with LVO may benefit from the combined treatment, the neutral result may be attributed to lower proportion of LVO in ARAIS study. Although NIHSS score at admission ≥ 6 was used as one of inclusion criteria, lower proportion of LVO was also potentially enrolled due to lack of vessel imaging before intravenous thrombolysis or receiving endovascular therapy when identifying LVO.

It is well known that baseline high National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was positively associated with LVO, and predicted poor functional outcomes after intravenous thrombolysis. In this context, we hypothesized that it was possible to detect the positive effect of argatroban plus alteplase in patients with higher NIHSS score rather than lower NIHSS score. Therefore, we explored the efficacy and safety of argatroban plus alteplase in patients with different stroke severity according to NIHSS score at admission in the ARAIS study.

### Baseline neurological deficit and argatroban plus alteplase in acute ischemic stroke: a post hoc analysis of ARAIS trial [^112XtmNA]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

The current study was a post hoc analysis of the ARAIS study and designed according to the STROBE guideline. Details on the design and protocol of ARAIS study have been published. In brief, ARAIS was a multicenter, open-label, blinded-end point, randomized clinical trial enrolling 817 patients between January 18, 2019, and October 30, 2021, to assess the efficacy of argatroban plus alteplase in patients with AIS within 4.5 ​h from symptom onset. The follow-ups were completed in January 2022. Eligible patients were adults aged between 18 and 80 years old with AIS (NIHSS scores at admission ≥ 6), and were enrolled up to 4.5 ​h after the onset of stroke symptoms. Key exclusion criteria were as follows: presence of disability in the community (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores ≥ 2) before the stroke; history of intracerebral hemorrhage; gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding in the last 30 days; and need for concomitant use of anticoagulants other than argatroban. All procedures were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by ethics committees of General Hospital of Northern Theater Command (approval number: k [2018]45), and written informed consents were obtained from patients or their legally authorized representatives. The study was registered with(NCT03740958).

In the current study, patients were selected based on the full analysis set. Patients were excluded from the full analysis set if they: (1) met the exclusion criteria or did not fulfill the inclusion criteria as protocol of ARAIS study; (2) did not complete argatroban treatment due to unplanned discharge; (3) received endovascular therapy after argatroban treatment given that it may affect vessel recanalization.

### Argatroban anticoagulation in patients with acute ischemic stroke (ARGIS-1): a randomized, placebo-controlled safety study [^1171d2Yb]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Direct thrombin inhibitors, including argatroban, represent an anticoagulant class distinct from heparins. We investigated the safety of 2 levels of argatroban anticoagulation in acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study included 171 patients with acute (≤ 12 hours from onset) stroke and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of 5 to 22. Patients received continuous intravenous argatroban (100 microg/kg bolus) at 3 microg/kg per minute (n = 59) or 1 microg/kg per minute (n = 58), respectively, adjusted to target activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) 2.25x and 1.75x baseline or placebo (n = 54) for 5 days. The primary outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) at 30 days.

Results

Baseline characteristics including neurologic deficits (median NIHSS score 9) were comparable between groups. Argatroban at mean doses of 2.7 and 1.2 microg/kg per minute increased aPTTs significantly (P < 0.001), with mean aPTTs at or near target values throughout infusion. Symptomatic ICH was not significantly different between groups (high-dose argatroban, 5.1%; low-dose argatroban, 3.4%; placebo, 0%; P ≥ 0.18), with 3 events during argatroban infusion and 2 events ≥ 7 days after stopping infusion. No significant between-group differences occurred in asymptomatic ICH (7 events), major systemic hemorrhage (no event), or 90-day mortality (13.4% overall).

Conclusions

In this first North American randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of direct thrombin inhibition in acute ischemic stroke, argatroban at each dose evaluated significantly prolonged aPTTs without increasing ICH or major bleeding. These results suggest that argatroban provides safe anticoagulation in acute ischemic stroke, warranting future studies powered to evaluate its efficacy and more precisely estimate event rates.

Discussion

This study indicated that the incidence of END was significantly lower, and the 90-day functional outcome was significantly better in patients with BAD treated with argatroban plus DAPT versus DAPT alone, with no predefined safety events observed. Furthermore, the difference in the primary end point outcome remained significant even after adjusting for predefined prognostic factors.

In a prospective multicenter, single-group trial, 144 patients diagnosed as probable BAD were treated with DAPT with cilostazol plus 1 oral antiplatelet drug (aspirin or clopidogrel), 76.4% of whom also received argatroban treatment. This cohort exhibited a significantly reduced rate of clinical progression at 2 weeks — defined as an increase of ≥ 1 points on the NIHSS or mRS from baseline — compared with a group of 142 matched historical control patients who received either cilostazol, aspirin, or clopidogrel as single antiplatelet therapy (only 5.6% of whom received argatroban), with rates of 9.7% versus 33.8%, respectively. Another study from Japan suggested that patients with penetrating artery infarctions, including lacunar infarctions and BAD, who were receiving treatment with a combination of argatroban and DAPT (aspirin and clopidogrel) experienced a significantly lower rate of stroke progression, defined as an increase in NIHSS score by 1 or 2 points or more within 7 days of admission. However, notably, less than half of the participants in the study were diagnosed with BAD, and the control group was treated with argatroban and aspirin, not DAPT.

In our study, patients with BAD in the control group in our study received DAPT comprising aspirin and clopidogrel, with an initial loading dose of 300 mg. Recent clinical studies have confirmed that short-term use of DAPT can reduce the risk of stroke recurrence in patients with mild to moderate AIS (NIHSS score ≤ 5) or high-risk transient ischemic attack. – Guidelines for the secondary prevention of stroke in numerous countries have advocated the early administration of DAPT after the onset of acute mild to moderate noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. In this study, by using DAPT as a control, we found that treatment with argatroban plus DAPT significantly reduced the risk of END in patients with BAD. To our knowledge, this was the first study to confirm that short-term treatment with argatroban plus DAPT can safely and effectively reduce the risk of END and improve functional outcome in patients with BAD.

### Randomized trial of argatroban plus recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke (ARAIS): rationale and design [^111JbzsJ]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies have implied the efficacy and safety of argatroban plus recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA) in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Further trials are needed to establish convincing conclusions in a large sample size.

Research Design and Methods

Argatroban plus r-tPA for Acute Ischemic Stroke (ARAIS) trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, and blind-end point trial. The trial proposes to randomize 808 patients with acute ischemic stroke National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS score ≥ 6 at the time of randomization) within 4.5 hours of symptom onset to receive argatroban (100 μg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 1.0 μg/kg per minute for 48 hours) plus r-tPA or r-tPA alone. The primary end point is the proportion of patients with an excellent outcome of no clinically significant residual stroke deficits (modified Rankin scale 0–1) at 90 days. Secondary end points include the proportion of patients with a good outcome (modified Rankin scale 0–2) at 90 days, early neurological improvement (NIHSS score ≥ 2-point decrease) at 48 hours, early neurological deterioration (NIHSS score ≥ 4-point increase) at 48 hours, decrease in the NIHSS score from baseline to 14 days, and stroke recurrence or other vascular events at 90 days. Safety end points include symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, parenchymal hematoma type 2, and major systemic bleeding.

Conclusion

ARAIS trial will evaluate whether argatroban plus r-tPA is superior to r-tPA alone in improving functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients in a large sample population.

Therapeutic target

Platelets represent a prime therapeutic target for thrombolysis in AIS. As mentioned above, much of the platelet–platelet cross-linking is primarily mediated via GpIIb/IIIa receptors. GpIIb/IIIa antagonists have been a mainstay of intravenous and intra-arterial antiplatelet therapy for well over a decade in helping to manage and prevent thrombotic complications during endovascular procedures. In fact, simple intravenous therapy with these agents is extremely effective in the management of complications such as in-stent thrombosis, while alteplase therapy is not, largely due to the fact that these thrombotic complications are primarily platelet mediated. Thus, it seems logical that if such therapy could be integrated with fibrolytic therapy, superior revascularisation outcomes could be achieved. There is currently a trial ongoing titled the Multi-arm Optimization of Stroke Thrombolysis trial comparing the efficacy of adjunctive thrombolysis with argatroban (a direct thrombin inhibitor), eptifibatide (a GpIIbIIIa inhibitor) and placebo is being compared (NCT03735979).

A prespecified subgroup analysis demonstrated a potentially stronger effect of argatroban among female patients (argatroban vs control: female, 81.7% [89 of 109] vs 65.5% [72 of 110]; male, 79.9% [151 of 189] vs 77.7% [150 of 193]; interaction P = 0.046) (eTable 3 in Supplement 3). Other subgroup analysis showed characteristics, such as age, NIHSS score at randomization, reperfusion therapy, and time from the onset of symptom to randomization, did not have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the intervention of argatroban in reducing the risks of the primary outcome.

We further conducted a subgroup analysis on patients receiving dual vs mono antiplatelet therapy. There was no significant interaction between subgroups receiving argatroban and different antiplatelet therapies (eTable 3 in Supplement 3).

Adverse Events

The occurrence of adverse events was similar across the 2 groups, including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, parenchymal hematoma, other bleeding events, and other common adverse events (Table 3). The proportion of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 3 of 317 (0.9%) in the argatroban group and 2 of 272 (0.7%) in the control group (P = 0.78).

### Randomized, multicenter trial of ARTSS-2 (argatroban with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for acute stroke) [^116PndB7]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

We conducted a randomized exploratory study to assess safety and the probability of a favorable outcome with adjunctive argatroban, a direct thrombin-inhibitor, administered to recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA)-treated ischemic stroke patients.

Methods

Patients treated with standard-dose r-tPA, not receiving endovascular therapy, were randomized to receive no argatroban or argatroban (100 μg/kg bolus) followed by infusion of either 1 (low dose) or 3 μg/kg per minute (high dose) for 48 hours. Safety was incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Probability of clinical benefit (modified Rankin Scale score 0–1 at 90 days) was estimated using a conservative Bayesian Poisson model (neutral prior probability centered at relative risk, 1.0 and 95% prior intervals, 0.33–3.0).

Results

Ninety patients were randomized: 29 to r-tPA alone, 30 to r-tPA+low-dose argatroban, and 31 to r-tPA+high-dose argatroban. Rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage were similar among control, low-dose, and high-dose arms: 3/29 (10%), 4/30 (13%), and 2/31 (7%), respectively. At 90 days, 6 (21%) r-tPA alone, 9 (30%) low-dose, and 10 (32%) high-dose patients were with modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1. The relative risks (95% credible interval) for modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1 with low, high, and either low or high dose argatroban were 1.17 (0.57–2.37), 1.27 (0.63–2.53), and 1.34 (0.68–2.76), respectively. The probability that adjunctive argatroban was superior to r-tPA alone was 67%, 74%, and 79% for low, high, and low or high dose, respectively.

Conclusions

In patients treated with r-tPA, adjunctive argatroban was not associated with increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and provides evidence that a definitive effectiveness trial is indicated.

### Adjunctive intravenous argatroban or eptifibatide for ischemic stroke [^113ZtLS7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Intravenous thrombolysis is a standard treatment of acute ischemic stroke. The efficacy and safety of combining intravenous thrombolysis with argatroban (an anticoagulant agent) or eptifibatide (an antiplatelet agent) are unclear.

Methods

We conducted a phase 3, three-group, adaptive, single-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial at 57 sites in the United States. Patients with acute ischemic stroke who had received intravenous thrombolysis within 3 hours after symptom onset were assigned to receive intravenous argatroban, eptifibatide, or placebo within 75 minutes after the initiation of thrombolysis. The primary efficacy outcome, the utility-weighted 90-day modified Rankin scale score (range, 0 to 10, with higher scores reflecting better outcomes), was assessed by means of centralized adjudication. The primary safety outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours after randomization.

Results

A total of 514 patients were assigned to receive argatroban (59 patients), eptifibatide (227 patients), or placebo (228 patients). All the patients received intravenous thrombolysis (70% received alteplase, and 30% received tenecteplase), and 225 patients (44%) underwent endovascular thrombectomy. At 90 days, the mean (± SD) utility-weighted modified Rankin scale scores were 5.2 ± 3.7 with argatroban, 6.3 ± 3.2 with eptifibatide, and 6.8 ± 3.0 with placebo. The posterior probability that argatroban was better than placebo was 0.002 (posterior mean difference in utility-weighted modified Rankin scale score, -1.51 ± 0.51) and that eptifibatide was better than placebo was 0.041 (posterior mean difference, -0.50 ± 0.29). The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was similar in the three groups (4% with argatroban, 3% with eptifibatide, and 2% with placebo). Mortality at 90 days was higher in the argatroban group (24%) and the eptifibatide group (12%) than in the placebo group (8%).

Conclusions

In patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis within 3 hours after symptom onset, adjunctive treatment with intravenous argatroban or eptifibatide did not reduce poststroke disability and was associated with increased mortality.

### Argatroban: update [^113DEtEX]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Unfractionated heparin has historically been used as the anticoagulant of choice in the management of a number of thrombotic diseases. Recognition of the limitations of heparin has led to the development of a newer class of anticoagulants, the direct thrombin inhibitors. Argatroban is a synthetic small molecule that selectively inhibits thrombin at its active site. In preclinical studies, argatroban has been shown to be more effective than heparin in preventing arterial thrombosis and in promoting vessel patency in conjunction with thrombolysis in a number of animal models. In clinical trials, argatroban has been shown to be as effective as heparin in the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in conjunction with thrombolysis. It has been shown to be an effective anticoagulant in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions. In patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia complicated by thrombosis, argatroban significantly decreases the risk of thrombotic events. Small studies have demonstrated a potential role for its use in ischemic stroke and hemodialysis. Additional studies are warranted to confirm argatroban's efficacy in a wide variety of clinical settings.

### Argatroban in patients with acute ischemic stroke with early neurological deterioration: a randomized clinical trial [^116Bpe67]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Outcome

The primary end point was good functional outcome at 90 days, defined as a score of 0 to 3 on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for the evaluation of neurological disability, through a structured interview for telephone assessment by personnel certified in the scoring of the mRS 90 days after randomization.

The secondary end points were favorable functional outcome (mRS score of 0–2) at 90 days, recovery assessed by categorical shift in mRS at 90 days, NIHSS score at 7 days and 90 ± 3 days after randomization, Barthel scale score at 90 ± 3 days, and the rate of composite cardiovascular events at 90 ± 3 days, including cerebrovascular events, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and systemic embolism.

Any adverse events that occurred during the study were recorded. The prespecified adverse event outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, parenchymal hematoma type 2, and other common adverse events. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as any evidence of bleeding on head CT scan associated with clinically significant neurological deterioration (≥ 4 point increase in NIHSS score) in the opinion of the clinical investigator or independent safety monitor. Parenchymal hematoma type 2 was defined as confluent bleeding occupying more than 30% of the infarct volume and causing significant mass effect. Follow-up head CT was performed at 7 days after randomization or at any time when neurological deterioration occurred. Central adjudication of clinical outcomes and adverse events was done by assessors unaware of treatment allocation or clinical details.

Final follow-up was performed at 90 days through a structured interview for telephone assessment by a trained and certified member in the central research hospital who was unaware of the randomized treatment assignment. A training course was held for all the investigators at each center to ensure the validity and reproducibility of the evaluation, and only certified investigators were eligible to evaluate NIHSS scores.

Sample Size Calculation

The sample size was estimated according to the results of the previous observational cohort (with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the randomized clinical trial) at the study center, with 33 patients in the experimental group and 66 patients in the control group. There were no significant differences in age and NIHSS score (baseline and progressive time), and the proportion of patients with an mRS score of 0 to 3 at day 90 in the experimental group and the control group was 80% and 69.6%, respectively. Based on 0.8 power to detect a significant difference (2-sided P = 0.05) and to compensate for nonevaluable patients of 15%, a total sample size of up to 630 patients would be required.

### Effect of argatroban plus dual antiplatelet in branch atherosclerosis disease: a randomized clinical trial [^117DZWHm]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Randomization and Masking

Patients who met the criteria were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive argatroban plus DAPT or DAPT alone (Figure 1). A simple randomization method was used, utilizing a computer-generated random sequence to allocate a sequence number based on the patient's time of enrollment. The baseline and follow-up NIHSS or mRS scores were assessed by the same professional assessor, who remained blinded to the study protocol, treatment allocation, and group assignments throughout the trial. To maintain blinding, the assessor received only essential clinical data required for evaluations, which underwent standardized preprocessing to remove any treatment-related information. Furthermore, all assessors completed standardized training and certification to ensure the objectivity of evaluations. mRS scores at admission and discharge were assessed face-to-face. For the 90-day follow-up, face-to-face visits were prioritized; if unavailable, structured assessments were conducted via telephone by certified personnel who were also blinded to treatment allocation. Central adjudication of outcomes and safety events was performed by a committee that was similarly blinded to treatment assignments.

Figure 1.
Study flow chart. Arg indicates argatroban; BAD, branch atherosclerosis disease; and DAPT, dual antiplatelet therapy.

Interventions

All patients received the drug treatment according to their assigned group immediately after randomization. Patients in the DAPT group received treatment as follows: 100 mg aspirin and 300 mg clopidogrel were administered orally on the first day, followed by 100 mg aspirin and 75 mg clopidogrel administered orally on the second day and continued daily for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, maintenance treatment consisted of only 1 antiplatelet drug. In addition to the above treatment, patients in the DAPT plus argatroban group also received argatroban, which was continuously infused at a dose of 60 mg/d for 2 days, followed by 20 mg/d from days 3 to 7. All other treatments administered for AIS followed the most recent guidelines of the American Heart Association.

An independent committee for data and safety monitoring supervised the trial, with particular attention to any occurrences of hemorrhagic events. During argatroban infusion, if a hemorrhagic event occurs and intracranial or other systemic moderate or severe bleeding is suspected, the argatroban infusion should be immediately discontinued. If a patient experiences END during hospitalization, a follow-up brain noncontrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging should be promptly performed.

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^112ccePF]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) consists of a multidisciplinary approach that more than ever requires the involvement of the critical care specialist. Before the 1990s, treatment options for AIS were limited and mainly focused on symptomatic management, secondary prevention, and rehabilitation. Since then, the entire field was revolutionized by two major introductions. The first groundbreaking innovation that dramatically transformed acute stroke care on the basis of a National Institutes of Neurological Disease and Stroke (NINDS) landmark study was the Federal Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of IV tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) in 1995. IV-tPA remained the mainstay of treatment for about 2 decades until 2015 when more sophisticated clinical trials showed robust outcomes for endovascular therapy (EVT). In the ICU, additional strategies aimed at optimizing patient's physiology can interface between triage and/or revascularization and discharge to rehabilitation.

### Intravenous argatroban or eptifibatide in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy: a subgroup analysis of the MOST randomized clinical trial [^115PYnaZ]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The addition of direct thrombin inhibitors or glycoprotein platelet inhibitors to intravenous thrombolysis in patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke may improve reperfusion rates and clinical outcomes.

Objective

To investigate the safety and efficacy of these agents.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a preplanned cohort analysis from the Multi-Arm Optimization of Stroke Thrombolysis (MOST) randomized clinical trial, which lasted from 2019 to 2023 with a 90-day follow-up. Centrally read outcomes were assessed blinded to treatment. The MOST study was a multicenter, multiarm, adaptive, single-blind, phase 3 trial that included patients with acute ischemic stroke who were selected for thrombectomy per standard of care.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to placebo, argatroban, or eptifibatide within 75 minutes of intravenous thrombolysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The 90-day utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (UW-mRS) score (range, 0–10, with higher scores reflecting better outcomes) was used as the primary outcome measure. Reperfusion rates and safety (hemorrhage rates) were also assessed, where good reperfusion was defined as a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b/2c/3 on the completion angiogram.

Results

A total of 5376 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of these individuals, 4332 did not meet inclusion criteria, 251 eligible patients did not have consent obtained, 279 were excluded for other reasons, and 514 were randomized in the MOST trial. A total of 254 were planned for thrombectomy (110 in the placebo group, 31 in the argatroban group, and 113 in the eptifibatide group). Mean (SD) age was 68 (14.3) years, and 134 (53%) were female. Of these patients, 219 received thrombectomy: 94 in the placebo group, 27 in the argatroban group, and 98 in the eptifibatide group. There was no effect of treatment on outcome (mean UW-mRS score: eptifibatide, 6.47; 95% CI, 5.79–7.15; argatroban, 5.35; 95% CI, 4.13–6.58; placebo, 6.68; 95% CI, 5.98–7.39). Rates of good reperfusion were similar between groups (83 of 92 in the placebo group [83%]; 17 of 27 in the argatroban group [63%], and 82 of 98 in the eptifibatide group [84%]). The proportion of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was similar between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this secondary analysis of the MOST randomized clinical trial reveal that the addition of argatroban or eptifibatide to intravenous thrombolysis was not associated with better reperfusion rates or clinical outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy. Future investigations of these agents as intravenous adjuncts to thrombectomy should focus on populations who are ineligible for intravenous thrombolysis.

### Current and potentially novel antithrombotic treatment in acute ischemic stroke [^114ruN4V]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the most common type of stroke and requires immediate reperfusion. Current acute reperfusion therapies comprise the administration of intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular thrombectomy. Although these acute reperfusion therapies are increasingly successful, optimized secondary antithrombotic treatment remains warranted, specifically to reduce the risk of major bleeding complications. In the development of AIS, coagulation and platelet activation play crucial roles by driving occlusive clot formation. Recent studies implicated that the intrinsic route of coagulation plays a more prominent role in this development, however, this is not fully understood yet. Next to the acute treatments, antithrombotic therapy, consisting of anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet therapy, is successfully used for primary and secondary prevention of AIS but at the cost of increased bleeding complications. Therefore, better understanding the interplay between the different pathways involved in the pathophysiology of AIS might provide new insights that could lead to novel treatment strategies. This narrative review focuses on the processes of platelet activation and coagulation in AIS, and the most common antithrombotic agents in primary and secondary prevention of AIS. Furthermore, we provide an overview of promising novel antithrombotic agents that could be used to improve in both acute treatment and stroke prevention.

### Effect of argatroban plus dual antiplatelet in branch atherosclerosis disease: a randomized clinical trial [^113Jjwfm]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Branch atherosclerosis disease (BAD), initially proposed by Caplan in 1989, describes a pathology marked by the occlusion or narrowing of penetrating artery origins, causing infarctions in the internal capsule or pons.BAD accounts for ≈10% to 15% of all acute ischemic strokes (AIS), yet its etiological classification remains undetermined. The condition predominantly involves the lenticulostriate arteries (LSA), paramedian pontine arteries, and anterior choroidal arteries. A notable feature of BAD is its association with a high risk of early neurological deterioration (END), which frequently occurs within 48 to 72 hours after onset, with an incidence rate of 17% to 75%. – An observational study revealed that despite receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), 34.5% of patients with BAD with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of ≤ 5 within 48 hours of onset still experienced END during the first 48 hours after hospital admission, and 38.2% of patients presented poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score ≥ 2) at 3 months. It indicated that the risk of END in patients with BAD remained high even when treated with DAPT, highlighting the necessity of exploring new antithrombotic strategies to prevent END in patients with BAD and reduce disability.

Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that effectively inhibits both free and clot-bound thrombin and is widely used to treat AIS, especially in Asian countries such as China and Japan. – Observational studies have suggested that short-term application of argatroban plus DAPT is safe and effective for treating AIS, including BAD, and this combination may also reduce the incidence of END. Currently, there is a lack of compelling evidence demonstrating the efficacy of argatroban plus DAPT in patients with BAD. One study conducted in Japan has shown that treatment with argatroban plus DAPT can reduce the incidence of END in patients with BAD without increasing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Our recent observational study, which included 80 patients with BAD who did not undergo intravenous thrombolysis, demonstrated that patients treated with argatroban plus DAPT exhibited a lower incidence of END and fewer poor functional outcome compared with those receiving DAPT alone, with no increase in the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. These results indicated that argatroban combined with DAPT might be an effective strategy for reducing the incidence of END in patients with BAD.

Hence, we designed a multicenter, open-label, blinded end point randomized trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of combining argatroban with DAPT for treating BAD.

Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Guidelines and are an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines. Methods- Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. An update of the 2013 AIS Guidelines was originally published in January 2018. This guideline was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. In April 2018, a revision to these guidelines, deleting some recommendations, was published online by the AHA. The writing group was asked review the original document and revise if appropriate. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials with > 100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers' comments and revised when appropriate. The current final document was approved by all members of the writing group except when relationships with industry precluded members from voting and by the governing bodies of the AHA. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/AHA 2015 Class of Recommendations and Level of Evidence and the new AHA guidelines format. Results- These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the prehospital and hospital settings. Conclusions- These guidelines provide general recommendations based on the currently available evidence to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. In many instances, however, only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

### Outcomes of argatroban treatment in patients with atherothrombotic stroke: observational nationwide study in Japan [^116vrpUj]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Argatroban, a selective thrombin inhibitor, is recommended for the use in patients with atherothrombotic stroke by the Japanese Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke. We performed a nationwide Japanese study to investigate whether argatroban improved early stroke outcomes in patients with acute atherothrombotic stroke.

Methods

This retrospective observational study, using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database in Japan, included patients who were hospitalized from July 1, 2010, to March 31, 2012, with a diagnosis of atherothrombotic stroke within 1 day of stroke onset. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those receiving argatroban on admission (argatroban group), and those who did not receive argatroban during hospitalization (control group). To balance the baseline characteristics and concomitant treatments during hospitalization between the 2 groups, one-to-one propensity-score matching analyses were performed. The main outcomes were the modified Rankin Scale score at discharge and the occurrence of hemorrhagic complications during hospitalization. An ordinal logistic regression analysis evaluated the association between argatroban use and modified Rankin Scale at discharge.

Results

After propensity-score matching, 2289 pairs of patients were analyzed. There were no significant differences in modified Rankin Scale at discharge between the argatroban and the control groups (adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–1.16). The occurrence of hemorrhagic complications did not differ significantly between the argatroban and the control groups (3.5% versus 3.8%; P = 0.58).

Conclusions

The present study suggested that argatroban was safe, but had no added benefit in early outcomes after acute atherothrombotic stroke.

Antiplatelet treatment — Administration of aspirin is recommended in patients with AIS within 24 to 48 hours after onset. For those treated with IV alteplase, aspirin administration is generally delayed until 24 hours later but might be considered in the presence of concomitant conditions for which such treatment given in the absence of IV alteplase is known to provide substantial benefit or withholding such treatment is known to cause substantial risk, and supporting trials administered doses between 160 and 300 mg.

### Efficacy of anti-coagulant treatment with argatroban on cardioembolic stroke [^115CoHhb]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Argatroban, which is a thrombin inhibitor, has an indication as a treatment in the acute phase on atherosclerotic ischemic stroke in Japan. Howeve, in cardioembolic stroke, argatroban is considered to be contraindicated with the side effect of hemorrhage, though there is no clear clinical evidence to show that argatroban increases hemorrhagic compared with heparin. The efficacy of anticoagulant treatment with argatroban on cardioembolic stroke was evaluated retrospectively in this study. We identified 3,113 patients from the Japan Standard Stroke Registry Study who had had a cardioembolic ischemic stroke. We excluded patients with the anti-platelet treatment or the combination therapy of anticoagulation. Our analyses are therefore based on a cohort of 2,529 patients who were treated either with heparin, and argatroban, or with no anti-coagulation treatment. With multivariable regression, hemorrhagic it was shown that hemorrhage was significantly reduced in heparin and argatroban treatments in the patients with mild severity. There was no significant difference in the recurrence of ischemic stroke between the treatments. Both argatroban and heparin showed dramatic improvement compared with the no treatment standard, but only heparin achieved statistical significance for mortality and change in NIHSS score (admission to discharge) in the moderate stroke subgroup [NIHSS 11–22]. Both heparin and argatroban [more so than heparin alone] have a significantly reduced mortality risk. From the present study, it is suggested that argatroban may be useful on cardioembolic stroke, increasing the improvement of recovery of stroke severity without increasing the risk of hemorrhage. Further prospective studies are awaited for evaluating better the efficacy of argatroban on cardioembolic stroke.

### Baseline neurological deficit and argatroban plus alteplase in acute ischemic stroke: a post hoc analysis of ARAIS trial [^111iF21Z]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The ARAIS trial didn't demonstrate argatroban significantly improve functional outcome at 90 days in acute ischemic stroke. We conducted post hoc analysis of ARAIS to investigate whether baseline neurological deficit was associated with outcomes.

Methods

Patients without endovascular therapy who met screening criteria as protocol and completed argatroban treatment were enrolled and classified into two subgroups according to NIHSS score at admission. Primary outcome was excellent functional outcome at 90 days, defined as mRS score of 0 to 1. Early neurological deterioration (END), defined as an increase of ≥ 4 in the NIHSS score from baseline within 48 hours, was investigated as secondary outcome. Compared with alteplase alone, we investigated treatment effect of argatroban plus alteplase on outcomes in subgroups and interaction with subgroups.

Results

A total of 675 patients from full analysis set were included: 390 were assigned into NIHSS score < 10 subgroup and 285 into NIHSS score ≥ 10 subgroup. For primary outcome, there was similar treatment effect between argatroban plus alteplase and alteplase alone in NIHSS score ≥ 10 subgroup (adjusted RD, 5.8%; 95% CI, -6.0% to 17.5%; P = 0.33) and in NIHSS score < 10 subgroup (adjusted RD, -1.4%; 95% CI, -9.9% to 7.1%; P = 0.75), and no significant interaction (P = 0.43). Occurrence of early neurological deterioration within 48 hours were significantly lower in NIHSS score ≥ 10 subgroup, compared with NIHSS score < 10 subgroup (P = 0.006).

Conclusion

Among patients with NIHSS score ≥ 10, argatroban plus alteplase could safely reduce END within 48 hours.

Intravenous tPA in patients with previous use of antithrombotic agents

Patients who had a stroke are often on antithrombotic agents, oral anticoagulants, heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and/or recent treated with of tPA. A small retrospective study explored the safety of thrombolysis in patients on antiplatelet agents and found that the risk of sICH was not increased, but parenchymal ICH rate rose substantially. One retrospective study in China found potential risk of sICH in patients on antiplatelet therapy. One large randomised controlled study reported that patients on antiplatelet agents had a trend of developing haemorrhage but without statistical significance, which was supported by meta-analysis findings.

According to the previously published guidelines and drug information, INR > 1.7 or PT > 15 s in AIS patients with onset of < 3 hours were two contraindications for intravenous tPA. In addition, regardless of the value of INR, it would be contraindicated if a patient was on anticoagulant. One large registry study demonstrated that warfarin increased the risk of sICH. However, after adjustment for stroke severity, age and comorbidities, the risk of sICH was not increased if INR was in the therapeutic range. Compared with unfractionated heparin, LMWH does not prolong PTT but has more biological activity and longer duration of action. Therefore, patients on LMWH within 24 hours of onset of stroke are not suitable for intravenous thrombolytic therapy due to increased risk of haemorrhage.

Direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran and argatroban) have become the first-line treatment for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation or peripheral vascular disease. A prospective study of 65 patients who received combination of intravenous argatroban and tPA found that the rate of recanalisation rate was 61% and rate of haemorrhage was 4.6%. Idarizumab, as the antidote of dabigatran, can block the action of dabigatran in several minutes. After careful consideration and reversal of dabigatran with idarizumab, intravenous tPA could be given.PT and aPTT could be prolonged in patients on oral FXa inhibitors (apixaban and rivaroxaban). Even with normal aPTT, INR, platelet count, ecarin clotting time, thrombin time, or direct factor Xa activity assays, or no history of receiving these non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in the past 48 hours (assuming renal function is normal), the efficacy and safety of intravenous tPA remains unclear.

### Combining intravenous thrombolysis and antithrombotic agents in stroke: an update [^112E1CfS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The results of the randomized controlled multicenter ARTSS‐2 study were recently published. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of a treatment combining a standard dose of intravenous rtPA and an intravenous bolus of 100 μg/kg of argatroban in association with 1 μg/kg per minute (low dose) or 3 μg/kg per minute (high dose) by intravenous perfusion over 48 hours, as compared with conventional intravenous thrombolysis performed within 4.5 hours after the onset of stroke. 26 Ninety patients were randomized: 29 received rtPA only, 30 received rtPA and the low dose of argatroban, and 31 received rtPA and the high dose of argatroban. The rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage were similar in the 3 groups. At 90 days, 6 (21%) rtPA alone, 9 (30%) low‐dose, and 10 (32%) high‐dose patients had a modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1. The relative risks (95% credible interval) for modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1 with low‐, high‐, and either low‐ or high‐dose argatroban were 1.17 (0.57–2.37), 1.27 (0.63–2.53), and 1.34 (0.68–2.76), respectively.

The results of these studies indicate that adding argatroban to rtPA is safe and that it can potentially provide a clinical benefit, thus justifying the evaluation of this association in a larger therapeutic trial.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) IV alteplase — prior antiplatelet therapy: IV alteplase is recommended for patients taking antiplatelet drug monotherapy before stroke because the benefit outweighs a possible small increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and it is also recommended for patients taking antiplatelet drug combination therapy (eg, aspirin and clopidogrel) before stroke given that the benefit outweighs a probable increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (both COR I, LOE A or B-NR as stated).

### The intensive care management of acute ischemic stroke: an overview [^111ak7k3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In part due to the availability of more aggressive treatments, increasing numbers of patients with AIS are being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Despite the availability of consensus guidance for the general management of AIS, there is little evidence to support its ICU management. The purpose of this article is to provide a contemporary perspective, and our recommendations, on the ICU management of AIS.

Methods

We reviewed the current general AIS guidelines provided by the European Stroke Organisation, the American Stroke Association, and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, as well as the wider literature, for the data most relevant to the ICU management of AIS.

Results

There are four interventions in AIS supported by class I evidence: care on a stroke unit, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4.5 h of stroke onset, aspirin within 48 h of stroke onset, and decompressive craniectomy for supratentorial malignant hemispheric cerebral infarction. However, robust evidence for specific AIS management principles in the ICU setting is weak. Management principles currently focus on airway and ventilation management, hemodynamic and fluid optimization, fever and glycemic control, management of anticoagulation, antiplatelet and thromboprophylaxis therapy, control of seizures and surgical interventions for malignant middle cerebral artery and cerebellar infarctions.

Conclusions

We have provided our recommendations for the principles of ICU management of AIS, based on the best available current evidence. Encouragement of large-scale recruitment of patients with AIS into clinical trials should aid the development of robust evidence for the benefit of different interventions in the ICU on outcome.

Evidence from other direct anticoagulants

Argatroban is an intravenous thrombin inhibitor commonly used during interventional procedures in cardiology, licensed back in 2000. Recently argatroban was tested in a Chinese multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (ARAIS). This study included 817 patients qualifying for IVT: 402 received argatroban (bolus followed by 48-h infusion) plus alteplase, and 415 received alteplase alone. The rates of sICH were similar between the two groups. The MOST study compared a similar approach with argatroban given within 75 min of thrombolysis, but with even higher doses of argatroban than ARAIS. The MOST study was stopped for futility in the summer for 2023 after a pre-planned analysis of the first 500 patients showed no statistically significant signal of harm in the high-dose argatroban arm that enrolled 59 patients. However, argatroban is not fully comparable to DOAC treatment which mostly consists of factor Xa antagonists so these studies cannot be used to imply that IVT in patients with DOAC intake is safe. In addition, patients included in randomized controlled trials are usually less fragile than real world patients.

### Prior anticoagulation and risk of hemorrhagic transformation in acute stroke: a post hoc analysis of the PRODAST study [^115S6HQR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

On a pathophysiological level, a potential explanation for this finding could be that inhibition of thrombin, whether direct or indirect, contributes to a more stable blood brain barrier (BBB) in acute stroke. HT in AIS occurs due to dysfunction of the BBB, which is, in addition to the primary cell death during AIS, further influenced by inflammation and metalloproteases. Thrombin may induce BBB dysfunction by a matrix metalloprotease (MMP)–dependent mechanism. Therefore, anticoagulants inhibiting thrombin may be regarded as BBB stabilizing. Experimental studies have investigated the effect of anticoagulants on the risk of HT in rodent models. In a study by Bieber et al, it was shown that treatment with edoxaban led to a reduction of stroke severity in mice by reducing damage of the BBB and inflammation. In contrast, Pfeilschifter et al reported that prior use of VKAs dramatically increases the risk of HT in a middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice. Thus, results from experimental studies on the effect of preexisting anticoagulant use on the risk of HT are conflicting. Our study provides evidence that early HT of AIS is indeed prevented by prior anticoagulant use in humans. A multicenter study by Meinel et al recently demonstrated that intravenous thrombolysis in patients currently receiving anticoagulation resulted in lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage compared with patients without anticoagulation. This is in line with our current findings. Of note, the number of patients who received thrombolysis despite OAC use was too small in our study to conduct a meaningful subanalysis. In the study by Meinel et al, the proportion of HT, similar to our current work, was approximately halved in patients taking OACs, which may further support the safety of thrombolysis despite anticoagulation. Furthermore, the randomized controlled trial ARAIS (Argatroban plus r‐tPA for Acute Ischemic Stroke) investigated whether adding the thrombin inhibitor argatroban to alteplase for acute ischemic stroke was safe and effective. Interestingly, the rates of HT were similar between both groups and not lower in the argatroban group. Hypothetically, BBB stabilizing effects by thrombin inhibition may thus be evident only with longer therapy as in patients with prior OAC use, such as in our study. Current guidelines are ambiguous in their recommendation regarding thrombolysis in patients with stroke with existing OAC therapy. Randomized controlled trials are therefore currently underway to investigate the safety and efficacy of thrombolysis in this situation.

### Baseline neurological deficit and argatroban plus alteplase in acute ischemic stroke: a post hoc analysis of ARAIS trial [^117JnDCA]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Additionally, argatroban plus alteplase significantly reduced risk of early neurological deterioration within 48 ​h in NIHSS score ≥ 10 subgroup, which agreed with benefit of excellent functional outcome in this population given the close association of early neurological deterioration with poor prognosis after intravenous thrombolysis. The results were consistent with our previous study reporting that argatroban could safely reduce early neurological deterioration in patients with large artery atherosclerosis.

The main strength of this study is the first attempt to investigate the effect of argatroban plus alteplase in acute ischemic stroke with different NIHSS score at admission, and found that argatroban plus alteplase may reduce early neurological deterioration in acute ischemic stroke with NIHSS score ≥ 10, which may explain the neutral results of ARAIS study. However, we admitted there were several limitations in the current study. First, statistical power would be affected by imbalanced sample size in each NIHSS score subgroup. Although we performed sensitivity analysis by propensity score matching to address the imbalanced sample size between NIHSS score subgroups to some extent, lower proportion of patients with NIHSS score ≥ 10 still affected the power. Thus, the efficacy of argatroban plus alteplase in patients with severe stroke warrant further investigation in a cohort with adequate and balanced sample size. Second, the difference for primary outcome was not statistically significant in subgroups. The neutral result may be attributed to the small sample size after selection and matching in the sensitivity analysis. Third, there were also lower proportion of patients with large artery atherosclerosis stroke included in the current study. Therefore, the results may not exactly represent the efficacy of argatroban plus alteplase in stroke with LVO. However, the NIHSS score at admission may indirectly reflect degree of vessel stenosis as we discussed. In the future, patients with higher NIHSS score matched with vessel imaging before intravenous thrombolysis may be screened for verifying the results. Fourth, the low dose of argatroban and low rate of target activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in the ARAIS study also existed in the post hoc analysis. High dose of argatroban and good target APTT theoretically may produce a significantly better improvement of clinical outcome in severe stroke. Therefore, this limited the generalization of the results. Fifth, the generalizability of the results would need to be validated in other cohorts, particularly in a non-Chinese population. We interpreted our findings with caution due to exploratory nature of post hoc analysis. These findings warrant confirmation.

### The argatroban and tissue-type plasminogen activator stroke study: final results of a pilot safety study [^116wQoNz]. Stroke (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that safely augments recanalization achieved by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in animal stroke models. The Argatroban tPA Stroke Study was an open-label, pilot safety study of tPA plus Argatroban in patients with ischemic stroke due to proximal intracranial occlusion.

Methods

During standard-dose intravenous tPA, a 100-μg/kg bolus of Argatroban and infusion for 48 hours was adjusted to a target partial thromboplastin time of 1.75× baseline. The primary outcome was incidence of significant intracerebral hemorrhage defined as either symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or Parenchymal Hematoma Type 2. Recanalization was measured at 2 and 24 hours by transcranial Doppler or CT angiography.

Results

Sixty-five patients were enrolled (45% men, mean age 63 ± 14 years, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale = 13). The median (interquartile range) time tPA to Argatroban bolus was 51 (38–60) minutes. Target anticoagulation was reached at a median (interquartile range) of 3 (2–7) hours. Significant intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 4 patients (6.2%; 95% CI, 1.7–15.0). Of these, 3 were symptomatic (4.6%; 95% CI, 0.9–12.9). Seven patients (10%) died in the first 7 days. Within the 2-hour monitoring period, transcranial Doppler recanalization (n = 47) occurred in 29 (61%) patients: complete in 19 (40%) and partial in another 10 (21%).

Conclusions

The combination of Argatroban and intravenous tPA is potentially safe in patients with moderate neurological deficits due to proximal intracranial arterial occlusions and may produce more complete recanalization than tPA alone. Continued evaluation of this treatment combination is warranted.

### Challenges in the anesthetic and intensive care management of acute ischemic stroke [^115JtqAn]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a devastating condition with high morbidity and mortality. In the past 2 decades, the treatment of AIS has been revolutionized by the introduction of several interventions supported by class I evidence-care on a stroke unit, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4.5 hours of stroke onset, aspirin commenced within 48 hours of stroke onset, and decompressive craniectomy for supratentorial malignant hemispheric cerebral infarction. There is new class I evidence also demonstrating benefits of endovascular therapy on functional outcomes in those with anterior circulation stroke. In addition, the importance of the careful management of key systemic physiological variables, including oxygenation, blood pressure, temperature, and serum glucose, has been appreciated. In line with this, the role of anesthesiologists and intensivists in managing AIS has increased. This review highlights the main challenges in the endovascular and intensive care management of AIS that, in part, result from the paucity of research focused on these areas. It also provides guidelines for the management of AIS based upon current evidence, and identifies areas for further research.

### Management of anticoagulant-related intracranial hemorrhage: an evidence-based review [^1162V8hY]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Similarly, unfractionated heparin (UFH) – a parenteral anticoagulant for various indications – also carries a risk of AICH. The incidence of symptomatic ICH used with UFH or heparinoids is 1 to 2.7% in patients with acute ischemic stroke. A direct thrombin inhibitor, argatroban, another commonly used short-term parenteral anticoagulant, is associated with a 4.3% incidence of AICH.

In contrast, there are promising yet limited clinical data on AICH associated with the use of newer oral anticoagulants. The results of recent clinical trials using these drugs are presented in Table 2. The rates of ICH were 0.74%, 0.30%, and 0.23% per year among those assigned to warfarin, dabigatran 150 mg, and dabigatran 110 mg respectively in the RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long Term Anticoagulant Therapy) trial, which assessed the efficacy of this oral direct thrombin inhibitor in atrial fibrillation. In contrast, in the RE-COVER (Efficacy and Safety of Dabigatran Compared to Warfarin for 6 Month Treatment of Acute Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism) trial, which compared dabigatran and warfarin in acute venous thromboembolism, there were no incidences of ICH during 6 months of therapy. The yearly incidence of AICH ranged between 0.33 and 0.35% for apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, in two different trials – the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events) trial and the AVERROES (Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Strokes) trial. The incidence of AICH linked to rivaroxaban, another oral factor Xa inhibitor, in the ROCKET-AF (Rivaroxaban Once-daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) study was 0.49%; that of warfarin was 0.74% (P < 0.05). However, in the EINSTEIN-PE (Oral Rivaroxaban Alone for the Treatment of Symptomatic Pulmonary Embolism) trial – a study that compared the efficacy of rivaroxaban with that of enoxaparin followed by warfarin in patients with pulmonary embolism – the incidence of AICH was lower for rivaroxaban (0.1% vs. 0.5%; P = 0.003). For cerebrovascular indication, national registry data showed similar peri-procedural incidence of ICH with bivalirudin and UFH after carotid stenting (0.1% vs. 0.2%; odds ratio = 0.62, 95% confidence interval = 0.20 to 1.91; P = 0.41).

Acute ischemic stroke — aspirin timing after onset and after IV alteplase: Administration of aspirin is recommended in patients with AIS within 24 to 48 hours after onset. For those treated with IV alteplase, aspirin administration is generally delayed until 24 hours later but might be considered in the presence of concomitant conditions for which such treatment given in the absence of IV alteplase is known to provide substantial benefit or withholding such treatment is known to cause substantial risk. The recommendation was modified from the previous guideline to remove the specific dosing recommendation, "initial dose is 325 mg", because previous clinical trials supporting its use for AIS included doses of 160 to 300 mg.

### Combining intravenous thrombolysis and antithrombotic agents in stroke: an update [^115Bq88E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Alteplase and Argatroban

Argatroban is a direct inhibitor of free and clot‐associated thrombin. The safety of this agent has been demonstrated in patients with myocardial infarction, whether or not in association with thrombolysis or aspirin. 23 Argatroban has the advantage of having a short half‐life, which allows its anticoagulating action to be terminated rapidly in case of hemorrhage. Additionally, its activity can be controlled by measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time.

In animal models of stroke, argatroban increased the efficacy of rtPA as a result of its favorable impact on microcirculation, on the speed of arterial recanalization, and on the prevention of reocclusion. 24

A pilot study, ARTSS (Argatroban tPA Stroke Study), has evaluated the safety of a treatment associating 0.9 mg/kg of intravenous rtPA and argatroban administered as an intravenous bolus of 100 μg/kg followed by a perfusion of 1 μg/kg per minute over 48 hours. 25 Sixty‐five patients (average age 63 ± 14; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 13) with a proximal intracranial arterial occlusion were included in this study between May 2003 and August 2010. The activated partial thromboplastin time target was 1.75 times the control under argatroban. A complete or partial arterial recanalization was seen in 55% of the patients at 2 hours and in 78% at 24 hours. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 3 patients (4.6%) and 7 patients (10.8%) died within the first 7 days, mainly as a result of extensive cerebral infarction. These preliminary safety data regarding the association of argatroban and intravenous rtPA have led to additional studies.

The other RCT(, Table 4b) in Japan enrolled 54 patients with lacunar infarcts (n = 29) or branch atheromatous disease (n = 23) within 48 h of stroke and randomised 28 to argatroban, aspirin and clopidogrel (AAC) and 26 to argatroban and aspirin (AA) and therefore is a trial of clopidogrel versus no clopidogrel on a background of argatroban and aspirin. The outcomes were progressive stroke, defined as worsening of ⩾ 2 NIHSS on the seventh day of admission, and mRS at 3 months, but neither outcome was reported for the lacunar stroke group alone. There were fewer progressive strokes in the AAC group than in the AA group (0 [0%] versus 4 [16%] p = 0.04) but no difference in dependency (mRS 3–6) at 3 months (AAC 6 [21%] vs AA 8 [32%], p = 0.53). Sources of bias included randomisation by sealed envelope, open label and follow-up by hospital staff (blinding not mentioned).

We found one entry in a trial registry (UMIN-CTR Clinical Trial) for a RCT of cilostazol+ aspirin versus aspirin started within 48 h of symptom onset and continued for 14 days to prevent progressive symptoms in lacunar stroke in Japan with outcomes including NIHSS and Barthel Index at 14 days (C000000454, Terayami et al, 2006), but could not find any results.

### Stroke medicine terminology: imprecise, wordy, and misleading [^113xFZh6]. Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

"Acute ischemic stroke" diagnostics

The term "acute ischemic stroke" (AIS) is widely used in the scientific literature. In fact, the updated American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines (2018) for early management of acute ischemic stroke mention "acute ischemic stroke" with the variations "acute stroke", "acute arterial ischemic stroke", or "acute stroke syndrome" a total of 154 times, even though stroke is "acute" by definition and "ischemic stroke" is used interchangeably with "acute ischemic stroke" — a syndrome with sudden onset likely caused by ischemia. "Acute ischemic stroke" is a pleonasm and reflects inaccuracy. The treatment of "AIS" as a pathological entity is more problematic however. In the literature, authors are often unclear regarding causative pathology and, as a result, one may come across terms such as "stroke imaging" and "stroke volume". However, a clinical syndrome like headache or stroke can only be reported: it cannot be imaged, has no volume, and cannot be treated effectively.

### Intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in patients with recent direct oral anticoagulant use: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115XWMKJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This systematic review and meta‐analysis is reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis guidelines. The study is registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, ID code: CRD42023400706. No institutional review board approval or informed consent was necessary for conducting this meta‐analysis. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Studies

Our systematic search included all the randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, cross‐sectional studies, case series (5 or more patients), and case–control studies of patients taking DOAC who received IVT for ischemic stroke. The control group consisted of a similar population not taking DOAC. Studies were included if they contained the intervention of interest or head‐to‐head comparisons and at least 1 of the outcomes of interest described herein. There was no restriction on language or country. We excluded case reports, abstracts, posters, review articles, studies in nonhumans, and studies discussing any of the following: (1) interventions other than IVT with alteplase or tenecteplase (for instance intra‐atrial thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator [tPA]), (2) patients who were taking other oral anticoagulants such as warfarin before the ischemic stroke, (3) patients who were on any nonoral anticoagulants such as heparin or enoxaparin before the ischemic stroke, (4) coadministration of tPA and other anticoagulants (eg, argatroban), and (5) presence of obvious contraindications for thrombolysis rather than treatment with DOAC.

Participants

Participants were adults (≥ 18 years old) with recent use or nonuse of DOAC, presented with acute ischemic stroke and treated with IVT, with or without specific antidote before IVT, as well as with or without mechanical thrombectomy following IVT.

Interventions

IVT consisted of acute intravenous administration of either alteplase or tenecteplase. The doses of alteplase used were 0.9 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, or 0.7 mg/kg, depending on regional guidelines and practice. Tenecteplase was administered at doses of 0.4 mg/kg or 0.25 mg/kg. All doses were administered within 4.5 hours from the last known well time.

### Effect of argatroban plus dual antiplatelet in branch atherosclerosis disease: a randomized clinical trial [^115T8thv]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations that need to be considered. First, due to the adoption of an open-label design, the concealment of treatment plans from participants and physicians was not possible, potentially affecting the objectivity of the outcomes. Nonetheless, we used a blinded evaluation approach for the study end points to minimize measurement biases and ensure the objectivity of our primary end points. Second, patients who received intravenous thrombolysis were excluded, which may limit the general applicability of the findings. Third, this study excluded specific etiologies like cardioembolic ischemic stroke, resulting in the study population mainly composed of atherosclerotic-type patients. Consequently, we could not perform a detailed etiological classification of BAD, and the findings are mainly applicable to the atherosclerotic subtype of patients with BAD. Fourth, although no safety events such as intracranial hemorrhage were observed, coagulation parameters were not dynamically monitored in patients using argatroban, nor were the doses adjusted according to the individual patient's condition, which may lead to other potential impacts. Notably, given the individual variability in ischemic stroke, the geographic limitation of our participants in Southwest China, and the relatively small sample size, the generalizability of our results is limited. Therefore, further validation across national and international regions, as well as stratified analysis by center is needed.

Conclusions

For patients with BAD at high risk of END who have not undergone intravenous thrombolysis, the administration of argatroban plus DAPT significantly reduced the occurrence of END and improved the 90-day functional outcome without increasing bleeding risk.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to summarize the therapeutic advances and evidence in the medical management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Recent evidence comparing the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase (TNK) with alteplase for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in AIS will be highlighted. Recent advances and evidence on improving micro-circulation following endovascular procedures and neuroprotection will be reviewed.

Recent Findings

A significant number of randomized control studies now support the use of tenecteplase for IVT in AIS. TNK 0.25mg/kg single bolus is as effective and well tolerated as alteplase 0.9mg/kg infusion for IVT in AIS. Evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs) has shown effective and well tolerated expansion of the therapeutic window of IVT in the wake-up stroke and up to 9h after last seen well, using advanced neuroimaging with computed tomography perfusion/MRI. Early evidence suggests that intra-arterial alteplase may help improve microcirculation in patients with large vessel occlusion following successful thrombectomy. However, more trials are required to confirm the results. Similarly, early evidence from a recent RCT showed that remote ischemic conditioning confers potential neuroprotection and improves outcomes in AIS.

Summary

Converging evidence has demonstrated that for patients with ischemic stroke presenting at under 4.5h from the onset, TNK is comparable to alteplase. These data along with the practical advantages of TNK have resulted in a shift to replace intravenous TNK as the standard for thrombolysis. Ongoing studies of IVT with TNK are focussed on defining the optimal dose, expanding the time window with multimodal imaging and defining the role of thrombolysis for bridging patients with stroke due to large vessel occlusion.

### Argatroban for prevention and treatment of thromboembolism in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^113kqPvt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To renew the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy adverse events, and cost of argatroban in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1980 to August 2000) of English-language literature was conducted using the search term argatroban to identify pertinent case reports, clinical trials, abstracts, and review articles. Additional reports were identified from the reference lists compiled in the literature reviewed, as well as from the manufacturer.

Data Synthesis

Argatroban is a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor indicated for parenteral use in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism in patients with HIT. Its elimination half-life is approximately 40–50 minutes, and it is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary secretion. Compared with historical controls, argatroban-treated patients with HIT or HIT with thrombosis (HITTS) experienced lower rates of the composite end point of death, amputation, and new thrombosis. Dosing is initiated at 2 microg/kg/min and adjusted to maintain the activated partial thromboplastin time at 1.5–3 times the patient's baseline. In Japan, argatroban is approved for use in acute ischemic stroke and chronic peripheral occlusive disease. It has also been used as an alternative to unfractionated heparin (UFH) in patients with a history of HIT or HITTS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and other procedures. Additionally, argatroban has been compared with UFH in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were receiving thrombolytic therapy. Hemorrhage is the primary adverse event associated with argatroban. Argatroban increases the prothrombin time, making assessment of the intensity of warfarin therapy during concurrent administration more complex.

Conclusions

The use of argatroban in patients with HIT and HITTS is associated with improvement in clinical outcomes compared with historical controls. Argatroban offers several practical advantages over other available agents with respect to dosing, monitoring, reversibility of effect with discontinuation of the drug, and cost.

Single drug antiplatelet aggregation therapy

Recommendations

Aspirin is recommended for patients with AIS within 24–48 hours after onset. For patients treated with IV rt-PA, aspirin is usually delayed until 24 hours later (class I, level of evidence A).
Aspirin (50–325 mg/day) or clopidogrel (75 mg/day) alone can be used as primary antiplatelet drug therapy (class I, level of evidence A).
Aspirin therapy is not recommended as an alternative therapy for patients with AIS who are suitable for IV rt-PA thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy (class III, level of evidence B).
Ticagrelor (instead of aspirin) is not recommended for acute mild stroke (class III, level of evidence B).
Cilostazol can be used in patients with AIS as an alternative to aspirin if aspirin or clopidogrel is not available (class IIa, level of evidence A).
For high risk of aspirin intolerance (gastrointestinal adverse reactions or allergies, etc) in patients with ischaemic stroke, indobufen (100 mg per time, twice a day) is feasible (class IIb, level of evidence B).
Abciximab is not recommended for AIS (class III, level of evidence B).
Tirofiban is safe in the perioperative period for bridging therapy or endovascular therapy. The recommended dose is 0.1–0.2 μg/(kg·min) and continuous infusion should be limited in 24 hours (class IIa, level of evidence B).
The efficacy of tirofiban and eptifibatide has not been fully determined, and further studies are needed to confirm (class IIb, level of evidence B).

Dual antiplatelet aggregation therapy

Recommendations

For patients with mild stroke and high-risk TIA who did not receive IV thrombolysis, dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg/day, clopidogrel 75 mg/day (first day load dose 300 mg)) was initiated within 24 hours of onset and lasted for 21 days, then clopidogrel 75 mg/day which could significantly reduce stroke recurrence for 90 days (class I, level of evidence A).
The efficacy of dipyridamole alone or dipyridamole combined with aspirin for preventing the recurrence of ischaemic stroke still needs RCTs to confirm (class IIb, level of evidence B).

Triple antiplatelet aggregation therapy

Recommendations

1. Triple antiplatelet aggregation therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel and dipyridamole) are not recommended for the treatment of acute non-cardiogenic stroke and TIA (class III, level of evidence B).

Acute ischemic stroke — low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) versus UFH for prophylaxis: When prophylactic anticoagulation is used, the benefit of prophylactic-dose LMWH over prophylactic-dose UFH is uncertain. There were no significant effects on death or disability for LMWH/heparinoids compared with UFH, and LMWH/heparinoid use was associated with a reduction in DVTs (OR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.44–0.70]) at the expense of a greater risk of major extracranial hemorrhages (OR, 3.79 [95% CI, 1.30–11.03]); LMWH can be administered once a day, but higher cost and increased bleeding risk in elderly patients with renal impairment are disadvantages that should be kept in mind.
