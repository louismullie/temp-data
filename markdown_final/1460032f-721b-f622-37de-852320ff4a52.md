## Question

Large granular lymphocytes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about large granular lymphocytes (LGLs), including their definition, subtypes, pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and special scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental definition and normal physiology of LGLs. Then, I should classify the disease entities and their epidemiology. Next, I will examine pathogenesis, followed by diagnostic criteria and pitfalls. After that, I need to review treatment strategies and response assessment. Finally, I will consider prognosis, special scenarios, and summarize practical takeaways with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the basic definition and physiology. LGLs are large lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasmic azurophilic granules that contain perforin, granzymes, and TIA-1, conferring cytotoxic function; they include CD3− NK cells and CD3+ cytotoxic T cells, with NK cells comprising the majority of normal LGLs and cytotoxic T cells a smaller fraction, typically around 5–10% of peripheral lymphocytes in health [^4890b364] [^8c3c0cae].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about disease classification. I should verify the entities. The WHO and contemporary guidelines recognize three main categories: T-cell LGL leukemia (T-LGLL), NK-LGLL (formerly CLPD-NK), and aggressive NK-cell leukemia (ANKL); T-LGLL is most common (~85%), NK-LGLL accounts for ~10–15%, and ANKL is rare and aggressive, often EBV-associated with poor outcomes, particularly prevalent in Asia [^e257d323] [^6dc8ff62] [^36fd5e1e].

> I need to check epidemiology carefully. Population-based data show T-LGLL is extremely rare, with an incidence around 0.2 per million per year in the US, median age near 66–67 years, and female patients diagnosed slightly earlier; many patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, and a substantial fraction never require therapy, though about 45% receive treatment at diagnosis in some cohorts [^ba43f27e] [^b27cff99] [^6f57a9c7].

> Next, I should review pathogenesis. Let me think about the central mechanisms. Chronic antigenic stimulation, often in the setting of autoimmunity, drives clonal expansion of cytotoxic T or NK cells; JAK/STAT signaling is constitutively activated in most cases, with STAT3 mutations in roughly 30–50% and STAT5B mutations more common in CD4+ T-LGLL; additional mutations in TET2, KMT2D, and CCL22 have been described, and resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis with upregulation of survival pathways (PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, MCL1) contributes to persistence [^c190a8f6] [^da80f5f7] [^a31f67fd] [^67e54615].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria because this is where misclassification occurs. Diagnosis rests on clinicopathologic correlation: persistent LGL expansion (> 0.5 × 10⁹/L for > 6 months), clonal TCR rearrangement or NK-receptor restriction, characteristic immunophenotype (CD3+ CD8+ CD57+ TCRαβ+ for T-LGLL; CD3− CD16+ CD56+ for NK-LGLL), and exclusion of reactive causes; bone marrow is not universally required but is useful when LGL counts are low or marrow failure is suspected, and TRBC1 flow cytometry is a sensitive surrogate for T-cell clonality; importantly, clonality alone is insufficient and must be interpreted in clinical context [^d40a4694] [^80eb4319] [^dfdc74e5] [^ce87558d].

> I should double-check the differential diagnosis and common mimics. Reactive LGL expansions can be polyclonal or oligoclonal and occur with viral infections (notably CMV), autoimmune disease, and post-transplant states; T-cell clones of uncertain significance (T-CUS) represent small, persistent clonal T-LGL populations without cytopenias or symptoms and require observation rather than therapy; distinguishing these from true LGLL requires integrated clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular data [^d51532dc] [^643cb747] [^f6029e67] [^4374e06f].

> Let me consider treatment principles, and I need to ensure I align with guidelines. Asymptomatic patients without significant cytopenias should be observed; therapy is indicated for symptomatic cytopenias (ANC < 0.5 × 10⁹/L, transfusion-dependent anemia, or symptomatic thrombocytopenia) or autoimmune complications. First-line immunosuppression includes low-dose methotrexate, cyclosporine, or cyclophosphamide, with methotrexate often preferred; responses are typically hematologic rather than clonal, and sequential use of agents yields responses in most patients; alemtuzumab has activity in refractory cases, and JAK/STAT inhibitors are under investigation [^d40a4694] [^41d154ba] [^c4ef7a20] [^1ed74e38] [^c190a8f6].

> Hold on, I should verify response criteria and duration limits. NCCN defines complete response as normalization of hemoglobin, ANC, and platelets with LGL < 0.5 × 10⁹/L, and partial response as meaningful improvements without full normalization; cyclophosphamide should be limited to 4 months if no response and generally not extended beyond 12 months due to toxicity risks [^3a7cb9e8] [^0e7a4be7].

> I will now examine prognosis and prognostic factors. Median overall survival is approximately 9–10 years, worse than age-matched controls, with older age and comorbidities predicting worse outcomes; STAT3-mutated patients more often require therapy but may have better survival, whereas γδ T-LGLL appears more symptomatic yet has similar survival to αβ T-LGLL; rare aggressive T-LGLL variants (e.g. CD56+) behave differently and require intensified therapy [^ba43f27e] [^540b7991] [^d2f43a0f] [^fc103712].

> But wait, what about special scenarios that change management. Post-allogeneic transplant LGL expansions are common, often after CMV, and can contribute to cytopenias; immunosuppression improves neutropenia in many cases, and these expansions may be clonal yet indolent and distinct from de novo LGLL; isolated anemia, including pure red cell aplasia, can be the sole initial manifestation and responds well to LGLL-directed therapy; pediatric and young adult clonal T-LGL proliferations are often reactive and warrant cautious interpretation [^a10ec2dd] [^2660d436] [^53a78d0f].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic pitfalls to ensure nothing is missed. Small clonal T-LGL populations can be detected in autoimmune disease and bone marrow failure syndromes, so clonality must be interpreted alongside cytopenias, symptoms, and morphology; transient monoclonal expansions can follow CMV or other infections, reinforcing the need for persistence and clinical correlation before labeling LGLL [^d40a4694] [^d51532dc].

> In summary, I need to ensure the practical takeaways are clear. LGLs are cytotoxic lymphocytes whose clonal expansion defines LGLL, an indolent disease with autoimmune features driven by antigenic stimulation and JAK/STAT activation; diagnosis requires integrated clinicopathologic criteria with clonality assessment; observation is appropriate for asymptomatic patients, while immunosuppression is first-line for symptomatic cytopenias; prognosis is generally favorable but inferior to the general population, and emerging targeted therapies may reshape future care [^c190a8f6] [^d40a4694] [^ba43f27e].

Large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) are **cytotoxic lymphocytes** with azurophilic granules that include NK cells and cytotoxic T cells [^4890b364]. In health, LGLs are a small subset of lymphocytes; clonal expansions define **LGL leukemia**, an indolent disorder with cytopenias and autoimmunity, most often due to STAT3 mutations [^c190a8f6] [^da80f5f7]. Diagnosis requires persistent LGL expansion, clonality, and exclusion of reactive causes; many patients are asymptomatic and managed with observation, while symptomatic cytopenias or autoimmunity are treated with low-dose immunosuppression (methotrexate, cyclosporine, or cyclophosphamide) [^d40a4694] [^41d154ba]. Prognosis is generally favorable, but a minority transform to aggressive disease, so ongoing monitoring is essential [^ba43f27e] [^75700e3f].

---

## Morphological and immunophenotypic characteristics

Morphologically, LGLs are **large lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm and azurophilic granules**; their nuclei are round or reniform with mature chromatin [^7a142ddb]. Immunophenotypically, T-LGLs are typically **CD3+ CD8+ CD57+ TCRαβ+** with cytotoxic markers (TIA-1, granzyme B, perforin), while NK-LGLs are **CD3− CD16+ CD56+** with variable CD57 expression [^d40a4694] [^ce87558d].

---

## Normal physiological role

LGLs are **essential for immune surveillance**, providing rapid cytotoxic responses to virally infected or malignant cells and producing cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α [^3787ef6a]. They undergo apoptosis after target engagement; dysregulation of this pathway contributes to disease [^3787ef6a].

---

## Pathological conditions associated with LGLs

### Large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGLL)

LGLL is a **clonal lymphoproliferative disorder** of T or NK cells, characterized by persistent LGL expansion and cytopenias [^c190a8f6]. It is rare, with an incidence of ~0.2–0.4 per million per year, and typically affects older adults (median age ~66 years) [^ba43f27e] [^627bf75d].

---

#### Clinical features

- **Cytopenias**: Neutropenia (most common), anemia, and thrombocytopenia [^380e8f1b].
- **Autoimmunity**: Rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and pure red cell aplasia are frequent [^b8dd0316].
- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, recurrent infections, and splenomegaly may occur [^2611319d].

---

#### Pathogenesis

Pathogenesis is driven by **chronic antigenic stimulation** (often viral or autoimmune) and dysregulated apoptosis, with constitutive JAK/STAT activation and frequent STAT3 mutations (~30–50%) [^c190a8f6] [^da80f5f7]. Additional mutations (STAT5B, TET2, KMT2D) and cytokine signaling (IL-15, PDGF-BB) support survival and proliferation [^a31f67fd] [^67e54615].

---

#### Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies on:

- **Persistent LGL expansion**: > 0.5 × 10⁹/L for > 6 months [^d40a4694].
- **Clonality**: TCR gene rearrangement or NK-receptor restriction [^d40a4694].
- **Exclusion of reactive causes**: Autoimmune diseases, viral infections, or drug-induced lymphocytosis [^d40a4694].

Bone marrow biopsy is not always required but helps when LGL counts are low or marrow failure is suspected [^b0f0e296].

---

#### Treatment

Many patients are asymptomatic and managed with observation; therapy is indicated for **significant cytopenias** or **autoimmune complications**. First-line options include low-dose methotrexate, cyclosporine, or cyclophosphamide, with response rates of 40–60% [^41d154ba] [^c4ef7a20]. Alemtuzumab is considered for refractory cases, and JAK/STAT inhibitors are under investigation [^1ed74e38] [^c190a8f6].

---

#### Prognosis

LGLL is **indolent**, with median overall survival ~9–10 years; older age, comorbidities, and severe cytopenias predict worse outcomes [^ba43f27e] [^21d7379d]. Transformation to aggressive disease is rare but possible, warranting ongoing surveillance [^75700e3f].

---

### Reactive LGL expansions

Reactive LGL expansions are **polyclonal or oligoclonal** and often follow viral infections (e.g. CMV, HIV) or occur in autoimmune diseases; they are usually transient and resolve with treatment of the underlying cause [^d51532dc] [^7a66fc74].

---

## Laboratory methods for detection and quantification

- **Peripheral smear**: Identifies LGLs by morphology [^d40a4694].
- **Flow cytometry**: Defines immunophenotype and detects aberrant antigen expression (e.g. dim CD5, CD7) [^a75fefb7].
- **TCR gene analysis**: Confirms clonality by PCR or NGS [^242acda3].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Assesses infiltration and excludes other disorders [^4f25b57d].

---

## Clinical significance and therapeutic implications

LGLs are central to immune defense, but clonal expansions cause cytopenias and autoimmunity; **targeted immunosuppression** improves counts and symptoms, though relapse is common and cure is rare [^c190a8f6]. Emerging JAK/STAT inhibitors may offer more selective control of disease activity [^c190a8f6].

---

Large granular lymphocytes are cytotoxic lymphocytes whose clonal expansion causes LGL leukemia, an indolent disease with cytopenias and autoimmunity; **careful diagnosis and individualized immunosuppression** achieve durable control in most patients, but lifelong follow-up is prudent due to rare transformation [^c190a8f6].

### T-cell clones of uncertain significance. when is the rogue clone dangerous? [^f6029e67]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocyte clones that persist over time and that exhibit molecular and immunophenotypic features closely resembling those of T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL) may be detectable in individuals who lack any clinical or laboratory features supporting a diagnosis of a T-cell malignancy. This condition represents a potential precursor state termed T-cell clones of uncertain significance (T-CUS). T-CUS represents the even more benign extreme of the wide spectrum of clonal T-large granular lymphocyte proliferations, emphasizing the need for an appropriate multiparametric diagnostic assessment that avoids misdiagnosis of T-cell neoplasia. This approach should overcome numerical cut-offs as the sole criteria to differentiate the benign condition from the related malignancies. In particular, genomic aberrancies might prospectively identify individuals who are at risk of progression to a full-blown T-cell malignancy. We herein discuss the significance of these T-cell clones in both healthy and disease states, suggesting molecular assays for tracking early steps of disease.

### Large granular lymphocytic leukaemia pathogenesis and management [^7910e654]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

The WHO classification recognises three distinct disorders of large granular lymphocytes: T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia (T-LGL), chronic lymphoproliferative disorders of NK-cells (CLPD-NK) and agressive NK-cell leukaemia. Despite the different cell of origin, there is considerable overlap between T-LGL and CLPD-NK in terms of clinical presentation and therapy. Many patients are asymptomatic and do not require treatment. Therapy, with immunosuppressant agents such as low dose methotrexate or ciclosporin, is usually indicated to correct cytopenias. In contrast, aggressive NK-cell leukaemia and the rare CD56(+) aggressive T-LGL leukaemia follow a fulminant clinical course, affect younger individuals and require more intensive combination chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant in eligible patients. The relative rarity of these disorders means that there have been few clinical trials to inform management. However, there is now considerable interest in the pathogenesis of the chronic LGL leukaemias and this has stimulated early trials to evaluate novel agents which target the dysregulated apoptotic pathways characteristic of this disease.

T-cell clones in patients with large granular lymphocyte leukemia

Large granular lymphocyte leukemias (LGLL) are rare diseases characterized by the clonal expansion of LGL whose diagnosis, classification and treatment have been hampered over time by their remarkable phenotypic, genotypic and clinical heterogeneity as well as their geographic diversity. To classify the different subtypes of LGL disorders precisely, appropriate immunophenotypic and molecular characterization is mandatory. In accordance with the scope of this paper, which aims to compare these disorders with T-CUS, Table 2 focuses on T-LGLL, summarizing the relevant features of this disease, especially in terms of the criteria required for diagnosis. Further details on the classification, pathogenesis, presentation, disease evolution, and treatments of T-LGLL have been extensively covered in recent reviews. We would like to comment briefly on a couple of issues: the size of the clone and the recent evidence of somatic mutations.

The number of clonal LGL in the peripheral blood of patients with T-LGLL typically exceeds 2.0×10⁹/L but the diagnosis of LGLL may also be made with LGL counts > 0.5×10⁹/L, or even lower when a restricted LGL clone is demonstrated in an appropriate clinical context (severe symptoms not attributable to other causes) including the association with unexplained cytopeniasor concurrent autoimmune disease. We label this subset of patients as "low-count LGLL". Nevertheless, this cutoff presents a diagnostic challenge that requires further insights and concerted efforts to address, as outlined below.

As in many hematologic conditions, genetic alterations have broadened our knowledge on LGL disorders and are becoming instrumental in distinguishing discrete disease subsets. This achievement is also guiding the research towards precision medicine strategies for patients, allowing for more tailored and effective treatments. In LGLL, the STAT3 pathway has been claimed as the central hub of the abnormal T-cell proliferation, and different mutations, such as STAT 3 and STAT5B to mention the most relevant, have been found to be harbored in leukemic cells. Furthermore, their detection helps in predicting the disease outcome. This finding not only advances our understanding of the pathogenesis of LGLL but can also aid in the diagnostic process and, in turn, refine the classification of these disorders.

### How I diagnose large granular lymphocytic leukemia [^4374e06f]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) represents a rare neoplasm of mature T cells or natural killer (NK) cells, with an indolent clinical course. Diagnosing LGLL can be challenging because of overlapping features with reactive processes and other mimickers.

Methods

By presenting 2 challenging cases, we elucidate the differentiation of LGLL from its mimics and highlight potential diagnostic pitfalls. A comprehensive review of the clinicopathologic features of LGLL was conducted.

Results

Large granular lymphocytic leukemia displays a diverse spectrum of clinical presentations, morphologies, flow cytometric immunophenotypes, and molecular profiles. These features are also encountered in reactive conditions, T-cell clones of uncertain significance, and NK cell clones of uncertain significance.

Conclusions

In light of the intricate diagnostic landscape, LGLL workup must encompass clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, clonal, and molecular findings. Meeting major and minor diagnostic criteria is imperative for the accurate diagnosis of LGLL.

### Large granular lymphocytic leukemia: current state of diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment [^71ac74bc]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This manuscript aims at updating the knowledge on the clinico-biological characteristics, pathogenesis, and the diagnostic challenges of T-LGLL and CLPD-NK disorders and reviews the advances in the management and treatment of these patients.

Recent Findings

It has been shown that clonal large granular lymphocyte (LGL) expansions arise from chronic antigenic stimulation, leading to resistance to apoptosis. All the above findings have facilitated the diagnosis of LGLL and provided insights in the pathogenesis of the disease. At present, there is no standard first-line therapy for the disease. Immunosuppressive agents are the treatment routinely used in clinical practice. However, these agents have a limited capacity to eradicate the LGL clone and induce long-lasting remission. Advances in the knowledge of pathogenesis have made it possible to explore new therapeutic targets with promising results. Since LGLL is a rare disease, international efforts are needed to carry on prospective clinical trials with new potentially active drugs that could include a large number of patients.

Figure 1.
Landscape of clonal chronic lymphoproliferative disorders of granular lymphocytes. T-cell clonopathy of uncertain significance represents the even more benign extreme of the spectrum of clonal T large granular lymphocyte proliferations, but the gray zone must be further specified. Detection of putative somatic mutations (mentioned in the faded area in the figure) could help to identify these subsets of patients more precisely. Color shades gradually moving from yellow to red represent disease progression, with yellow indicating asymptomatic patients and red indicating more advanced stages of disease. The size of the areas tentatively reflects the prevalence of patients' subsets.

- Healthy state. Evidence that the patient is devoid of other laboratory and clinical features supporting a diagnosis of malignancy is another prerequisite to define T-CUS. In particular, the context of earlier mentioned clinical features includes associated diseases, splenomegaly, cytopenias, and related symptoms.

### T-cell large granular leukemia and related proliferations [^f8f6acae]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Session 9 of the 2005 Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology Workshop focused on large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemias and related disorders. T-cell LGL (T-LGL) leukemias, discussed herein, account for 2% to 3% of cases of small lymphocytic leukemia. T-LGL diseases cover a heterogeneous spectrum of disorders that include reactive conditions, typically associated with autoimmune disease, to outright leukemia. These disorders are found in older people, with an average age at initial examination of approximately 60 years and a median survival of more than 10 years in T-LGL leukemia. Systemic symptoms and neutropenia are common at initial examination. Lymphocytosis, composed of small mature lymphocytes with increased cytoplasm, is common. The spleen and bone marrow are involved in T-LGL leukemia, although morphologic findings may be subtle. The immunophenotype is typically that of CD3+/CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Some cases may be due to chronic immune stimulation, with subsequent clonal escape and proliferation of a neoplastic population of lymphocytes.

### Models for T-large granular lymphocytic leukemia: how to mimic the cellular interplays in malignant autoimmunity [^67320536]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This review highlights the key aberrations in T-LGLL's multifactorial pathogenesis and establishes essential requirements for murine systems to more accurately model the main aspects of this disease. We outline that current models helped to dissect single traits of T-LGLL's biology and clinical presentation. However, given their limitations to resemble specific disease aspects, no existing model fully replicates the disease's complexity or meets all necessary requirements for a comprehensive model including (i) clonal T-cell expansion, (ii) T-LGLL's immunophenotype, (iii) autoimmune phenomena, (iv) indolent manifestations, (v) pathogenetic hallmark alterations of T-LGLL, (vi) a specifically instructed TME, and (vii) cytopenias. Addressing these challenges requires model-specific adjustments, as well as broader strategies to enhance model fidelity. It is also important to note that possibly several initiating scenarios (e.g. auto-antigen driven) funnel in a common track of T-LGLL, hence, can not be captured in one single T-LGLL model.

Refining T-LGLL models is critical for advancing research in the field. By developing more sophisticated models, we can enhance our understanding of the disease and its mechanisms. Ultimately, these improvements will also contribute to the identification of more effective treatment strategies for T-LGLL.

### Are clonal T-cell large granular lymphocytes to blame for unexplained haematological abnormalities? [^6cce4f9e]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Abnormalities diagnosed on routine blood work, such as mild neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and relative lymphocytosis, often have obscure aetiologies. A series of 30 patients were evaluated for various unexplained haematological abnormalities between 1997 and 2005, and found to have circulating monoclonal T-cell large granular lymphocytes (T-LGL). These patients fit the diagnosis of T-cell clonopathy of unknown significance (TCUS), which may represent a clinical spectrum of clonal T-LGL proliferation. Our patients were characterised by a complete absence of severe neutropenia (< 0.5 × 10⁹/L), absence of recurrent neutropenic infection (0%), negative rheumatoid serology (0%) and a low incidence of constitutional symptoms (20%). This overall asymptomatic clinical presentation appeared to be different from other previously reported series of TCUS or T-LGL leukaemia who typically had symptomatology and required treatment. Our series of 30 patients represented the benign end of the spectrum of clonal T-LGL proliferation, and might reflect diagnosis at earlier stages of the condition relative to other reported series. TCUS may be a heterogeneous and under-diagnosed condition. This study further broadens our understanding of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of indolent clonal T-cell proliferation, and raises our awareness of this condition. We suggest that TCUS should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained haematological problems.

### Large granular lymphocytic leukemia: molecular pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment [^f68bda43]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia represents a spectrum of rare lymphoproliferative diseases defined by clonal amplification of either CD3(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocytes or CD3(-) natural killer cells. This chapter focuses on the T-cell form of LGL leukemia. Clinical features include neutropenia, anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis. LGL leukemia is thought to arise from chronic antigenic stimulation, with the long-term survival of LGL being promoted by constitutive activation of multiple survival signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT3, sphingolipid, and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways. Therefore, these lead to global deregulation of apoptosis and resistance to normal pathways of activation-induced cell death. The majority of LGL leukemia patients eventually need treatment. Treatment of leukemic LGL is based on immunosuppressive therapy, primarily using low doses of methotrexate or cyclophosphamide. However, no standard therapy has been established because of the lack of large, prospective trials. In addition, because some patients are refractory to currently available treatments and none of these therapeutic modalities can cure LGL leukemia, new therapeutic options are needed. Understanding the current state of the pathogenesis of LGL leukemia may provide insights into novel therapeutic options.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^d40a4694]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

NCCN T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia — diagnosis includes peripheral blood smear analysis for cytology with presence of LGLs characterized by reniform or round nucleus and abundant cytoplasm containing azurophilic granules; peripheral blood flow cytometry with adequate immunophenotyping to establish diagnosis; a flow cytometry panel that may include CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD56, CD57, TCRδ, TCRγδ, TRBC1; and assessment of T-cell clonality. Useful in certain circumstances are bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, an IHC panel that may include CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD56, CD57, TCRβ, TCRδ, TIA1, perforin, granzyme B, mutational analysis of STAT3 and STAT5B, and EBER-ISH. The guideline advises to rule out reactive large granular lymphocytosis and to repeat peripheral blood flow cytometry and T-cell clonality studies in 6 months in asymptomatic patients with small clonal large granular lymphocyte populations (< 0.5 × 10⁹/L) or polyclonal LGL, and notes that bone marrow evaluation is typically needed to confirm diagnosis and is essential for cases with low LGL counts (< 0.5 × 10⁹/L) and cases suspicious for concurrent bone marrow failure disorders. Typical immunophenotype for T-LGLL is CD3+, CD8+, CD16+, CD57+, CD56 ±, CD28-, CD5 dim, and/or CD7 dim, CD45RA+, CD62L-, TCRαβ+, TIA1+, granzyme B+, or granzyme M+, and approximately 10% of LGLL cases will be of the NK-cell subtype and are treated with a similar approach to T-LGLL. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Mixed-phenotype large granular lymphocytic leukemia: a rare subtype in the large granular lymphocytic leukemia spectrum [^5eb45898]. Human Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) is a chronic proliferation of cytotoxic lymphocytes in which more than 70% of patients develop cytopenia(s) requiring therapy. LGLL includes T-cell LGLL and chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer (NK) cells. The neoplastic cells in LGLL usually exhibit a single immunophenotype in a patient, with CD8-positive/αβ T-cell type being the most common, followed by NK-cell, γδ T-cell, and CD4-positive/αβ T-cell types. We investigated a total of 220 LGLL cases and identified 12 mixed-phenotype LGLLs (5%): 7 cases with coexistent αβ T-cell and NK-cell clones and 5 with coexistent αβ and γδ T-cell clones. With a median follow-up of 48 months, the clinicopathological characteristics of these patients seemed similar to those of typical LGLL patients. Treatment was instituted in 9 patients, and 5 patients (55%) attained complete hematologic response or partial response. The therapeutic response rate of this cohort is comparable to the reported overall response rate of 40% to 60% in typical LGLL patients. Three patients who did not receive any treatment had progressive or persistent cytopenias. Interestingly, inverted proportions of 2 clones at disease recurrence were identified in 4 patients (36%) and stable clonal proportions in 7 patients (64%). Mixed-phenotype LGLL is rare, and this study underscores the importance of recognizing this rare type of LGLL in patients who may benefit from LGLL treatment.

### A population-based study of large granular lymphocyte leukemia [^ba43f27e]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a lymphoproliferative disorder of cytotoxic cells. T-cell LGL (T-LGL) leukemia is characterized by accumulation of cytotoxic T cells in blood and infiltration of the bone marrow, liver or spleen. Population-based studies have not been reported in LGL leukemia. We present clinical characteristics, natural history and risk factors for poor survival in patients with LGL leukemia using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) and the United States National Cancer Data Base (NCDB). LGL leukemia is an extremely rare disease with the incidence of 0.2 cases per 1000000 individuals. The median age at diagnosis was 66.5 years with females likely to be diagnosed at 3 years earlier compared with males. Analysis of patient-level data using NCDB (n = 978) showed that 45% patients with T-LGL leukemia required some form of systemic treatment at the time of diagnosis. T-LGL leukemia patients have reduced survival compared with general population, with a median overall survival of 9 years. Multivariate analysis showed that age > 60 years at the time of diagnosis and the presence of significant comorbidities were independent predictors of poor survival.

### Genomic landscape characterization of large granular lymphocyte leukemia with a systems genetics approach [^3a6dfe7a]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a rare clonal disease characterized by a persistent increase in the number of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells or CD16/56+ natural killer (NK) cells. It is associated with recurrent infections, severe cytopenias and autoimmune diseases. JAK/STAT pathway activation, deregulation of pro-apoptotic pathways (sphingolipid and FAS/FAS ligand) and activation of pro-survival signaling pathways (PI3K/AKT and RAS) are known hallmarks of LGL leukemia. Activating somatic STAT3 mutations have been reported in the SH2 domain (30–70% of cases), and in the DNA-binding or coiled-coil domain (2%). STAT5B mutations are more rare, but typical of CD4+ T-LGL leukemia cases. The JAK/STAT pathway can also be activated by non-mutational mechanisms such as increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion and epigenetic inactivation of JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors. Indeed, aberrant STAT signaling is observed in almost all LGL leukemia patients irrespective of the presence of JAK/STAT mutations.

Introduction

Large granular lymphocytes (LGL) are a morphologically distinct lymphoid subpopulation in the peripheral blood characterized by abundant azurophilic cytoplasmic granules. Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) is a clonal hematopoietic disorder caused by an abnormal expansion of LGLs in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen. The majority of LGLL cases (approximately 85%) arise from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (T-LGLL), while the remaining cases exhibit natural killer (NK) cell phenotype and are categorized under chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells (CLPD-NK) in the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematolymphoid neoplasms.

Although the pathophysiologic mechanism of LGLL is not well-understood, immunological stimuli, possibly from viruses or tumor antigens, have been implicated. This theory has been supported by the high rate of association between LGLL and various hematologic malignancies, namely B-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, myeloid neoplasms, and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

The diagnosis of LGLL is established by the detection of persistent and clonal LGLL cells. LGLL cells can be identified by their specific morphology and immunophenotype in the peripheral blood or bone marrow, or detected by immunohistochemical stains (granzyme B, perforin, and/or TIA-1) in the bone marrow, highlighting the presence of intrasinusoidal cytotoxic lymphocyte infiltrates. T-cell clonality can be established by monotypic TRBC1 expression or Vβ T-cell receptor (TCR) gene repertoire analysis by flow cytometry, or TCR gene arrangement by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. NK-cell clonality can be determined by the restriction of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR).

Performing a proper workup is the key to the diagnosis of LGLL, which can be straightforward when patients exhibit typical clinical or hematologic presentations such as repeated infections, unexplained neutropenia, or splenomegaly. However, the diagnosis of LGLL can be challenging or missed because of the lack of the typical clinical and hematologic presentations. While anemia is common in LGLL, it is usually accompanied by neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia. Although rare, LGLL associated with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) has been previously reported, however, isolated anemia without PRCA has not been systematically investigated. In this report, we characterized the clinicopathologic features of LGLL presenting with isolated anemia in our practice, compared these features between patients with and without PRCA, and further evaluated the clinical outcomes of such patients.

In summary, LGL leukemia is a rare disease that most commonly affects the elderly population. Fewer than half the patients with T-LGL leukemia required some form of systemic treatment at the time of diagnosis. Although OS of patients with LGL leukemia is 9 years, it shortens the survival compared with that of the general population. Age ⩾60 years at the time of diagnosis and the presence of significant comorbidities are independent predictors of poor survival in patients with T-LGL leukemia. Further studies are required to understand poor prognosis and to devise better treatments.

Introduction

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of cytotoxic T or natural killer cells. T-cell LGL (T-LGL) leukemia is characterized by clonal proliferation of CD3 + /CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes and infiltration of the bone marrow, liver or spleen. Clinically, T-LGL leukemia may be present as asymptomatic lymphocytosis or may be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or cytopenias. The diagnosis of T-LGL leukemia is based on peripheral blood expansion of the leukemic LGL population (> 0.5 × 10⁹/L) in association with CD3 + /CD8 + phenotype and evidence of clonality as suggested by clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gene using PCR or flow cytometry.

T-LGL leukemia is a rare disease representing ~2–5% of chronic lymphoproliferative diseases in the US. Despite significant advances in understanding biology and therapeutics of LGL leukemia, the incidence, demographics, natural history, treatments and long-term prognosis of the disease remain poorly characterized.

Here, we present the first population-based study of T-LGL leukemia studying epidemiology and demographics using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program and the National Cancer Data base (NCDB). We discuss long-term outcomes for patients with T-LGL leukemia compared with matched general population and factors predicting adverse outcomes.

### Models for T-large granular lymphocytic leukemia: how to mimic the cellular interplays in malignant autoimmunity [^680a183a]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

To develop new, innovative therapeutic strategies, preclinical models are of indisputable importance. T-LGLL presents at a unique intersection between cancer and immune dysregulation, exhibited by the clonal expansion of malignant T cells and the association with autoimmune mechanisms that drive clinical presentation. Current mouse models, however, fail to capture this duality of T-LGLL. As our understanding of the disease's complex pathomechanism grows, emerging insights are reshaping our view of its biology. These evolving perspectives highlight the need for refined preclinical models that reflect this complexity. In this review, we present an updated concept of T-LGLLs pathogenesis, outline the core criteria required for effective in-vivo modeling, and critically examine existing models. We highlight the future challenges in more accurately representing the intricate interplay of immune dysregulation and malignant transformation in T-LGLL.

T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) — overview and definition characterizes LGLL as an indolent T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of mature cytotoxic lymphocytes with an indolent and non-progressive clinical course and frequent autoimmune neutropenia. There is significant clinical and pathophysiologic overlap with autoimmune syndromes, including concurrent rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and persistent large granular lymphocytosis can also accompany other chronic autoimmune conditions. Diagnosis is generally based on a persistent (> 6 months) increase in the number of large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) with typical morphologic features, assessed in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of the patients (> 2000/uL) with exclusion of other conditions; the degree of blood and bone marrow involvement does not necessarily correlate with disease severity or the grade of cytopenias. T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality studies may demonstrate an oligoclonal or monoclonal pattern that does not correlate with disease aggressiveness, and T-cell LGLLs frequently express CD2, CD3, CD8, CD57, and TCRαβ with cytotoxic markers TIA1, granzyme B, and granzyme M; in rare cases, LGLLs are CD4+ alpha-beta T cells or gamma-delta T cells (CD8+ or CD4-/CD8-). Characteristic genetic features include activating somatic STAT3 mutations affecting the SH2 domain in approximately 30% of LGLL cases with most mutations heterozygous, and STAT5B SH2 mutations have also been reported. Main differential diagnoses include HSTCL, aggressive NK-cell leukemia (ANKL), EBV-positive T-cell and NK-cell lymphoproliferative diseases of childhood, and reactive gamma-delta T-cell proliferations.

### Clonal T-cell large granular lymphocyte proliferations in childhood and young adult immune dysregulation conditions [^53a78d0f]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Proliferation of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) and T-cell LGL (T-LGL) in peripheral blood along with demonstration of clonality are the hallmarks of a heterogeneous group of disorders, including T-LGL leukemia or T-LGL lymphocytosis. They are often associated with neutropenia and responsive to immunosuppression. The true nature of this entity is not well understood. Some cases are reported as reactive phenomena with very limited experience in pediatric population.

Methods

Hematology/Oncology Flow Cytometry Laboratory database has been reviewed retrospectively. Patients with identifiable distinct CD5-dim T-cell population and positive clonal T-cell receptor rearrangement were included in the analysis. Clinical and laboratory data were then reviewed.

Results

Sixteen cases of children and young adults with increased peripheral blood clonal T-LGL population characterized by dim CD5 expression with wide range of underlying immune dysregulation/stimulation disorders were reviewed. Extended follow up with repeat testing suggested the reactive nature of persistent clonal T-LGL proliferations in this group.

Conclusions

Our observations indicate that clonal T-LGL proliferations in children and young adults are reactive in nature and some can be persistent with an indolent course with unknown consequentiality. Clonal T-LGL cells could be targeting the most prominent immunogenic stressor(s) involved as a control mechanism.

### How I treat LGL leukemia [^41d154ba]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is characterized by a clonal expansion of either CD3(+) cytotoxic T or CD3(-) NK cells. Prominent clinical features of T-LGL leukemia include neutropenia, anemia and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The terminal effector memory phenotype (CD3(+)/CD45RA(+)/CD62L(-)CD57(+)) of T-LGL suggests a pivotal chronic antigen-driven immune response. LGL survival is then promoted by platelet-derived growth factor and interleukin-15, resulting in global dysregulation of apoptosis and resistance to normal pathways of activation-induced cell death. These pathogenic features explain why treatment of T-LGL leukemia is based on immunosuppressive therapy. The majority of these patients eventually need treatment because of severe or symptomatic neutropenia, anemia, or RA. No standard therapy has been established because of the absence of large prospective trials. The authors use low-dose methotrexate initially for T-LGL leukemia patients with neutropenia and/or RA. We recommend either methotrexate or oral cyclophosphamide as initial therapy for anemia. If treatment is not successful, patients are switched to either the other agent or cyclosporine. The majority of patients experience an indolent clinical course. Deaths infrequently occur because of infections related to severe neutropenia. As there are no curative therapeutic modalities for T-LGL leukemia, new treatment options are needed.

### Acquired pure red cell aplasia: updated review of treatment [^dfa10165]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

The evidence of a granular lymphocytosis greater than 2 × 10⁹/l lasting for more than 6 months has been regarded as the criteria for defining the disease. However, the normal range for peripheral blood LGL counts is 0·223 ± 0·099 × 10⁹/l and clonal disease has been documented in 8% of patients when absolute LGL counts are between 0·6 to 1·0 × 10⁹/l. Thus, an expansion of a restricted LGL subset demonstrates the diagnosis of LGL-leukaemia and a 6-month follow-up criterion is not necessary when clonality is established. The characteristic finding is the presence of increased numbers of LGL, usually identified by a greater size than normal lymphocytes, abundant pale cytoplasm, and prominent azurophilic granules. However, these features may vary, even among cells from the same patient. The granulation can range from fine to coarse, and some cells may have otherwise characteristic features but lack granules (sometimes called large agranular lymphocytes). Occasionally, clonally expanded lymphocytes with a characteristic CD3 +, CD57 + phenotype may not have LGL morphology on a peripheral smear but may represent in vivo antigen-activated cytotoxic effector T cells. An increase of CD3 + /CD56 − or CD3 − /CD56 + cells by peripheral-blood flow cytometry and/or an inverted CD4 + /CD8 + cell ratio (< 1·0) suggests the existence of LGL leukaemia.

### T-cell and natural killer-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia neoplasias [^3787ef6a]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2011). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a rare disorder of cytotoxic lymphocytes. LGL cells play an integral role in the immune system and are divided into two major lineages of CD3(-)natural killer (NK) cells and CD3(+) T cells that circulate throughout the blood in search of infected cells, in which they will make contact through a receptor ligand and induce cell death. LGL cells are also programmed to undergo apoptosis after contact with an infected target cell; however, they continue to survive in individuals with LGL leukemia. This unchecked proliferation and cytotoxicity of LGLs in patients results in autoimmunity or malignancy. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune condition seen in individuals with LGL leukemia; however, LGL leukemia is associated with a wide spectrum of other autoimmune diseases. Patients may also suffer from other hematological conditions including hemolytic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, and neutropenia, which lead to recurrent bacterial infections. Currently, the only established treatment involves a low dose of an immunosuppressive regimen with methotrexate, in which 40–50% of patients are either resistant or do not respond. In order to establish new therapeutics it is important to understand the current state of LGL leukemia both in the clinic and in basic research.

### Classification of NK-large granular lymphocytic leukemia by CD56 expression [^96a75a8a]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGLL) is a rare and heterogeneous disorder characterized by clonal expansion of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Generally, LGLL can be categorized according to the immunophenotype of tumor cells as T-large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) and NK-large granular lymphocytic leukemia (NK-LGLL), with NK-LGLL constituting roughly 10% of the total disease. Despite numerous researches have demonstrated the sharing of clinical features and pathogenesis between the 2 subtypes, LGLL patients display extremely different clinical manifestations, treatment responses, and quite diverse biological features. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that the expression of CD8 or γδTCR, loss of TCRVδ2 on T-LGLs, and STAT3 mutation may indicate a more symptomatic disease and poorer survival in patients with T-LGLL, underscoring the heterogeneity of the disease. In contrast, the heterogeneity of clinical and biological characteristics in NK-LGLL remains unclear as its rarity.

NK-large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) are typically considered to be mature and activated NK cells (CD2+/CD3−/ CD16+ or CD56+) demonstrating more potent cytotoxic immunophenotypes than the health. Physiologically, the expression of CD56 indicated the transformation from immature NK cells to mature NK cells. To further, mature NK cells could be divided into 2 subsets, CD56dim and CD56bright. The CD56dim NK-cell subset exhibits elevated levels of Ig-like NK receptors (KIRs) and CD16 conferring enhanced cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) compared to CD56bright NK cells. In contrast, CD56bright NK cells prefer to produce higher levels of cytokines, including TNF-β, IFN-γ, and IL-10, in response to monocyte stimulation and for interacting with other immune cells. Despite these distinctions in physically, the clinical and biological difference between CD56 dim or bright expression NK-LGLL has yet to be fully determined. Toward that end, in this study, we conducted an analysis of a large cohort with 47 NK-LGLL patients, finding that patients presenting CD56 dim or negative expression on NK-LGLs had more severe symptoms and worse outcomes.

### Large natural killer cell lymphoma arising from an indolent natural killer cell large granular lymphocyte proliferation [^75700e3f]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Natural killer cell large granular lymphocyte proliferation is a relatively rare disorder that typically runs a chronic, indolent course. We present a patient with a 3 1/2-year history of natural killer cell large granular lymphocyte proliferation terminating in large cell lymphoma with natural killer cell features. The diagnosis of natural killer cell large granular lymphocyte proliferation was based on flow cytometric demonstration of an expanded population of CD3- CD16+/CD56+ lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The patient experienced various rheumatologic symptoms, but was hematologically stable for 3 1/2 years. He then developed fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and a left lower lobe lung mass. Resection of the mass showed a large cell lymphoma with immunohistochemical positivity for CD2, CD7, CD56, and T-cell intracellular antigen-1, compatible with natural killer cell origin. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus and polymerase chain reaction analysis for T-cell receptor gene rearrangement were negative. To our knowledge, this is the second documented report of chronic natural killer cell large granular lymphocyte proliferation terminating in an aggressive large natural killer cell lymphoma.

T-Cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) — bone marrow assessment and immunophenotype: Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is not essential for initial evaluation; however, bone marrow biopsy with immunophenotyping is useful for patients with low large granular lymphocyte count (< 0.5 × 10⁹/L) and for evaluating concurrent bone marrow failure disorders. Typical immunophenotype for T-LGLL is CD3+, CD8+, CD16+, CD57+, CD56-, CD28-, CD5 dim and/or CD7 dim, CD45RA+, CD62L-, TCRαβ+, TIA1+ and granzyme B+, and granzyme M+; typical immunophenotype for NK-LGLL is CD3-, CD8+, CD16+, CD56+, CD4-, CD94+, and TCRαβ-. Rare populations include CD4+ T-LGLL (CD3+CD4+CD56dim, CD8-/dim, CD56+CD56+/partial) and gamma/delta T-LGLL (CD3+CD4-CD8-CD16+CD57+). Flow cytometry should include CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD16, CD56, CD57, CD28, TCRαβ, TCRγδ, CD45RA, and CD62L; the immunohistochemistry panel should include CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD56, CD57, TCRβ, TCRγ, TIA1, perforin, and granzyme B, and IHC for granzyme M may be useful in selected circumstances.

### T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia and related disorders [^ea0a7a0b]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a clonal proliferation of cytotoxic T cells, which causes neutropenia, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia. This condition is often associated with autoimmune disorders, especially rheumatoid arthritis, and other lymphoproliferative disorders. The diagnosis is suggested by flow cytometry demonstrating an expansion of CD8(+)CD57(+) T cells and is confirmed by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies. Mounting evidence suggests that LGL leukemia is a disorder of dysregulation of apoptosis through abnormalities in the Fas/Fas ligand pathway. In most patients, this is an indolent disorder, and significant improvement of cytopenias can be achieved with immunosuppressive agents such as steroids, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporin A. This review provides a concise, up-to-date summary of LGL leukemia and the related, more aggressive, malignancies of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells.

### A population-based study of large granular lymphocyte leukemia [^b27cff99]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

LGL leukemia is believed to be a rare disease characterized by clonal expansion of cytotoxic lymphocytes — either cytotoxic T lymphocytes or natural killer cells. Over the years, there has been a significant progress in understanding the biology of LGL leukemia. Most reports are either case reports or small series limiting our understanding of the impact of LGL leukemia in the population. Here, we present the first population study of LGL leukemia studying demographics, natural history and risk factors for poor survival using the SEER and the United States NCDB databases.

Our study confirms that LGL leukemia is an extremely rare disease with the annual incidence of 0.2 cases per million individuals in the US with no significant change in the annual incidence of LGL leukemia during the time of study. LGL leukemia is thought to be a disease of the elderly, though prior studies reported median age at the time of diagnosis varying anywhere between 39 and 67 years. In our cohort of 978 patients with T-LGL leukemia, the median age of diagnosis was 66.5 years. Overall incidence was similar between males and females, though females were likely to be diagnosed 3 years earlier compared with males. We found 14% patients to be under the age of 50 years at the time of diagnosis, in contrast to previously described French registry database that reported 26% patients < 50 years of age.

### Hemolytic versus malproductive anemia in large granular lymphocytic leukemia [^61d295e9]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) can be defined as a chronic clonal proliferation of either cytotoxic T- (CTLs) or natural killer (NK) cells (T- or NK-LGLL). In a typical clinical situation, the disease affects elderly patients, who may present with neutropenia (39–62%) and/or anemia (up to 50%), but also with a variety of autoimmune diseases. Particularly, while commonly anemia in the context of LGLL is malproductive and reticulocytopenic resembling pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), we have also occasionally encountered cases with increased/preserved reticulocyte counts. A clinical workup done on these patients revealed either immune hemolytic anemia (IHA), hypersplenism or both. Thus, the pathophysiologic underpinnings of anemia in LGLL can be diverse. Because clinical distinction has therapeutic consequences and may provide clues to the pathogenesis of LGLL, we sought to investigate the features of hemolytic versus reticulocytopenic anemia by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of hemolysis occurring in the context of a large cohort of patients affected by this disease.

We analyzed clinical and molecular features of 262 patients diagnosed (median follow up: 84 months) at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) from 1998 to 2022 to identify those experiencing hemolysis. LGLL diagnosis was based on the presence of ≥ 4/6 criteria: i) chronically elevated LGL count (> 0.5 × 10⁹/dL over > 3 months), ii) clonal TCR rearrangement, iii) VB expansion, iv) flow cytometric detection of aberrant CTL or NK-cell proliferation, v) STAT3/5 mutation and vi) LGL infiltration of the marrow. IHA diagnosis was based on the evidence (at any time during clinical course) of signs of hemolysis namely reticulocytosis (> 2% and/or > 60 × 10³/μL), elevated LDH levels, and low haptoglobin. Conversely, anemia characterized by a reticulocyte index (RI) of < 2 without evidence of hemolysis was classified as malproductive/hyporegenerative. Hemoglobin (Hb) response criteria including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) were determined using consensus definitions. Transfusion dependence was defined as requirement of ≥ 2 units of red blood cell (RBC) every 2 weeks for at least 3 months due to Hb < 7 or symptomatic anemia. Fisher's exact test was used to determine statistical significance at p < 0.05.

### Hu-mik-beta1 to treat T-Cell large granular lymphocytic… [^511a9f7e]. ClinicalTrials (2004). Low credibility.

Study Overview This study will examine the use of the humanized Mik-beta-1 antibody in patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia. Patients with T-LGL often have reduced white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, and increased numbers of abnormal cells called large granular lymphocytes.
- Imaging studies, such as chest x-ray and CT scan of the body after completing treatment if the screening scans showed abnormalities due to the T-LGL leukemia.
- Lymph node biopsy in individuals with enlarged superficial lymph nodes due to T-LGL leukemia to see if the treatment is reaching the leukemia in the lymph nodes.
- T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder associated with granulocytopenia, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia.
- Although agents such as cyclosporine and methotrexate have shown activity in T-LGL, treatment of T-LGL has remained largely undefined and symptomatic.
- The shared IL-2R/Il-15R Beta receptor is over expressed on T-LGL cells and may stimulate growth T-LGL cells through its interaction with IL-15.
- Hu-Mik-Beta1 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to IL-2R/IL-15R Beta.
- Hu-Mik-Beta1 may inhibit the growth and exert cytotoxic activity against T-LGL cells. Objectives: Patients must have a granulocyte count of less than 1000/microL, or hemoglobin less than 10 gm/dL, or be transfusion dependent, or platelets less than 100, 000/ microL, or any combination of these unless receiving a hematopoietic growth factor.
- T-LGL cell count greater than or equal to 1000/microL by flow cytometry.
- Patients may be receiving a stable dose of a hematopoietic growth factor. ii. An absolute C3+, CD8+, usually CD57+ cell count greater than or equal to 1000/uL in the peripheral blood or bone marrow as measured by flow cytometry. iii.

At least 50% of the CD3+/CD8+ cells must also express CD122.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^80eb4319]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) — diagnosis — requires the presence of an expanded clonal population of T- or NK-cell large granular lymphocytes, and a large granular lymphocyte count is typically needed, but not required for the diagnosis of T-LGLL; therefore, the diagnosis of T-LGLL should be based on clinicopathologic findings. Morphologic examination of peripheral blood smear together with flow cytometry with adequate immunophenotyping and assessment of T-cell clonality are essential to confirm the diagnosis of T-LGLL, and it is essential to rule out reactive large granular lymphocytic lymphocytosis in patients with autoimmune or bone marrow failure disorders because small, clinically non-significant clones can be detected in bone marrow failure disorders. TRBC1 expression by flow cytometry has been reported as a highly sensitive method for the assessment of T-cell clonality with good correlation with molecular methods, and flow cytometry and T-cell clonality studies should be repeated in 6 months.

### Large granular lymphocyte leukemia: a clonal disorder with autoimmune manifestations [^b8dd0316]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by an expansion of clonal T or natural killer lymphocytes. Neutropenia-related infections and anemia represent the main manifestations. LGL leukemia is frequently associated with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, autoimmune endocrinopathies, vasculitis, or autoimmune cytopenia. Recent advances in the phenotypic and molecular characterization of LGL clones have underscored the pivotal role of a chronic antigenic stimulation and a dysregulation of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway in the pathophysiology linking leukemic-cell expansion and autoimmunity. In more than half of patients, there is a somatic STAT3 mutation. The disease is characterized by an indolent course, but approximately half of all patients will eventually require therapy. The first-line treatment for LGL leukemia is historically based on immunosuppressive agents (methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine). However, cytokines blocking molecules or Jak/STAT inhibitors represent a new conceptual therapeutic approach for LGL leukemia. In this review, we present an overview of the spectrum of LGL proliferations, potential links between LGL expansion and autoimmunity, and therapeutic approaches.

### Characteristic appearances of the bone marrow in T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukaemia [^4f25d57d]. Histopathology (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To augment the limited literature on bone marrow (BM) appearances in T-cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia and to identify a histological signature to aid in diagnosis of this condition.

Methods and Results

A descriptive analysis of the histology of the BM in T-cell LGL leukaemia was performed (n = 38). Antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD16, CD56, CD57 and CD20 or CD79a were employed. Antibodies against CD68 (macrophages) and CD34 (sinusoids) were also included. BM was normocellular or hypercellular in the majority of cases, with interstitial lymphoid infiltration in 97%. Lymphoid nodules were present in 55% and intrasinusoidal permeation in 58%. Apoptotic figures and haemosiderin deposition were common. All cases showed trilinear haematopoiesis with normal or increased megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis, but normal/reduced myelopoiesis. Reticulin was increased (Grade II-III). Immunohistochemistry revealed interstitial infiltration in all cases and helped to identify lymphoid nodules in two-thirds of cases. Preferential localization of CD8+ T lymphocytes to the interstitium and CD4+ T lymphocytes to the periphery of CD20+ B-cell nodules was seen in almost 90% of cases.

Conclusions

Nodules with non-clonal B-cell centres surrounded by CD4+ cells, with interstitial CD8+ cells, are a characteristic finding in T-cell LGL leukaemia and may represent a histological signature for this condition.

### Large granular lymphocyte leukemia [^4e89d961]. The Oncologist (2006). Low credibility.

Clonal disorders of large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) represent a spectrum of biologically distinct lymphoproliferative diseases originating either from mature T cells (CD3+) or natural killer (NK) cells (CD3-). Both subtypes, T-cell and NK-cell LGL leukemia, can manifest as indolent or aggressive disorders. The majority of patients with T-cell LGL leukemia have a clinically indolent course with a median survival time > 10 years. Immunosuppressive therapy with low-dose methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine A can control symptoms and cytopenias in more than 50% of patients, but this approach is not curative. Several cases of an aggressive variant (CD3+ CD56+) of T-cell LGL leukemia with a poor prognosis have also been reported. Aggressive NK-cell LGL leukemia is usually a rapidly progressive disorder associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), with a higher prevalence in Asia and South America. This disease is usually refractory to conventional chemotherapy, with a median survival time of 2 months. Chronic NK-cell leukemia/lymphocytosis is a rare EBV-negative disorder with an indolent clinical course. The malignant origin of this subtype is uncertain because clonality is difficult to determine in LGLs of NK-cell origin.

### Analysis of a French cohort of patients with large granular lymphocyte leukemia: a report on 229 cases [^c4ef7a20]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Large granular lymphocyte leukemia is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder associated with autoimmune diseases and impaired hematopoiesis. This study describes the clinical and biological characteristics of 229 patients with T-cell or NK-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia.

Design and Methods

The diagnosis was based on a large granular lymphocyte expansion (> 0.5×10⁹/L) lasting more than 6 months. Monoclonal T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement was detected in all the cases of T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia. Patients with chronic NK-cell lymphocytosis had an indolent disease, while those with multiorgan large granular lymphocyte infiltration and an aggressive clinical disease were considered to have NK-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia.

Results

The diagnosis of T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia was confirmed in 201 cases, chronic NK-cell lymphocytosis in 27 cases and NK-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia in one case. Associated autoimmune diseases or other neoplasms were present in 74 and 32 cases, respectively. One hundred patients (44%) required treatment, mainly for neutropenia-associated infections (n = 45), symptomatic autoimmune diseases (n = 24), transfusion-dependant anemia (n = 18), and other causes (n = 13). Patients were treated with steroids (n = 33), methotrexate (n = 62), cytoxan (n = 32), or cyclosporine (n = 24) either as first-, second-, third- or fourth-line therapy. The overall response rate at 3 months and complete response rate for the various treatments were as follows: steroids (12% and 3%), methotrexate (55% and 21%), cytoxan (66% and 47%), cyclosporine (21% and 4%), respectively. Four out of 13 patients responded to splenectomy. Eleven out of 15 patients responded to cytoxan after methotrexate treatment had failed. The mean number of treatments was 3.4 (range, 1–7). There were 15 large granular lymphocyte leukemia-related deaths.

Conclusions

Patients with T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia and chronic NK-cell lymphocytosis have similar clinical and biological features and responses to treatment. First-line therapy with cytoxan should be tested in a prospective trial.

### Large granular lymphocytosis with cytopenias after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation: clinical characteristics and response to immunosuppressive therapy [^a10ec2dd]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Large granular lymphocytosis (LGL)-or LGL leukemia-is a T- or NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder that often results in cytopenias and autoimmune phenomena. Several studies have described LGL in a subset of patients after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT), almost exclusively in the setting of asymptomatic lymphocytosis. Some have suggested an association with improved transplant-related outcomes. In contrast, clinically significant LGL after alloBMT is only described in small case reports. This study sought to assess the characteristics, significance, and response to treatment of LGL associated with unexplained anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia after alloBMT. We performed a retrospective analysis of 150 patients who were evaluated for LGL by peripheral blood flow cytometry (LGL flow) for unexplained cytopenias following initial engraftment after alloBMT from January 1 2012 to July 1, 2019. We identified patients with abnormally increased populations of LGL cells (LGL+) as assessed by Johns Hopkins Hematopathology. We collected demographic, transplantation, and LGL treatment information from electronic medical records. We compared LGL+ patients to patients with unexplained cytopenias with negative flow cytometry for LGL (LGL-) in this cohort. We also assessed change in blood counts after 4 weeks of immunosuppressive therapy in LGL+ patients. Cytopenias occurred at a median of 5.7 months (range 1–81) after alloBMT. The majority of the transplants were nonmyeloablative from haploidentical donors, and all patients received post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, consistent with the overall alloBMT characteristics at our center. We identified 70 patients with LGL and cytopenias, representing 47% of those evaluated by flow cytometry. There were no significant demographic or transplant-related differences between LGL+ patients and LGL- patients. The median age was 59, and 63% were male. LGL+ patients were more likely to have had cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia (73% versus 28%, P < .0001), but not acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. LGL+ patients had higher absolute lymphocyte counts (1500 versus 485/ mm 3, P < .0001), a trend toward lower absolute neutrophil count (660 versus 965/mm 3, P = 0.17), and lower neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (0.39 versus 1.71, P < .001). There were no differences in overall survival or relapse-free survival. Of those with T-cell LGL, 45 were assessed for T-cell receptor clonality. In all, 22% were clonal, 53% oligoclonal, 4% polyclonal, and 20% indeterminate. Thirty (43%) LGL+ patients received immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for cytopenias. First-line treatment was corticosteroids for 25 (83%). Among those treated, there was an increase in median absolute neutrophil count from 720 before treatment to 1990/mm 3 after 4 weeks (P = 0.0017). Thrombocytopenia and anemia showed at most a mild improvement with IST. LGL was a common association with otherwise unexplained cytopenias after alloBMT, almost always after prior CMV infection. LGL in the setting of cytopenias did not predict improved transplantation outcomes compared to those with cytopenias without presence of LGL. IST was effective at improving neutropenia associated with LGL after alloBMT.

### T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemias have multiple phenotypic abnormalities involving pan-T-cell antigens and receptors for MHC molecules [^a75fefb7]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemias represent monoclonal T-cell expansions that express CD16, CD56, or CD57 and cause cytopenias. The identification of T-LGL leukemias can be difficult because reactive T-LGL cells also can express CD16, CD56, and CD57, and many leukemia cases show only mild lymphocytoses. In this study, 23 T-LGL leukemia cases were analyzed by 3- and 4-color flow cytometry to identify markers that could aid in discriminating leukemic from normal T-LGL. In most cases (18/23), abnormalities (bright, dim, or negative expression) of 2 or more pan-T-cell antigens were identified, with all cases showing abnormal CD5 levels. Abnormal expression of CD94 was identified in 22 of 23 cases, and 15 of 21 cases also showed abnormal expression of class 1 MHC receptor molecules identified by antibodies against CD158a, CD158b, CD158e, CD158i, CD158k, and CD94. These studies help define abnormal phenotypic features typical of T-LGL leukemia that may have important diagnostic value.

### Large granular lymphocyte leukaemia study at the university hospital of donostia [^6f57a9c7]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia is considered a mature T-cell or natural killer (NK) cell neoplasm, characterised by a clonal proliferation of LGL.

Aims

To analyse the characteristics and to establish (if possible) the prognostic parameters of these patients diagnosed in a single centre: University Hospital of Donostia.

Methods

We retrospectively studied data about 308 patients with LGL leukaemia diagnosed in our centre.

Results

The frequency of T-LGL leukaemia and chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells was 89% and 6.8% respectively, and no aggressive NK-LGL leukaemia was seen in our population. The median age at diagnosis was 65.7 years and male-to-female ratio was 1.08. 59% of our patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Most patients presented lymphocytosis and 63.6% more than 20% LGLs in the peripheral blood count, but it has to be taken into account that these results may be influenced by the selection bias of our study, as we recognised these patients as 'alarms of the laboratory analysers'. Neutropenia was the most common cytopenia, and autoimmune disorders were described in 16.5% of the patients. Only 12 patients (3.9%) required treatment, a much lower percentage that the one reported in the literature, and this is consistent with the fact that patients were less symptomatic than in other series, as we expected. The 5-year and 15-year overall survival was 92% and 87%, respectively.

Conclusions

Our patients may represent the even more benign end of the spectrum of clonal T LGL and NK proliferations.

### Models for T-large granular lymphocytic leukemia: how to mimic the cellular interplays in malignant autoimmunity [^97e347fe]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

T-large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the clonal expansion of mature T cells. Although classified as a rare disease, T-LGLL is among the most prevalent mature T-cell leukemias. The oligo- to monoclonal expanded leukemic cells are post-thymic T cells, presenting in most patients a terminally differentiated effector memory CD3 + CD8 + phenotype, with diminished CD5 expression and clonal restriction to the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta constant 1 (TRBC1) or TRBC2 chain. A minority of patients develop CD4 + leukemic cells, presenting a more indolent disease course and, therefore, handled as a distinct subtype. Additionally, T-LGLL is closely related to NK-LGLL, likely linked by similar pathogenic mechanisms, though the exact factors influencing the dominance of each clonal population remain unclear.

Clinically, patients frequently present with severe neutropenia, leading to recurrent infections, along with transfusion-dependent anemia. Bone-marrow infiltration is commonly seen in T-LGLL patients, but interestingly, the severity of cytopenias does not correlate with the degree of T-LGLL infiltration, suggesting that immunogenic mechanisms, beyond those of anti-neutrophil antibodies or Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, play a role. Furthermore, T-LGLL is frequently associated with autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or severe vasculitis. A 'watch and wait' approach is appropriate for asymptomatic patients, but our clinical experiences show that treatment has to be initiated in ~70% of patients with options remaining limited. Standard therapy includes immunosuppressive agents like low-dose methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine, often combined with temporary glucocorticoids and supportive measures (e.g. transfusions). However, those treatments are often insufficient in controlling disease and symptoms; and come with relevant side effects, emphasizing, that novel strategies are highly warranted.

### Large granular lymphocyte expansions in primary Sjögren's syndrome: characteristics and outcomes [^e6d001aa]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic auto-immune disease (AID) that mainly causes mucosal dryness, asthenia, arthralgia and, sometimes, severe organ involvement requiring immunosuppressive treatment. Despite negative randomised controlled trials, rituximab (RTX) is frequently used in case of systemic complications.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) disorders are characterised by proliferation of LGL cytotoxic lymphocytes of either T-cell (mainly CD3+TCRαβ+CD8+CD57+CD56+/−CD16+/−, rarely CD4+CD8+/−) (T-LGL) or less frequently NK-cell (CD3-CD2+CD16+CD56+CD57+/−) (NK-LGL) origin. The spectrum of LGL disorders extends from reactive LGL expansions (LGLe), which are usually asymptomatic, transitory and have polyclonal or oligoclonal profile, to LGL leukaemias, which are monoclonal proliferations associated with cytopenias and somatic activating mutations in STAT3.T-LGL expansions (T-LGLe) have frequently been described in several AIDs, especially rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this context, they could exhibit either polyclonal, oligoclonal or monoclonal profile, and could be accompanied by neutropenia irrespective of their clonal status. However, LGLe have been exceptionally reported in pSS. Thus, we here report eight cases of LGLe in patients with pSS.

We describe a case of cytotoxic T-large granular lymphocyte leukaemia showing typical morphological features, expressing antigens characteristic for cytotoxic T cells and exhibiting marked natural killer-like cytotoxicity towards different target cells. Moreover, characterization of the T-cell receptors revealed simultaneous expression of two different types of beta-chains as well as alpha-chains by the malignant cell clone. The patient had an 8 year history of indolent disease, before progressing to an aggressive clinical course hardly responsive to chemotherapeutic treatment. This is the first description of a peripheral T-cell neoplasm expressing four distinct types of T-cell receptor molecules.

T-Cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) — diagnosis — requires the presence of an expanded clonal population of T- or NK-cell large granular lymphocytes, and the diagnosis of T-LGLL should be based on clinicopathologic findings. Morphologic examinations of peripheral blood smear, flow cytometry with adequate immunophenotyping, and assessment of T-cell clonality are essential to confirm T-LGLL, and small, clinically non-significant clones can occur in bone marrow failure disorders; therefore, it is essential to rule out reactive large granular lymphocytosis in patients with autoimmune or bone marrow failure disorders. TRBC1 expression by flow cytometry has been reported as a highly sensitive method for assessing T-cell clonality with good correlation with molecular methods.

### Pro-inflammatory cells sustain leukemic clonal expansion in T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia [^6453827d]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study we provide evidence that a pro-inflammatory background plays a defined role in sustaining T-cell proliferation in T-LGL disorders. In particular, in CD8 + STAT3 -mutated LGLL patients we demonstrated a skewed Th17/Treg ratio and an abnormal distribution of monocyte populations characterized by reduced classical and increased intermediate and non-classical monocytes. These latter cells release high levels of IL-6 following CCL5 stimulation. We also demonstrated that T-LGLL patients' monocytes take advantage from abnormal intracellular signaling pathways, as compared to monocytes from HC. These data on the ability of the leukemic clone to shape the environment in favor of its own proliferation open a new paradigm in T-LGLL. Accumulating evidence indicates that the intrinsic features of the LGL clone characterize the kinetics of the expanding population and contribute to define the disease subgroups. Clustering T-LGLL patients according to immunophenotype and STAT mutational status allowed us to demonstrate different types of signatures in relationship to the characteristics of non-leukemic cell populations, thus offering additional tools to separate disease subsets and suggesting peculiar pro-inflammatory mechanisms sustaining the pathogenesis of CD8 + and CD4 + T-LGLL. In fact, a skewed Th17/Treg ratio was a distinctive feature in CD8 + and CD4 + T-LGLL patients, CD8 + T-LGLL being characterized by a higher percentage of Th17 while a reduced percentage of Treg cells was detectable in CD4 + T-LGLL; these features were maintained during the patients' follow-up. The presence of a high percentage of Th17 cells was reported to stimulate CD8 + proliferation and increased cytotoxicity, suggesting a pro-proliferative role for these cells in CD8 + T-LGLL. On the other hand, the reduction of Treg might be due to the marked plasticity of these cells, which not only downmodulate FoxP3 to become pro-inflammatory cells, but can also express Th1, Th17 or Th2 master regulators, turning out as helper T celllike Treg. All these findings might contribute to the proinflammatory environment needed for LGL proliferation. Looking at each T-LGLL subgroup in more detail, we identified that CD8 + STAT3 -mutated and neutropenic patients are characterized by the highest number of "autoimmune-like" alterations, including an increased Th17/Treg ratio and the skewed monocyte distribution and count that are typically detected in autoimmune conditions. These findings would suggest that concomitant autoimmune diseases are involved in shaping the peculiar environment detected in CD8 + STAT3 -mutated cases. The evidence that the same changes in cellular distribution were also detected in CD8 + STAT3 -mutated patients but without association with autoimmune diseases supports the concept that immune system alterations, identified in these patients, are actually an intrinsic trait of the disease and a potential concomitant autoimmune disease might amplify this feature.

### Clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular cytogenetic assessment of CD4-/ CD8-γ δ T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia [^0dad8098]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

γδ T-cell large granular lymphocytic (T-LGL) leukemia of the CD4-/CD8- subtype is rare, and data are limited in the literature. This study evaluated the clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular cytogenetic features of 7 cases of CD4-/CD8- γδ T-LGL leukemia. Although this variant shares several clinical and morphologic features with the more common T-LGL leukemias, the incidences of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and pure red cell aplasia are higher. Another striking feature observed in our study was the lack of increased large granular lymphocytes in the peripheral blood in the majority of cases despite prominent bone marrow or splenic involvement. CD4-/CD8- γδ T-LGL leukemia also displays an immunophenotype and pattern of splenic involvement overlapping with hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Clinically, this variant of T-LGL leukemia shows an overall indolent course, but treatment is often required in the initial stages of the disease. Awareness of these features is important for early recognition and accurate diagnosis of patients with CD4-/CD8- γδ T-LGL leukemia.

### Large granular lymphocytes (LGL) following non-myeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: a case report [^e4c8bed7]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

We report here the first case of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) expansion following non-myeloablative allo-BMT for chronic myeloid leukemia. We characterized the morphologic, phenotypic and functional features of the LGL subset amplified in vivo 14 months after allo-BMT. Our results indicate that LGL can mediate in vitro a cytolytic activity on tumor cells. In vivo, the timing of the LGL expansion was associated with a sustained complete molecular remission. These observations suggest that LGL are a subset with the properties of effector lymphocytes which may contribute to the graft-versus-tumor effect.

### Prevalence and characteristics of persistent clonal T cell large granular lymphocyte expansions in rheumatoid arthritis: a comprehensive analysis of 529 patients [^01c60b25]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Up to one-third of patients with T cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia display symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In Crohn's disease and psoriasis, treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors is associated with hepatosplenic γδ T cell lymphoma and with clonal expansion of γδ T cells, respectively. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of clonal T-LGL cells in patients with RA and define risk factors for this rare hematologic malignancy.

Methods

A total of 529 RA patients were recruited between November 2013 and August 2015. Eight-color flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS]) was performed to screen for aberrant T cell populations of LGLs. Molecular analysis of the T cell receptor was used to confirm the diagnosis in patients with suggestive FACS findings. Electronic patient files were used to determine risk factors. Patients with clonal populations were monitored prospectively for up to 4 years.

Results

The median patient age was 61 years, and 74% were female. The median duration of RA was 12 years. The median Disease Activity Score in 28 joints was 2.8, and 69.9% of patients had ever been treated with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. We identified clonal T-LGL expansions in 19 patients, equaling a prevalence of 3.6%. The T-LGL cell clone was constant over time in most patients and was significantly associated with the duration of the exposure to TNF-blocking agents (P = 0.01). No other risk factors could be detected.

Conclusion

RA patients with long-term exposure to TNF-blocking agents were at a greater risk of developing clonal expansions of LGLs. This finding may prompt clinicians to refrain from using these substances in RA patients with known T cell aberrations.

Introduction

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) proliferations are derived from normal cytotoxic LGL cells, which comprise 10–15% of peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MNCs). The majority of the normal LGL cells (85%) are of NK-cell origin, and a minority is derived from mature (post-thymic) T lymphocytes. Lymphoproliferations of LGLs range from activated polyclonal expansions to clinically overt leukemias. T-cell LGL (T-LGL) leukemia is the most common subtype, representing ∼85% of all LGL leukemia cases diagnosed in western countries.

T-LGL leukemia is a rare and heterogeneous disorder and about one-third of patients is asymptomatic at diagnosis. The main clinical manifestations are related to chronic neutropenia and/or anemia. There is a frequent association with a wide variety of autoimmune diseases (33%) and other malignancies (13%). Its diagnosis is based on a persistent (> 6 months) morphologically and/or immunophenotypically increased clonal CD3 + /CD57 + LGL population in PB, usually > 2 × 10⁹/L, though a lower count (range 0.4–2 × 10⁹/L) may also be compatible with a diagnosis of T-LGL leukemia. T-LGL leukemias can be divided into three groups on the basis of their immunophenotypical and molecular characteristics: CD8 +, CD4 + and T-cell receptor (TCR)γδ + T-LGL. Monoclonal CD8 + /TCRαβ + T-LGL leukemia forms the largest subgroup (80–90%) of monoclonal T-LGL lymphoproliferative disorders. It presents in elderly individuals (mean age 60 years) and generally has an indolent clinical course. However, cases with a more aggressive clinical course that are associated with a CD3 + /CD8 + /CD56 + /CD57 − phenotype have been reported as well. CD3 + /CD4 + /TCRαβ + T-LGL leukemia and CD3 + /TCRγδ + T-LGL leukemia are far less common (< 5 and 5–10%, respectively), but a considerable number of cases from both disease entities have recently been described in detail.

T-Cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) — classification and epidemiology — comprises the most common subtype of large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL), representing approximately 85% of LGLL cases, with NK-LGLL representing approximately 10% and aggressive NK-cell leukemia (ANKL) approximately 5%; LGLL accounts for 2% to 5% of all chronic lymphoproliferative disorders in North America and Europe. The 2017 WHO classification listed three categories (T-LGLL, chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells, and ANKL), while the 2022 WHO classification (WHO5) renamed chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells as NK-LGLL and listed it as a definite entity, and the 2022 International Consensus Classification (ICC) continued to list it as a provisional entity. Most T-LGLL are of αβ T-cell origin, with some γδ phenotype; NK-LGLL has clinical and biologic features similar to T-LGLL and is managed similar to T-LGLL. ANKL is mainly diagnosed in Asia, is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and has very poor prognosis since it is refractory to chemotherapy.

### LGL leukemia: from pathogenesis to treatment [^9c318123]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia has been recognized by the World Health Organization classifications amongst mature T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell neoplasms. There are 3 categories: chronic T-cell leukemia and NK-cell lymphocytosis, which are similarly indolent diseases characterized by cytopenias and autoimmune conditions as opposed to aggressive NK-cell LGL leukemia. Clonal LGL expansion arise from chronic antigenic stimulation, which promotes dysregulation of apoptosis, mainly due to constitutive activation of survival pathways including Jak/Stat, MapK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt, Ras-Raf-1, MEK1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, sphingolipid, and nuclear factor-κB. Socs3 downregulation may also contribute to Stat3 activation. Interleukin 15 plays a key role in activation of leukemic LGL. Several somatic mutations including Stat3, Stat5b, and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 have been demonstrated recently in LGL leukemia. Because these mutations are present in less than half of the patients, they cannot completely explain LGL leukemogenesis. A better mechanistic understanding of leukemic LGL survival will allow future consideration of a more targeted therapeutic approach than the current practice of immunosuppressive therapy.

### Clinical features and treatment outcomes in large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) [^540b7991]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2018). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) represents a clonal/oligoclonal lymphoproliferation of cytotoxic T and natural killer cells often associated with STAT3 mutations. When symptomatic, due to mostly anemia and neutropenia, therapy choices are often empirically-based, because only few clinical trials and systematic studies have been performed. Incorporating new molecular and flow cytometry parameters, we identified 204 patients fulfilling uniform criteria for LGLL diagnoses and analyzed clinical course with median follow-up of 36 months, including responses to treatments. While selection of initial treatment was dictated by clinical features, the initial responses, as well as overall responses to methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporine (CsA), and cyclophosphamide (CTX), were similar at 40–50% across drugs. Sequential use of these drugs resulted in responses in most cases: only 10–20% required salvage therapies such as ATG, Campath, tofacitinib, splenectomy or abatacept. MTX yielded the most durable responses. STAT3-mutated patients required therapy more frequently and had better overall survival.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): focus on peripheral blood cell morphology [^ea9787cd]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Numerous studies have shown peculiar morphological anomalies in COVID-19 patients' smears. We searched all the peer-reviewed scientific publications that explicitly reference the cytomorphological alterations on peripheral blood smears of patients with COVID-19. We extracted data from sixty-five publications (case reports, patient group studies, reviews, and erythrocyte morphology studies). The results show that frequent alterations concern the morphology of lymphocytes (large lymphocytes with weakly basophilic cytoplasm, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, large granular lymphocytes). Neutrophils display abnormal nuclei and cytoplasm in a distinctive cytomorphological picture. Besides a left shift in maturation, granulations can be increased (toxic type) or decreased with areas of basophilia. Nuclei are often hyposegmented (pseudo-Pelger-Huёt anomaly). Apoptotic or pycnotic cells are not uncommon. Monocytes typically have a large cytoplasm loaded with heterogeneous and coalescing vacuoles. Platelets show large and giant shapes. The presence of erythrocyte fragments and schistocytes is especially evident in the forms of COVID-19 that are associated with thrombotic microangiopathies. Such atypia of blood cells reflects the generalized activation in severe COVID-19, which has been demonstrated with immunophenotypic, molecular, genetic, and functional methods. Neutrophils, in particular, are involved in the pathophysiology of hyperinflammation with cytokine storm, which characterizes the most unfavorable evolution.

### Refining the diagnosis of T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia by combining distinct patterns of antigen expression with T-cell clonality studies [^7754c239]. Leukemia (2011). Low credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia is a complex diagnosis, requiring persistent clonal expansions of LGLs, and cytopenias. Often the diagnosis is unclear as non-clonal expansions of LGLs commonly occur in reactive conditions. To better understand T-LGL leukemia, we performed a comprehensive clinicopathologic analysis of 85 patients with LGL expansions. Interestingly, distinct CD8+(dim)/CD57+ populations, seen by flow cytometry, were significantly associated with clonal T-LGL leukemia (P < 0.001) as well as neutropenia (median absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1.45 vs 3.19 × 10⁹/L; P = 0.0017). Furthermore, cases with distinct CD8+(dim)/CD57+ populations and monoclonal T cells had even lower ANCs (median ANC 1.41 × 10⁹/L; P = 0.001) compared with cases without these dual criteria. Additionally, complete or partial loss of CD5 expression was independently associated with clonal T-LGL leukemia (P < 0.001) and neutropenia (median ANC 1.41 vs 2.70 × 10⁹/L; P = 0.002). This study describes specific immunophenotypic parameters to better define clonal cases of T-LGL leukemia associated with significant neutropenia.

### Identification of novel STAT5B mutations and characterization of TCR β signatures in CD4 + T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia [^4d400f8c]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL) is a rare lymphoproliferative disease characterized by chronic expansion of clonal, mature cytotoxic T cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Two subtypes of T-LGLL are commonly recognized: the most common CD8+ T-LGLL (70% of cases) and the less frequent CD4+ T-LGLL (30% of cases). Clinically, CD4+ T-LGLL is usually an indolent disease and unlike in its CD8+ counterpart, these patients rarely have cytopenias or autoimmune symptoms. However, CD4+ T-LGLL has been reported more frequently associated with secondary neoplasms such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and plasma cell disorders. In CD4+ T-LGLL, the leukemic T-LGLs express CD4 (either alone or together with CD8) and the α/β T-cell receptor (TCR) together with a typical mature cytotoxic (Granzyme B+, CD56+, CD57+) and activated/memory T-cell (CD2 bright, CD7 dim, CD11a bright, CD28−, CD62L−) phenotype.

Patient characteristics

The clinical characteristics of the 14 FS patients included herein are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, and Online Supplementary Table S4 and Online Supplementary Table S5. None of the patients represented classical LGL leukemia with marked LGL lymphocytosis and T-cell receptor (TCR) γ gene rearrangement. Thirteen patients had longstanding RA prior to Felty syndrome diagnosis, and they had been treated with immunosuppressive drugs at the time of sample collection. The first sample of patient 9 was taken before initiating immunosuppressive treatment.

Table 1.
Basic clinical characteristics of Felty syndrome patients.

Table 2.
Laboratory findings of Felty syndrome patients.

As LGL lymphocytosis is the hallmark of LGL leukemia, peripheral blood smears were re-examined for this study. FS patients showed an overrepresentation of LGL lymphocytes (Table 2; normal range up to 25% of lymphocytes), but only two patients (patients 3 and 6) had absolute LGL lymphocytosis. Patients' bone marrow exams did not show dysplasia, but they often showed a slight left shift in granulopoiesis, and in some cases, overrepresentation of lymphocytes.

Large CD8 + T-cell expansions are characteristic for T-LGL leukemia. In FS patients, flow cytometry screening revealed skewed CD8 + TCR Vβ usage (Table 2 and Online Supplementary Figure S2). In 40% (4/10) of the examined cases, CD8 + expansions comprised over 20% of all CD8 + T cells.

Most of our patients' clinical features were well in accordance with the FS criteria (Table 1 and Table 2). Only three patients did not show the classical phenotype. No neutropenia was recorded in the clinical registry of patient 8. Patient 9 had cytopenias during tuberculosis therapy (although neutropenia continued years after the completion of the therapy). In addition, patient 3 showed lymphocytosis, but her bone marrow and peripheral blood TCRγ rearrangement tests were negative, and flow cytometry did not show any excess of natural killer (NK) cells.

### A population-based study of large granular lymphocyte leukemia [^21d7379d]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

A wide range (33–80%) of patients are reported to undergo therapy for T-LGL leukemia. The challenge in part is due to the fact that the definition of systemic therapy for T-LGL leukemia can vary widely. Moreover, many patients receive steroids and/or immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune diseases diagnosed before, concurrently or after the diagnosis of T-LGL leukemia — making it difficult to interpret the data. In our cohort, less than half patients with T-LGL leukemia required some form of systemic treatment at the time of diagnosis. This pattern is significantly different compared with the published French registry data, though reasons behind it remain unclear.

The long-term outlook and risk for poor prognosis in patients with T-LGL leukemia are not well understood. T-LGL leukemia is considered to be a chronic disease with unclear impact on survival. In an observational study 17% patients died during the 2-year follow-up. In contrast, another study showed median survival of 10 years. Our data is consistent with the latter study with a median OS of 9 years. At all the time points studied, the observed survival in patients with T-LGL leukemia was shorter than expected survival suggesting that T-LGL leukemia adversely affects OS (Figure 3a).

In a single-institution retrospective study of 286 patients with T-LGL leukemia, anemia, severe neutropenia and lymphopenia were identified as poor prognostic factors. Although we did not have access to similar laboratory parameters, we found that diagnosis of LGL leukemia in the older patients (aged > 60 years) and those with high coexistent comorbidities as defined by CCI > 2 were independent predictors of poor survival.

The limitation of this study includes inability to access individual patient data (including laboratory parameters), thus limiting our understanding of the presenting symptoms, laboratory parameters and reasons to institute therapy. NCDB data does not include cause of death, limiting our ability to ascertain cause specific mortality. The SEER data presented here suggest that at all the time points studied, T-LGL leukemia adversely affects OS.

### Aggressive T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia: a case report and review of the literature [^fc103712]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with T-cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia will have an indolent clinical course. Herein, we report a case of an aggressive T-cell LGL leukemia in a previously healthy 42-year-old Caucasian male who presented with acute onset of B-symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphocytosis, moderate anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Immunophenotypically, the malignant cells co-expressed CD3(+)CD8(+)CD56(+) markers and the T-cell receptor beta (TCR beta) gene demonstrated clonal rearrangement. The patient was treated with an intensive chemotherapeutic regimen (hyper-CVAD) and he achieved a complete remission. A systematic review of all available English literature revealed 12 well-described cases of aggressive T-cell LGL leukemia suggesting that this variant is a new and distinct entity in the spectrum of LGL disorders.

### T-cell receptor gammadelta-large granular lymphocytic leukemia associated with an aberrant phenotype and TCR-vbeta20 clonality [^33d50009]. Haematologica (2004). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia is a rare heterogenous disorder of mature lymphocytes with a characteristic morphology, multiple autoimmune disorders and indolent clinical course. Most cases exhibit a T-cell phenotype of CD3, CD8 and CD57 positivity, while the minority exhibit a CD2, CD56, and CD16 positive NK-cell phenotype. We report a case of a 71-year-old female suffering from a TCRgammadelta positive T-cell leukemia with a morphology compatible to LGL leukemia. She referred to the hospital for investigation of mild anemia, lymphocytosis, neutropenia and hyperglobulinemia. Peripheral blood and bone marrow were occupied by mature large granular lymphocytes with abundant azurophilic granules. The immunophenotype was CD3+, CD2+, CD5+, CD7+, CD4-, CD8-, CD16-, CD56-, CD57- and the Vbeta repertoire analysis showed clonal reactivity with Vbeta20 mAb. The patient was diagnosed as having T-LGL and was treated with G-CSF. So far, she experiences an indolent clinical course. To our knowledge, this is a rare case of TCRgammadelta positive T-LGL leukemia with the aberrant immunophenotype of CD3+, CD4-, CD8-, CD16-, CD56-, CD57-.

### The constitutive activation of STAT3 gene and its mutations are at the crossroad between LGL leukemia and autoimmune disorders [^39702fdc]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Type T Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia (T-LGLL) is a chronic disorder characterized by the abnormal proliferation of clonal cytotoxic T cells. The intriguing association of T-LGLL with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the most prominent example being rheumatoid arthritis, raises questions about the underlying pathophysiologic relationships between these disorders which share several biological and clinical features, most notably neutropenia, which is considered as a clinical hallmark. Recent progress in molecular genetics has contributed to a better understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms, thus moving our knowledge in the field of LGL leukemias forward. Focusing on the constitutive activation of STAT3 pathway and the well-established role of STAT3 mutations in T-LGLL, we herein discuss whether the T cell clones occurring in comorbid conditions are the cause or the consequence of the immune-inflammatory associated events. Overall, this review sheds light on the intricate relationships between inflammation and cancer, emphasizing the importance of the STAT3 gene and its activation in the pathophysiology of these conditions. Gaining a deeper understanding of these underlying mechanisms seeks to pave the way for the development of novel targeted therapies for patients affected by inflammation-related cancers.

### Large granular lymphocyte leukaemia is characterized by a clonal T-cell receptor rearrangement in both memory and effector CD8 (+) lymphocyte populations [^a2134658]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia is a disease with increased numbers of circulating granular lymphocytes and an increased percentage of clonally rearranged CD8(+)CD57(+) cells. To determine whether LGL cells are also found in other lymphocyte subsets, CD8(+) cells from 10 LGL patients were sorted into CD57(+) and CD57(-) fractions and analysed for clonality using a T-cell receptor gamma (TCR gamma) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In nine patients, a clonal TCR rearrangement was identified in the CD8(+)CD57(+) cells, and in one patient, the TCR rearrangement was oligoclonal in the CD8(+)CD57(+) fraction. In eight out of nine of the clonally rearranged patients, the same band was also present in the CD8(+)CD57(-) fraction. To define the relationship between CD57(-) and CD57(+) LGL populations, CD8(+)CD57(-) and CD8(+)CD57(+) cells were sorted from five patients and cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 plus CD28 antibodies. The CD57(+) cells died of apoptosis before d 7, while the CD57(-) cells proliferated and differentiated into CD57(+) cells. Clonal analysis identified the same band in both cultured subpopulations and in the uncultured CD8(+) cells. Immunophenotypical analysis showed that CD8(+)CD57(-) cells expressed memory cell markers, while the CD8(+)CD57(+) cells exhibited effector characteristics. These results suggest that LGL disease originates in a CD57(-) memory T-cell compartment that continually generates CD57(+) (effector cell) progeny.

### Atypical presentation of T-Cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia mimicking pleural malignancy on 18F-FDG PET / CT [^d97a3e35]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia is a rare form of leukemia, caused by clonal proliferation of cytotoxic T-cells, characterized by modest lymphocytosis and cytopenias of other lineage with hepatosplenomegaly and relatively rare lymph nodal involvement. Involvement of other organs is extremely rare. It is predominantly an indolent disease and most of patients remain asymptomatic for a long period. We present a rare case of aggressive form (CD56 positive) of large granular lymphocytic leukemia with atypical presentations mimicking pleural malignancy on F-FDG PET/CT.

### Indolent T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukaemia after haematopoietic SCT: a clinicopathologic and molecular analysis [^a2a41081]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Four women and three men after allogeneic (n = 4) and autologous (n = 3) haematopoietic SCT (HSCT) were observed to have an increase in T-cell large granular lymphocytes (T-LGLs) of CD3+CD8+ phenotype for a median of 41 (15–118) months. Clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gene was verified by two PCR techniques and direct DNA sequencing, confirming that the cases were neoplastic and therefore classifiable as T-LGL leukaemia. In the allogeneic HSCT cases, T-LGL leukaemia was derived from donor T cells in three patients, as shown by DNA chimerism analysis, and recipient T cells in one patient who had graft failure previously. None of the patients showed cytopenia, autoimmune phenomenon or organ infiltration, which were features typical of de novo T-LGL leukaemia. Six patients had remained asymptomatic with stable large granular lymphocyte counts. One patient died from cerebral relapse of the original lymphoma. T-LGL leukaemias occurring post-HSCT are distinct from de novo T-LGL leukaemia and may have a different pathogenesis and clinical course. Patients did not require specific treatment, and the disease remained stable for long periods.

### Severe cytopenia after chimeric antigen receptor-T cell driven by large granular lymphocytes and responsive to steroids [^d0b36f58]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Immune effector cell‐associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT) is a common toxicity associated with an important morbidity after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)‐T‐cell therapy. Multiple factors seem to be involved in the development of severe ICAHT, making its management difficult. Here, we report three cases of severe ICAHT after axicabtagene‐ciloleucel (axi‐cel) for diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma showing an expansion of large granular lymphocyte in the bone marrow with a CD3/CD57‐positive non‐CAR‐T immunophenotype. We show that it is possible to treat them with low‐dose steroids, obtaining a striking resolution of cytopenias with no deleterious impact on the underlying malignancy.

### Single-cell RNA sequencing coupled to TCR profiling of large granular lymphocyte leukemia T cells [^da80f5f7]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL) is a lymphoproliferative disease usually presenting with cytopenia, and typically characterized by clonal expansion of terminally differentiated effector-memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). T-LGLL has been hypothesized to be driven by chronic antigen exposure, resistance to Fas-FasL-mediated apoptosis, and constitutive activation of signaling proteins in the Janus-kinase (JAK) and other survival pathways –. JAK-STAT pathway activation is present in almost all cases, and gain-of-function mutations in STAT3 and STAT5B have been identified in about half of patients. Sequencing of the antigen-binding region (complementarity-determining region 3, CDR3) and measurement of the variable β chain (Vβ) of the T cell receptor (TCR) by flow cytometry provides clinical evidence of T cell clonal expansion in T-LGLL. Vβ flow cytometry and TCR γ -polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis are well correlated, but current panels of monoclonal antibodies only include about 75% of the Vβ spectrum. Application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to both Vβ and Vα chains has not been routine, and paired chain information is lost in the sequencing of bulk cell populations, which can only be paired using statistical algorithms. Therefore, high-resolution profiling of the TCR repertoire in T-LGLL is lacking. Efforts to characterize the transcriptome of clonal CTL using whole peripheral blood or after enrichment of specific clones by flow cytometry have not provided satisfying resolution and scale, due to heterogeneity among patients.

### Clinicobiological, immunophenotypic, and molecular characteristics of monoclonal CD56-/ + dim chronic natural killer cell large granular lymphocytosis [^e1516967]. The American Journal of Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Indolent natural killer (NK) cell lymphoproliferative disorders include a heterogeneous group of patients in whom persistent expansions of mature, typically CD56(+), NK cells in the absence of any clonal marker are present in the peripheral blood. In the present study we report on the clinical, hematological, immunophenotypic, serological, and molecular features of a series of 26 patients with chronic large granular NK cell lymphocytosis, whose NK cells were either CD56(-) or expressed very low levels of CD56 (CD56(-/+dim) NK cells), in the context of an aberrant activation-related mature phenotype and proved to be monoclonal using the human androgen receptor gene polymerase chain reaction-based assay. As normal CD56(+) NK cells, CD56(-/+dim) NK cells were granzyme B(+), CD3(-), TCRalphabeta/gammadelta(-), CD5(-), CD28(-), CD11a(+bright), CD45RA(+bright), CD122(+), and CD25(-) and they showed variable and heterogeneous expression of both CD8 and CD57. Nevertheless, they displayed several unusual immunophenotypic features. Accordingly, besides being CD56(-/+dim), they were CD11b(-/+dim) (heterogeneous), CD7(-/+dim) (heterogeneous), CD2(+) (homogeneous), CD11c(+bright) (homogeneous), and CD38(-/+dim) (heterogeneous). Moreover, CD56(-/+dim) NK cells heterogeneously expressed HLA-DR. In that concerning the expression of killer receptors, CD56(-/+dim) NK cells showed bright and homogeneous CD94 expression, and dim and heterogeneous reactivity for CD161, whereas CD158a and NKB1 expression was variable. From the functional point of view, CD56(-/+dim) showed a typical Th1 pattern of cytokine production (interferon-gamma(+), tumor necrosis factor-alpha(+)). From the clinical point of view, these patients usually had an indolent clinical course, progression into a massive lymphocytosis with lung infiltration leading to death being observed in only one case. Despite this, they frequently had associated cytopenias as well as neoplastic diseases and/or viral infections. In summary, we describe a unique and homogeneous group of monoclonal chronic large granular NK cell lymphocytosis with an aberrant activation-related CD56(-/+dim)/CD11b(-/+dim) phenotype and an indolent clinical course, whose main clinical features are related to concomitant diseases.

### Spectrum of clonal large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) of α β T cells: T-Cell clones of undetermined significance, T-Cell LGL leukemias, and T-Cell immunoclones [^f3562131]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Clones of T-cell large granular lymphocytes (LGLTs) were detected by flow cytometry. Disease associations are described.

Methods

Flow cytometry on blood or marrow detected clonal LGLTs by analyzing variable regions of the T-cell receptor β chain.

Results

LGLT clones were detected in 20% (54/264) of tested patients. The clone sizes were less than 2.0 × 10(9)/L in the blood in 73% and less than 10% of marrow space in 94%. Blood counts showed cytopenias. Clinical associations included B-cell clones, myeloid neoplasms, nonneoplastic disorders of blood or marrow, transplants, systemic immune disorders, carcinomas, or hypothyroidism. Twelve patients had LGLT leukemia. Most (76%) had small LGLT clones with limited impact on the clinical management.

Conclusions

Most of the LGLT clones detected by flow cytometry were small and did not change the clinical management. We propose the following terminology: T-cell clones of undetermined significance, LGLT leukemias, and T-cell immunoclones.

### Subclonal STAT3 mutations solidify clonal dominance [^48c51139]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

T large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL) is a clonal lymphoproliferative disorder that can arise in the context of pathologic or physiologic cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses. STAT3 mutations are often absent in typical T-LGLL, suggesting that in a significant fraction of patients, antigen-driven expansion alone can maintain LGL clone persistence. We set out to determine the relationship between activating STAT3 hits and CTL clonal selection at presentation and in response to therapy. Thus, a group of patients with T-LGLL were serially subjected to deep next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vβ complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) and STAT3 to recapitulate clonal hierarchy and dynamics. The results of this complex analysis demonstrate that STAT3 mutations produce either a sweeping or linear subclone within a monoclonal CTL population either early or during the course of disease. Therapy can extinguish a LGL clone, silence it, or adapt mechanisms to escape elimination. LGL clones can persist on elimination of STAT3 subclones, and alternate STAT3 -negative CTL clones can replace therapy-sensitive CTL clones. LGL clones can evolve and are fueled by a nonextinguished antigenic drive. STAT3 mutations can accelerate this process or render CTL clones semiautonomous and not reliant on physiologic stimulation.

### Pro-inflammatory cells sustain leukemic clonal expansion in T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia [^c7a73534]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the clonal expansion of T-cell large granular lymphocytes (T-LGL). Immunophenotypic and genotypic features contribute to discriminate symptomatic (CD8 + STAT3 -mutated T-LGLL) from clinically indolent patients, this latter group including CD8 + wildtype (wt), CD4 + STAT5B -mutated and wt cases. T-LGL lymphoproliferation is sustained both by somatic gain-of-function mutations (i.e. STAT3 and STAT5B) and by pro-inflammatory cytokines, but little information is available on the activity of T-LGLL non-leukemic cells. In this study, we characterized pro-inflammatory cells in the peripheral blood of T-LGLL patients and analyzed their role in supporting the leukemic growth. In symptomatic patients we found that cell populations not belonging to the leukemic component showed a discrete pro-inflammatory pattern. In particular, CD8 + STAT3 -mutated cases showed a skewed Th17/Treg ratio and an abnormal distribution of monocyte populations characterized by increased intermediate and non-classical monocytes. We also demonstrated that monocytes released high levels of interleukin-6 after CCL5 stimulation, a chemokine specifically expressed only by leukemic LGL. Conversely, in asymptomatic cases an altered distribution of monocyte populations was not detected. Moreover, T-LGLL patients' monocytes showed abnormal activation of signaling pathways, further supporting the different pathogenic role of monocytes in patients in discrete clinical settings. Altogether, our data contribute to deepening the knowledge on the different cell subtypes in T-LGLL, focusing particularly on non-leukemic cell populations and thus offering the rationale for new therapeutic strategies.

Haematologic response and outcomes

Fourteen of twenty-five (56%; 95% CI: 37–73%) subjects responded; nine subjects had a CR and five had a PR at 3 months after treatment (Figure 1, left panel). No responses were seen in the 4 subjects with associated myelodysplasia (MDS) and in the two hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. Thus, the response rate in nineteen subjects with typical T-LGL was 14/19 (74%; 95% CI: 51–86%; Figure 1, right panel). Of the fourteen responding patients, eight had anaemia, four had neutropenia and two had both anaemia and neutropenia at baseline. Haematologic improvement occurred quickly after treatment, usually in the first 2–3 weeks, and was durable in over half of the responders after only 1 course of alemtuzumab (Figure 2). Significant depression in non-affected lineages was not observed with this low dose alemtuzumab regimen.

Five of the responders relapsed: one achieved PR with cyclosporine; four subjects were re-treated with alemtuzumab, of whom 2 achieved CR but relapsed at 5 and 12 months later. The patient that relapsed at 5 months after retreatment achieved a durable CR to oral cyclosporine 2 months after starting the drug. Of the eleven non-responders three became responders at 6 months but, from the other eight patients, seven of them died (four of infectious complication, one from bleeding, and two of unknown causes); whereas all the alemtuzumab responders, including the relapsed subjects, were alive at the time of censor (Figure S2, page 2).

### Transient monoclonal expansion of CD8 + / CD57 + T-cell large granular lymphocytes after primary cytomegalovirus infection [^d51532dc]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Lymphocytosis associated with viral infection is generally polyclonal or oligoclonal. In this article, we describe a case of transient monoclonal CD8+/CD57+ T-cell lymphocytosis with large granular lymphocyte (LGL) morphology occurring after primary CMV infection and review cases of virus-associated monoclonal CD8+ T-cell expansions reported in the literature. Several clinical features shared by virus-associated monoclonal CD8+ T-cell expansions suggest the reactive nature of the lymphocytosis. Based on this, our case report and those reported in the literature support the notion that T-cell receptor clonality per se is not necessarily indicative of malignancy. These observations further corroborate the need for a close follow-up before assigning the diagnosis of LGL leukemia to individuals developing monoclonal CD8+ T-cell expansions.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^6dc8ff62]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) — epidemiology and classification — is a rare chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of mature T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, accounting for 2% to 5% of all the chronic lymphoproliferative disorders in North America and Europe. In the 2017 WHO classification, LGLL was categorized as T-cell LGLL (T-LGLL), chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells, and aggressive NK-cell leukemia (ANKL). In the updated 2022 WHO classification (WHO5), chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells is renamed as NK-LGLL and is listed as a definite entity, while the 2022 International Consensus Classification (ICC) continues to list chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells as a provisional entity. T-LGLL is the most common subtype, representing approximately 85% of LGLL cases; NK-LGLL represents approximately 10%; and ANKL represents approximately 5%, is mainly diagnosed in Asia, is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and the prognosis is very poor since it is refractory to chemotherapy.

### TCRalphabeta + / CD4 + large granular lymphocytosis: a new clonal T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder [^d33b27da]. The American Journal of Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a well-recognized disease of mature T-CD8(+) or less frequently natural killer cells; in contrast, monoclonal expansions of CD4(+) T-LGL have only been sporadically reported in the literature. In the present article we have explored throughout a period of 56 months the incidence of monoclonal expansions of CD4(+) T-LGL in a population of 2.2 million inhabitants and analyzed the immunophenotype and the pattern of cytokine production of clonal CD4(+) T cells of a series of 34 consecutive cases. Like CD8(+) T-LGL leukemias, CD4(+) T-LGL leukemia patients have an indolent disease; however, in contrast to CD8(+) T-LGL leukemias, they do not show cytopenias and autoimmune phenomena and they frequently have associated neoplasias, which is usually determining the clinical course of the disease. Monoclonal CD4(+) T-LGLshowed expression of TCRalphabeta, variable levels of CD8 (CD8(-/+dim)) and a homogeneous typical cytotoxic (granzyme B(+), CD56(+), CD57(+), CD11b(±)) and activated/memory T cell (CD2(+bright), CD7(-/+dim), CD11a(+bright), CD28(-), CD62L(-) HLA-DR(+)) immunophenotype. In addition, they exhibited a Th1 pattern of cytokine production [interferon-gamma(++), tumor necrosis factor-alpha(++), interleukin (IL-2)(-/+), IL-4(-), IL-10(-), IL-13(-)]. Phenotypic analysis of the TCR-Vbeta repertoire revealed large monoclonal TCR-Vbeta expansions; only a restricted number of TCR-Vbeta families were represented in the 34 cases analyzed. These findings suggest that monoclonal TCRalphabeta(+)/CD4(+)/NKa(+)/CD8(-/+dim) T-LGL represent a subgroup of monoclonal LGL lymphoproliferative disorders different from both CD8(+) T-LGL and natural killer cell-type LGL leukemias. Longer follow-up periods are necessary to determine the exact significance of this clonal disorder.

### Clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular features of γ δ T-Cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia: an analysis of 14 patients suggests biologic differences with α β T-Cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia [^985f7514]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

T-cell large granular lymphocytic (T-LGL) leukemia is a rare disorder in which the neoplastic cells usually express the αβ T-cell receptor (TCR). To determine the significance of γδ TCR expression in this leukemia, we compared the clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features of patients with T-LGL leukemia expressing γδ TCR or αβ TCR.

Methods

We used the World Health Organization classification criteria to confirm the diagnosis. All patients were diagnosed and treated at our institution.

Results

We identified 14 patients with γδ T-LGL leukemia, 11 men and three women; six (43%) patients had a history of rheumatoid arthritis, 10 (71%) had neutropenia, four (29%) had thrombocytopenia, and three (21%) had anemia. Eight (67%) of 12 patients had a CD4-/CD8- phenotype, and four (33%) had a CD4-/CD8+ phenotype. The median overall survival was 62 months. Patients with γδ T-LGL leukemia were more likely to have rheumatoid arthritis (P = 0.04), lower absolute neutrophil count (P = 0.04), lower platelet count (P = 0.004), and a higher frequency of the CD4-/CD8- phenotype (P < .0001). However, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups (P = 0.64).

Conclusions

Although patients with γδ and αβ T-LGL leukemia show some different clinical or phenotypic features, overall survival is similar, suggesting that γδ TCR expression does not carry prognostic significance.

### Isolated anemia in patients with large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) [^a41a579f]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

It is uncertain the mechanism of how LGLL causes cytopenia, but the direct cytotoxicity effect on hematopoietic cells is an appealing hypothesis. In patients with PRCA, both in vitro and in vivo data suggested that erythropoiesis at a level of differentiation between early and late erythroid progenitors was inhibited by large granular lymphocytes, which was mediated by direct cell-cell interaction. Immature erythroid elements were essentially absent in PRCA patients but present in non-PRCA patients, suggesting LGLL cells inhibited both immature and mature erythroid elements that might share similar cell surface antigens at successive stages of differentiation. Interestingly, no LGLL patients with isolated anemia developed neutropenia during a median follow-up of 51 months. It is consistent with the previous reports that neutropenia was uncommon in T-LGLL patients with PRCA. The finding raises a possibility that LGLL sometimes might apply lineage-specific inhibition mechanisms, especially in this LGLL group with much lower incidence of rheumatoid arthritis. We recognize that anemia is associated with neutropenia in many LGLL patients, and they may occur at different time points in the course of LGLL. The relatively short median follow-up in this study could not be long enough for the development of neutropenia. Therefore, a longer follow-up may be informative. Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that LGLL could cause isolated anemia at initial presentation as these patients may not develop neutropenia until much later.

In conclusion, anemia can uncommonly be the sole cytopenia at the initial diagnosis of LGLL, with PRCA seen in one-third of these patients. Compared to PRCA patients, isolated anemia patients without PRCA demonstrate similar clinicopathologic features, similar therapeutic responses, and comparable overall survival, indicating they are the continuum of the same disorder. This study highlights the importance of recognizing LGLL as a potential cause of isolated anemia at the initial presentation which allows for beneficial LGLL-related treatment.

### A modern view of LGL leukemia [^c190a8f6]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) is a rare lymphoproliferative chronic disorder characterized by expansion of either T or natural killer (NK) cytotoxic cells. In contrast to Epstein-Barr virus-induced aggressive NK-LGLL, chronic T-LGLL and NK-LGLL are indolent diseases affecting older patients with a median age of 66.5 years. LGLL is frequently associated with autoimmune disorders, most frequently rheumatoid arthritis. An auto-/alloantigen is tentatively implicated in disease initiation. Large granular lymphocyte expansion is then triggered by proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-15, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1), and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted). This proinflammatory environment contributes to deregulation of proliferative and apoptotic pathways. After the initial description of the JAK-STAT pathway signaling activation in the majority of patients, recurrent STAT3 gain-of-function mutations have been reported. The JAK-STAT pathway plays a key role in LGL pathogenesis by promoting survival, proliferation, and cytotoxicity. Several recent advances have been made toward understanding the molecular landscapes of T- and NK-LGLL, identifying multiple recurrent mutations affecting the epigenome, such as TET2 or KMT2D, and cross talk with the immune microenvironment, such as CCL22. Despite an indolent course, published series suggest that the majority of patients eventually need treatment. However, it is noteworthy that many patients may have a long-term observation period without ever requiring therapy. Treatments rely upon immunosuppressive drugs, namely cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and cyclosporine. Recent advances have led to the development of targeted approaches, including JAK-STAT inhibitors, cytokine targeting, and hypomethylating agents, opening new developments in a still-incurable disease.

### Aggressive NK-cell leukaemia: diverse morphology, distinct clinical features [^36fd5e1e]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

ANKL is a rare disease strongly associated with EBV, often complicated by haemophagocytic syndrome, multiorgan failure and coagulopathy. Although leukaemic cells usually resemble large granular lymphocytes (LGL), their morphology can vary significantly, ranging from normal LGL to large blastoid cells without granules, as demonstrated here. Regardless of this morphological variability, most cases result in a poor prognosis with survival generally not exceeding a few months. Consequently, although CD30 expression in ANKL has been rarely reported in the literature, it could represent a potential therapeutic target, given the poor response to conventional treatments.

Introduction

Large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGLL) is a rare and heterogenous chronic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the clonal expansion of large granular lymphocytes (LGLs). The etiology of LGLL is unknown, but a constitutive activation of JAK/STAT pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of LGL proliferation, further supported by the discovery of somatic STAT3 and STAT5b mutations in ∼40% of patients. Among LGLLs, the latest World Health Organization classification recognizes a CD3 + T-cell LGLL (T-LGLL) and CD3 – natural killer (NK)-LGLL, accounting for 85% and 15% of cases, respectively. Moreover, based on surface T-cell receptor expression, Tαβ and Tγδ subsets of LGLL can be identified.

Although LGLL incidence ranges between 0.2 and 0.72 cases per 1 million individuals per year, the frequency of Tγδ proliferation is still not well defined, and most information has been collected through small retrospective studies. As compared with the more frequent Tαβ LGLL, Tγδ LGLL has been less investigated. First reported by Oshimi et al in 1988 in a 60-year-old woman exposed to the radiation in Nagasaki in 1945, Tγδ LGLL has been described in a sizable number of patients in 2006 by Sandberg et al, who reported an immunophenotypical analysis of 44 cases. Up to now, only 4 retrospective studies including more than 200 LGLL patients are available; however, few cases of Tγδ LGLL were included and only in the Italian cohort. Consequently, the clinical features of Tγδ LGLL and information on the efficacy of treatments in this LGLL variant are still missing. Furthermore, data on the frequencies of STAT3 and STAT5b mutations are nowadays available for Tαβ LGLL, but still limited and controversial for Tγδ LGLL. The Italian group recently reported 25% and 19% of Tγδ cases mutated in STAT3 and STAT5b genes, respectively, and STAT3 mutations were found in all patients included in a small Japanese Tγδ LGLL cohort.

### TCR vbeta repertoire analysis in CD56 + CD16 (dim /-) T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukaemia: association with CD4 single and CD4 / CD8 double positive phenotypes [^4dfea689]. British Journal of Haematology (2003). Low credibility.

We report 10 patients with T-cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia: four patients had CD16+ CD56- LGL lymphocytes (typical for LGL leukaemia), and six patients had CD56+ CD16(dim/-) LGL lymphocytes (atypical). Among the CD56+ CD(dim/-) patients, LGL lymphocytes were CD4+ CD8- in one patient, CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) in three, and CD4- CD8+ in two. The CD4+ CD8dim DP cells expressed a CD8alphaalpha homodimer. T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) size distribution analysis and direct sequencing identified at least 1 in-frame clonal TCR Vbeta transcript in each patient; three patients had two or three different clonal sequences. To determine whether these transcripts were translated into cell surface TCR, we performed flow cytometric analysis using Vbeta monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). A single Vbeta protein was identified in patients, even those with multiple in-frame transcripts. Previous and present results suggest that CD56+ CD16(dim/-) LGL leukaemia is more common than previously thought, and is associated with unusual phenotypes. When assessed using only molecular techniques, the monoclonal status of this disease may be misinterpreted as oligoclonal; thus, flow cytometric analysis using Vbeta mAb is quite useful. Because mAbs do not cover the entire Vbeta repertoire, assessing clonality using a combination of molecular methods and mAbs is preferable.

Fig. 1
Proposed concept of T-LGLL pathogenesis.

This schematic overview illustrates the pathobiological landscape of T-LGLL, highlighting key genomic, transcriptomic, and microenvironmental factors that drive T-LGLL leukemogenesis. The proposed initial event for T-LGLL is a chronic antigenic stimulation, resulting in polyclonal LGL expansion. The expansion of LGLs is further supported by inflammatory cytokines, like IL-2, IL-6, and IL-15, potentially secreted by the non-leukemic compartment, like B-cells, CD4 + T cells, monocytes, and other antigen-presenting cells (APC). Autocrine platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB signaling, via PI3K/Akt/mTOR, adds an additional proliferative stimulus. Clonal selection of T-LGLL expansions can be further favored by the occurrence of specific mutations, predominantly gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of STAT3 in CD8 + T-LGLL and STAT5B in CD4 + T-LGLL. Constitutive activation of STAT3 is additionally achieved by diminished expression of the negative regulator SOCS3. Pathways conferring resistance to apoptosis are also shown, with increased c-FLIP levels contributing to Fas/FasL resistance. Red shadows indicate proven alteration within T-LGLL cells; dashed arrows show suspected but unconfirmed interactions, while gray arrows denote downregulated effects in T-LGLL.

### Lack of common TCRA and TCRB clonotypes in CD8 (+) / TCR α β (+) T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia: a review on the role of antigenic selection in the immunopathogenesis of CD8 (+) T-LGL [^d557efb3]. Blood Cancer Journal (2014). Low credibility.

At closing of the study, the median follow-up of the patients was 34 months (range 6–122 months). Two-thirds of patients required therapy with one or more agents (Table 1). The therapeutic strategy was largely aimed at improving cytopenias and included erythrocyte transfusions and various immunosuppressive drugs. We observed one disease-related death in these 26 patients (case 86–041) which is in line with the generally indolent clinical course of this disease.

Typical LGL immunophenotype is seen in all CD8 + /TCRαβ + T-LGL

T-LGL cells of all 26 cases showed membrane co-expression of CD3, CD8 and TCRαβ molecules. The majority of leukemic LGLs expressed CD2 (100%), CD5 (77%) and CD7 (81%). Furthermore, the T-LGL cells of all cases showed expression of one or more markers like CD16, CD56 or CD57 that have typically been associated with LGL and that reflect the antigen-experienced nature of the cells (Table 1). Out of 22 cases 11 were CD16 positive (50%), whereas CD56 expression was seen in 7 out of 20 cases analyzed (35%). Heterogeneous expression of CD57 could be demonstrated in 23 out of 24 evaluable cases (96%). Thus, these CD8 + /TCRαβ + T-LGLs show the typical effector T-cell phenotype.

### Clonal drift demonstrates unexpected dynamics of the T-cell repertoire in T-large granular lymphocyte leukemia [^62903698]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL) is characterized by chronic lymphoproliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and is associated with lineage-restricted cytopenias. Introduction of T-cell receptor (TCR) variable β-chain (Vβ) monoclonal antibodies has facilitated identification and enumeration of clonal CTLs by flow cytometry. A highly skewed TCR Vβ repertoire identified by flow cytometry is strongly associated with monoclonal CDR3 regions by quantitative sequencing and positive TCRγ rearrangement assays. Therefore, Vβ expansions can serve as surrogate markers of CTL clonality to assess clonal kinetics in T-LGLL. We analyzed the TCR repertoire in 143 patients, 71 of which were available for serial measurements over 6 to 96 months. Although the majority (38/71, 54%) maintained a consistent monoclonal expansion, many (26/71, 37%) unexpectedly displayed a change in the dominant clone, whereby the original CTL clone contracted and another emerged as demonstrated by Vβ typing. Our results demonstrate that the T-cell repertoire is more dynamic in T-LGLL than recognized previously, illustrating the heterogeneity of disorders under this categorization.

Introduction

T cell Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia (T-LGLL) is a rare lymphoproliferative disease characterized by the accumulation of abnormal, clonally restricted, and activated effector T cells in the blood, bone marrow, and spleen. Although immune-mediated cytopenias (most frequently neutropenia, 70–80%) and autoimmune manifestations (most frequently rheumatoid arthritis [RA], 10–18%) are commonly associated with T-LGLL, it usually presents as an indolent disease that is manageable with low-dose immunosuppressive therapies –.

The absence of presenting symptoms and shared morphological and phenotypic (CD3 + CD8 + CD45RA + CD57 +) features with healthy reactive cytotoxic T cells impose challenges in the diagnosis of CD8 + T-LGLL. Activating somatic mutations in the STAT3 gene, the hallmark of CD8 + T-LGLL, occurs in 40–50% of patients –, where the majority of variants (e.g. Y640F, D661V, and D661Y) are located in the SH2 domain of STAT3. Although the clinical features of patients with mutated and wild-type STAT3 overlap, (severe) neutropenia and autoimmune manifestations are more common in mutated STAT3 cases. Nevertheless, T-LGLL clonotypes show constant STAT3 activation irrespective of the STAT3 mutation status and are resistant to FAS/FAS-L mediated apoptosis, which can be explained by upregulated survival signaling pathways, such as MCL1, NF-κB, and PI3K/AKT –.

Although chronic antigenic stimulation has been suggested to drive cytotoxic T cell lymphoproliferation in T-LGLL, little has been reported about the function of non-leukemic populations in driving or aiding T-LGLL pathogenesis. Altered B-cell activities (dyscrasias, hypergammaglobulinemia, enhanced production of immunoglobulins, including autoantibodies), elevated levels of multiple cytokines (e.g. IL-15, TNF, IL-6) –, and that IL-15 expression by monocytes can initiate T-LGLL in transgenic mice, suggest the possible function of non-leukemic cells in the disease. As changes in leukemia cell burden cannot be associated with therapy responses, and multiple symptoms can be attributed to elevated cytokine expressions, a holistic understanding of the total immune repertoire behind T-LGLL is an unmet need.

### Isolated anemia in patients with large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) [^2660d436]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

PRCA is a rare hematologic syndrome characterized by anemia, reticulocytopenia, and severe erythroid hypoplasia of the bone marrow that could be caused by immune conditions, medications, viral infections, thymoma, LGLL, or idiopathy. Approximately 10–30% of PRCA patients have T-LGLL, and 10% of T-LGLL patients have PRCA. Among our cohort of 34 LGLL patients with isolated anemia, 38% of patients had PRCA and most did not. Although PRCA patients had markedly decreased reticulocyte count in the peripheral blood and erythroid precursors in the bone marrow and they are more transfusion-dependent, there was no other significant clinicopathologic difference between PRCA and non-PRCA patients.

The discovery of STAT3 mutations has shed light on the genetic basis of LGLL pathogenesis. Although T-LGLL patients with PRCA have been reported to preferentially harbor STAT3 mutations, none were found in the PRCA patients in this cohort. This is likely due to the small number of cases investigated.

More PRCA patients were given LGLL therapy than non-PRCA patients, likely because PRCA patients were more transfusion-dependent. Among the treated patients, both PRCA and non-PRCA groups exhibited higher therapeutic response rates (72.7% in PRCA and 92.3% in non-PRCA), compared to the reported overall response rate of 40–60% in typical LGLL patients. Our study confirmed the previous finding that LGLL patients with PRCA showed superior response to immunosuppressive therapy. In addition, this is the first study that demonstrates LGLL patients with non-PRCA related isolated anemia also having an excellent therapeutic response to LGLL treatment. Half of the observed non-PRCA patients experienced progressive anemia, which warrants LGLL treatment in the future. This cohort's high therapeutic response rate (83%) further confirms that LGLL is the etiology for the anemia and emphasizes the importance of LGLL diagnosis in patients with isolated anemia who may benefit from LGLL treatment.

### A high definition picture of somatic mutations in chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer cells [^7832aecd]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Among the abnormal proliferations of large granular lymphocytes (LGL), chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer (NK) cells (CLPD‐NK) is characterized by a persistent (> 6 months) clonal expansion of LGL of the NK lineagein the peripheral blood with an absolute NK-LGL count ≥ 0.5 × 10⁹/L. CLPD‐NK patients are generally asymptomatic, with a minority of cases presenting with cytopenia, mainly neutropenia and anemia. CLPD‐NK is commonly associated with autoimmune disorders and neoplastic conditions, both hematological and non-hematological. The clinical course of CLPD-NK is usually indolent, consistent with the better characterized T-cell LGL leukemia (T-LGLL), whereas it is clearly distinguished from the aggressive NK cell leukemia (ANKL) and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma-nasal type (NKTCL). CLPD-NK is often characterized by a CD3− CD16+ CD56+ CD8 ± CD57 ± phenotype and a restricted pattern of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) providing a surrogate marker of clonality.

### Mutations in large granular lymphocytic leukemia [^a31f67fd]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia is an indolent, mature cytotoxic T-cell or NK-cell proliferative disorder that is often associated with immune-mediated complications, including cytopenia and autoimmune diseases. The genetic landscape of LGL leukemia has been elucidated, including frequent somatic mutations in STAT3, STAT5B and TET2 genes.-Recently, somatic mutations in C-C motif chemokine ligand 22 (CCL22) were identified in patients with NK-cell LGL leukemia (NK-LGLL), suggesting a novel mechanism of LGL proliferation in mutated chemokine-induced microenvironmental alterations. However, information on the mutational profile of CCL22 and its clinical significance in LGL leukemia remains limited, and its genetic-phenotypic associations remain to be clarified. We investigated mutational profiles, including CCL22 gene mutations, in patients with LGL leukemia and identified CCL22 mutations in T-cell LGL (T-LGL) leukemia and NK-LGLL, and found that their associations with clinical features varied among the subtypes of LGL leukemia.

### Novel somatic mutations in large granular lymphocytic leukemia affecting the STAT-pathway and T-cell activation [^6b743ceb]. Blood Cancer Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia was first described in 1985 as a clonal disorder involving tissue invasion of the bone marrow, spleen and liver. Patients are prone to recurrent infections and often suffer from neutropenia, anemia, splenomegaly and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus.LGL leukemia can be divided into T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell LGL leukemia depending upon the type of cell that is affected. T-cell LGL (T-LGL) leukemia is characterized as a chronic leukemia where there is an expansion of CD3+ CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.

The prevalence of LGL leukemia has not yet been accurately established and it could be underdiagnosed, but it has been estimated to range from 2 to 5% of all chronic lymphoproliferative diseases in North America. In Western countries, LGL leukemia arising from T-cells is much more frequent (85%) than NK-cell disease (15%). T-LGL leukemia is diagnosed at a median age of 55–60 years and has an equal gender distribution. Only 20–25% of patients are younger than 50 years.

Our recent findings suggest that up to 40% of T-LGL patients harbor mutations in the STAT3 gene, whereas a smaller subset of patients present with mutations in the STAT5B gene. Although these findings emphasize the role of STAT family genes in the pathogenesis of LGL leukemia, the underlying genetic defects in the remaining T-LGL patients are yet to be discovered. In order to identify additional somatic mutations, we chose three STAT3 and STAT5 mutation-negative T-LGL leukemia patients for exome sequencing.

### Gammadelta T-cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia with spontaneous remission [^a28bcb93]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a clonal disorder with an indolent clinical course. In July 1995, a 46-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital because his anemia had progressed. He had a white blood cell count of 3.9 × 10⁹/L with 75% lymphocytes, which were intermediate to large and had almost round nuclei and azurophilic granules, and anemia with a red blood cell count (RBC) of 2.69 × 10¹²/L, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.5 g/dL, and hematocrit (Hct) of 28.3%. Electron microscopic examination showed that most of the lymphocytes had a parallel tubular array and dense core granules in their cytoplasm. Flow cytometry and Southern blotting of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) genes using the peripheral blood species showed monoclonal proliferation of LGLs with a CD3+, TCRgammadelta+, CD4-, CD8-, CD16+, CD56-, CD57-, HLA-DR+ phenotype, and a TCR gamma gene rearrangement, respectively, suggesting that the patient was diagnosed as having gammadelta T-cell LGL leukemia. He had no symptoms, organomegaly, or skin lesions. About 1.5 years after diagnosis, the anemia gradually improved with disappearance and appearance of a rearranged band in the TCR-gamma gene and TCR-beta gene, respectively. About 7 years after diagnosis, the anemia improved completely with a RBC of 5.01 × 10¹²/L, Hb of 14.8 g/dL, and Hct of 44.3%, and he was in complete remission without TCR-beta and -gamma gene rearrangements. He had received no therapy. This is the first report of spontaneous remission of gammadelta T-cell LGL leukemia.

### Latest advances in the diagnosis and treatment of large granular lymphocytic leukemia… [^7a142ddb]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte leukemia is an indolent lymphoproliferative disorder that belongs to mature T and natural killer cell neoplasms and is recognized as cytotoxic T and NK cell lymphomas and leukemia in the 2016 World Health Organization classification. 1Two subtypes of chronic LGL proliferation are described, T-LGL and NK-LGL, which account for more than 85% and 10% of cases, respectively. They share the same clinical and biologic pattern, and the recent discovery of the same genetic mutation hallmark unifies those entities. 5and the second, based on an American registry, found 0. 2 cases per 1 million individuals per year. 4 LGL leukemia is characterized by a clonal expansion of cytotoxic T or NK lymphocytes. Pathogenesis is still incompletely understood, but recent molecular discoveries involving the Stat3 activation pathway have improved comprehension of the disease.

6Currently, treatment is based on immunosuppressive therapies, which produce an unsatisfactory long-term response, making targeted therapies the next step to a curative approach. Serum protein electrophoresis usually shows polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia as a result of increased immunoglobulin G and/or immunoglobulin A subclasses. Hypogammaglobulinemia is seen in 5% to 10% of patients. Defects in downregulation of immunoglobulin secretion in LGL leukemia could partly explain the development of autoantibodies and clonal B-cell malignancies observed in this disease, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance being the most frequent. Cytology: What Do LGLs Look Like. Large granular lymphocyte are cytotoxic cells defined as: large size, an abundant cytoplasm containing typical azurophilic granules, and a reniform or round nucleus with mature chromatin. In physiologic conditions, such cells represent 5% to 10% of total lymphocytes, do not exceed 0.

25 G/L, and are mainly NK type. They contain cytotoxic equipment in their granulations and express apoptosis signal through their death receptor. The first step of diagnosis is based on the identification of increased numbers of circulating LGLs. Historically, the threshold of 2 × 10.

### Transient clonal expansion of T-large granular lymphocytes during primary cytomegalovirus infection [^643cb747]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Clonal immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements are useful in distinguishing reactive lymphoproliferations from neoplastic processes. Here, we report a case of transient clonal expansion of CD8+ CD57- T-large granular lymphocytes (T-LGL) during primary cytomegalovirus infection. This case underlines that clonal expansion of T-LGL could be a reactive phenomenon related to an acute infectious disease and is not specific for lymphoid malignancy.
