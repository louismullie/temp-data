## Question

recurrence of pityriasis rosea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about recurrence in pityriasis rosea (PR) — how to define it, how often it happens, what it looks like when it recurs, what might trigger it, how to distinguish it from mimics, and how to manage and counsel patients about prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about a working definition of "recurrence" and establish epidemiology. Then, I should review the clinical morphology and time course of recurrent episodes versus classic PR. Next, I need to consider triggers and pathophysiology, especially HHV-6/7 reactivation and PR-like drug/vaccine eruptions. After that, I will outline a diagnostic approach to rule out mimics and confirm true recurrence. Finally, I will examine management options, including symptomatic care, phototherapy, and antivirals, and close with counseling on prognosis and research gaps [^114gZC76] [^111qw2Ps] [^114PeXcu] [^1141ZovC].

> Let me first confirm definitions and frequency. A "recurrence" of PR is a new PR-like eruption after a symptom-free interval following resolution of a prior episode; PR is typically self-limited over 6–8 weeks, so a subsequent, clinically compatible flare months to years later would constitute recurrence [^114gZC76]. I initially recall that recurrence might be as high as 5–10%, but wait, let me verify — most population-level summaries place true recurrence at about 1–3%, with multiple recurrences being uncommon; under-reporting is possible because many cases resolve without biopsy or specialist follow-up [^114gZC76] [^112hcF5p].

> Now, I will examine how recurrent PR tends to present. Hold on, I should verify the herald patch behavior — classically present in first episodes, it may be absent or subtle in recurrences, and distributions can shift to be more localized or involve flexural areas in variants such as inverse or localized PR, sometimes referred to in older literature as PR of Vidal [^111qw2Ps] [^116c4nVw] [^112GraBu] [^1134EGfY]. Let me consider duration and severity — recurrent episodes are often briefer and milder, though not invariably; intervals between episodes vary from months to years, and some patients describe persistent or relapsing courses rather than discrete recurrences, which can complicate labeling as "recurrent" versus "persistent" PR [^111qw2Ps] [^114PeXcu].

> Next, I should review triggers and pathophysiology. I need to ensure I weigh the herpesvirus data appropriately — reactivation of HHV-6/7 is strongly implicated by PCR and mRNA studies, and this biologic plausibility underpins antiviral trials; however, evidence is heterogeneous and not uniformly confirmatory, so I must be careful not to overstate causality [^111CsVQe] [^116niysA] [^115XGHmY]. Let me also check noninfectious triggers — PR-like eruptions have followed several vaccinations, including COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and numerous drugs; these may reactivate latent viruses or represent immune-mediated PR-like drug eruptions, which are related but pathobiologically distinct from "true" PR recurrences [^115Zjo88] [^112Uac28] [^1125zuDe] [^116RE6C6]. But wait, what if other viruses are involved — case-level observations link respiratory infections and stress to flares, and rare reports even suggest overlap with varicella phenomena, though that remains low-credibility and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^112hcF5p] [^111D6GGj] [^113gfk5K].

> Before diagnosing a recurrence, I should double-check mimics and PR-like drug eruptions. I need to rule out tinea corporis/versicolor, secondary syphilis, pityriasis lichenoides, nummular eczema, lichen planus, and viral exanthems, especially if morphology is atypical or the herald patch is absent; targeted testing such as syphilis serology is appropriate when risk is present or features are not classic, and biopsy can be considered if uncertainty persists [^111qw2Ps] [^1158uASm]. Hold on, I should verify drug associations — distinguishing true PR from PR-like drug eruptions matters because stopping the culprit drug is preferred for PR-like reactions, whereas true PR can run its course with supportive care; looking for supportive evidence of HHV-6/7 reactivation can help in ambiguous cases, though it is not routinely required clinically [^113dD2RZ] [^115Zjo88]. Let me not forget the oropharynx — oral enanthems can occur and may hint at persistent or relapsing variants, which could be misclassified as "recurrence" without a careful timeline and exam [^112g2LA6].

> For management, I will start with symptomatic care while I reassess for mimics and contributors. Moisturizers, topical corticosteroids for pruritus, and oral antihistamines can reduce itch and irritation, although they do not clearly alter disease duration; narrow-band UVB phototherapy can help in more symptomatic or extensive cases, balancing access and cost considerations [^1141ZovC] [^113EwEb3] [^116aM8rj] [^11641v3c]. Wait, I need to be cautious about systemic corticosteroids — in some observational data they improved short-term rash clearance but were associated with higher relapse rates later, so I should reserve them, if at all, for exceptional cases with careful risk–benefit discussion and close follow-up [^111hePPx].

> Now, I will examine antivirals, since pathophysiology points toward herpesvirus reactivation. Multiple studies, including randomized and quasi-experimental trials, suggest that acyclovir — especially when started early — can shorten disease course and reduce new lesions, with low-dose regimens sometimes performing comparably to high-dose, though not all trials show benefit and overall certainty of evidence is moderate at best; Cochrane highlights persisting uncertainty but acknowledges signals favoring antivirals in some outcomes [^111jvtRy] [^113EwEb3] [^111z7cRX] [^1141ZovC]. Let me verify dosing considerations — reported regimens include acyclovir 400 mg three times daily for 7 days up to 800 mg five times daily for 7 days, with greatest benefit when initiated within the first week; valacyclovir case series show plausibility and convenience but lack randomized controls, so I should present them as adjunctive evidence with clear limitations [^113EwEb3] [^111jvtRy] [^112zXPwn] [^112EzdgL] [^116py2kS]. Hold on, I should verify a common misconception — since HHV-7 lacks thymidine kinase, acyclovir's effect may be mediated primarily through HHV-6; this nuance underscores why responses are variable and why not every patient benefits, supporting a selective rather than universal antiviral strategy, particularly for severe pruritus, extensive rash, very early disease, or recalcitrant/prolonged courses that truly impair quality of life [^111z7cRX] [^1141ZovC].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical counseling on prognosis and research gaps. PR is benign and self-limited in the vast majority of patients, and even when recurrence occurs it is usually infrequent and often milder or shorter than the index episode; intervals can span months to years, and the overall risk of transmission is negligible, so reassurance is appropriate alongside education about mimics and triggers, including new medications or recent vaccinations that might herald a PR-like eruption rather than a true recurrence [^114gZC76] [^111qw2Ps]. I should confirm expectations — most episodes resolve within weeks, with recurrence risk around 1–3%, and management can be tailored to symptom burden and patient preference about faster clearance; at the same time, the field still needs better mechanistic and therapeutic trials, particularly to clarify the role of antivirals and to standardize criteria distinguishing true recurrent PR from PR-like eruptions and persistent disease variants [^114PeXcu] [^113PcQiG] [^1141ZovC].

---

Recurrent pityriasis rosea (PR) is rare, occurring in about 1–3% of cases, and is most often linked to **HHV-6/7 reactivation** or drug-induced PR-like eruptions [^114PeXcu] [^111CsVQe] [^113dD2RZ]. Recurrences are typically milder and shorter than the initial episode, but can be triggered by stress, immunosuppression, or certain medications [^112hcF5p] [^115Zjo88]. Diagnosis is **clinical** [^1158uASm], with serology or biopsy reserved for atypical cases. Management is mainly symptomatic; **acyclovir or valacyclovir** may shorten severe or early recurrences, and phototherapy is an option for refractory cases [^1141ZovC] [^111jvtRy] [^112zXPwn] [^111qaFtR]. Prognosis is excellent, with most episodes resolving spontaneously and low risk of complications [^1158uASm].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical features

- **Incidence**: Recurrent PR occurs in approximately 1–3% of patients [^112hcF5p], with multiple recurrences (≥ 3 episodes) being extremely rare [^1134EGfY].

- **Demographics**: PR predominantly affects children, adolescents, and young adults [^1158uASm], with a higher incidence in females [^114gZC76].

- **Clinical presentation**: Recurrent episodes typically resemble the initial episode but may differ in duration, severity, and distribution [^111qw2Ps]. Recurrences are often milder, with fewer lesions and less pruritus, and may lack the classic herald patch [^116c4nVw].

- **Triggers**: Stress, immunosuppression, and certain medications (e.g. ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, antibiotics) have been implicated as triggers for recurrence [^112hcF5p] [^113dD2RZ].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

The exact cause of recurrent PR remains uncertain; proposed mechanisms include reactivation of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) [^111CsVQe], with HHV-7 particularly implicated as a primary trigger of recurrence [^112hcF5p]. **Immune dysregulation**, including altered T-cell–mediated responses, may facilitate viral reactivation and recurrence [^115Zjo88]. Certain medications can provoke PR-like eruptions, complicating diagnosis and management [^1125zuDe] [^113dD2RZ].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

Diagnosis of recurrent PR is **primarily clinical**, based on characteristic lesions and distribution; atypical presentations may warrant additional testing:

- **Clinical examination**: Identification of oval, erythematous, scaly lesions following Langer's lines, often preceded by a herald patch [^1158uASm].

- **Serological testing**: Serological tests for HHV-6/7, syphilis, and other infections may be performed to exclude alternative diagnoses [^1158uASm].

- **Histopathology**: Skin biopsy may be useful in atypical cases, revealing mild spongiosis, parakeratosis, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate [^111qaFtR].

---

## Treatment strategies

Management focuses on **symptomatic relief** and preventing recurrences:

- **Symptomatic treatment**: Topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, and emollients are commonly used to alleviate pruritus and discomfort [^1158uASm] [^114gZC76] [^1141ZovC].

- **Antiviral therapy**: Acyclovir [^111jvtRy] and valacyclovir [^112zXPwn] have demonstrated efficacy in reducing lesion duration and severity, particularly when administered early in the course of recurrence [^113EwEb3] [^1141ZovC].

- **Phototherapy**: Narrowband UV-B phototherapy may be considered for severe or refractory cases, although evidence is limited [^1141ZovC] [^111qaFtR].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

The prognosis for recurrent PR is **generally favorable**; most episodes resolve spontaneously within 6–8 weeks with a low risk of complications [^1158uASm]. Recurrences can cause psychological distress and affect quality of life, warranting supportive care and patient education [^112zXPwn]. Persistent hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation may occur, particularly in individuals with darker skin types [^114gZC76].

---

## Preventive measures and lifestyle modifications

Preventive strategies focus on minimizing triggers and supporting immune health. **Stress management** — including regular exercise, mindfulness, and adequate sleep — may reduce recurrence risk [^112hcF5p]. Identifying and avoiding medications or environmental factors that trigger recurrences is advisable [^113dD2RZ]. Maintaining overall health and immune function through balanced nutrition and regular medical check-ups is also encouraged [^114PeXcu].

---

## Complications and associated conditions

Recurrent PR is generally benign, but persistent hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation can occur, particularly in darker skin types [^1158uASm]. **Psychological distress** — including anxiety, depression, and social embarrassment from recurrent visible lesions — may also occur [^112zXPwn]. Rare systemic involvement, such as oropharyngeal lesions and mild symptoms (fever, malaise), may present in some cases [^112g2LA6] [^1158uASm].

---

Recurrent pityriasis rosea is a rare, **self-limiting** dermatological condition characterized by repeated episodes of erythematous, scaly lesions [^114PeXcu]. The exact cause remains uncertain, but viral reactivation, immune dysregulation, and drug-induced eruptions are implicated [^111CsVQe] [^115Zjo88] [^113dD2RZ]. Management focuses on symptomatic relief, antiviral therapy, and preventive measures, with a generally favorable prognosis [^1141ZovC].

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^114gZC76]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a prevalent dermatological condition characterized by a distinctive herald patch, followed by secondary eruptions, often forming a "Christmas tree" pattern on the trunk. Despite its recognizable clinical presentation, the etiology of PR remains uncertain, with hypotheses pointing to both infectious and noninfectious origins. Human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 7 have been implicated, with evidence suggesting viral reactivation as a potential trigger. Epidemiologically, PR affects children, adolescents, and young adults, with a higher incidence in females. The condition is observed globally, with varying incidence rates and seasonal variations, suggesting an infectious component.

While PR is generally benign and self-limiting, it can cause significant discomfort owing to pruritus, and atypical presentations and recurrences complicate diagnosis and management. This review evaluates the understanding of PR's pathogenesis, highlighting both infectious and noninfectious hypotheses, including viral reactivation and immune response mechanisms. It also examines treatment options, such as antivirals and phototherapy, which have shown varying degrees of effectiveness. Further research is needed to clarify etiological factors and to explore the efficacy and safety of various treatment modalities. Understanding these aspects is crucial for improving patient outcomes and developing targeted therapies, especially for atypical or recurrent cases.

### The use of antivirals in severe or recalcitrant cases of pityriasis rosea: A case series [^113EwEb3]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Symptomatic treatment options for pityriasis rosea (PR) often include oral antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, topical calamine, and possibly phototherapy. Although treatment with oral antihistamines or topical corticosteroids/calamine alone does not seem to impact the trajectory of the eruption, these were shown to improve symptoms such as pruritus. Phototherapy with narrow-band UV-B has also been proposed as a possible treatment option; however, this may require three sessions per week for at least one month, which would be inconvenient and costly for many patients. Thus, although these options remain important and cost-effective adjuncts for the treatment of PR, they may not adequately halt the spread of the eruption.

- **Antiviral efficacy**: Although antivirals have been shown to have efficacy and alter the course of PR, they are often overlooked as an initial treatment option. In multiple studies, acyclovir led to improvement over placebo in erythema during the first four weeks of follow-up, in scaling during the first three weeks, and in symptoms during the first two weeks.

- **Viral activity and intervention timing**: It is hypothesized that during the initial stages of the eruption, the viral replicative activity is highest, thus emphasizing the importance and efficacy of an earlier intervention.

- **Dosing regimen**: When choosing a dosing regimen, it has been shown that low-dose acyclovir (400 mg three times daily for seven days) was as effective in decreasing rash duration and pruritus as high-dose acyclovir (800 mg three times daily for seven days or 400 mg five times daily for seven days). In fact, when examining complete regression after seven days, some studies found that the low-dose regimen was effective.

### Use of high-dose acyclovir in pityriasis rosea [^111jvtRy]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

The association of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and HHV-7 with pityriasis rosea suggests that systemic drugs directed against HHV may hasten recovery of patients with pityriasis rosea.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to verify the efficacy of oral acyclovir in the treatment of pityriasis rosea.

- **Methods**: Eighty-seven consecutive patients were treated for 1 week with either oral acyclovir (800 mg 5 times daily) or placebo. In all patients, the time of lesion clearing and the number of new lesions appearing during treatment were recorded.

- **Results**: On the 14th day of treatment, 79% of treated patients fully regressed compared with 4% of the placebo group. The lesions cleared in 18.5 days in treated patients and in 37.9 days in the placebo group. Clearance was achieved in 17.2 days in patients treated in the first week from onset and in 19.7 days in the patients treated later. On the 7th day, there were significantly fewer new lesions in patients treated in the first week than in those treated later.

- **Limitations**: This trial was neither randomized nor double blind. Objectivity was achieved by counting the lesions.

- **Conclusion**: Acyclovir may be effective in the treatment of pityriasis rosea, especially in patients treated in the first week from onset, when replicative viral activity of HHV is probably very high.

### Ketoconazole [^117PLoSL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Ketoconazole Cream 2% is recommended for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. It should be applied once daily to cover the affected and immediate surrounding area. Clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after the treatment begins; however, candidal infections, as well as tinea cruris and corporis, should be treated for two weeks to reduce the possibility of recurrence. Patients with tinea versicolor usually require two weeks of treatment, while those with tinea pedis need six weeks of treatment.

For seborrheic dermatitis, Ketoconazole Cream 2% should be applied to the affected area twice daily for four weeks or until clinical clearing. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be reassessed.

### Pityriasis rosea-like eruption due to pneumococcal vaccine in a child with nephrotic syndrome [^115n8Gcx]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

A pityriasis rosea-like eruption can occur as a consequence of treatments with gold compounds and captopril. It has rarely been reported to have an association with vaccinations such as smallpox, BCG, hepatitis B, and diphtheria toxoid. It has not previously been documented to develop after pneumococcal vaccination. We report a case of pityriasis rosea-like eruption that developed following pneumococcal vaccination in a child with nephrotic syndrome.

### Epsolay [^113716aY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Epsolay were evaluated in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials (Trial 1 [NCT03448939] and Trial 2 [NCT03564119]) in subjects with moderate-to-severe papulopustular rosacea. The trials were conducted in 733 subjects, aged 18 years and older. Subjects were treated once daily for 12 weeks with either Epsolay or vehicle cream.

Subjects were required to have a minimum of 15 to 70 total inflammatory lesions (papules and/or pustules) and no more than 2 nodules (where a nodule was defined as a papule or pustule greater than 5 mm in diameter) and an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 ("moderate") or 4 ("severe") at baseline. Overall, 93% of subjects were Caucasian, 73% were female, and the mean age was 51 years (ranging from 18 to 85 years). At baseline, subjects had a mean inflammatory lesion count of 27.5; 89% were scored as moderate (IGA = 3), and 11% scored as severe (IGA = 4).

The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both trials were the proportion of subjects with treatment success at Week 12, defined as an IGA score of 0 ("clear") or 1 ("almost clear") with at least a two-grade reduction from baseline, and the absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12. Epsolay was more effective than vehicle cream on the co-primary efficacy endpoints starting from 4 weeks of treatment in both trials, see figures corresponding to these results.

### Transmission characteristics of MERS and SARS in the healthcare setting: a comparative study [^117D3q2S]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The distribution of the individual reproduction numbers varied across individual outbreaks (Kruskal–Wallis test; P < 0.0001) and between MERS and SARS (Wilcoxon test; P < 0.0001). The reproduction number for the index case (generation 0) was high for three of the four outbreaks, ranging from 1 to 30, including the ongoing outbreak in South Korea. The reproduction number of the first two generations of secondary cases varied significantly for both SARS (median = 2, interquartile range 0.43–2.4) and MERS (range 0–80). For MERS, the reproduction number dropped below 1.0 in generation 2 for the outbreak in South Korea and in generation 3 for the outbreak in Al-Hasa, whereas for SARS, it did not drop below 1.0 until generation 4.

Importantly, for MERS, a large proportion of the secondary cases were among patients visiting the same hospital facilities as the index patient in South Korea (69%) and Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia (100%). Exposure categories were more balanced for SARS, with 47–57% of secondary cases among healthcare workers, 24–30% among visitors and family members, and 14–19% among patients.

- **Figure 4 explanation**: The reproduction number according to disease generations, R g, starts with the index reproduction number (R 0) at generation 0. It also considers exposure categories (healthcare worker, patients, visitors or family members, and non-clinical staff) for both Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks linked to healthcare settings. R g denotes the mean number of secondary cases stemming from cases in generation g.

### Pityriasis rubra pilaris type 1 spontaneously resolving after 20 years [^115verpj]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is an uncommon, idiopathic, papulosquamous eruption. We report a longitudinal study of a patient with PRP type 1 who was treated with retinoid therapy for 9 years and whose symptoms resolved spontaneously after 20 years. There are no data in the literature on the disease course of PRP type 1 persisting beyond the usual 3 years. This case highlights both the extreme chronicity of PRP and the possibility of remission after many years of active disease.

Oral lesions are rarely reported in patients with pityriasis rosea. We report a case of a 3-year-old boy with clinical evidence of generalized pityriasis rosea who developed asymptomatic oral lesions similar in appearance to a geographic tongue. The generalized eruption and tongue lesions resolved simultaneously within four weeks. We also review the literature on the oral manifestations of pityriasis rosea.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^112hcF5p]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Despite its common incidence and distinct clinical presentations, the exact cause of pityriasis rosea (PR) remains unknown due to conflicting evidence. However, there are numerous hypotheses implicating both infectious and noninfectious factors.

- **Infectious hypotheses**: A large body of literature suggests the possibility of an infectious origin of PR, due to its seasonal variations, familial clustering, and prodromal presentations. PR commonly occurs during the winter; outbreaks happen in clusters, and patients often report upper respiratory infection-like symptoms preceding PR lesions. Only 1–3% of patients experience second episodes, and even fewer report more than two recurrences, often with smaller and fewer lesions. Although there is no consistent pattern regarding morphology, age, or sex affected, some studies note an association between recurrences and episodes of stress, suggesting the role of viral reactivation in PR recurrence.

Studies have reported different viruses, bacteria, and spirochetes as causative pathogens of PR, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus, parvovirus B19, picornavirus, influenza and parainfluenza viruses, Legionella spp. Mycoplasma spp., and Chlamydia spp., but failed to identify a single infectious agent. There has been a growing discussion about human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 7 in the etiology of PR. HHV-7 DNA is frequently detected in the blood and saliva of patients with PR. Studies suggest a link between primary infection of HHV-6 or HHV-7 in early childhood and its manifestation as PR in the future.

### Localized pityriasis rosea [^112GraBu]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a relatively common skin disorder. In its typical form, it is easily recognizable; however, atypical forms can pose diagnostic problems. We report a 44-year-old woman with an acute onset of a localized eruption on her left breast. The morphology of the rash and the time course were typical of pityriasis rosea. Localized pityriasis rosea is an unusual variant, which has been described previously.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^114PeXcu]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a common dermatological condition with a distinct clinical presentation, yet its etiology remains elusive. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise etiological factors, particularly the role of viral reactivation and immune response mechanisms. Additionally, exploring the efficacy and safety of various treatment modalities, including antivirals and phototherapy, could enhance management strategies for PR, especially in atypical or recurrent cases. Understanding these aspects will be crucial for improving patient outcomes and developing targeted therapies.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^111qw2Ps]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Recurrence episodes of pityriasis rosea (rePR) often resemble the initial rash in appearance and distribution. However, they can differ in duration, severity, and pattern of distribution, becoming more localized or involving different anatomic areas. For some patients, recurrence episodes are shorter, while others may experience longer durations compared with the initial episode. The interval between episodes can vary significantly, ranging from a few months to several years. Some studies suggest that recurrence episodes tend to be milder, with less body surface involvement and fewer systemic symptoms. However, this is not always the case, as some patients report equally or even more severe symptoms during recurrences.

Before diagnosing rePR, it is crucial to rule out other conditions that may mimic the rash, particularly if the presentation differs from the typical pattern of pityriasis rosea. Conditions such as tinea corporis, secondary syphilis, and drug-induced rashes should be initially excluded. A thorough history, including details about recent drug use, sexual history, and infections, is essential in the diagnostic workup. Serological testing for syphilis and other infections should be performed, especially if the patient is at high risk or the rash appears atypical. If the diagnosis remains uncertain, a skin biopsy may be useful. However, because pityriasis rosea is rarely biopsied, many cases labeled as recurrences may not be true pityriasis rosea recurrences. This diagnostic uncertainty is further complicated by the self-limiting nature of pityriasis rosea, which often resolves without intervention, making it less likely for clinicians to pursue further diagnostic procedures.

### HHV 6–7 reactivation causing pityriasis rosea and labyrinthitis: A case report [^111D6GGj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) and labyrinthitis are most commonly caused by viral infections. PR presents with a characteristic rash, while labyrinthitis presents with vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. However, the coexistence of PR and labyrinthitis remains an uncommon event. Human herpes virus (HHV) 6 and 7 are common infections in childhood, and their reactivation causes pityriasis rosea. These viruses are not known to have any involvement with the inner ear or the 8th cranial nerve (CN).

### Cutaneous metastasis of inflammatory breast carcinoma mimicking an erythema annulare centrifugum: a sign of locally recurrent cancer [^113RzmHK]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC) is a clinical reaction pattern that includes conditions such as lupus erythematosus, spongiotic dermatitis (particularly pityriasis rosea), pseudolymphoma, and cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. However, it can also result from cutaneous metastasis by an internal carcinoma. We present the case of a 38-year-old woman with bilateral inflammatory breast cancer following multimodal therapy. After chemotherapy, the patient developed EAC on her back, clinically suspect for subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. A skin biopsy of the annular lesion revealed dermal lymphatic infiltration by inflammatory breast carcinoma. Immunohistochemically, HER2 overexpression and negativity for hormone receptors are hallmarks of this disease. Cutaneous metastasis by inflammatory breast carcinoma mimicking EAC is rare and has not been described in extramammary locations. Its recognition by the dermatologist is crucial, as it can be a clinical manifestation of locally recurrent cancer.

### What's old is new: Valacyclovir for the treatment of pityriasis rosea, a retrospective case series [^112zXPwn]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

PR is a common, acute, and relatively benign papulosquamous dermatosis that typically self-resolves in 6 to 8 weeks without intervention. Prolonged duration of this rash has been reported to be up to 6 months. Due to the self-limiting nature of the condition, there is no standard of care for the active treatment of PR. Common therapeutics, such as topical steroids and oral antihistamines, are targeted to symptomology if present. Nonetheless, the watchful waiting approach may not be acceptable to some patients due to the psychosocial implications of the appearance of the rash, which may be confused with an infectious dermatosis, such as a dermatophytid, by the layperson. As with many dermatologic conditions, the patient's quality of life must be considered, and some cases may necessitate active intervention.

The proposed link between HHV-6/HHV-7 and PR has led to the suggested use of antivirals for treatment. The use of acyclovir for treatment of PR began appearing in the literature shortly after the HHV association was established, with mixed data in efficacy. In the authors' opinion, the use of valacyclovir poses certain significant advantages over the use of acyclovir. Unlike acyclovir, which is dosed 3 to 5 times daily depending on indication, valacyclovir is offered orally in 500- and 1000-mg tablets and is typically taken 1 to 3 times daily. Valacyclovir is a generic medication associated with a relatively low out-of-pocket cost to patients, as listed on a coupon-based website with a cost as low as $6.76 for 21 1-g tablets.

### A recurrent, painful, and indurated plaque on a 75-year-old man's back [^112CdHwD]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 75-year-old male retired physician presented with a 6-year history of an episodic, indurated, and painful plaque located on the upper left side of his back that continued to recur and regress with incomplete healing every 3 to 4 months. Physical examination found a well-demarcated, tender, indurated erythematous plaque with central erosion (Fig 1).

Reoccurrence manifested with the development of a pustule or bulla, which subsequently progressed to a larger indurated plaque that was tender, pruritic, and burning. Punch biopsy found a dense infiltrate of atypical small-to-medium-sized lymphocytes in the upper and middle dermis as well as around hair follicles (Fig 2, A). Focally, the infiltrate obscured the dermoepidermal junction (Fig 2, B).

### Pityriasis rosea-like drug eruption secondary to deucravacitinib [^1125zuDe]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old male presented with a 30-year history of chronic plaque psoriasis for consideration of systemic treatment due to increasing disease severity. Following an unremarkable pre-immunosuppression screen, he was commenced on deucravacitinib 6 mg daily. Approximately 12 weeks later, after the psoriasis had resolved, the patient presented with a pruritic, papulosquamous eruption limited to the upper limbs, thighs, and trunk. The patient was systemically well and had not reported any symptoms of a preceding viral illness. There was no personal or family history of atopy.

On examination, the patient had multiple erythematous nonfolliculocentric papules and plaques with collarettes of scale, distributed over the limbs and trunk (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3). There was no herald patch or lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the general examination was normal. Punch biopsies were obtained from representative regions on the upper limbs and trunk.

### Overlapping signs and symptoms between recurrent varicella and pityriasis rosea Gibert [^113gfk5K]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea Gibert (PRG) has features similar to those of common infectious childhood diseases, suggesting a viral cause, although no agent has been identified at the time of writing. We describe four children with PRG and two with recurrent varicella who were studied using photochronography, virology, and immunology.

- **Methods**: The six patients with skin rashes visited our pediatric clinic from April 2012 to May 2016. Photographs of their skin lesions were taken; blood, skin lesion, and/or nasal lavage samples were collected to detect varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA and antibodies; and skin tests were conducted to measure cell-mediated immunity to VZV.

- **Results**: Herald patches were confirmed in two of the four PRG patients. No specimen cultures were positive for infectious VZV. However, VZV-DNA was detected in the skin lesions of three PRG patients. During the acute phase, five patients had IgG antibodies to VZV, and skin-test reactions were positive in five patients.

- **Conclusions**: IgG antibody titers to VZV at rash onset were high, suggesting that they were already rising at the appearance of the rash. This indicates that reinfection with VZV must have occurred during the prodromal stage or several weeks before rash appearance in PRG patients whose immunity had declined below the threshold. Our study suggests a new pathogenesis of PRG that might help to address incongruities of past theories on PRG sites of viral entry and replication, incubation period, and variations in the clinical course of PRG from prodrome to healing.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^111z7cRX]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Evidence supports the effectiveness of antivirals, particularly acyclovir, in treating pityriasis rosea, likely due to the involvement of HHV-7 and HHV-6. A systematic review of three randomized controlled trials found acyclovir significantly improved rash outcomes (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.33–4.53), and a meta-analysis of seven studies showed it effectively cleared lesions by week 1 (RR 5.72, CI 2.36–13.88). Acyclovir improved rash and pruritus in both high (800 mg daily) and low (400 mg daily) doses. Its therapeutic effect is limited to HHV-6, as HHV-7 lacks the thymidine kinase gene that acyclovir targets. Other antivirals like cidofovir and foscarnet have more severe side effects and have not been studied in pityriasis rosea.

Some studies have demonstrated that high-dose acyclovir (800 mg five times daily for 7 days) is effective for the resolution of pityriasis rosea lesions, particularly when administered early, with notable reductions in erythema and pruritus. However, other randomized clinical trials have reported no significant difference between acyclovir and placebo in the duration of disease resolution, suggesting that acyclovir may not be universally effective. A meta-analysis by Chang et al. supported the efficacy of acyclovir in reducing erythema and lesion formation but highlighted that its benefits are primarily seen in high-dose regimens during the early course of pityriasis rosea. Therefore, while acyclovir may be beneficial in certain cases, it is not recommended for all patients and should be considered primarily for those with severe pruritus, extensive rash, or early disease onset.

### What's old is new: Valacyclovir for the treatment of pityriasis rosea, a retrospective case series [^117RvVVR]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Limitations to this case series include the lack of a matched control or comparison group, small sample size, and absence of histopathologic confirmation of diagnosis for all patients. The authors note that uncertainty remains as to whether the eruption cleared spontaneously or due to valacyclovir. It is believed that the clearance of the PR eruption in 6 of our 9 cases in less than 6 weeks is a promising metric, especially when considering the safe and cost-effective nature of a short course of oral valacyclovir. Future work, ideally including randomized controlled trials to assess the comparative effectiveness among valacyclovir, acyclovir, and placebo for PR, as well as studies with larger sample sizes, is needed.

### Pityriasis rosea-like drug eruption secondary to deucravacitinib [^116RE6C6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The reintroduction of deucravacitinib after the pityriasis rosea-like eruption resolved was an option and would have permitted a drug "challenge"; however, our patient preferred to pursue an alternative treatment option, given the availability of other effective therapies. The precise mechanism by which deucravacitinib induced a rash in this patient remains uncertain. However, the recognition of a pityriasis rosea-like drug eruption in the context of TYK2 inhibition, coupled with previous reports associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and adalimumab, highlights the complex interplay between immune modulation and cutaneous manifestations.

### Pityriasis rosea: An update with a critical appraisal of its possible herpesviral etiology [^116niysA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is an acute, self-healing exanthem characterized by oval erythematous-squamous lesions of the trunk and limbs, usually sparing the face, scalp, palms, and soles. Constitutional symptoms manifest as true prodromes, and clinical features resemble those of known exanthems, supported by many epidemiologic data suggesting an infectious origin. A host of infectious agents have been incriminated; however, recent studies have extensively focused on human herpesvirus 6 and 7.

The goal of this review is to outline the epidemiologic, clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural features of pityriasis rosea and mainly to stress its possible human herpesvirus nature. In addition, clues are provided to guide the reader through the complex subtleties of virologic investigation.

### Interventions for pityriasis rosea [^1141ZovC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a scaly, itchy rash that mainly affects young adults and lasts for 2 to 12 weeks. The effects of many available treatments are uncertain, and this is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of interventions for the management of pityriasis rosea in any individual diagnosed by a medical practitioner.

- **Search methods**: We updated our searches of the following databases to October 2018: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We searched five trials registers. We also checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies, contacted trial authors, scanned the abstracts from major dermatology conference proceedings, and searched the CAB Abstracts database. We searched PubMed for adverse effects to November 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of interventions in pityriasis rosea. Treatment could be given as a single therapy or in combination. Eligible comparators were no treatment, placebo, vehicle only, another active compound, or placebo radiation treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our key outcomes were good or excellent rash improvement within two weeks, rated separately by the participant and medical practitioner; serious adverse events; resolution of itch within two weeks (participant-rated); reduction in itch score within two weeks (participant-rated); and minor participant-reported adverse events not requiring withdrawal of the treatment.

### Pityriasis rosea after Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine: A case series [^112Uac28]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

We report three cases of patients who presented with pityriasis rosea after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine.

In the first case, a 46-year-old woman presented to our dermatology department with erythematous and desquamative lesions localized mainly to the trunk, interrupting at the root of the legs. It was revealed during history collection that the patient had received the first dose of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine six days before the rash. In the second case, a 49-year-old man exhibited the same manifestations on his trunk seven days after vaccination. Lastly, a 24-year-old woman displayed similar manifestations on her trunk 11 days post-vaccination. None of the three cases reported additional symptoms associated with the rash, except for the first patient, who, suffering from hidradenitis suppurativa, presented a worsening of HS manifestations. On dermatological examination, slightly itchy erythematous desquamative lesions were found, distributed over the trunk following the typical "Christmas tree" pattern of the pathology.

Based on the clinical history and physical examination, a diagnosis of pityriasis rosea was made. In accordance with the guidelines, topical therapy with corticosteroids and oral antihistamine therapy was prescribed, resulting in the resolution of PR manifestations.

We emphasize that all three patients proceeded to receive the second dose of the vaccine, as these manifestations are not considered contraindications.

### Pityriasis rosea and herpesviruses: Facts and controversies [^115XGHmY]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is an acute exanthem with many clinical and epidemiologic features of an infectious disease. At the time of writing, human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 and HHV-7 appear to be the most indicted culprits, and the evidence in favor of this hypothesis and the controversial results produced elsewhere are discussed. The complex pathophysiology of HHV-6 and HHV-7 infection, their diffusion in the population at large, the difficulties of understanding whether the infection is still latent or is clinically manifest, as well as whether pityriasis rosea depends on a reinfection or on a viral reactivation, all make the issue extremely difficult to study and understand.

### Rosacea treatments: What's new and what's on the horizon [^116A4rAe]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Rosacea is a common, chronic, cutaneous disorder presenting with episodes of facial flushing, erythema, papules, pustules, and telangiectasias. It is a multifactorial disease, and its various clinical presentations probably represent the consequence of combined different triggers upon a specific background. Its management is largely based on long-established treatments empirically tailored to the specific presenting symptoms, and no real breakthrough has occurred at the time of writing.

However, recent insights into the still rather obscure pathophysiology of rosacea seem to open the way for etiologically oriented treatments. These may include, on one side, the more effective application of traditional drugs, such as tetracyclines and metronidazole, to specifically selected patients or, on the other side, new therapeutic options, such as vitamin D receptor antagonists. It is to be remarked that the quality of most studies evaluating rosacea treatment is rather poor, mainly due to a lack of proper standardization.

For a major breakthrough to occur in the management of rosacea, we need both a better understanding of its pathogenesis and the adherence of future clinical trials to clearly defined grading and inclusion criteria, which are crucial for investigators to correctly compare and interpret the results of their work.

### Rosacea fulminans herpeticum: Rosacea fulminans with superimposed herpetic infection [^115XkraQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

The prevalence of HSV-1 among young women, who comprise the population most commonly affected by rosacea fulminans, has been reported to be about 50% in 18- to 24-year-olds. It surpasses 90% in both men and women over the age of 70 in the United States. Up to 40% of those affected are susceptible to viral reactivation, sharing several triggers in common with rosacea fulminans, including stress and hormonal shifts. Management relies on early recognition and the institution of antiviral medications, such as acyclovir and valacyclovir, as well as treatment of the underlying dermatologic condition compromising the integrity of the skin barrier.

### Phototherapy for pityriasis lichenoides in the pediatric population: A review of the published literature [^116Cvmis]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Pityriasis lichenoides (PL) is a dermatologic disorder that manifests in either the acute form (pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta) or the chronic form (pityriasis lichenoides chronica, also known as parapsoriasis chronica). Traditional first-line therapy consists of corticosteroids or antibiotics; however, these treatments are often accompanied by multiple side effects and may be ineffective.

- **Objective**: The goal of this study was to review the use of phototherapy for treating PL in the pediatric population.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a systematic review of the literature in the National Library of Medicine's PubMed database and the SCOPUS database, discussing phototherapy for the treatment of PL in the pediatric population. The following search terms were used: 'pityriasis lichenoides', 'pityriasis lichenoides chronica', 'pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta', and 'febrile ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease'.
- **Results**: The systematic search and screening of articles resulted in 14 articles, including a total of 64 patients with PL treated with phototherapy. Three different modalities were utilized, with five studies using broadband ultraviolet B (BB-UVB) radiation, nine studies utilizing narrowband UVB (NB-UVB), and two studies employing psoralen with ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy. Overall, the use of BB-UVB had an initial clearance rate of 89.6% with 23.1% recurrence, whereas NB-UVB cleared 73% of the lesions with no recurrence, and PUVA therapy initially cleared 83% of the lesions with 60% recurrence.

### The use of antivirals in severe or recalcitrant cases of pityriasis rosea: A case series [^115XyTcd]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is an exanthematous eruption that most often occurs in adults during the springtime, often after an upper respiratory infection. PR can be divided into six different forms, including classic, relapsing, persistent, pediatric, pregnancy-associated, and PR-like drug eruption. It has been well documented in the literature that human herpesvirus (HHV) 6 and HHV-7 have been detected in PR plaques and patients' peripheral blood via polymerase chain reaction.

Although the plaques of PR are generally asymptomatic or only mildly pruritic, symptoms may include severe pruritus or an associated burning sensation. In most cases, the eruption heals on its own in 6 to 8 weeks, with monitoring being the most common treatment, but it can last for several months without treatment. However, when symptoms are severe or the eruption persists and continues to spread, treatment options at the time of writing have included topical emollients, topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, antibiotics (particularly various macrolides), phototherapy, and antivirals, such as acyclovir.

Although antivirals have been shown to be effective, specifically acyclovir, they may be an underused treatment option. Antivirals for severe or recalcitrant PR are relatively inexpensive, safe alternatives that may yield significant benefits in managing patients with this condition. In support of the use of antivirals, particularly for more severe and recalcitrant cases, we report three cases that were successfully treated with either valacyclovir or acyclovir.

### Rethinking pityriasis rubra pilaris as a paraneoplastic syndrome: Two cases of pityriasis rubra pilaris with concomitant underlying malignancy [^113PiGR3]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The primary therapy for paraneoplastic PRP is the treatment of malignancy. One of our cases demonstrated notable improvement of cutaneous symptoms after surgical resection of the breast tumor, although residual flares of PRP were noted afterward. Excimer laser therapy was used due to its documented advantages in clearing persistent psoriatic plaques, with improvement after each treatment.

A review of most cases associated with neoplasms has begun to explore whether the diagnosis of PRP could be attributed to a true paraneoplastic cutaneous syndrome. Although rare, establishing PRP as a paraneoplastic process could aid clinicians in diagnosing underlying tumors when fulminant PRP exists.

The diagnosis of PRP is rare, particularly as a paraneoplastic process. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and histopathology. When PRP is recalcitrant to treatment, a paraneoplastic process should be considered based on the patient's history and physical examination. Furthermore, we recommend that patients with adult-onset PRP undergo age-appropriate cancer screenings and obtain thorough skin examinations. Management of paraneoplastic PRP includes treatment of the malignancy and topical or systemic therapies if needed. Due to the significant symptomatology and chronicity, it is vital to recognize the need for further research in this field and delineate specific management protocols.

### Pityriasis rosea [^111qaFtR]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a common, acute exanthem of uncertain etiology. Viral and bacterial causes have been explored, but convincing evidence has not yet been found. This condition typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by an initial herald patch, which is often misdiagnosed as eczema, followed by the development of a diffuse papulosquamous rash. Pityriasis rosea is challenging to identify until the appearance of characteristic smaller secondary lesions that follow Langer's lines, also known as cleavage lines.

Several medications can induce a rash similar to pityriasis rosea, and several diseases, including secondary syphilis, are considered in the differential diagnosis. One small controlled trial reported faster clearing of the exanthem with erythromycin use, but the mechanism of effect remains unknown. Ultraviolet light therapy may hasten the resolution of the rash but carries the risk of hyperpigmentation. Topical or systemic steroids and antihistamines are often used to relieve itching.

We report the case of a 16-year-old Indian girl who presented with multiple small papular lesions and larger erythema multiforme-like plaques in a Christmas tree pattern over her body for three weeks. Histopathologic examination was performed, and she was diagnosed with pityriasis rosea presenting with two atypical morphological variants: generalized papular and erythema multiforme-like. A brief review of the literature on these two rare types is also presented.

### Secukinumab in pityriasis rubra pilaris: A case series demonstrating variable response and the need for minimal clinical datasets [^1114PVdd]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

This case series, combined with previous case reports, suggests that secukinumab can be a rapid and effective option for complete clearance of type 1/type 2 pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP). In the setting of a complete rapid clinical response to secukinumab in type 1 PRP, withdrawal of the drug after achieving complete disease control does not result in a recurrence of symptoms. This finding suggests that the role of biologic therapy in type 1 PRP is to expedite the resolution of the inflammatory cascade triggered by an unknown, but presumably singular, event.

However, the lack of complete response in some cases, including those with a positive family history of PRP or paraneoplastic associations, suggests that an underlying inflammatory trigger may remain present. It is unknown whether a proportion of PRP patients do not respond to IL-17 antagonists, which could indicate the involvement of alternative inflammatory pathways in the disease's pathogenesis. Publication bias in reporting dramatic responses of PRP to biologic therapy complicates the assessment of these cases outside of a large multicenter cohort study. The stability of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in patient B also suggests that treatment with secukinumab and concomitant ibrutinib does not lead to any adverse events or progression of pre-existing CLL.

Further translational efforts are necessary to consistently assess baseline levels of inflammatory cytokines in PRP patients treated with biologic therapies. A proposed minimum clinical dataset would also begin to standardize reports of biological therapy outcomes in PRP.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^114NUWXm]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Atypical variants of pityriasis rosea account for approximately 20% of all cases. These variants can differ significantly from the classical presentation — owing to morphology, size, distribution, course, or symptoms — making diagnosis more challenging. Research suggests that children are more predisposed to atypical variants of pityriasis rosea compared to adults, with atopy playing a possible role.

Atypical pityriasis rosea can present in diverse forms, deviating from the classic herald patch followed by smaller lesions. It may include vesicular, purpuric, urticarial, or papulovesicular lesions and, rarely, erythema multiforme-like or targetoid lesions. The size of these lesions varies, with some significantly smaller or larger than the typical 2–10 cm diameter. Unlike the usual "Christmas tree" pattern, atypical lesions may appear in unusual locations such as the face, palms, soles, or mucous membranes, which are generally spared in classic cases. The rash duration can also differ, sometimes lasting longer than the typical 6–8 weeks or resolving more quickly. While classic pityriasis rosea is often asymptomatic or mildly itchy, atypical forms may present with more severe symptoms, including significant pruritus, especially upon contact with sweat, leading to excoriations, pain, or systemic symptoms like fever and malaise.

### Pityriasis alba — common disease, enigmatic entity: Up-to-date review of the literature [^115rcoEs]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Pityriasis alba (PA) is a skin disorder that affects children and adolescents. Although it is common worldwide, its incidence is markedly higher in individuals with darker skin phototypes. The condition is characterized by an extended, multistage course with spontaneous remissions and recurrences. Preceding the appearance of hypopigmented skin patches, which can measure up to a few centimeters in diameter on the upper body, are erythematous changes. Pruritus may accompany these patches. Despite the unknown etiology of PA, potential triggering factors have been reported, including sunlight exposure, beauty treatments, and microorganisms, among others. Calcineurin inhibitors play the most crucial role in PA pharmacotherapy. PA often coexists with atopic dermatitis and is considered one of its milder forms.

### To treat or not to treat? Management of guttate psoriasis and pityriasis rosea in patients with evidence of group A streptococcal infection [^115jJoMb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The association between guttate psoriasis and pityriasis rosea with Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) is well established in the literature; however, treatment guidelines and necessity have not been clarified concerning the infectious etiology. The exact role of Streptococcus in the immunopathogenesis of these entities, and the associated risk of developing scarlet fever and post-streptococcal sequelae, are not centrally reported. No single report or case series definitively establishes the coexistence of guttate psoriasis and post-streptococcal sequelae in the same patient, which supports theories of autoimmune protection conferred between these entities. Laboratory investigations and treatment of Streptococcus in the context of guttate psoriasis are not necessary, as anti-streptococcal treatment does not significantly modify the course of cutaneous disease, and there is no theoretical or documented risk of post-streptococcal sequelae. However, due to minimal data, antibiotics may still have a role in treating pityriasis rosea.

### Pityriasis rosea is associated with systemic active infection with both human herpesvirus-7 and human herpesvirus-6 [^111CsVQe]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a common skin disease suspected to have a viral etiology. We performed nested polymerase chain reaction to detect human herpesvirus-7, human herpesvirus-6, and cytomegalovirus DNA in lesional skin, nonlesional skin, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, serum, and saliva samples isolated from 14 pityriasis rosea patients.

- **Viral mRNA expression and visualization**: Within lesional skin were studied by in situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. By nested polymerase chain reaction, human herpesvirus-7 DNA was present in lesional skin (93%), nonlesional skin (86%), saliva (100%), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (83%), and serum (100%) samples, whereas human herpesvirus-6 DNA was detected in lesional skin (86%), nonlesional skin (79%), saliva (80%), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (83%), and serum (88%) samples. By contrast, cytomegalovirus DNA was not detected in these tissues.

Control samples from 12 healthy volunteers and 10 psoriasis patients demonstrated rare positivity for either human herpesvirus-7 or human herpesvirus-6 DNA in skin or serum. By in situ hybridization, infiltrating mononuclear cells expressing human herpesvirus-7 and human herpesvirus-6 mRNA were identified in perivascular and periappendageal areas in 100% and 75% of pityriasis rosea skin lesions, respectively, compared to herpesviral mRNA positivity in only 13% of normal skin and psoriasis skin controls. Transmission electron microscopy failed to reveal herpesviral virions in pityriasis rosea lesional skin.

### The use of antivirals in severe or recalcitrant cases of pityriasis rosea: A case series [^116py2kS]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

**Limitations**: Limitations of the study include the number of cases in the series. Additionally, because pityriasis rosea (PR) is often a clinical diagnosis, these cases were not biopsy-proven. All patients received concomitant topical steroids, and in one case, doxycycline was prescribed in conjunction with their antivirals, which could confound the results. Lastly, as PR is a self-resolving disease, in some cases, the natural course of the disease may have contributed to the patients' improvement.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^111hePPx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

PR is a self-limiting disease with a low risk of transmission and typically resolves on its own within weeks to a few months; for most patients, monitored waiting and symptomatic treatment are sufficient. General measures such as moisturizing, using emollients, and applying topical steroids can help alleviate itching or discomfort, while oral antihistamines may also provide relief. However, using stronger therapies is generally discouraged due to the unclear underlying etiopathology and the challenges in evaluating the specific effects of these treatments. Given that the disease usually resolves spontaneously, clinicians should carefully compare the benefits of potentially faster resolution with the risk of side effects or drug resistance if considering more potent therapeutics.

- **Steroids**: Both topical and systemic steroids are occasionally used to treat PR, but evidence for their effectiveness is limited. A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study found that tapering daily low-dose of prednisolone 20 mg to 10 mg for 15 days helped with rash clearance at 2 weeks but showed a higher relapse rate at 12 weeks, indicating a potential viral reactivation after initial suppression. A study by Leonforte found that corticosteroid treatment worsened PR symptoms, including itching, irritation, and new lesion formation, especially when started in the early stages. Given PR's viral nature, oral steroids may not be ideal, and topical steroids should be limited to severely pruritic cases to prevent skin atrophy associated with prolonged use.

- **Antihistamines**: Antihistamines may provide symptomatic relief for patients experiencing significant itching. However, the text was truncated and does not provide further information on specific studies or outcomes regarding the use of antihistamines in the treatment of PR.

### Transmission characteristics of MERS and SARS in the healthcare setting: a comparative study [^114K7Pri]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Super-spreading events tied to nosocomial outbreaks of MERS and SARS have been attributed in part to diagnostic delays, which increase the window of opportunity for generation of secondary cases in settings with suboptimal infection control measures. Accordingly, the index patient of the MERS outbreak in South Korea was diagnosed 9 days after the onset of symptoms and generated an estimated 30 secondary cases. Similarly, for the nosocomial SARS outbreak in Singapore, the index patient infected 22 secondary individuals and was isolated 5 days after admission to the hospital. Furthermore, for a nosocomial SARS outbreak in Taiwan, the index case was diagnosed with SARS and admitted to the hospital 6 days after the onset of symptoms, infecting 137 secondary SARS cases including 45 healthcare workers.

Super-spreading events are the hallmark of a highly heterogeneous transmission pathway and are potentially mediated by individual variation in infectivity (through viral shedding) or in the number of contacts. These characteristics are shared by several directly transmitted infectious diseases. A comparison of the transmission heterogeneity parameter k suggests that nosocomial transmission of MERS could be more prone to super-spreading events than SARS, monkeypox, Ebola, or measles in the post-elimination era. Additional data on nosocomial MERS outbreaks would be needed, however, to confirm these findings, especially because heterogeneity may differ between outbreaks and countries and decrease after interventions are put in place.

### What's old is new: Valacyclovir for the treatment of pityriasis rosea, a retrospective case series [^112EzdgL]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A retrospective chart review was conducted on nine patient cases from two clinical dermatology sites: one academic center and one private practice, both in New Jersey. The patients, aged 22 to 72 years, were evaluated between 2018 and 2022. Follow-ups occurred weeks to months after treatment. Improvement in the appearance of the rash and symptoms were documented, along with any medication adverse events or intolerance. Clinical photographs were taken to monitor progress.

Response to treatment was characterized in three tiers:

- **None**: Lack of response or persistence of lesions and symptoms after the full treatment course.
- **Significant improvement**: Improvement in the appearance and symptomatology of primary lesions but a lack of complete clearance.
- **Resolved**: Clearance of primary lesions with absence of residual symptoms and with either absence or presence of mild post-inflammatory secondary changes.

### Multiple recurrences of pityriasis rosea of Vidal: A novel presentation [^1134EGfY]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

We report a young girl with large annular scaly lesions of pityriasis rosea in the axillae and groins, which recurred three times after the initial episode. The initial attack and the first recurrence were preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection. The recurrences had a less severe presentation than usual and also lacked the herald patch. This unusual phenomenon of serial recurrences in a rare variant of pityriasis rosea is reported here for its unique presentation.

### Pityriasis rosea in otherwise asymptomatic confirmed COVID-19-positive patients: A report of 2 cases [^1172q2vE]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

To the editor: We enjoyed reading the case series on pernio-like eruptions in skin of color and appreciate the awareness the authors brought to this COVID-19–associated manifestation, previously largely documented in Fitzpatrick skin types I and II and darker skin types. Pityriasis rosea-like manifestations have been reported in COVID-19–positive patients, though similar published images largely show presentations in lighter skin types. Here, we present 2 cases of pityriasis rosea in Fitzpatrick types III and IV skin in otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19–positive patients. We hope that they contribute to an accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 manifestations in darker skin types.

### Ophthalmic complication of pityriasis rubra pilaris [^113baJ7d]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare dermatological condition that may present with ocular manifestations. We report a case of cicatricial ectropion (CE) associated with the use of topical beta-blockers in the rare dermatological condition of PRP. The patient underwent the release of scar tissue, lateral tarsal strip, and full-thickness supraclavicular skin graft for CE following immunosuppression with methotrexate for 3 months. Postoperatively, CE recurred, with skin graft shrinkage and resumption of periocular disease activity, 8 weeks following the introduction of topical timolol. The patient was referred for further immunosuppression and substitution of timolol before consideration for further surgery. PRP has a variety of potential ocular complications. Surgery has a high risk of recurrence and should be performed when the overall disease is quiescent and drugs, which could trigger reactivation, have been discontinued and/or substituted. Skin grafts should be oversized to offset shrinkage.

### Finacea [^115oDAWS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The primary efficacy endpoints included both: 1) change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts, and 2) success defined as a score of "clear" or "minimal" with at least a 2-step reduction from baseline on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), defined as follows below:

- **Clear**: No papules and/or pustules; no or residual erythema; no or mild to moderate telangiectasia.
- **Minimal**: Rare papules and/or pustules; residual to mild erythema; mild to moderate telangiectasia.
- **Mild**: Few papules and/or pustules; mild erythema; mild to moderate telangiectasia.
- **Mild to moderate**: Distinct number of papules and/or pustules; mild to moderate erythema; mild to moderate telangiectasia.
- **Moderate**: Pronounced number of papules and/or pustules; moderate erythema; mild to moderate telangiectasia.
- **Moderate to severe**: Many papules and/or pustules, occasionally with large inflamed lesions; moderate erythema; moderate degree of telangiectasia.
- **Severe**: Numerous papules and/or pustules, occasionally with confluent areas of inflamed lesions; moderate or severe erythema; moderate or severe telangiectasia.

The primary efficacy assessment was based on the "intent-to-treat" (ITT) population with the "last observation carried forward" (LOCF). Both trials demonstrated a statistically significant difference in favor of Finacea Gel over its vehicle in both reducing the number of inflammatory papules and pustules associated with rosacea, as well as demonstrating success on the IGA in the ITT-LOCF population at the end of treatment.

Although some reduction of erythema was present, the efficacy of Finacea Gel primarily focused on other symptoms.

### Oral erythromycin is ineffective in the treatment of pityriasis rosea [^112kU3nv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of various medical treatments for pityriasis rosea, a large percentage of patients fail to achieve satisfactory results. Erythromycin is reported to be effective in the treatment of pityriasis rosea.

- **Methods**: We designed a placebo-controlled study on 184 patients with pityriasis rosea attending the outpatient dermatology department at Hazrat-e-Rasul Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Adult patients were treated with 200 mg of erythromycin 4 times daily, and children were treated with 20 to 40 mg/kg daily in 4 divided doses. Controls were given a placebo (an emollient cream) that was not identical in appearance. Subjects were seen at follow-up visits 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after starting treatment.

- **Results**: Both groups were comparable with regard to sex, age, and mean duration of the disease at the time of attending the clinic. We found no significant difference between the two treatment groups at weeks 4, 6, and 8 after the beginning of treatment (p > .05, Chi2).

### Pityriasis rosea and pityriasis rosea-like eruptions: How to distinguish them [^113dD2RZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

To the Editor: We appreciate the article from Bitar et al. on ibrutinib-associated pityriasis rosea (PR)-like rash. It allows us to share our experience and make some observations. Recently, we proposed criteria to distinguish PR from PR-like eruptions. In fact, distinguishing them is of paramount importance, as typical PR may develop during but independently from a therapy. During PR, a self-limiting exanthematous disease associated with the endogenous systemic reactivation of human herpes virus (HHV)-6 and/or HHV-7, the drug (if indispensable for the health of the patient and except for immunosuppressive therapies that can favor viral reactivation) may be cautiously continued.

When the skin rash is diagnosed as a drug reaction with morphological features similar to genuine PR (a PR-like eruption), it is preferable to stop the drug immediately to prevent more dangerous drug reactions. Indeed, the interesting case described by Bitar et al. has some of the characteristics of PR-like eruptions, such as the presence of itch on the lesions, the dusky-red color of the lesions, and the superficial and perivascular eosinophil infiltration in the dermis. However, it is uncommon after several months to have resolution of the eruption without interruption of the drug. In fact, this course of the disease is more typical for PR.

Unfortunately, the authors have not investigated potential signs of HHV-6 and HHV-7 reactivation, such as detection of HHV-6/7 DNA in plasma and detection of positive IgM antibodies against HHV-6/7 in serum. In addition, they did not refer to peripheral eo…

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^115Zjo88]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Noninfectious hypotheses

- **Pityriasis rosea-like eruptions post-vaccination**: PR-like eruptions have been reported following various vaccinations, including Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), influenza, polio, H1N1, diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, smallpox, papillomavirus, Hepatitis B, pneumococcus, and COVID-19. Papakostas et al. proposed that vaccines may trigger a T-cell mediated response and that the activated immune system thus reactivates the pathogen. In fact, it has been suggested that the pathophysiology of PR is predominantly T-cell mediated, supported by the proliferation of T-cells and the lack of natural killer (NK) cells and B-cells found in PR lesions. The presence of anti-immunoglobulin M (IgM) keratinocytes in PR patients also suggests that this immune response is responsible for the clinical signs of PR.

- **Drug-induced pityriasis rosea-like eruptions**: There have also been reports of patients developing lesions resembling PR following new administration of medications. Drug-induced PR-like eruptions usually occur without a herald patch or typical collarette scaling and may require lower dosage or discontinuation of the drug to resolve.

### Pityriasis rosea: Diagnosis and treatment [^1158uASm]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a common self-limiting rash that usually starts with a herald patch on the trunk and progresses along the Langer lines to a generalized rash over the trunk and limbs. The diagnosis is based on clinical and physical examination findings. The herald patch is an erythematous lesion with an elevated border and depressed center. The generalized rash usually presents two weeks after the herald patch. Patients can develop general malaise, fatigue, nausea, headaches, joint pain, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and sore throat before or during the course of the rash.

The differential diagnosis includes secondary syphilis, seborrheic dermatitis, nummular eczema, pityriasis lichenoides chronica, tinea corporis, viral exanthems, lichen planus, and pityriasis rosea-like eruption associated with certain medications. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms and consists of corticosteroids or antihistamines. In some cases, acyclovir can be used to treat symptoms and reduce the length of the disease. Ultraviolet phototherapy can also be considered for severe cases. Pityriasis rosea during pregnancy has been linked to spontaneous abortions.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^116c4nVw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Presence of the herald patch in PR variants**: The presence of a herald patch is a key feature of classic pityriasis rosea (PR), but it may be absent in atypical variants of the condition. In inverted PR, where the lesions predominantly involve the flexural areas, a herald patch may be less easily identified or entirely absent. Similarly, in localized PR, the exanthem may be confined to one area, and a distinguishable herald patch may not be present. Persistent PR and relapsing PR also tend to have more varied presentations, with a herald patch being less commonly reported.

	- In pediatric PR and PR associated with COVID-19, the presence of a herald patch is variable. Studies have suggested that in COVID-19-related PR-like eruptions, the exanthem may present without a classic herald patch, mimicking the morphology of viral exanthems. Identifying the herald patch can be crucial for diagnosis, but its absence should not rule out PR, particularly in atypical or variant forms, where the clinical course and morphology of lesions may differ.

### Cutaneous plasmacytosis resembling pityriasis rosea in a 66-year-old white woman: A rare disease presenting in an unusual patient demographic [^116tHDsy]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The etiology of cutaneous plasmacytosis is unknown. One theory considers this disorder a variant of the reactive plasmacytic disorders; however, other theories speculate a role in infectious, environmental, or genetic etiologies. Elevated levels of IL-6, a cytokine that plays a role in the differentiation of B cells to plasma cells, have been reported in some patients with cutaneous plasmacytosis. Some consider cutaneous plasmacytosis a variant of multicentric Castleman disease, as follicular hyperplasia and polyclonal plasma cell infiltrate with elevated levels of IL-6 may be seen in multicentric Castleman disease. Overproduction of IL-6 was attributed to cells that were latently infected with HHV-8. Because of the similarities, it was hypothesized that HHV-8 may also play a role in cutaneous plasmacytosis; however, most patients, including ours with histopathologically proven cutaneous plasmacytosis, are HHV-8 negative.

Cutaneous plasmacytosis is a chronic disorder with rare spontaneous regression and overall favorable prognosis. Multiple extracutaneous involvements, levels of hypergammaglobulinemia greater than 5,000 mg/dL, and concentration of plasma cells in the bone marrow greater than 7% are correlated with a more severe disease course. A few cases with fatal outcomes are reported in the literature, with causes of death ranging from renal failure and leukemia to lymphoid interstitial pneumonia.

Multiple treatment modalities have been attempted for cutaneous and systemic plasmacytosis with no standard treatment for this rare disease. Treatment options with variable success have been documented.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^113PcQiG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

While this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the clinical features and differential diagnoses of pityriasis rosea (PR), it is subject to some limitations. The review relies on the available literature, and variations in study quality, sample sizes, and geographic differences may limit the generalizability of the conclusions. Additionally, publication bias may have led to an overrepresentation of unusual or positive findings. We also did not perform a systematic meta-analysis, which limits the ability to quantitatively synthesize the data. As PR research evolves, more rigorous studies and controlled trials are needed to further refine our understanding.

### Can pityriasis versicolor be treated with 2% ketoconazole foam [^114ybiJF]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor is a superficial fungal infection of the stratum corneum caused by Malassezia species. The diagnosis is made clinically by its classic appearance of round or oval macules with fine scale that may be hyperpigmented or hypopigmented. Diagnosis may also be confirmed with microscopic evaluation of skin scrapings that reveal both short, stubby hyphae and spores under KOH preparation. Ketoconazole is an important treatment of pityriasis versicolor but is primarily used in cream formulas. A foam vehicle has been shown to improve drug absorption through the stratum corneum and distribution in the skin. This study has assessed the safety and efficacy of ketoconazole 2% foam in the treatment of pityriasis versicolor.

- **Methods**: Ketoconazole 2% foam was evaluated in a single-center, open-label, one-arm pilot study which enrolled eleven subjects to gain 10 evaluable subjects aged 21 years and older with a clinical diagnosis of tinea versicolor and positive KOH using calcofluor. The subjects attended four scheduled visits (baseline, week 1, week 2, and week 4) and were instructed to apply ketoconazole 2% foam to all affected areas twice daily for 2 weeks. At each visit, mycological and clinical assessment of a target area was done, along with static global assessment and body surface area estimation of the disease in each subject. Patient questionnaires were given at baseline and at week 2 to rate pruritus and satisfaction with the foam.

- **Results**: At the week 2 visit, following the treatment period, three out of ten evaluable subjects had negative skin results.

### Management of seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis versicolor [^116vTSgv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis are two very common skin diseases. Pityriasis versicolor is a chronic superficial fungal disease usually located on the upper trunk, neck, or upper arms. In pityriasis versicolor, the lipophilic yeast Malassezia (also known as Pityrosporum ovale or P. orbiculare) changes from the blastospore form to the mycelial form under the influence of predisposing factors.

The most important exogenous factors are high temperatures and high relative humidity, which probably explain why pityriasis versicolor is more common in the tropics. The most important endogenous factors are greasy skin, hyperhidrosis, hereditary factors, corticosteroid treatment, and immunodeficiency. There are many ways to treat pityriasis versicolor topically. Options include propylene glycol, ketoconazole shampoo, zinc pyrithione shampoo, ciclopiroxamine, selenium sulfide, and topical antifungals. In difficult cases, short-term treatment with fluconazole or itraconazole is effective and well-tolerated. To avoid recurrence, a prophylactic treatment regimen is mandatory.

Seborrheic dermatitis is characterized by red scaly lesions predominantly located on the scalp, face, and upper trunk. Many studies indicate that Malassezia plays an important role in this condition. Even a normal number of Malassezia can trigger an inflammatory reaction. Mild corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. However, the disease often recurs quickly, sometimes within just a few days. Antifungal therapy is effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.

### Pityriasis lichenoides chronica in a patient on tafasitamab and lenalidomide therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^116T9UyR]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) is a rare dermatosis that typically presents as erythematous papules, which can be asymptomatic or pruritic. Although the pathology of PLC is not well understood, it is thought to be an inflammatory reaction to an antigenic trigger, which is mostly infectious in nature. More rarely, PLC may be seen as a paraneoplastic phenomenon or a reaction to medication. Some researchers label PLC as a lymphoproliferative disorder, given that these patients have demonstrated T-cell clonality; however, this is highly debated in the literature. Herein, we present a case of PLC in a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who developed a rash after initiating tafasitamab/lenalidomide therapy.

Moreover, oropharyngeal lesions can occur in up to 28% of patients with pityriasis rosea (PR). These lesions are painless and are typically associated with the exanthem of PR. The most frequently observed patterns include petechial, macular, and papular lesions. While petechial enanthema has been predominantly associated with persistent PR and pediatric PR, macular and papular lesions are observed across various forms of the disease, including relapsing PR and classic PR. Thus, it is important to examine the oropharyngeal mucosa in patients with PR, as the presence of these lesions can help distinguish PR from other mucosal diseases and may indicate a more atypical course of the disease, such as persistent or relapsing forms.

Some patients may experience mild prodromal symptoms before the appearance of the herald patch, including a sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbances, fever, and arthralgia. Although the rash may be asymptomatic, some individuals may experience mild to moderate itching, which can worsen with heat or sweating. Severe itching occurs in about 25% of cases. Occasionally, patients may also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, joint pain, or slight enlargement of lymph nodes. The rash of pityriasis rosea typically resolves within 6 to 8 weeks in more than 80% of patients, though it may persist longer in some cases. It usually resolves spontaneously without leaving scars, and the herald patch may last longer than the secondary lesions.

### Dupilumab-induced pityriasis rosea [^116AJb1v]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Since 2017, dupilumab has been an effective and globally recognized Food and Drug Administration-approved biologic drug that addresses the underlying T-helper-2 pathway in allergic diseases. Overall, dupilumab is a safe and well-tolerated drug. Adverse cutaneous reactions do not always necessitate discontinuation of the drug. Injection site reactions, facial erythema, and psoriasiform reactions are the most common cutaneous reactions to dupilumab. Some have theorized psoriasiform lesions as a marker for effective treatment with dupilumab, reflecting a potential shift toward cutaneous IL-23 and T-helper-17 pathway activation with suppression of type 2 immunity.

In contrast to the treatment response in our case of a pityriasis rosea-like drug eruption, most cases of psoriasiform eruptions in the setting of dupilumab achieve clearance with the use of topical medium-strength to potent steroids. In contrast, drug-induced or idiopathic pityriasis rosea tends to be refractory to treatment as it is mediated by a different immunologic mechanism in response to viral triggers. Other rarer cutaneous reactions that have been described with dupilumab include erythema nodosum and urticaria.

To our knowledge, this is the first case of a pityriasis rosea-like drug eruption induced by dupilumab. Pityriasis rosea-like drug eruptions mimic pityriasis rosea, a common idiopathic and typically self-limited cutaneous eruption. Pityriasis rosea initially presents as a solitary scaly, pink, or flesh-colored plaque, the "herald patch", followed by an eruption of scaling patches on the trunk.

### Effect of patching on reducing restenosis in the carotid revascularization endarterectomy versus stenting trial [^115oXfLU]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether patching during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) affects the perioperative and long-term risks of restenosis, stroke, death, and myocardial infarction compared to primary closure.

- **Methods**: We identified all patients who were randomized and underwent CEA in the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial. CEA patients who received a patch were compared with patients who underwent CEA with primary closure without a patch. We compared periprocedural and 4-year event rates, 2-year restenosis rates, and rates of reoperation between the two groups. Results were further analyzed by surgeon specialty.

- **Results**: A total of 1,151 patients underwent CEA, with 753 (65%) receiving a patch and 329 (29%) having primary closure. Forty-four patients who underwent eversion CEA and 25 patients with missing CEA data (5%) were excluded. Patch use differed by surgeon specialty: 89% of vascular surgeons, 6% of neurosurgeons, and 76% of thoracic surgeons used a patch. There was a significant reduction in the 2-year risk of restenosis among patients who received a patch, persisting after adjustment for surgeon specialty (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.74; P = 0.006). There were no significant differences in the rates of periprocedural stroke and death (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–7.58; P = 0.57), in immediate reoperation (hazard ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–2.27; P = 0.45), or in the 4-year risk of ipsilateral stroke (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.42–3.6).
