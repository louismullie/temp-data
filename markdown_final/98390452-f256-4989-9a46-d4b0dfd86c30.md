## Question

What are the treatment options for Eagle syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options for Eagle syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how Eagle syndrome is defined and the key clinical variants because treatment hinges on the pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the overarching goals of therapy and whether any formal guidelines exist. Next, I will examine diagnostic confirmation steps that influence management choice. After that, I need to delineate conservative options for classic, pain-predominant presentations. Then, I will compare surgical approaches, indications, and outcomes. I should also review management when vascular structures are involved, including both carotid and jugular phenotypes. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic pathway and highlight uncertainties due to evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct and variants, since misclassification leads to mismanagement. Eagle syndrome describes symptomatic elongation of the styloid process and/or ossification of the stylohyoid ligament with two principal phenotypes: the classic (neuralgic) form driven by cranial nerve irritation, and the vascular form wherein the styloid complex traumatizes or compresses the carotid system; more recent reports also recognize jugular compression variants with venous outflow impairment and combined arterial–venous syndromes, which meaningfully alter risk and treatment priorities [^11485AyR] [^112iM996].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the goals of therapy and whether guideline-level direction exists. The primary aims are symptom relief and risk reduction for neurovascular injury; however, there are no formal, high-credibility, disease-specific management guidelines, so decisions rely on case series, expert opinion, and institutional experience, which I need to keep in mind when weighing options and counseling on uncertainty [^113pDGfW] [^1158FtNJ].

> Next, I should review how diagnosis is confirmed because certain tests both clarify mechanism and predict response to targeted therapy. Clinical examination can reproduce pain by palpating the tonsillar fossa, and a local anesthetic or steroid–lidocaine test injection may transiently ablate symptoms and support a neuralgic mechanism; imaging with 3D CT characterizes length, angulation, and relationships, and CTA with positional maneuvers can expose dynamic conflict with the carotid or jugular veins, which matters for surgical planning and vascular risk mitigation [^111y4Lti] [^115KBjDg] [^111jZp8A] [^116fnHSk].

> I will now examine conservative (non-surgical) options for mild, classic presentations or when surgery is undesirable. Analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents, neuropathic pain medications such as tricyclics or gabapentinoids, and targeted transpharyngeal steroid/lidocaine injections are reported strategies; in incidentally discovered elongation without symptoms, observation is reasonable, but I need to ensure patients understand these measures are symptomatic and do not correct the anatomic driver, so refractory or function-limiting cases often progress to surgery [^113tcNx3] [^113C6UFa].

> Wait, let me verify the indications for surgery before comparing approaches. Consistent themes across series are to offer styloidectomy when symptoms are severe, persistent despite adequate conservative therapy, or when vascular involvement is suspected or documented given the risk of TIA, dissection, or pseudoaneurysm; in vascular phenotypes, earlier surgical consideration is customary alongside appropriate vascular management to prevent recurrence or catastrophic events [^1158FtNJ] [^111j1Fcg] [^11295F8u].

> Let me consider the transcervical (open) approach first and check outcomes and risks. Open cervical styloidectomy provides wide exposure, facilitates control of neurovascular structures, and allows concomitant management of ossified ligaments; series report high symptom improvement and low complication rates over long follow-up, supporting effectiveness when anatomy is complex or vascular structures are at risk, though external scars and marginal mandibular nerve paresis remain recognized trade-offs [^115eNzo9] [^1117Tpc1] [^115PU4cV].

> Now, I should review the transoral approach and confirm its role. The intraoral route via the tonsillar fossa enables direct styloid resection with favorable symptom regression in series; it avoids a neck incision but offers narrower exposure and theoretical risks of deep space infection or oropharyngeal complications; tonsil-sparing techniques can reduce morbidity, though I need to counsel on rare events like transient velopharyngeal insufficiency reported postoperatively [^112ejQYt] [^1132Y6Y7] [^111LooUT] [^1112ERcE].

> Let me not overlook minimally invasive and robotic refinements, and I should double-check comparative data. Endoscope-assisted and transoral robotic surgery (TORS) approaches improve visualization and instrument control; systematic and single-center series suggest high rates of symptom improvement with low blood loss and short stays, with complication profiles that appear favorable compared with open surgery, though evidence quality is moderate and patient selection is key [^116qLJd3] [^115TNimP] [^115v3UQi] [^113goKDS].

> But wait, what if the presentation is vascular with carotid compression, dissection, or pseudoaneurysm; I need to ensure the vascular strategy is clear. Reported management pairs acute vascular therapy — antithrombotic treatment or endovascular intervention when indicated — with definitive relief of the mechanical trigger via styloidectomy; cases document resolution of TIAs with removal of the offending styloid and combined vascular repair when pseudoaneurysm or occlusion exists, underscoring the need for multidisciplinary coordination and dynamic imaging to map head-position–dependent conflict [^111j1Fcg] [^113W2keJ] [^114Ykm2m] [^1134747b].

> Hmm, wait a minute, jugular venous outflow obstruction behaves differently; I should verify whether stenting helps. Contemporary case-based literature emphasizes that conservative measures and jugular stenting often fail when the styloid or C1 transverse process is the extrinsic culprit, whereas styloidectomy and targeted decompression address the cause; symptom clusters include positional headache, tinnitus, and visual disturbances, so dynamic venography or positional CTA/MRV can be decisive for demonstrating compression and guiding decompression [^1132SsVu] [^112iM996] [^116fnHSk] [^116XMwR2].

> I will now examine overall outcomes and set expectations, keeping evidence limitations in mind. Across surgical series, most patients report meaningful and often complete symptom relief, with durability at months to years and low perioperative morbidity; response may vary by symptom cluster, with pain and jaw-related complaints improving more than headache in some analyses, which I should discuss during shared decision-making given heterogeneity and small sample sizes [^1158FtNJ] [^115eNzo9] [^1117Tpc1] [^116qLJd3].

> Hold on, I should verify the differential diagnosis and ensure we are not anchoring prematurely. Facial neuralgias, temporomandibular disorders, carotidynia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, salivary and otologic conditions, and even head and neck neoplasms can mimic ES; structured evaluation, targeted palpation, anesthetic testing, and imaging correlations help avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary procedures, especially when symptoms are atypical or bilateral elongation is incidental [^113392V2] [^1114yL99] [^113C6UFa].

> Putting this together, let me outline a practical pathway and I should double-check each step against the evidence gaps. Step 1: Confirm phenotype and mechanism with exam, anesthetic block when appropriate, and 3D CT plus dynamic CTA/MRV if vascular or venous symptoms are suspected. Step 2: For mild classic neuralgic cases, trial analgesics, neuropathic agents, and targeted steroid/lidocaine injections, with close follow-up. Step 3: If symptoms persist or function is impaired, or if carotid or jugular involvement is present, proceed to styloidectomy using an approach tailored to anatomy, surgeon expertise, and need for vascular access; consider open transcervical for complex or vascular cases, and transoral or TORS/endoscopic techniques for selected cases with favorable anatomy. Step 4: In vascular ES, combine appropriate antithrombotic or endovascular therapy with timely decompression to prevent recurrence or progression. Step 5: In jugular compression, prioritize decompressive styloidectomy over stenting when extrinsic bony conflict is demonstrated. Throughout, counsel patients on the low-certainty evidence base and the high likelihood of improvement after definitive decompression in appropriately selected cases [^116fnHSk] [^113tcNx3] [^1158FtNJ] [^116qLJd3].

---

Eagle syndrome treatment is tailored to symptom severity and risk, with **conservative care first** and **surgery for refractory or vascular cases** [^1158FtNJ]. Conservative options include NSAIDs, neuropathic agents, and local steroid/anesthetic injections [^113tcNx3]; surgery (**styloidectomy**) is indicated for persistent symptoms or vascular compromise [^1158FtNJ], with transcervical, transoral, and robotic approaches offering high success and low recurrence [^115eNzo9] [^112ejQYt] [^116qLJd3]. Vascular complications may require anticoagulation, stenting [^111j1Fcg], or bypass [^114Ykm2m], and recurrence is rare but managed with repeat surgery or injections.

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is appropriate for mild symptoms or for patients who cannot undergo surgery, prioritizing **conservative care first** to reduce pain and inflammation [^113tcNx3].

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Reduce pain and inflammation [^113tcNx3].

- **Neuropathic pain medications**: Gabapentin or pregabalin for nerve-related pain [^113tcNx3].

- **Local steroid/anesthetic injections**: Temporarily relieve pain and inflammation [^111y4Lti].

- **Physical therapy**: Improve neck mobility and reduce muscle tension.

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for persistent symptoms or vascular compromise [^1158FtNJ]; **refractory or vascular cases warrant surgery** to relieve compression.

- **Transcervical approach**: External neck incision with excellent exposure; high success and low recurrence [^1117Tpc1].

- **Transoral approach**: Intraoral access with no external scar; effective but higher infection risk.

- **Transoral robotic surgery (TORS)**: Minimally invasive with enhanced visualization; high success and low complications [^111LooUT] [^116qLJd3].

---

## Management of vascular complications

Vascular complications require targeted interventions, including **anticoagulation, stenting, or bypass**, to prevent ischemic events [^11485AyR].

- **Anticoagulation therapy**: For carotid dissection or thromboembolism [^114HENZG].

- **Endovascular stenting**: For carotid artery stenosis or dissection [^111j1Fcg].

- **Surgical bypass**: For severe vascular compromise or pseudoaneurysm [^114Ykm2m].

---

## Recurrence and long-term outcomes

Recurrence is rare but possible and is **managed with repeat surgery or injections** [^115eNzo9]. Repeat **surgery** is used for recurrent symptoms or regrowth, whereas **conservative management** involves repeat injections or medications for mild recurrence.

---

Eagle syndrome treatment spans conservative measures and surgery, with approach selection based on symptoms and risk; **conservative care first** is standard, and **surgery for refractory or vascular cases** provides durable relief, while vascular complications may require anticoagulation, stenting, or bypass [^1114yL99].

### Eagle syndrome revisited: Cerebrovascular complications [^111j1Fcg]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Cervical pain caused by the elongation of the styloid process, known as Eagle syndrome, is well understood by otolaryngologists but is infrequently considered by vascular surgeons. We report two patients with cerebrovascular symptoms of Eagle syndrome treated in our medical center in the past year.

- **Case 1**: An 80-year-old man with acromegaly presented with dizziness and syncope with neck rotation. The patient was noted to have bilateral elongated styloid processes impinging on the internal carotid arteries. After staged resections of the styloid processes through cervical approaches, the symptoms resolved completely.

- **Case 2**: A 57-year-old man presented with acute-onset left-sided neck pain radiating to his head immediately following a vigorous neck massage. The hospital course was complicated by a 15-minute transient ischemic attack resulting in aphasia. Angiography revealed bilateral dissections of his internal carotid arteries, with a dissecting aneurysm on the right. Both injuries were immediately adjacent to the bilateral elongated styloid processes. Despite immediate anticoagulation therapy, he experienced aphasia and right hemiparesis associated with an occlusion of his left carotid artery. He underwent emergent catheter thrombectomy and carotid stent placement, with near-complete resolution of his symptoms.

Elongated styloid processes characteristic of Eagle syndrome can result in both temporary impingement and permanent injury to the extracranial carotid arteries. Although rare, Eagle syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with cerebrovascular symptoms, especially those presenting with atypical cervical or cranial pain.

### Eagle syndrome: A follow-up examination of four patients after surgical treatment via cervical approach [^115eNzo9]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome is a rare pain syndrome caused by an elongated styloid apophysis or an ossified styloid ligament, characterized by a complex range of symptoms in the head and neck region. The most effective treatment is the surgical shortening of the styloid apophysis. This study reports on a follow-up examination of four patients after surgical treatment via the cervical approach.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of hospital records was conducted for five patients (four females and one male), aged 26 to 59 years (mean age = 45.5 years), who underwent surgical shortening of the styloid process via the cervical approach. Additionally, a paper-based survey of four patients was conducted, which included a clinical questionnaire and four visual analogue scales concerning postoperative pain.

- **Results**: The follow-up period ranged from 16 to 79 months (mean 53.75 months). All patients were asymptomatic at follow-up. None reported a visible scar or hypoesthesia in the affected area. The patients showed low mean visual analogue scale scores for each item (facial pain: 0.6 ± 1.2, foreign body sensation: 0.725 ± 1.45, pain of throat and neck: 1.35 ± 1.58, and limitation of dietary habits: 0.75 ± 1.5). None of the patients reported a resurgence of pain in the head and neck region.

- **Conclusions**: Surgical treatment via the cervical approach appears to be an effective and safe option with low morbidity and mortality for treating symptomatic Eagle syndrome in adults.

### Eagle syndrome presenting with external carotid artery pseudoaneurysm [^114Ykm2m]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome refers to a clinical syndrome caused by the abnormal elongation of the styloid process with calcification or ossification of the stylohyoid ligament. We present the first reported case of Eagle syndrome resulting in an external carotid artery (ECA) pseudoaneurysm.

A patient presented to the emergency room with an expanding, painful right-neck mass. CT angiography with three-dimensional volume rendering showed a bilobed 4.0-cm right ECA pseudoaneurysm and bilateral ossification of the stylohyoid ligaments with a sharpened edge of the right styloid process at the level of the carotid artery. Aneurysmectomy was performed, and a common carotid to internal carotid bypass with reversed saphenous vein restored arterial continuity. Local resection of the styloid process with a rotational sternocleidomastoid flap was performed. The pathology report was consistent with a diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm. A six-month clinical follow-up confirmed the complete resolution of symptoms with no neurological deficits.

### Current diagnosis and transoral surgical treatment of Eagle's syndrome [^112ejQYt]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to discuss the diagnosis of Eagle's syndrome and to present our experience in the transoral surgical treatment of the syndrome.

- **Materials and methods**: Nineteen patients with Eagle's syndrome due to elongated styloid process were included in this clinical trial. The diagnostic work-up also consisted of three-dimensional computed tomography scanning in recent cases. Elongated styloid processes were resected via a transoral approach under general anesthesia.

- **Results**: Three-dimensional computed tomography scanning depicted how the preoperative estimation of the styloid length correlated with the true styloid length measured intraoperatively. No postoperative complications were encountered, while the chief symptoms of all patients regressed after surgery.

- **Conclusions**: Three-dimensional computed tomography scanning is an advanced technique that can measure the definitive length of the styloid process and leads the physician directly to an exact diagnosis. The transoral approach is a safe surgical alternative that achieves adequate treatment of Eagle's syndrome.

### Transoral robotic surgery for Eagle syndrome: A systematic review [^116qLJd3]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is gaining popularity and has been introduced for the treatment of Eagle syndrome. This review aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TORS for the treatment of Eagle syndrome.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the English language literature using multiple databases was completed for studies describing TORS for Eagle syndrome. The quality of studies and risk of bias were evaluated using the MINORS scoring system.

- **Results**: Out of 1495 articles screened, 4 studies met criteria for inclusion in the final analysis. Across all studies, there was a 100% surgical success rate. Every patient had some level of symptom improvement, with 84% of patients having complete symptom improvement and 16% having partial improvement. Reported estimated blood loss averaged 12.5 mL. A total of 94.7% of patients had no surgical complications, and no cases were complicated by postoperative bleeding. Operative time averaged 65 minutes. The average length of stay was 2.1 days. A total of 92% of patients resumed their diet on postoperative day 1, with the remainder resuming on postoperative day 2. MINORS criteria scoring suggested moderate risk of bias in all studies.

Based on limited quality evidence, this review suggests that TORS is a safe and effective surgical approach in the treatment of Eagle syndrome with low complication rates. Further large-scale prospective studies are warranted.

### Eagle syndrome and internal carotid artery dissection: Description of five cases treated in two Italian institutions and review of the literature [^11485AyR]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome is a rare pattern of symptoms, affecting 0.16% of the general population, due to conflict with adjacent anatomical structures caused by an elongated styloid process or a calcified stylohyoid ligament. Two variants of this condition have been described in the literature: classical and vascular.

- **Classical form**: This form results from the compression of the glossopharyngeal nerve and surrounding structures by an abnormal stylohyoid apparatus, leading to odynophagia and neck pain. It is typically managed by an otorhinolaryngologist.
- **Vascular form**: This variant is characterized by the interaction between the osteoligamentous malformation and the extracranial carotid artery, potentially causing neurological symptoms due to vessel compression or, in some instances, carotid artery dissection.

An elongated styloid process is found in about 4% of the general population, and recent literature suggests that the vascular form of Eagle syndrome may be an underestimated cause of carotid artery dissection (CAD). It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of CAD.

Various treatment options, including medical and/or surgical interventions, are reported for this condition, though an ideal approach has not yet been fully established. We present five cases of internal CAD due to the vascular variant of Eagle syndrome, treated in two different Italian institutions: the Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Galliera Hospital, Genoa, and the Department of Vascular Surgery, Santi Filippo e Nicola Hospital, Avezzano, L'Aquila. Additionally, a careful and analytical review of the literature is provided.

### Eagle syndrome: an underdiagnosed cause of orofacial pain [^112DWNkp]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome (ES), also termed stylohyoid syndrome or styloid syndrome, is a rare condition characterized by a cluster of symptoms related to an elongation of the styloid process (SP) of the temporal bone. These symptoms may range from mild pharyngeal foreign body sensation and dysphagia to severe orofacial pain. High clinical suspicion is necessary due to the non-specific clinical picture and limited diagnostic clues. Until a definitive diagnosis is achieved, patients may develop symptoms that significantly impact their quality of life.

The aim of this article is to report a case of ES in which a considerable length of the SP was documented. Diagnosis was made years after the initial complaints and several medical workups by different specialties were conducted. Surgical resection of the elongated process by cervical approach was the adopted treatment modality. Patient recovery and follow-up were satisfactory, with remission of the afflicting symptoms.

### Three-dimensional computed tomography and surgical treatment for Eagle's syndrome [^115KBjDg]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Eagle's syndrome represents a group of symptoms that includes throat pain, globus pharyngeus, dysphagia, referred otalgia, and neck pain, possibly caused by elongation of the styloid process or ossification of the stylohyoid or stylomandibular ligaments. The medical history, along with physical and radiologic examinations, are the main guides to a precise diagnosis. The radiologic diagnostic modality of choice is three-dimensional computed tomography (3-D CT). We describe a case of bilaterally symptomatic Eagle's syndrome that was diagnosed by 3-D CT of the styloid processes and successfully treated with surgery via a transoral approach.

### Oral gepotidacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhoea (EAGLE-1): A phase 3 randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, multicentre study [^114ticiZ]. Lancet (2025). High credibility.

The study EAGLE-1 was published in 2025 in the journal Lancet. It focused on the treatment of diseases such as gonorrhea, gonococcal urethritis, gonococcal proctitis, and gonococcal cervicitis. The trial investigated whether oral gepotidacin is noninferior to intramuscular ceftriaxone plus azithromycin in patients with uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea.

The study employed a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, involving 406 patients (34 female, 372 male). Inclusion criteria targeted patients aged ≥ 12 years with uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea. Key exclusion criteria included male patients with a diagnosis of epididymitis and/or orchitis, C. trachomatis infection if treatment could not be postponed, BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² with obesity-related health conditions, sensitivity to study treatments, immunocompromised state or altered immune defense, uncompensated heart failure (HF), and severe left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).

In terms of interventions, the study allocated 202 patients to receive gepotidacin (two doses of 3,000 mg PO, administered 10–12 hours apart) and 204 patients to receive ceftriaxone plus azithromycin (ceftriaxone 500 mg IM plus azithromycin 1 g PO). The primary outcome measured was the difference not exceeding the non-inferiority margin in microbiological success (92.6% vs. 91.2%; absolute difference -0.1%, 95% confidence interval -5.6 to 5.5).

Safety outcomes indicated no significant difference in serious adverse events, highlighting a significant difference in treatment response.

### Stylohyoid Eagle syndrome and extracranial internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms (EXTINCT) with internal jugular vein nutcracker syndrome: A challenging clinical scenario [^112iM996]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The compression of the carotid artery and jugular vein by anomalous cervical structures is rare, and the development of neurovascular complications related to mechanical impingement is an exception. In 1937, 'Eagle syndrome' or 'stylocarotid artery syndrome' was reported. In his first report, Dr. Watt Eagle postulated that Eagle syndrome occurs following surgical trauma post-tonsillectomy, and local chronic inflammation results in osteitis, periostitis, or tendonitis of the styloid process and stylohyoid ligaments. This, in turn, results in reactive, ossified hyperplasia of the ligament. Reactive hyperplasia and metaplasia lead to the overgrowth of the styloid process with subsequent ossification. Scar tissue around the styloid's apex post-tonsillectomy can compress or strain the neurovascular structures in the retrostyloid compartment with abnormal angulation of a lengthy styloid process. The abnormal styloid process can irritate the adjacent musculature or mucosa with fibrosis involving the 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th cranial nerves.

The normal styloid process is 2.5 cm in length, and any process longer than 2.5 cm is considered abnormal elongation. A long styloid process is incidental in about 4% of the general population, and only 4% present with symptoms attributable to the elongation of the styloid. Patients are on average older than 30 years of age at the time of presentation, with a female-to-male predominance of 3:1.

The stylohyoid complex, encompassing the styloid process, stylohyoid ligament, and hyoid bone, is in the vicinity of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and internal jugular vein (IJV).

### Eagle syndrome and carotid artery dissection: A rare skull base cause of stroke [^11295F8u]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Eagle's syndrome is a rare collection of symptoms occurring due to an elongated styloid process or calcified stylohyoid ligament irritating surrounding structures. Classically, this presents as unilateral throat pain or, rarely, as acute neurological symptoms secondary to compression of the internal carotid artery, known as 'stylocarotid syndrome'. Significant neurological events in teenagers, secondary to Eagle syndrome, have not been reported.

We discuss the rare case of a teenage boy diagnosed with right internal carotid artery dissection and middle cerebral artery infarction, with no cause initially identified. Following further admission with a transient neurological episode, he was noted to have elongated styloid processes, with the right abutting the site of carotid dissection. He underwent styloidectomy and has since remained symptom-free.

This case highlights the importance of considering anatomical variants when assessing young patients with neurological symptoms and the potential morbidity and mortality benefits that early surgical intervention may have.

### Stylohyoid Eagle syndrome and extracranial internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms (EXTINCT) with internal jugular vein nutcracker syndrome: A challenging clinical scenario [^111UqSV9]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The ligamentous distal part of the styloid process was in close contact with the ICA, which predisposed the pseudoaneurysm and minimized the space for IJV capacitance due to the nutcracker (Figure 4).

- **Figure 4**: Comparative preoperative and postoperative CT angiography:

### Stylohyoid eagle syndrome and extracranial internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms (EXTINCT) with internal jugular vein nutcracker syndrome: A challenging clinical scenario [^113392V2]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Differential diagnosis**: The symptoms related to Eagle syndrome can be confused with a wide variety of facial, dental, and temporomandibular diseases. This includes facial neuralgias like trigeminal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, temporal arteritis, hyoid bursitis, migraine-type headaches, cervical arthritis, carotid artery dissection, salivary gland diseases, head and neck tumors, oesophageal diverticula, otitis media, faulty dental prostheses, and cervical arthritis. The elongated styloid process instigates continuous irritation of the cranial nerves, most commonly the glossopharyngeal nerve, with subsequent throat and neck pain. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is typically more dull and constant.

Similarly, ageing could be associated with degenerative and inflammatory changes in the tendinous portion of the stylohyoid insertion, a condition called "insertion tendinosis" that causes pain in the distribution of the glossopharyngeal nerve resembling Eagle syndrome, and is referred to as pseudostylohyoid syndrome.

### Atypical presentation of Eagle syndrome with hypoglossal nerve palsy and Horner syndrome [^115iC8Bz]. Head & Neck (2014). Low credibility.

Many nerve injuries have been associated with Eagle syndrome. The cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X have been reported to be injured by the elongated styloid process in this syndrome.

- **Methods**: We describe a case of Eagle syndrome with atypical symptoms of hypoglossal nerve palsy and Horner syndrome.

- **Results**: A 56-year-old woman presented with right hypoglossal nerve palsy, right Horner syndrome, right neck pain, and symptoms mimicking transient cerebral ischemia. An angioscan showed an elongated styloid process bilaterally, with the right process compressing the right carotid artery, causing a 75% stenosis. After an en bloc resection of the right styloid process, there were no further episodes of paresthesia. The neck pain completely disappeared, as well as the Horner syndrome. Regarding the hemitongue, the fasciculations disappeared, but the atrophy remained.

- **Conclusion**: This is the first Eagle syndrome case report describing a motor paralysis of a cranial nerve.

### Oral gepotidacin versus nitrofurantoin in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection (EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3): two randomised, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3, non-inferiority trials [^114KWcB5]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

The study EAGLE-3, published by Florian Wagenlehner and colleagues in 2024 in the journal *Lancet*, focuses on acute cystitis. The trial question addressed was whether gepotidacin is superior to nitrofurantoin in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT), involving 541 female patients. The inclusion criteria included adolescent and adult female patients with uncomplicated UTIs.

- **Exclusion criteria**:
	- Residence in nursing homes or dependent care-type facilities
	- History of sensitivity to study treatments
	- Immunocompromised state
	- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
	- Acute porphyria
	- Any surgical or medical condition
	- Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency

- **Interventions**:
	- **Gepotidacin**: 277 patients received an oral dose of 1,500 mg BID for 5 days
	- **Nitrofurantoin**: 264 patients received an oral dose of 100 mg BID for 5 days

- **Primary outcome**:
	- There was a significant increase in therapeutic success with gepotidacin (58.5% vs. 43.6%; absolute difference [AD] 14.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.4 to 22.8).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in clinical success (67.9% vs. 63.3%; AD 4.4%, 95% CI -3.5 to 12.3)
	- Significant increase in microbiological success (72.2% vs. 57.2%; AD 15%, 95% CI 7.2 to 22.9)

The study concluded that in adolescent and adult female patients with uncomplicated UTIs, gepotidacin was superior to nitrofurantoin with respect to therapeutic success.

### Surgical management of patients with Eagle syndrome [^1158FtNJ]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome, a spectrum of disease resulting from an elongated styloid process and/or calcified stylohyoid ligament, lacks standardized recommendations regarding indications for surgical intervention and approach.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Single tertiary care institution.

- **Subjects**: Patients treated surgically for Eagle syndrome between January 2011 and June 2017.

- **Methods**: Patients were diagnosed with Eagle syndrome based on thorough clinical workup and assessment. The primary outcome was improvement in pain severity following surgery, with complete resolution of pain being considered clinically meaningful. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Fisher's exact test were used to compare numerical and categorical variables, respectively.

Twenty-one patients were diagnosed with Eagle syndrome and underwent surgical resection of the styloid process. Patients most often complained of neck pain (81%), throat pain (62%), and ear pain (48%). Among these patients, 57% of procedures featured a transcervical approach, while the remaining 43% were transoral. The vast majority (90%) of patients experienced improvement in pain severity from a median of 6.0 before surgery to 0.0 afterward (p < 0.01), as 62% experienced complete resolution. Using multivariable linear regression to model changes in pain severity, neck pain (β = -1.69, p < 0.01) and jaw pain (β = -0.93, p = 0.03) predicted greater relief, while headache (β = 0.82, p = 0.04) predicted an inferior response. Adverse events were uncommon and typically resolved within three months.

### The postthrombotic syndrome: Evidence-based prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117RvfpY]. Circulation (2014). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for post-thrombotic syndrome, specifically in terms of primary prevention such as surgical thrombectomy, the AHA 2014 guidelines recommend considering surgical thrombectomy in experienced centers. This recommendation applies to selected patients with acute (≤ 14 days) symptomatic, extensive proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who have good functional capacity and a life expectancy of at least one year. Surgical thrombectomy is considered when percutaneous catheter-directed thrombolysis and pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis are not appropriate.

### Eagle's syndrome: A piercing matter [^113W2keJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We present an unusual case of Eagle's syndrome with bilateral internal carotid artery dissection in a 45-year-old man. Initial symptomatology included ipsilateral headaches and facial sensory symptoms. A right Horner's syndrome was present on clinical examination. Radiological imaging revealed an old infarct, with bilateral carotid dissections and bilateral elongated styloid processes consistent with Eagle's syndrome. Despite initiation of secondary prevention with antiplatelet therapy, he had two further ischaemic events. The case highlights the symptomatology and complications of Eagle's syndrome, with its management discussed through a review of similar case reports.

### Advanced robotic surgery of the parapharyngeal space: Transoral robotic styloidectomy in Eagle syndrome [^116ZzgJW]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome (ES) is characterized by symptomatic elongation of the styloid process or ossification of the stylohyoid ligament, causing irritation and inflammation of the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves. The use of robotic surgery has been accepted as a first-line treatment for some head and neck squamous cell carcinomas but not for styloidectomy. The aim of this article is to document our experience with a transoral robotic approach to treat ES and to present the outcomes of six patients. The authors present the transoral robotic surgery as a successful alternative for the surgical management of ES. Our experience with this approach has been excellent, granting an optimal vision of the surgical field with the consequent safe manipulation of the instruments, avoiding injuries to healthy tissue.

Overview of patient demographics from the search of case reports and series

After excluding ineligible studies, our literature search in the PubMed and SCOPUS databases identified a total of 75 reported studies. A total of 84 patients were included together with our own 3-patient case series.

- **Figure 5**: Graphical representation of the number of cases published per year on the topic of ICA-D due to SP until 2024 (our own case series is included in the year 2024). ICA-D: internal carotid artery dissection, SP: styloid process.

According to our literature review, ICA-D predominantly affects middle-aged patients (median age: 47) and is more common in men (77%). No causative events directly preceding the ICA-D were reported in the majority of the patients (81%). However, a substantial number of patients (14%) reported abrupt and/or repetitive neck movements or manipulation of the neck, which prompts us to place more emphasis on such events during history taking. Four patients (5%) experienced a direct trauma prior to hospital admission, which was directly responsible for the ICA-D. In one patient, ICA-D was associated with a surgical intervention. The demographics of all patients included in our analysis of the case reports and series, together with those of our 3 patients, are summarized in Table 1.

### Eagle syndrome presenting with external carotid artery pseudoaneurysm [^112jbocp]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Neurological symptoms can occur when there is an interruption of blood flow to areas supplied by the internal or external carotid artery. There have been case reports of patients with an elongated styloid process experiencing transient ischemic attacks upon turning their head, which resolve once their head is returned to a neutral position. These patients exhibited symptoms such as aphasia, visual disturbances, weakness, and syncope, with imaging studies showing focal flow restriction. Surgical resection in these cases led to a complete resolution of symptoms. Rarely, compression of both carotid sinuses by bilaterally elongated styloid processes can lead to sudden death due to vagus-mediated cardiac inhibition.

Impingement of the carotid arteries by an elongated styloid process can result in direct mechanical damage and the development of a carotid dissection. Additionally, there has been a report of a distal extracranial internal carotid artery aneurysm developing in a patient with a prominent styloid process. Angiograms demonstrated the styloid process directly impinging on the aneurysmal sac, suggesting that repetitive trauma may have led to aneurysm formation. An external carotid artery pseudoaneurysm from a hyoid bone fracture has also been reported. However, no prior reports describe the development of an external carotid artery pseudoaneurysm as a result of Eagle syndrome. It is conceivable that these processes are related and occur due to traumatic injury to the carotid artery from the elongated styloid process.

### Stylohyoid Eagle syndrome and extracranial internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms (EXTINCT) with internal jugular vein nutcracker syndrome: A challenging clinical scenario [^116XMwR2]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome is a rare condition attributed to the elongation of the styloid process and the associated mineralization or ossification of the stylohyoid ligament. The symptoms are challenging and, at times, wrongly attributed to various facial neuralgias. There are two distinct types of primary Eagle syndrome: primary stylo-carotid and stylo-jugular syndrome. The former refers to stenosis or internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection, whereas the latter is due to impingement on the internal jugular vein (IJV) with venous reflux obstruction. The secondary or classic syndrome mainly occurs post-tonsillectomy, with irritation of the glossopharyngeal nerve by an inflamed styloid process.

We report a challenging case of combined carotid arterial and jugular venous styloid compression due to the tendinous and ligamentous attachments of the long styloid process, injuring the ICA and causing a pseudoaneurysm. Concomitant IJV compression due to a long C1 transverse process caused a venous compression by the styloid process on the IJV. The patient experienced various complaints over 10 years, exacerbating over the past 4 years. Diagnosing such a complex pathology requires a high index of suspicion.

### Eagle's syndrome, a rare cause of neck pain [^116VYD3p]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Eagle's syndrome (ES), sometimes called styloid or stylohyoid syndrome, is defined as the symptomatic elongation of the styloid process or mineralization of the stylohyoid ligament. The symptoms related to this condition can be confused with those attributed to a wide variety of facial neuralgias. We report a 34-year-old male patient who presented with recurrent neck pain and dysphagia. He was diagnosed with an elongated styloid process. An intraoral transtonsillar shortening of the styloid process was performed. We discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of ES, as well as provide a review of the literature.

### Stylohyoid eagle syndrome and extracranial internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms (EXTINCT) with internal jugular vein nutcracker syndrome: A challenging clinical scenario [^115TR6wv]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

We report a 4-year delay in diagnosing a combined carotid arterial and jugular venous styloid compression. The symptoms, which included dull neck pain, dizziness, intermittent diplopia, tinnitus, severe incapacitating right side headache, and eye bloating, were challenging and wrongly attributed initially to various facial neuralgias. The patient presented during the COVID-19 pandemic and was first labeled as having 'carotidynia' and later as having a transient perivascular inflammation of carotid artery syndrome. Combined targeted duplex ultrasonography and CT angiography with 3D reconstruction revealed a long styloid process and its tendinous-ligamentous attachments injuring the internal carotid artery. Moreover, there was substantial internal jugular vein compression on a long C1 transverse process with a nutcracker syndrome. Release of the tendinous portion of the long styloid process and repair of the carotid artery pseudoaneurysm ended the patient's complaints and allowed him to have a better quality of life.

### Endoscope-assisted resection of elongated styloid process through a retroauricular incision: A novel surgical approach to Eagle syndrome [^115v3UQi]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Conventional resection of the elongated styloid process is associated with large-scale tissue dissection and poor surgical exposure. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a novel surgical approach using an endoscopic technique to treat Eagle syndrome.

- **Materials and methods**: The authors implemented a retrospective cohort study composed of 133 patients undergoing endoscope-assisted styloidectomy (EAS) from June 2010 to August 2015 at a university teaching hospital. Outcome measurements included the length of the styloid process, blood loss, and duration of surgery. The simple verbal response scale for symptom relief, cosmetic appearance of the incision, and postoperative incision pain was used to assess patients' subjective satisfaction.

- **Results**: All patients underwent EAS without conversion to conventional surgery. One hundred seven patients (80.5%) achieved complete relief of symptoms, with 20 (15%) achieving partial relief. The residual length of the styloid process was 10.1 ± 4.4 mm. One hundred seventy-two incision sides (75.8%) had no pain during the postoperative evaluation. One side (0.4%) showed slight transient facial paresis, and 4 sides (1.8%) presented transient ear numbness. The vast majority of patients (122 of 133; 91.7%) considered the cosmetic appearance of the incision to be excellent.

The results of this study suggest that EAS provides a viable surgical approach for Eagle syndrome in terms of efficacy and safety.

### CT findings associated with Eagle syndrome [^111jZp8A]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2001). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome is an aggregate of symptoms caused by an elongated ossified styloid process, the cause of which remains unclear. This is a rare finding that often goes undetected in the absence of radiographic studies. In this case, we present the diagnostic CT and lateral view plain film radiography findings of a 39-year-old woman with clinical evidence of Eagle syndrome. Eagle syndrome can occur unilaterally or bilaterally and most frequently results in symptoms of dysphagia, headache, pain on rotation of the neck, pain on extension of the tongue, change in voice, and a sensation of hypersalivation. We present rare and diagnostic radiographic evidence of this on both plain film radiographs and CT scans. Although well documented in otolaryngology literature and dentistry literature, this syndrome has not been reported in the radiology literature.

### Stylohyoid eagle syndrome and extracranial internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms (EXTINCT) with internal jugular vein nutcracker syndrome: A challenging clinical scenario [^115KyU2Q]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

We believe that this challenging, complex case of nutcracker jugular vein compression and internal carotid artery (ICA) pseudoaneurysm due to the ossification of the stylohyoid ligamentous-tendinous process and C1 transverse process elongation is one of the first reported cases. The traditional Eagle syndrome focuses on arterial compression and does not include the combined arterial and venous compression syndrome. Therefore, we propose a classification of the primary stylo-carotid and stylo-jugular syndrome:

- **Classification of primary Eagle syndrome**:
	- **Type IA**: Primary stylo-carotid syndrome with mid-internal carotid artery (ICA) involvement.
	- **Type IB**: Primary stylo-carotid syndrome with proximal and mid-ICA involvement.
	- **Type II**: Primary stylo-jugular syndrome with impingement on the internal jugular vein (IJV).
	- **Type III**: Combined primary stylo-carotid-jugular syndrome.

The clinical presentation of our patient was the culmination of complex symptoms resulting from both arterial and venous pathologies, which were managed accordingly. Misdiagnoses and delayed time to diagnosis in primary stylo-carotid-jugular syndrome are due to the challenging nature of its symptoms and signs.

### Eagle syndrome presenting with external carotid artery pseudoaneurysm [^115ckxMi]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome refers to a clinical syndrome caused by the abnormal elongation of the styloid process with calcification or ossification of the stylohyoid ligament. We present the first reported case of Eagle syndrome resulting in an external carotid artery (ECA) pseudoaneurysm. A patient presented to the emergency room with an expanding, painful right-neck mass.

CT angiography with three-dimensional volume rendering showed a bilobed 4.0-cm right ECA pseudoaneurysm and bilateral ossification of the stylohyoid ligaments with a sharpened edge of the right styloid process at the level of the carotid artery. An aneurysmectomy was performed, and a common carotid to internal carotid bypass with reversed saphenous vein restored arterial continuity. Local resection of the styloid process with a rotational sternocleidomastoid flap was performed. The pathology report was consistent with a diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm. A six-month clinical follow-up confirmed the complete resolution of symptoms with no neurological deficits.

### Eagle syndrome presenting with cardiac sinoatrial arrest and recurrent syncope [^115LbVXY]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome (ES), also known as styloid syndrome, is a rare condition caused by pathological elongation of the styloid process. The abnormal styloid may impinge on adjacent structures, causing orofacial or cervical pain often triggered by head or neck movement. First described by Dr. Watt Eagle, it may result from surgical trauma (e.g. tonsillectomy), chronic irritation, or reactive ossifying hyperplasia. However, since many patients have no history of tonsillectomy, alternative explanations include abnormal angulation or accelerated age-related changes (insertional tendinosis).

Normal styloid processes are about 2.5 cm; lengths beyond this are considered elongated. ES is more frequently diagnosed in women, particularly in the third or fourth decade of life. It typically presents in two forms: classic ES and vascular ES. Classic ES often follows pharyngeal trauma or tonsillectomy and is associated with neuralgia (cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X), pharyngeal foreign body sensation, dysphagia, headache, and pain on cervical rotation. Vascular ES (stylocarotid syndrome) results from the compression of the carotid artery by the elongated styloid, potentially leading to syncope or transient cerebral ischemia. For example, Sun et al. demonstrated using real-time transcranial Doppler that tilting the head forward reduced middle cerebral artery flow velocity, reproducing presyncope. Returning the head to a neutral position restored normal flow velocity.

### Classic eagle's syndrome: Styloidectomy via the transcervical approach [^116wkn6S]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Eagle's syndrome was first described by Watt Eagle in 1937 as a syndrome of vague orofacial and cervical pain. He reported two variants: classic styloid and stylocarotid artery syndrome. Eagle's syndrome is a non-perceived and underdiagnosed clinical condition of the head and neck. This anomalous entity presents with neck pain, globus sensation, difficulty in turning the head, dysphagia, and odynophagia, along with various other symptoms resulting from irritation to nearby structures.

The surgical management of Eagle's syndrome consists of two major approaches: the transoral and the transcervical approaches. We report a case of classic bilateral elongated styloid process syndrome treated with transcervical styloidectomy for a painful left elongated styloid process. This provided permanent relief to the patient. The transcervical surgical approach for resection of the elongated styloid process in patients with Eagle's syndrome appears to be safe and effective, although the risk of transient marginal mandibular nerve weakness is notable.

### Stylohyoid eagle syndrome and extracranial internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms (EXTINCT) with internal jugular vein nutcracker syndrome: A challenging clinical scenario [^116fnHSk]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome usually presents with a characteristic dull and throbbing pain from the elongated styloid process, which is aggravated with deglutition and objectively reproduced by palpating the tonsillar fossa. Additionally, the anomalous stylohyoid complex anatomy can provoke ICA-IJV injury, such as dissection or thrombosis, with neck rotation, stretching, talking, laughing, and swallowing. Intraoral palpation can identify an elongated styloid process by placing the index finger in the tonsillar fossa and applying gentle pressure. These maneuvers can reproduce the pain, or the patient can feel it referred to the ear, face, or head. A standard styloid process length is usually impalpable.

A CT is the most accurate diagnostic test. However, CT angiogram lacks dynamic information. Therefore, a 3D CT reconstruction of the neck enables precise measurement of the length of the styloid process and the ossified stylohyoid ligament. Positional changes during CT angiogram can uncover the pathological anatomical relationship between carotid arteries and IJV with the cervical bony and cartilaginous structures, particularly during head rotation and swallowing.

Orthopantomogram and CT can both be used to assess the styloid process/stylohyoid ligament complex. CT with contrast medium and 3D reconstruction allows correct measurement of the length and angulation of the styloid process and evaluation of its relationships with the vascular and lateral-cervical nerve structures. It should be obtained with the patient's head appropriately positioned to reproduce symptoms that may demonstrate mechanical stress.

### Stylohyoid eagle syndrome and extracranial internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms (EXTINCT) with internal jugular vein nutcracker syndrome: a challenging clinical scenario [^113pDGfW]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Extracranial internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms (EXTINCT) account for 1% of arterial aneurysms. Any segment of the common carotid artery, external carotid artery, and ICA can be affected, although the ICA is most commonly involved. The pathological presentations of the stylohyoid complex include carotid dissection, pseudoaneurysm, stenosis, or occlusion due to direct compression and pressure-induced plaque formation and rupture due to constructional changes at the carotid wall leading to alterations in blood flow and shear force. This repetitive mechanical interference on the carotid artery wall can cause vessel wall injury and intimal thrombus formation with cerebral embolization, triggering neurovascular events.

In a multicenter case-control study of carotid artery dissection patients, Renard et al. demonstrated that shorter distances between the stylohyoid complex and ICA result in mechanical injury, predisposing individuals to carotid artery dissection. Schneider et al. considered the phenomenon of mechanical trauma to the ICA leading to thrombus formation, embolization, and recurrent TIAs, and called it carotid artery entrapment syndrome.

There are no guidelines or treatment algorithms due to the scarcity of cases. The rarity of extracranial primary internal carotid pseudoaneurysms associated with Eagle syndrome means that there is a lack of evidence and publication bias in selecting treatment options. However, surgical partial bone resection and the release of ligamentous-tendinous entrapment have proved to be safe and effective, helping to restore blood flow integrity.

### Surgical management of Eagle syndrome: A 17-year experience with open and transoral robotic styloidectomy [^115TNimP]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Low credibility.

Eagle Syndrome (ES) is a rare disorder that can present with symptoms ranging from globus sensation to otalgia due to an elongated styloid process and/or calcified stylohyoid ligament. No standardized treatment algorithm exists, and although various surgical approaches have been described, data on the use of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in this population is limited. To investigate the utility of TORS in the treatment of ES, a retrospective review of 19 ES patients was conducted at a single academic, tertiary medical center between 2000 and 2017. Nineteen patients underwent twenty-one styloid resections: 6 performed via TORS and 15 via the transcervical approach.

Across all patients, 90% reported some degree of lasting improvement in symptoms, while 55% reported significant improvement. When TORS was compared to transcervical resection, there was no significant difference in the subjective rate of "meaningful" (83% vs. 57%) versus "non-meaningful" symptom improvement (17% vs. 43%) [p = 0.35]. There was a trend towards less estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time, and post-operative length of stay (LOS) with TORS versus transcervical cases (9.2 mL vs. 30.0 mL, 98 vs. 156 min, and 0.7 vs. 1.2 days); however, these did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.11, 0.13, and 0.42, respectively). Three patients experienced complications associated with an open approach, compared to none with TORS. In select patients, TORS styloidectomy is a reasonable surgical alternative to traditional transoral and transcervical techniques as it provides similar symptom improvement.

### Eagle syndrome presenting as anterior ischaemic neuropathy: a multidisciplinary approach [^112dheZC]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome is a rare entity that occurs when an elongated styloid process compresses the neck vasculonervous structures. A 47-year-old female patient was referred to our glaucoma clinic for a second opinion concerning bilateral visual field progression despite maximal tolerated medical therapy. After aggressive intraocular pressure lowering and resorting to surgical and optimized medical treatment, the visual field kept stable in the right eye but was still showing progression in the left eye. As the optic disc was paler in the left eye and following a full appreciation of systemic complaints, including left neck, ear, and eye pain, a multidisciplinary approach with otorhinolaryngology was prompted. Plain radiographs of the skull showed an elongated styloid process on the left side, compatible with Eagle syndrome. Surgical resection of the styloid process provided definitive relief of the patient's eye, ear, and neck pain. Since this intervention, there was no further deterioration of the visual field defect in the left eye.

### Eagle syndrome presenting with cardiac sinoatrial arrest and recurrent syncope [^113tcNx3]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Management of Eagle syndrome (ES) may include conservative treatment using analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or transpharyngeal steroid/lidocaine injections. Surgical options involve resection via intraoral or external approaches. External surgery offers broader exposure for removing ossified ligaments but carries risks such as facial nerve injury and visible scarring.

This case presents what is, to our knowledge, a novel manifestation of ES as cardioinhibitory syncope due to sinoatrial arrest, mimicking carotid sinus syndrome. This condition is characterized by an exaggerated response to carotid sinus stimulation, with afferent signals from the vagus nerve transmitted to the nucleus solitarius, triggering a parasympathetic response: bradycardia (up to AV block or sinus arrest), vasodilation, and hypotension.

The 2018 ESC guidelines recommend pacemaker implantation (Class IIa) in patients over 40 years with spontaneous symptomatic pauses longer than 3 seconds or asymptomatic pauses longer than 6 seconds due to sinus arrest or AV block. Early pacing in cardioinhibitory responses may prevent syncope by maintaining cerebral perfusion. In our patient, dual-chamber pacemaker implantation was followed by styloidectomy. Whether pacemaker support will remain necessary postoperatively is unclear. Device interrogation after 3 months showed 98% native rhythm, 2% pacing, and no documented sinoatrial arrest. Long-term follow-up is required to assess continued pacemaker necessity.

- **Learning points**: Eagle syndrome is a rare condition that may present as carotid sinus syndrome with sinoatrial arrest. Bilateral elongated styloid processes can be identified with appropriate diagnostic imaging, which aids in the diagnosis and management of the condition.

### Eagle's syndrome associated with lingual nerve paresthesia: a case report [^112tRBER]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Eagle's syndrome is characterized by a variety of symptoms, including throat pain, sensation of a foreign body in the pharynx, dysphagia, referred otalgia, and neck and throat pain exacerbated by head rotation. Any styloid process longer than 25 mm should be considered elongated and will usually be responsible for Eagle's syndrome. Surgical resection of the elongated styloid is a routine treatment and can be accomplished using a transoral or an extraoral approach. We report a patient with a rare giant styloid process that was approximately 81.7 mm. He complained of a rare symptom: hemitongue paresthesia. After removal of the elongated styloid process using the extraoral approach, his symptoms, including the hemitongue paresthesia, were alleviated. We concluded that if the styloid process displays medium to severe elongation, the extraoral approach will be appropriate.

### Internal carotid dissection caused by an elongated styloid process (Eagle syndrome) [^114HENZG]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome, which involves symptoms associated with an elongated styloid process (SP), is commonly divided into two presentations. First, the so-called classic Eagle syndrome, where patients can present with unilateral sore throat, dysphagia, tinnitus, unilateral facial and neck pain, and otalgia. Second is the vascular or stylocarotid form of Eagle syndrome, in which the elongated SP is in contact with the extracranial internal carotid artery.

We describe two cases of internal carotid artery dissection associated with an elongated SP. One case involves a patient with ischemic stroke, while the other concerns a patient with transient ischemic attacks caused by an elongated SP. A surgical resection of the SP was performed on the former patient. Both patients were treated with anticoagulation and recovered well. A literature search revealed only two prior descriptions of carotid dissection in the context of an elongated SP.

### Stylohyoid Eagle syndrome and extracranial internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms (EXTINCT) with internal jugular vein nutcracker syndrome: A challenging clinical scenario [^116f2qWt]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A man in his 70s presented to his general practitioner with slowly progressive intermittent dull pain in the anterior triangle of the upper right neck for 10 years. It was associated with dizziness, intermittent diplopia, sharp agonizing incapacitating right-sided headache, tinnitus, and eye bloating that exacerbated over the past 4 years. The pain was localized to the tonsillar fossa and accompanied by dysphagia, a foreign body sensation, sore throat, and voice changes. It was worsened by head movements such as looking up, turning the face to the left side, or lying on a pillow.

The patient underwent several consultations over this period, including visits to otolaryngology, neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, and dentistry. He was a non-drinker and non-smoker, and he did not have a family history of cardiovascular disease or aneurysms. There was no history of trauma. The patient had an appendectomy at the age of 14 and a tonsillectomy at 32. He underwent transurethral resection of the prostate followed by radiotherapy in 2013 for prostate cancer. He had a first-degree heart block with a normal coronary angiogram. His medications included statins and calcium channel blockers. Frequent MRIs of the brain performed before he presented to us delineated mild chronic microvascular ischemic changes, which were age-appropriate, but there were no acute intracranial events. The MRIs were confined to the brain, and he did not have an MRI of the cervical region or a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the carotid arteries.

The patient was admitted to a regional hospital.

### Stylohyoid eagle syndrome and extracranial internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms (EXTINCT) with internal jugular vein nutcracker syndrome: a challenging clinical scenario [^1132SsVu]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The imprecise symptoms portrayed by IJV compression syndrome often result in delayed or missed diagnosis:

- **Head symptoms**: Severe bouts of unilateral headache, head noise, dizziness, and memory decline.

- **Eye symptoms**: Eye congestion, diplopia, blurred vision, and visual field defects.

- **Ear symptoms**: Tinnitus, high-frequency hearing decline, neck discomfort, or sleeping disorder.

The IJV J3 segment is most frequently involved. The jugular venous wall is thinner and lacks smooth muscle and elastic fibers. The IJV is susceptible under extrinsic compression, which is why cervical bony cartilaginous structures deform it. A targeted duplex ultrasound scan of the IJV is the most sensitive, but magnetic resonance venography is superior to computed tomographic venography for diagnosis accuracy. Li et al. documented that after an accurate diagnosis of Eagle jugular syndrome, conservative treatments are worthless for the styloid-induced IJV syndrome, and jugular stenting offers no benefit. Styloidectomy is the only effective management.

Styloidogenic jugular compression is a nosological entity, having a variety of syndromic names, including 'styloidogenic-cervical spondylotic internal jugular venous compression', 'Eagle jugular syndrome', or 'styloid-induced IJV stenosis'. Venous flow impairment due to styloidogenic compression can result in an imbalance in venous-cerebrospinal fluid and the lymphatic system. The symptomatologies of headache, tinnitus, insomnia, and visual impairment are almost pathognomonic. These constellations of symptoms are not explained by any other common neurosurgical disorders.

### Eagle syndrome: A wide spectrum of clinical and neuroradiological findings from cervico-facial pain to cerebral ischemia [^1114yL99]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome (ES) is a rare symptomatic condition generally caused by abnormal elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylo-hyoid ligament. Patients with ES typically present a variety of symptoms, which range from mild discomfort to acute neurologic and referred pain in the head-and-neck region. Eagle syndrome can be identified through physical examination but often goes undetected without imaging studies. Although uncommon, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with cervico-facial pain.

The authors report three cases with clinical evidence of ES, including both neurologic and vascular patterns, supported by clinical and radiological diagnosis. They also propose a brief review of the syndrome's main clinical presentations, diagnostic studies, and some treatment options.

### Tonsillectomy sparing transoral robot assisted styloidectomy [^111LooUT]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). High credibility.

Eagle Syndrome can present with a variety of symptoms and be caused by an elongated styloid process or calcified stylohyoid ligament. Patients failing medical management of this disorder may be treated with surgical excision of the styloid process. In the literature, both transoral and transcervical approaches have been described. Although transoral approaches typically begin with a tonsillectomy, tonsil-sparing approaches have also been utilized. With the advent of robotic surgery, the potential for a tonsillectomy sparing approach has become a feasible alternative, preventing the pain and morbidity associated with adult tonsillectomy while continuing to provide superior exposure and instrumentation. We report three successful cases of patients treated with tonsillectomy sparing transoral robot assisted styloidectomy. This represents the first application of this technique in the literature and suggests the potential for a paradigm shift in the surgical management of this disease.

Surgery is the definitive treatment that includes styloidectomy and/or release of the tendinous stylohyoid insertion. An open cervical neck approach was adopted for our patient. Following a cervical neck incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the distal end of the styloid process was lifted, and its proximity to the hypoglossal, glossopharyngeal, vagus, and chorda tympani of the facial nerve was observed. The ligamentous and/or tendinous structure strapped to the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) was cut. The pointing and angle of the styloid process allowed it to spring away, enlarging the space for both the artery and the vein (Figure 2). Once the styloid process recoiled out of the surgical field, the entire space was freed to perform an end-to-end ICA anastomosis (Figure 3). The internal jugular vein (IJV) expanded, and its physiological response was restored with the visualization of the 'A' wave and oscillation.

### Eagle syndrome presenting with cardiac sinoatrial arrest and recurrent syncope [^113fx9Pm]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A man in his mid-40s presented with episodes of syncope, some of which were triggered by neck extension. In-hospital telemetry documented sinoatrial arrest with a prolonged asystole of 11 seconds. Computed tomography of the neck demonstrated bilateral elongation of the styloid processes consistent with Eagle syndrome (ES). Vagal reflex stimulation was suspected as the underlying mechanism. A dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted prior to surgical styloidectomy. At a 3-month follow-up, pacemaker interrogation revealed 2% pacing activity, with no further syncopal episodes. This case highlights an unusual cardioinhibitory presentation of ES and supports early pacing when surgical resolution of vagal stimulation remains uncertain.

### Eagle syndrome: Entrapment of the glossopharyngeal nerve? Case report and review of the literature [^111y4Lti]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome is characterized by unilateral pain in the oropharynx, the side of the face, and the earlobe. It is caused by an elongated styloid process; resection of the elongated process eliminates the pain. Although quite rare, this syndrome is well represented in the oral, ear, nose, and throat surgery literature. In the neurosurgical literature, on the other hand, there is little, if any, mention of Eagle syndrome.

The author presents a case of a woman who suffered from severe pain in the throat, the side of the face, and the ear. After the diagnosis of Eagle syndrome was made based on radiographic findings and confirmed using a local anesthetic block, resection of the elongated styloid process was performed, resulting in complete and lasting pain relief. Eagle syndrome, which is caused by compression of the glossopharyngeal nerve as it passes the elongated styloid process, may be classified as an entrapment syndrome deserving of neurosurgical attention. The goal of this report is to familiarize neurosurgeons with Eagle syndrome and its diagnostic work-up and treatment.

### A rare cause of recurrent cerebral ischemia and syncope: Eagle syndrome [^111GY6iF]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome is defined as symptomatic elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylohyoid and stylomandibular ligament. The syndrome was first described by W.W. Eagle in 1937. The styloid process is located between the internal and external carotid arteries and laterally in the tonsillar fossa. Cases of cerebrovascular ischemia causing syncope or hemiparesis due to Eagle syndrome are rarely published in the literature. The authors presented a patient with cerebrovascular attacks due to a long styloid process.

### Transient velopharyngeal insufficiency after calcified stylohyoid ligament resection [^1112ERcE]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Elongation of the stylohyoid process or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament is known as Eagle syndrome. It is mostly seen incidentally on imaging or with extreme suspicion, and usually, patients are asymptomatic. Surgery is the preferred method in symptomatic patients, with transcervical or transoral methods often selected as the surgical route. A 28-year-old female patient, who had formerly undergone a tonsillectomy, presented with throat and ear pain. A neck computed tomography was performed, and she was diagnosed with Eagle syndrome. Surgery was recommended.

The patient developed transient velopharyngeal insufficiency on postoperative day 4. Ventilation exercises and follow-up were recommended. The patient's complaints decreased by the 15th day. It should be kept in mind that the stylohyoid ligament may be calcified in both young and middle-aged patients with dysphagia or odynophagia, and a differential diagnosis should be considered. Another issue is the condition of velopharyngeal insufficiency, which may occur due to the damage of the pharyngeal muscles by deep dissection during surgery.

### Does transcervical styloidectomy for Eagle syndrome improve quality of life [^115PU4cV]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome is an uncommon disorder that significantly impacts the quality of life (QoL) of patients. No formal QoL study has been carried out on a population of Eagle syndrome patients treated via the transcervical approach. This study aims to evaluate and analyze the outcomes of patients with Eagle syndrome treated with transcervical styloidectomy using a modified QoL survey.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was employed for patients with Eagle syndrome who underwent transcervical styloidectomy at the institution from January 2008 until December 2018. Two QoL surveys were sent to subjects. Patients were asked preoperatively and postoperatively about the presence and intensity of pain, alteration of speech, diet or chewing, limitations of daily activity, mobility or recreation, and the presence of anxiety or mood disturbances related to the disease. The styloid length on preoperative computed tomography scans and the length of the surgical specimen were obtained, and correlations with the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) were analyzed. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to determine numerical correlation. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and a P-value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.

- **Results**: The study sample comprised 10 patients with Eagle syndrome who underwent transcervical styloidectomy. Eight patients underwent unilateral styloidectomy, and 2 patients were bilateral. Most patients were female (80%) with a mean age of 46.0. The preoperative NPRS score averaged 5.5 ± 2.7 (range 1 to 10) and postoperative NPRS was…

### Eagle syndrome: an incidental finding in a trauma patient: a case report [^115BnoWW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome is a rare condition characterized by an elongated styloid process that occasionally irritates or disrupts adjacent anatomical structures. Although this is well known in the literature, it is rarely at the forefront of the clinician's mind. In the trauma patient, awareness of Eagle syndrome and knowledge of the anatomy associated with it may help differentiate symptoms secondary to acute injury from the chronic symptoms of this syndrome.

- **Objectives**: To review the diagnostic and treatment modalities related to Eagle syndrome and its associated anatomical structures germane to the trauma patient.

- **Case report**: A 42-year-old African American man presented with neck, face, head, and back pain after being assaulted. The patient noted that he had a long history of foreign body sensation on the right side of his neck with occasional difficulty swallowing. On physical examination, the patient was found to have a solitary, 1-cm laceration in the left parietal scalp. The physical examination was unremarkable other than the scalp hematoma and laceration. Computed tomography scans of the head, face, and cervical spine were negative for acute injury other than a small scalp hematoma and a markedly enlarged right styloid process, measuring approximately 8 cm, with ossification of the stylohyoid ligament to the level of the hyoid bone.

- **Conclusion**: In the trauma patient, awareness of Eagle syndrome and knowledge of the anatomy associated with it may help differentiate symptoms secondary to acute injury from the chronic symptoms of this syndrome.

### Evidence-based cervical facet consensus: access or outcome [^1124QGTD]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The guidelines represent more than just a consensus. They offer a detailed and extensively referenced review of the evidence pertinent to each question, acknowledging when evidence is nonexistent, conflicting, arguable, or suspect. The result is a comprehensive literature review that strives not to endorse any particular bias, as physicians and their societies often have strong opinions regarding their practice habits and recommendations.

We thank Brian Sites for graciously inviting us to write an editorial and providing a forum for discussing the cervical guidelines that emphasize inclusiveness over division.

### Eagle syndrome presenting with external carotid artery pseudoaneurysm [^113C6UFa]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

This is the first reported case of Eagle syndrome causing a pseudoaneurysm of the ECA. Eagle syndrome should be suspected in individuals with symptoms of stylo-carotid compression and can be suggested by characteristic CT findings, most pertinently a heavily ossified and calcified styloid process. CT scans can be used to determine the length of the styloid process, with recent findings suggesting 3D CT to be superior for this task. The normal length of the styloid process is estimated to be 2.5 cm, and it is generally accepted that a length greater than 3 cm is elongated. The incidence of styloid process elongation has been estimated to be as high as 28% and as low as 4%. However, only a small subset of patients with an elongated styloid process ever experiences any symptoms. Eagle estimated that 4% have symptoms, while other studies have found symptoms in as many as 10%. Styloid process elongation is usually bilateral, but symptoms generally appear on only one side.

There are two forms of the syndrome, both originally described by Eagle in 1937. The "classic Eagle syndrome" is usually seen in patients after tonsillectomy. Patients typically present with symptoms of ipsilateral cervicofacial pain, dysphagia, sensation of a foreign body in the throat, vertigo, tinnitus, and otalgia. Additional symptoms which may manifest include a persistent sore throat, sensation of a foreign body in the pharynx, painful trismus, vocal changes, and alterations in taste. The symptoms are thought to be due to the impingement of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X by the elongated styloid process.

### Eagle syndrome: Case report and review of the literature [^113RPr2m]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome, which is an uncommon sequela of elongation of the styloid process, can manifest as pain in the anterolateral neck, often with referred pain to the ear. In most cases, the elongation is an acquired condition, often occurring as a result of a traumatic incident, including tonsillectomy. We describe the case of a 57-year-old man who experienced unremitting right neck pain for several years following an accidental fall. A multidisciplinary investigation identified an elongated styloid process. Surgical shortening of the structure provided definitive relief of the patient's symptoms. We review the anatomy of the peristyloid structures and discuss the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of Eagle syndrome.

### Eagle's syndrome: Importance of a corrected diagnosis and adequate surgical treatment [^112wRJFf]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Elongation of the styloid process and calcification of the stylohyoid ligament, as described by Eagle, are often reported in the literature. Properly called Eagle's syndrome or stylalgia, this condition is characterized by distinct symptoms and etiology, distinguishing it from pathologies with partially overlapping symptoms due to adjacent anatomical structures. A correct differential diagnosis is paramount for choosing the most adequate treatment.

### Oral gepotidacin versus nitrofurantoin in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection (EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3): two randomised, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3, non-inferiority trials [^112UsGfP]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

The study EAGLE-2, published in the journal Lancet in 2024 by Florian Wagenlehner and colleagues, investigates acute cystitis. The trial question was whether gepotidacin is noninferior to nitrofurantoin in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The population consisted of 607 female patients. Inclusion criteria included adolescent and adult female patients with uncomplicated UTIs. Key exclusion criteria were residence in a nursing home or dependent care-type facility, history of sensitivity to study treatments, immunocompromised state, COPD, acute porphyria, any surgical or medical condition, and G6PD deficiency.

- **Interventions**:
	- 320 patients received an oral dose of 1,500 mg BID of gepotidacin for 5 days
	- 287 patients received an oral dose of 100 mg BID of nitrofurantoin for 5 days

- **Primary outcome**:
	- Difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in therapeutic success (50.6% vs. 47%; AD 4.3%, 95% CI -3.6 to 12.1)

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in clinical success (65.6% vs. 65.2%; AD 1.2%, 95% CI -6.3 to 8.7)
	- No significant difference in microbiological success (72.5% vs. 67.6%; AD 5.2%, 95% CI -2.1 to 12.5)

In conclusion, the study found that gepotidacin was noninferior to nitrofurantoin with respect to therapeutic success in adolescent and adult female patients with uncomplicated UTIs.

### Eagle syndrome: 3D endoscope-assisted anterior tonsillar fossa approach to styloid process [^113goKDS]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the potential advantages of the 3D endoscope-assisted anterior tonsillar fossa approach to the elongated styloid process.

- **Methods**: A 58-year-old woman was reported to our department with a one-year history of odynophagia, latero-cervical pain on the left side, and ipsilateral foreign body sensation. The pain was dull and intermittent in nature. The patient had visited different clinics and underwent physiatric and maxillo-facial evaluations with two dental extractions, all without any relief of symptoms. On physical examination, a hard, bony consistency area was palpated over the left-sided tonsillar fossa, causing severe pain. Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) confirmed an anomalous length of the left styloid process, leading to a diagnosis of Eagle's syndrome (ES). After careful surgical and anesthesiology evaluation, we decided to proceed with the partial excision of the styloid process using a 3D endoscope-assisted transoral anterior tonsillar fossa approach (Reddy et al, 2020).

- **Results**: The patient was relieved of her symptoms after the surgery and was discharged after one day. Postsurgical healing was uneventful. Pharyngodynia was observed for the first 48 hours and treated with anti-inflammatory medication. No early or late postoperative complications, including massive bleeding, neurovascular injury, or infection, were encountered. At a one-year follow-up visit, the patient was still asymptomatic, and the CT scan did not show any abnormalities. The 3D endoscope provided high-quality magnification of the tonsillar fossa, which allowed us to accurately conduct the procedure.

### Eagle's syndrome: A report of 4 patients treated using a modified extraoral approach [^117LNhue]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a slightly modified extraoral approach to removing the symptomatic elongated styloid process. A brief description of this surgical technique and its comparison to the intraoral approach is provided.

- **Patients and methods**: Four patients were evaluated using an extraoral approach to expose and remove the elongated calcified stylohyoid complex. Five sides were treated and reviewed individually. All patients were interviewed preoperatively and postoperatively, and their records were thoroughly examined. Patients were objectively evaluated for pain, function, sensory and motor nerve deficits, and aesthetics.

- **Results**: Follow-up time ranged from 6 to 39 months with an average of 21 months. Improvement in the original symptoms was reported for 4 of the 5 operated sides. Three of 5 procedures resulted in more than an 80% reduction in pain and improvement in function. All patients had a satisfactory cosmetic result and no paresthesia.

- **Conclusions**: The advantages of the extraoral approach are reflected in this small retrospective study by the absence of perioperative complications and the minimal blood loss, surgical morbidity, and hospital stay.

### Eagle syndrome [^113d61QB]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome, also known as an elongated styloid process, is a condition first described by Watt Eagle in 1937. It occurs when an elongated styloid process or a calcified stylohyoid ligament causes throat pain, a foreign body sensation, dysphagia, or facial pain. Additional symptoms may include neck or throat pain with radiation to the ipsilateral ear. It is usually hard to diagnose because the symptoms can be confused with those attributed to a wide variety of facial neuralgias. This article reports a case of Eagle syndrome exhibiting unilateral symptoms with bilateral elongation of the styloid process.

### Elongated styloid process (Eagle's syndrome): A clinical study [^117H9ydD]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Elongated styloid process can be a source of craniofacial and cervical pain and remains a diagnostic challenge to many. The aim of the study was to determine the symptomatology and various criteria for the diagnosis of an elongated styloid process and its management. Our clinical study consisted of 58 patients with elongated styloid process who had symptoms of vague cervicofacial pain and presented to our department during a period of 10 years. Special emphasis is given to palpation of the tonsillar fossa, lidocaine infiltration test, and orthopantomography.

Minimal complications and zero incidence of deep neck infection were noted. All of the patients were managed surgically through the intraoral approach, which was found to be a safe procedure.

### Complete recovery after an intraoral approach for Eagle syndrome [^1132Y6Y7]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome is considered a rare disease. It is characterized by a collection of symptoms that include neck, throat, and hemifacial pain; sensation of a foreign body in the throat; dysphagia; otalgia; and changes in voice, which result directly from an elongated styloid process or calcified stylohyoid ligament. Clinical diagnosis is generally challenging and must be confirmed by radiological imaging.

Our patient was a 37-year-old woman with a three-year history of dysphagia and foreign body sensation. A computed tomographic scan revealed a long left styloid process and calcification in the upper part of the stylohyoid ligament, suggestive of Eagle syndrome. The patient underwent surgical removal of the elongated styloid process through an intraoral approach. At nine months post-surgery, the patient was symptom-free.

Regarding medical management for antiphospholipid syndrome, specifically in the context of managing recurrent thrombosis, the EULAR 2019 guidelines recommend considering one of the following options for patients with recurrent arterial thrombosis despite adequate treatment with VKA, after evaluating other potential causes:

- **Targeting an INR of 3–4**: Patients should aim for this international normalized ratio as a therapeutic target.
- **Adding low-dose aspirin to therapy**: Consider incorporating aspirin to enhance the treatment plan.
- **Switching to LMWH**: Transition to low molecular weight heparin as an alternative course of action.

### Eagle syndrome as a cause of transient ischemic attacks [^111N6hdk]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome is an uncommon entity but is well known in the otorhinolaryngology and oral surgery literature. This syndrome results from the compression of cranial nerves in the neck by an elongated styloid process, causing unilateral cervical and facial pain. The styloid process can also cause compression of the cervical carotid arteries, leading to the so-called carotid artery syndrome along with carotidynia or neurological symptoms due to flow reduction in these arteries.

The authors discuss the case of a 70-year-old man who suffered from transient ischemic attacks when turning his head to the left, with immediate remission of symptoms when his head returned to the neutral position. The patient was studied with dynamic angiography, which clearly showed focal flow restriction. Upon diagnosis, the styloid process was removed surgically, and the patient completely recovered from his symptoms. A postoperative angiogram demonstrated complete resolution of the pathology.

Neurosurgeons might encounter patients with Eagle syndrome and should be aware of the symptoms and signs. Once the diagnosis is made, the treatment is clear and very effective.

### Transcervical styloidectomy for Eagle syndrome [^1117Tpc1]. Head & Neck (2022). Low credibility.

We demonstrate a safe and effective surgical technique for the operative management of Eagle syndrome, also known as stylohyoid syndrome, via transcervical styloidectomy. Fifteen patients who presented to our institution for surgical management of Eagle syndrome were included. A detailed video shows the operative techniques used to perform styloidectomy via a transcervical approach. The procedure was well tolerated without complications, and all patients were discharged on postoperative day one.

Thirteen patients (87%) endorsed significant improvement or complete resolution of their presenting complaints, most commonly throat and neck pain or discomfort (53%), otalgia (47%), and/or tinnitus (40%). The transcervical approach for styloidectomy provides an alternative for operative access that overcomes the limitations associated with the transoral approach. It enables better exposure of the operative field, a more efficient procedure, and, in the senior author's experience, results in decreased postoperative pain, trismus, and length of hospital stay.
