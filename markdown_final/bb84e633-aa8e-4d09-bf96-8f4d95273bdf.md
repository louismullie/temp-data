## Question

How many units of insulin reverse opioid overdose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many units of insulin are required to reverse an opioid overdose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether insulin has any role at all in opioid overdose reversal. Then, I should verify what the evidence-based reversal agent is and its dosing units. Next, I should review FDA labeling and clinical data for recommended doses and routes. After that, I need to consider repeat dosing, fentanyl-era nuances, and special cases like buprenorphine. Finally, I will conclude with a clear, clinically aligned answer and safety caveats, making sure I have not missed any mention of insulin in the provided sources [^115aT8vt] [^114kJeuH] [^115QUarr].

> Wait, let me verify whether any provided documents even mention insulin in this context, because I need to ensure I am not overlooking an uncommon practice or a niche scenario. I should double-check the source set: everything here centers on naloxone as the opioid antagonist and the standard of care for overdose reversal, with no role for insulin discussed anywhere in these references, which repeatedly emphasize naloxone's centrality in overdose management and distribution programs [^114ay4Dg] [^117HP9b2] [^116iaZLA] [^111nZKSX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the mechanistic and guideline consensus. Naloxone is the opioid receptor antagonist used to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression and remains the only available treatment for that purpose, while insulin is not an opioid antagonist and is not used in overdose reversal protocols in these sources, so there are no "units of insulin" applicable here [^115QUarr] [^113S5b1z] [^114ay4Dg].

> Let me think about dosing units and starting doses, because I need to ensure I'm providing labeled, route-specific guidance. Initially, I was going to say IM dosing is always 0.4–2 mg, but wait, I should verify labeling ranges: some FDA SPL entries list IM dosing ranges from 0.2–4 mg for reversal, while IV labeling commonly specifies 0.4–2 mg, all in milligrams, not insulin units, and titration is based on clinical response with the possibility of repeat dosing every 2–3 minutes, often escalating to a cumulative 10 mg in refractory cases, depending on context and response [^113f9mHw] [^115aT8vt] [^112BZMz1].

> Next, I should review intranasal options, because bystander formulations are common and some users may be holding 4 mg IN naloxone. Let me verify comparative effectiveness: a randomized trial found 0.8 mg IM restored breathing within 10 minutes more reliably than 1.4 mg IN, indicating route and dose matter for time-to-reversal, while pharmacokinetic studies show that 2 mg IN achieves early exposure comparable to 0.4 mg IM and higher sustained levels, supporting repeated IN dosing if needed, again all in milligrams, not insulin units [^114kJeuH] [^112R6yAt] [^113CaKAu].

> I should confirm special situations and the need for repeat dosing and supportive care, especially in fentanyl-era overdoses and long-acting or high-affinity opioids, because I need to ensure safety. Evidence and guidance note variable responsiveness and risk of re-narcotization; ventilation and calling emergency services are essential, and with buprenorphine exposures higher or repeated naloxone doses may be necessary due to receptor kinetics, with explicit labeling to educate patients and underscore that naloxone's effects are temporary and EMS activation is mandatory [^115QUarr] [^115V2zn6] [^114WZkUu] [^113eCzQm].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also consider adverse effects from "over-antagonism", because dose titration matters clinically. Lower effective doses can reduce naloxone-related adverse events in ED series, and very high cumulative out-of-hospital doses have been associated with increased pulmonary complications, so careful titration to the minimal dose that restores adequate ventilation is prudent while continuing supportive care and monitoring [^114GksWL] [^1123oN1S].

> Let me reconsider the core question to be sure my conclusion is unambiguous: insulin does not reverse opioid overdose, so there are no "units of insulin" to give; the correct agent is naloxone in milligrams, titrated by route and clinical response, with typical adult initial parenteral doses of 0.4–2 mg IV/IM and repeats every 2–3 minutes as needed, or intranasal formulations such as 2–4 mg with repeat dosing per product instructions and clinical response, along with immediate ventilation support and EMS activation [^115aT8vt] [^113f9mHw] [^114kJeuH] [^112R6yAt] [^113eCzQm].

Zero units of **insulin** are used to reverse opioid overdose. Insulin is not indicated for opioid overdose reversal; the **standard treatment is naloxone** [^114ay4Dg], an opioid antagonist, administered at 0.4–2 mg IV/IM/SC [^115aT8vt] [^113f9mHw] [^1146xMSW] or 2–4 mg intranasally [^112R6yAt], repeated every 2–3 minutes as needed [^111AHsCn] [^112BZMz1]. Insulin is only used if the patient is hyperglycemic or diabetic, and has no role in reversing opioid-induced respiratory depression [^115QUarr].

---

## Pharmacological rationale

Opioid overdose causes respiratory depression via μ-opioid receptor activation in the brainstem [^115QUarr]. Naloxone, a **competitive antagonist** at these receptors, rapidly reverses respiratory depression and restores consciousness [^116VM3sZ]. Insulin, by contrast, regulates blood glucose and **has no known interaction with opioid receptors** or opioid-induced respiratory depression.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) state that **naloxone is the standard treatment** for opioid overdose [^114ay4Dg]. Recommended doses include:

- **Intravenous (IV) route**: 0.4–2 mg IV once, repeated every 2–3 minutes as needed [^115aT8vt].
- **Intramuscular (IM) route**: 0.2–4 mg IM once, repeated every 2–3 minutes as needed [^113f9mHw].
- **Subcutaneous (SC) route**: 0.4–2 mg SC once, repeated every 2–3 minutes as needed [^1146xMSW].
- **Intranasal (IN) route**: 2–4 mg IN, repeated every 2–3 minutes as needed [^113CaKAu].

These guidelines **do not mention insulin as a treatment** because it does not reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression [^115QUarr].

## Risks associated with insulin administration in opioid overdose

Administering insulin during opioid overdose carries **significant risks**, chiefly hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can cause seizures, coma, or death if not promptly recognized and treated. In this setting — where patients may already be unconscious or have altered mental status — insulin-induced hypoglycemia can worsen the condition and complicate clinical management.

---

## Clinical scenarios where insulin may be administered

Insulin may be given to patients with opioid overdose only if a concurrent medical condition requires it, such as diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. In such cases, insulin is **unrelated to the opioid overdose itself** and is managed separately from the overdose treatment.

---

## Conclusion

Insulin is **not used to reverse opioid overdose**. The sole recommended treatment for opioid overdose is naloxone, an opioid antagonist that rapidly reverses opioid-induced respiratory depression [^114ay4Dg]. Administering insulin to patients with opioid overdose without a medical indication is inappropriate and potentially dangerous due to the risk of hypoglycemia.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^111AHsCn]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Exploratory analyses were conducted additionally to consider early exposure relative to the i.m. reference and repeat naloxone administration.

- **Early naloxone absorption**: Given that Tmax may not describe the early absorption curve fully, three exploratory PK parameters were introduced to assess early exposure from i.n. relative to 0.4 mg i.m. naloxone: t 50% [defined as time taken to achieve blood levels of 50% of Cmax (C50%)]; AUCp (partial AUC from time of dosing to median Tmax of i.m. naloxone); and, for i.n. administration, T50% ref (time taken to reach the C50% of the primary reference 0.4 mg i.m.).

- **Simulation of repeat administration**: In emergency medicine, naloxone doses may be repeated to achieve overdose reversal. Therefore, simulations of repeat administrations were performed using the superposition approach. Superposition relies upon linear pharmacokinetics and employs a simple overlay technique, assuming that observed plasma concentrations following a single dose can be used to predict plasma concentrations after multiple dosing. Opioid overdose management guidelines typically recommend initial administration of 0.4 mg naloxone, repeated every 2–3 minutes if necessary. Consequently, we simulated repeat administration of five doses of the 0.4 mg i.m. reference at 3-minute intervals (simulating the upper limit of the recommended dose range, 2 mg i.m.) versus two doses of 2 mg i.n. at 3-minute intervals (simulating similar naloxone exposure, assuming 50% i.n. bioavailability).

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^112BZMz1]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Naloxone is an essential tool for reversing opioid overdoses. On the street, it is typically administered via nasal spray or intramuscular/subcutaneous injection by bystanders or first responders. Due to naloxone's short half-life of 30 to 90 minutes, its effectiveness is often limited, necessitating multiple doses to prevent re-narcotization by fentanyl and its synthetic analogues. Patients generally require ongoing monitoring, and naloxone should be administered every 2 to 3 minutes for patients who relapse. Failure to monitor the patient until emergency medical services (EMS) arrive, especially following a high fentanyl or synthetic overdose, could result in death. For patients who relapse after multiple doses, EMS can provide oxygen and additional intravenous doses (if IV access is quickly available), with the dosage adjusted based on the patient's response during transport to the hospital.

In a hospital setting, patients receive close monitoring to address potential re-narcotization, especially with long-acting opioids. The precise naloxone dose needed for opioid reversal varies based on the amount and type of opioid ingested, its receptor affinity, the patient's weight and age, comorbidities, and any polysubstance use. Because this information is often unknown, an empirical dosing approach is necessary. For adults, initial doses range from 0.4 mg to 2 mg, with increases every 2 to 3 minutes as needed, up to a total of 10 mg. Patients with rebound toxicity are often moved to the intensive care unit (ICU), where they are administered continuous naloxone infusions.

### Distribution of naloxone for overdose prevention to chronic pain patients [^115doxPS]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In this commentary, we reflect on the growing opioid overdose epidemic and propose that chronic pain patients prescribed opioids are contributing to growing mortality rates. We advocate for expanding naloxone access and overdose prevention training, which has historically been directed, when available, to injection drug users, to chronic pain patients who may be at high risk for accidental opioid overdose.

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^116DE3un]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To test the prevention of fentanyl-induced respiratory depression after initial reversal (re-narcotization), rats received a second fentanyl dose (1.5 mg kg−1; s.c.) 6 hours after naloxone or prodrug dosing. Naloxone failed to prevent opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD), with four out of six rats dying. AG10-L-E1-Naloxone was also ineffective in preventing OIRD. However, AG10-L-E2-Naloxone significantly prevented OIRD after the second fentanyl dose. After 24 hours, rats received a third fentanyl dose (1.5 mg kg−1; s.c.). AG10-L-E2-Naloxone again demonstrated higher efficacy in preventing mortality and reversing OIRD compared to naloxone and AG10-L-E1-Naloxone, with one out of six rats dying in the AG10-L-E1-Naloxone group. The slow onset of AG10-L-E2-Naloxone suggests that enhancing the initial release of naloxone from the prodrug may be needed for effective rescue from the first fentanyl dose. However, this slow-release profile might be helpful in certain therapeutic applications.

### Do patients require emergency department interventions after prehospital naloxone [^116BfPvJ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Patients receiving naloxone for suspected opioid overdose in the prehospital setting are typically transported to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation, regardless of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The objective of our study is to determine whether patients with GCS ≥ 14, after receiving prehospital naloxone, received additional doses of naloxone and medical interventions in the ED compared to those with GCS < 14 after prehospital naloxone.

- **Methods**: Our retrospective observational study included patients ≥ 18 years old treated with naloxone and transported by an inner-city hospital-based Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to its affiliated ED from January 2, 2016, to December 31, 2016. Investigators collected demographic data, prehospital interventions, GCS, ED interventions, and dispositions. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. The main outcome measures were repeat doses of naloxone and ED interventions.

- **Results**: In all, 473 patient encounters were reviewed. The most common route of prehospital naloxone administration was intranasal (68%). Nearly two-thirds of patients (n = 473) had GCS ≥ 14 upon ED arrival. Repeat naloxone was administered to 3.5% (n = 314) of patients with GCS ≥ 14 versus 14.6% (n = 159) of patients with GCS < 14. ED interventions, such as airway maneuvers, laboratory and radiology testing, and cardiac monitoring, were less common among patients who had improved GCS of 14 or higher (n = 314). There were 8 deaths among patients with GCS < 14 (n = 159) and no deaths among patients with GCS ≥ 14 (n = 314).

Patients with GCS score ≥ 14 showed a lower need for repeat doses of naloxone and ED interventions, and none resulted in death compared to those with GCS < 14.

### High opioid doses, naloxone, and central nervous system active medications received by Medicare-enrolled adults [^114ZMg9P]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a guideline to address morbidity and mortality associated with opioid prescribing in the United States (US). This guideline highlighted opioid doses and the co-prescribing of medications such as hypnotics, benzodiazepines, and skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) associated with adverse events and increased healthcare utilization. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a communication recommending avoiding prescribing central nervous system (CNS) active medications among patients utilizing opioids due to increased risks for respiratory depression, overdose, and death.

Subsequently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommended naloxone co-prescribing for patients at greater risk of an opioid overdose. These include individuals diagnosed with substance use disorder, utilizing ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) per day, and those prescribing benzodiazepines, or having already experienced an opioid overdose.

One means of improving the uptake of naloxone among patients at risk for opioid overdose is enrollment in Medication Therapy Management (MTM) services. These services are utilized to comprehensively assess medication regimens to identify medication-related problems (MRPs). They provide recommendations that improve the uptake of evidence-based medications and indicated medication doses and reduce the prevalence of supra-therapeutic medication doses.

### Naloxone in opioid poisoning: Walking the tightrope [^1174cKfa]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute opioid intoxication and overdose are common causes of presentation to emergency departments. Although naloxone, a pure opioid antagonist, has been available for many years, there is still confusion over the appropriate dose and route of administration. This article looks at the reasons for this uncertainty and undertakes a literature review from which a treatment algorithm is presented.

### Prehospital naloxone and emergency department adverse events: A dose-dependent relationship [^117YJNgJ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate prehospital and emergency department (ED) interventions and outcomes of patients who received prehospital naloxone for a suspected opioid overdose.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to evaluate if the individual dose, individual route, total dose, number of prehospital naloxone administrations, or occurrence of a prehospital adverse event (AE) were associated with the occurrence of AEs in the ED. Secondary objectives included a subset analysis of patients who received additional naloxone while in the ED, or were admitted to an intensive care or step-down unit (ICU).

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, observational chart review of adult patients who received prehospital naloxone and were transported by ambulance to a suburban academic tertiary care center between 2014 and 2017. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate statistics were used, with p < 0.05 indicating significance.

- **Results**: There were 513 patients included in the analysis, with a median age of 29 years, and median total prehospital naloxone dose of 2 mg. An increasing number of prehospital naloxone doses, an occurrence of a prehospital AE, and a route of administration other than intranasally for the first dose of prehospital naloxone were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of an ED AE. Patients who received less than 2 mg of prehospital naloxone had the least likelihood of being admitted to an ICU, whereas patients who received at least 6 mg had a dramatically increased likelihood of ICU admission.

Our results suggest that an increasing dose of prehospital naloxone is linked to subsequent ED AEs, highlighting the need for further investigation into optimal prehospital naloxone dosing.

### Actiq [^112QNjAT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver. Assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Actiq [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g. by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)].

Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

Individually titrate Actiq to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects. The initial dose of Actiq to treat episodes of breakthrough cancer pain is always 200 mcg. The Actiq unit should be consumed over 15 minutes. Patients should be prescribed an initial titration supply of six 200 mcg Actiq units, thus limiting the number of units in the home during titration. Patients should use up all units before increasing to a higher dose.

### Electronic advisories increase naloxone prescribing across health care settings [^116bZ5dy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Naloxone is a life-saving, yet underprescribed, medication that is recommended to be provided to patients at high risk of opioid overdose.

- **Objective**: We set out to evaluate the changes in prescriber practices due to the use of an electronic health record (EHR) advisory that prompted opioid prescribers to co-prescribe naloxone when prescribing a high-dose opioid. It also provided prescribers with guidance on decreasing opioid doses for safety.

- **Design**: This was a retrospective chart abstraction study looking at all opioid prescriptions and all naloxone prescriptions written as emergency department (ED) discharge, inpatient hospital discharge, or outpatient medications, between July 1, 2018, and February 1, 2020. The EHR advisory went live on June 1, 2019.

- **Subjects**: Included in the analysis were all adult patients seen in the abovementioned settings at a large county hospital and associated outpatient clinics.

- **Main measures**: We performed an interrupted time series analysis looking at naloxone prescriptions and daily opioid dosing in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) before and after initiation of the EHR advisory.

- **Key results**: The EHR advisory was associated with changes in prescribers' behavior, leading to increased naloxone prescriptions and decreased prescribed opioid doses.

- **Conclusions**: EHR advisories are an effective systems-level intervention to enhance the safety of prescribed opioids and increase rates of naloxone prescribing.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^114WZkUu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver. Because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose.

Advise patients and caregivers that naloxone may also be administered for a known or suspected overdose with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film itself. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration of naloxone may be necessary due to the long duration of action of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film and its affinity for the mu-opioid receptor.

Inform patients and caregivers of their options for obtaining naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g. by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and, if naloxone is prescribed, how to treat with naloxone. Emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered.

### Drug overdose deaths involving stimulants - United States, January 2018-June 2024 [^111xBFaF]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Low credibility.

Naloxone is a life-saving medication that can reverse an overdose from opioids, including heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioids. Because SUDORS only includes people who died of a drug overdose, evidence of naloxone administration reflects failed administration (i.e. it did not reverse the overdose). This could be because naloxone was not administered soon enough or in sufficient dosages to reverse the overdose, it was not effective (i.e. overdose did not involve opioids), or its effectiveness was affected by polydrug use.

- **Potential bystander**: Defined as a person aged ≥ 11 years who was physically nearby during or shortly preceding an overdose and potentially had an opportunity to intervene or respond. This includes persons in the same structure (e.g. same room or same building, but different room) as the decedent during that time. This does not include persons in different self-contained parts of buildings (e.g. persons in a different apartment in the same apartment building would not be a potential bystander).

- **Emergency department visits**: Denotes whether the person was seen in an emergency department for the fatal overdose regardless of whether they were dead or alive on arrival and regardless of whether or not they received treatment.

Among 46 states and DC with sufficient circumstance data, higher percentages of persons who died of overdoses involving stimulants and no opioids had a known history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with those who died of overdoses co-involving stimulants and opioids (38.7% versus 21.2%) and were seen in the emergency department.

### A comparison of intramuscular (Zimhi) and intranasal naloxone (Narcan) in reversal of fentanyl-induced apnea: a randomized, crossover, open-label trial [^115V2zn6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone remains the primary treatment for an opioid overdose. While originally available as an injectable for IV or IM use in the clinical setting, new formulations have recently been approved for use outside the hospital. IN and IM naloxone are easily administered by first responders and bystanders. However, the efficacy and optimal dosing regimen have not been investigated in a controlled setting, particularly not in individuals that are apneic following the rapid IV administration of high-dose fentanyl. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first respiratory study that quantifies the effect of IM and IN naloxone following a 2-minute period of fentanyl-induced apnea. This experimental study was designed to replicate an opioid overdose in the community setting as closely as possible, albeit in a safe and monitored environment. During the study, personnel with airway management and resuscitation skills were continuously present. The use of supplemental oxygen prevented serious hypoxic adverse events. This is certainly different from the real-world setting where overdose victims breathe air with 21% oxygen; this should be considered when extrapolating our findings to community overdose settings. In real-world settings, oxygen desaturations will occur rapidly and negatively impact cardiac output, complicating effective treatment with any naloxone formulation due to suboptimal drug distribution. As discussed before, rescue of opioid overdose victims should include naloxone administration combined with resuscitation efforts, i.e. ventilation.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^114zsLNp]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Take-home naloxone can prevent death from heroin/opioid overdose, but pre-provision is difficult because naloxone is usually given by injection. Non-injectable alternatives, including naloxone nasal sprays, are currently being developed. To be effective, the intranasal (i.n.) spray dose must be adequate but not excessive, and early absorption must be comparable to intramuscular (i.m.) injection. We report on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a specially produced concentrated novel nasal spray. The specific aims were to estimate PK profiles of i.n. naloxone, compare early systemic exposure with i.n. versus i.m. naloxone, and estimate i.n. bioavailability.

- **Design**: Open-label, randomized, five-way cross-over PK study.

- **Setting**: Clinical trials facility (Croydon, UK).

- **Participants**: Thirty-eight healthy volunteers (age 20–54 years; 11 female).

- **Intervention and comparator**: Three doses of i.n. (1 mg/0.1 ml, 2 mg/0.1 ml, 4 mg/0.2 ml) versus 0.4 mg i.m. (reference) and 0.4 mg intravenous (i.v.) naloxone.

- **Measurements**: Regular blood samples were taken, with high-frequency sampling during the first 15 minutes to capture early systemic exposure. PK parameters were determined from plasma naloxone concentrations. Exploratory analyses involved simulation of repeat administration.

Findings show that mean peak concentration (C max) values for 1 mg (1.51 ng/ml), 2 mg (2.87 ng/ml), and 4 mg (6.02 ng/ml) i.n. exceeded 0.4 mg i.m. (1.27 ng/ml) naloxone. All three i.n. doses rapidly achieved plasma levels greater than 50% of peak concentrations (T50%) by 10 minutes.

### An innovative model for naloxone use within an OTP setting: A prospective cohort study [^117HjxVd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Unintentional opioid overdose deaths are a public health crisis, and naloxone is the most effective harm reduction tool to curb many of these deaths. There is growing evidence that take-home naloxone can prevent opioid overdose in targeted populations. The goal of this study is to measure the opioid overdose reversal rate with take-home naloxone among participants with a diagnosis of opioid use disorder (OUD) in an opioid treatment program (OTP) setting.

- **Methods**: Patients enrolled in an outpatient OTP program were eligible for this prospective cohort study between April 4, 2016, and July 4, 2016. Two hundred forty-four study participants received overdose education, instruction on how to use naloxone, and were provided with 2 doses of a take-home naloxone auto-injector kit. They were subsequently followed for 3 months.

- **Results**: Thirty-one study participants reported overdose reversals using naloxone auto-injector kits on 38 community members. All overdose reversals were heroin-related. Eighty-seven percent of the community members reversed with naloxone were friends or relatives of the study participants. This study validates that naloxone is not commonly used on the index study participant but is often used on a secondary target among people who inject drugs. The large number of overdose reversals reported in this prospective study suggests that this novel model for naloxone use may be replicated at other OTP settings to reduce opioid overdose deaths.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^113UK5Du]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

To explore the pharmacokinetics of repeated administration, intranasal (i.n.) bioavailability relative to intramuscular (i.m.) as reported above was in the range of 47–51%. Hence, a 2:1 dose ratio (i.n.:i.m.) was assumed for the simulations. This compared cumulative 2 × 2 mg i.n. doses at 3-minute intervals with five cumulative 0.4 mg i.m. doses at 3-minute intervals, totaling 2 mg i.m.

- **Simulation results**: Figure 3 shows the peak plasma level from the observed 2 mg i.n. dose occurring between those from the observed i.m. 0.4 mg dose and the simulated 2 mg i.m. dose (5 × 0.4 mg administered 3 minutes apart). This simulation suggests that, in a hypothetical overdose scenario, a second dose of 2 mg i.n. administered after 3 minutes would expose the patient to approximately the same plasma naloxone levels, in terms of both initial rise and peak, as five consecutive i.m. 0.4 mg doses (also 3 minutes apart), i.e. 2 mg in total.

- **Plasma concentration**: In addition, the plasma naloxone levels from the simulated 2 × 2 mg i.n. dose declined more slowly than the simulated 5 × 0.4 mg i.m. administrations, indicating that plasma naloxone concentrations would be sustained for longer than those from i.m. dosing.

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^114W1cnM]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

In a similar experiment with fentanyl (two doses of 3 mg kg − 1 each, s.c. at 0 h and 6 h; n = 8 per group), six vehicle-treated rats died after the first dose, and the remaining two died after the second. In the naloxone group, all rats died after the second fentanyl dose. The higher survival rate for the two rats in the vehicle group compared to the naloxone group after the second fentanyl dose likely indicates acute tolerance, which develops quickly, often within hours or days, and can occur with a single administration of a high dose or short-term repeated doses. This rapid tolerance could be due to receptor desensitization or internalization, temporarily reducing opioid receptor responsiveness. Acute tolerance differs from chronic tolerance, which develops over extended use over time and involves longer-lasting receptor downregulation (decreased receptor numbers) and gene expression changes.

### Opioid overdose: Limitations in naloxone reversal of respiratory depression and prevention of cardiac arrest [^115QUarr]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Opioids are effective analgesics, but they can have harmful adverse effects, such as addiction and potentially fatal respiratory depression. Naloxone is currently the only available treatment for reversing the negative effects of opioids, including respiratory depression. However, the effectiveness of naloxone, particularly after an opioid overdose, varies depending on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of the opioid that was overdosed. Long-acting opioids, and those with a high affinity at the µ-opioid receptor and/or slow receptor dissociation kinetics, are particularly resistant to the effects of naloxone. In this review, the authors examine the pharmacology of naloxone and its safety and limitations in reversing opioid-induced respiratory depression under different circumstances, including its ability to prevent cardiac arrest.

### Characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder associated with performing overdose reversals in the community: An opioid treatment program analysis [^1173wZex]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

- **Variable distributions regarding community members reversed with the prescribed naloxone**: Logistic regression analyses for identification of potential confounders and effect modifiers resulted in education as a potential confounder, with no potential effect modifiers. Analyses of the associations between the 16 explanatory variables and the outcome of whether or not naloxone was used to reverse an opioid overdose event in another individual resulted in 6 variables significantly (P < 0.050) associated with the use of take-home naloxone.

- **Logistic regression between each explanatory variable and use of naloxone**: Final multivariate model selection resulted in a model with 5 significant explanatory variables. The significant associations with the outcome included being 29 years of age or younger, being Hispanic/white, reporting receiving previous emergency room care for overdose, reporting previously witnessing someone overdose, and being positive for 2 or more substances in their 6-month urine toxicology screens. These associations had odds ratio point estimates ranging from 2.80 to 5.67, indicating increased odds of using naloxone compared to the reference categories. Study participants in the final selected model included 247 of the 251 6-month follow-up participants with complete records for all 16 explanatory variables included in the initial full model. The 4 study participants not included in the final model were dropped due to very low numbers in the categories of race/ethnicity. Odds ratios in the final selected multivariate logistic regression model are listed in Table 3.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^113CaKAu]. Addiction (2018). High credibility.

The FDA and Health Canada approved a first nasal naloxone product in November 2015 and October 2016, respectively. However, only limited pharmacokinetic (PK) data for intranasal (i.n.) naloxone exist at the time of writing, with bioavailability estimates ranging from 4% for dilute [2 mg/5 mL relative to intravenous (i.v.)] to 46–54% for concentrated (0.8 mg/0.1 mL relative to i.v.; 4 mg/0.1 mL relative to intramuscular (i.m.)) formulations.

Recent work in Europe has explored different i.n. formulations, aiming to develop a nasal spray suitable for lay administration. The goal is rapid onset of action and adequate exposure without the risk of 'over-antagonism'. We now report on the PK characteristics of nasal naloxone spray at different concentrations and doses, with a particular focus on early absorption. The primary aims of this study were to estimate the PK profile of i.n. naloxone and compare its early partial systemic exposure to the i.m. reference. The secondary aim was to estimate i.n. bioavailability.

### Reversal of opioid-induced ventilatory depression using low-dose naloxone (0.04 mg): a case series [^111Z69RV]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Naloxone is commonly administered in emergency departments (ED) to reverse opioid intoxication. Several naloxone dose recommendations exist for the acute management of opioid intoxication based on limited published clinical data. A case series of ED patients with opioid-induced ventilatory depression that was reversed using low-dose naloxone (0.04 mg with titration) is presented.

- **Methods**: ED patients with opioid-induced ventilatory depression requiring naloxone administration were identified through medical toxicology consultation. A retrospective review of medical records was performed. Collected data included history, and pre- and post-naloxone data, including respiratory rate (RR), pulse oximetry (pulse ox), end-tidal CO2 level (ET-CO2), and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS).

- **Results**: Fifteen ED patients with moderate to severe opioid-induced ventilatory depression (median RR, 6 breaths/min) who were managed using a low-dose naloxone strategy were identified. Twelve of 15 patients reported ingestion of methadone (range, 30 to 180 mg). The median naloxone dose of 0.08 mg (range, 0.04 to 0.12 mg) reversed opioid-induced ventilatory and CNS depression. Two patients experienced acute opioid withdrawal after receiving 0.08 mg.

- **Conclusion**: ED patients with moderate to severe opioid-induced ventilatory depression can be reversed using 0.04 mg IV naloxone with appropriate dose titration.

### Characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder associated with performing overdose reversals in the community: An opioid treatment program analysis [^112TiH3D]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Our prior study suggests that providing opioid overdose education and take-home naloxone to opioid treatment program (OTP) patients can significantly increase overdose reversals in the community. In this study, the characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) who have significantly greater odds of performing naloxone overdose reversals include younger age, previously witnessing an opioid overdose, receiving emergency room care for an overdose, and having positive urine toxicology screens. By targeting certain patients based on their characteristics and providing them with additional support, overdose reversals may be increased significantly in the community. It is possible that this targeted subset of patients may be interested in being trained as "harm reduction peer educators" in their community. This may help to further reduce opioid overdose deaths and bridge the gap between clinical and public health efforts related to naloxone distribution.

The findings in this analysis may differ in other regions of the United States or internationally. Because our findings seem to be partly dependent on social variables and connectivity, it may be valuable for other regions around the country to investigate their own OTP populations. They may discover which characteristics increase the likelihood of individuals performing overdose reversals in their community.

In future studies, we plan to ask study participants ethnographic, qualitative interview questions regarding their thoughts and feelings surrounding performing overdose reversals.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^111sgCfd]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Taken together with other recently published data, the results of this study lend strong support to the potential value of concentrated intranasal naloxone spray for opioid overdose reversal. Across all three intranasal doses, naloxone exposure was dose-proportional, with approximately 50% absolute bioavailability. We identified the 2 mg/0.1 mL intranasal dose as most similar to the 0.4 mg intramuscular reference, producing comparable early naloxone concentrations. The 2 mg intranasal dose had the added feature of effective maintenance of plasma levels for the next 2 hours. In September 2017, following acceptance of this manuscript but pre-publication, the European Medicines Agency gave a positive opinion to the application for product license for a 1.8 mg/0.1 mL concentrated naloxone nasal spray under the trade name Nyxoid; 1.8 mg naloxone in Nyxoid is equivalent to 2 mg naloxone hydrochloride.

Clinicians and policymakers will need to consider the potential merits of the different time-course profiles, including speed of onset and duration of effect, of intranasal versus injectable naloxone. They may also see implementation advantages with intranasal naloxone for broad-based take-home naloxone provision.

### Implementation of a naloxone best practice advisory into an electronic health record [^1132w3zG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Naloxone is a harm reduction tool for mitigating the rising rate of opioid overdose deaths. We sought to develop and implement an alert in the electronic health record outlining which patients are at higher risk of opioid overdose and should be coprescribed naloxone. Our aim was to increase coprescribing of naloxone to qualified patients. We also endeavored to evaluate naloxone prescription volume, fill rates, and statewide dispenses before and after alert implementation.

- **Methods**: We developed the electronic alert according to a state opioid safety initiative specifying under which conditions it should activate. We collected data on naloxone prescriptions ordered in the 5 months before and after alert implementation and unique patients with a naloxone dispense statewide. We used internal pharmacy data to evaluate the percentage of fills and used a χ² test to assess changes in the percentage of fills. Descriptive statistics and t-tests were used to analyze changes in the number of prescriptions and unique patients dispensed naloxone.

- **Results**: We found a 2144% increase in the number of monthly naloxone prescriptions written after the alert became active. There was no statistically significant change in the percentage of fills. There was a 402.8% increase in unique patients statewide with a naloxone dispense after alert implementation.

- **Conclusions**: Designing and implementing an electronic alert prompting naloxone coprescription are feasible and were associated with substantial increases in numbers of naloxone prescriptions and patients with naloxone dispenses.

### Low-dose oral naloxone reverses opioid-induced constipation and analgesia [^1121qr9s]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

The most common side effect of opioid therapy is constipation, which is often difficult to treat and is believed to be primarily a peripheral effect. Single large doses of oral naloxone have been shown to be efficacious in reversing opioid-induced constipation but they often cause the unwanted side effect of analgesia reversal. This study evaluated the effects on constipation and analgesia of low doses of oral naloxone given three times daily. Patients taking stable doses of opioids with complaints of constipation were recruited for this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients were given 4 mg or 2 mg of oral naloxone, or placebo, three times daily. Stool frequency and symptoms related to constipation were recorded daily. Patients also recorded the daily amount of analgesics required to maintain pain control. Nine patients were recruited for the study. All the patients who received oral naloxone had some improvement in their bowel frequency. Three of the patients also experienced reversal of analgesia, including one who had complete reversal of analgesia. This study demonstrates that reversal of analgesia still occurred despite dividing the oral naloxone into very low doses relative to the total dose of opioid used. Patients using high doses of opioids appear to be the most vulnerable to the analgesic effect of oral naloxone.

### Reversal of pediatric opioid toxicity with take-home naloxone: A case report [^116u6awU]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2019). Low credibility.

Take-home naloxone, an opioid antagonist, has become part of a multimodal approach to curbing opioid-related mortality. However, there is little information about the utility of take-home naloxone in pediatric patients. We report a case of opioid toxicity after exposure to methadone in a pediatric patient, which was successfully reversed with take-home naloxone.

- **Case**: A previously healthy 22-month-old girl ingested an unknown amount of liquid methadone. The child became progressively somnolent. The mother administered intranasal naloxone at home, resulting in the reversal of somnolence. The patient presented to the emergency department and had a recurrence of symptoms. The patient was placed on a naloxone infusion and was discharged uneventfully from a tertiary care facility, two days after ingestion.

- **Results**: To our knowledge, we report the first case of pediatric opioid toxicity reversed by take-home naloxone. In the setting of rising opioid-related mortality, providers and public health officials should consider expanding access to take-home naloxone for children at high risk for opioid overdose.

### Emergency medical services naloxone access: A national systematic legal review [^113S5b1z]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Fatal opioid overdose in the United States is at epidemic levels. Naloxone, an effective opioid antidote, is commonly administered by advanced emergency medical services (EMS) personnel in the prehospital setting. While states are rapidly moving to increase access to naloxone for community bystanders, the EMS system remains the primary source for out-of-hospital naloxone access. Many communities have limited advanced EMS response capability and therefore may not have prehospital access to the medication indicated for opioid overdose reversal. The goal of this research was to determine the authority of different levels of EMS personnel to administer naloxone for the reversal of opioid overdose in the United States, Guam, and Puerto Rico.

The authors systematically reviewed the scope of practice of EMS personnel regarding the administration of naloxone for the reversal of opioid overdose. All relevant laws, regulations, and policies from the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico in effect in November 2013 were identified, reviewed, and coded to determine the authority of EMS personnel at four levels — in increasing order of training: emergency medical responders (EMRs), emergency medical technicians (EMTs), intermediate/advanced EMTs, and paramedics — to administer naloxone. Where available, protocols governing the route and dose of administration were also identified and analyzed.

All 53 jurisdictions license or certify EMS personnel at the paramedic level, and all permit paramedics to administer naloxone.

### Assessment of a naloxone coprescribing alert for patients at risk of opioid overdose: A quality improvement project [^116VvjzU]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). High credibility.

Patients taking high doses of opioids, or taking opioids in combination with other central nervous system depressants, are at increased risk of opioid overdose. Coprescribing the opioid-reversal agent naloxone is an essential safety measure, recommended by the Surgeon General, but the rate of naloxone coprescribing is low. Therefore, we set out to determine whether a targeted clinical decision support alert could increase the rate of naloxone coprescribing.

- **Methods**: We conducted a before-after study from January 2019 to April 2021 at a large academic health system in the Southeast. We developed a targeted point-of-care decision support notification in the electronic health record to suggest ordering naloxone for patients who have a high risk of opioid overdose based on a high morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) ≥ 90 mg, concomitant benzodiazepine prescription, or a history of opioid use disorder or opioid overdose. We measured the rate of outpatient naloxone prescribing as our primary measure. A multivariable logistic regression model with robust variance to adjust for prescriptions within the same prescriber was implemented to estimate the association between alerts and naloxone coprescribing.

- **Results**: The baseline naloxone coprescribing rate in 2019 was 0.28 (95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.31) naloxone prescriptions per 100 opioid prescriptions. After alert implementation, the naloxone coprescribing rate increased to 4.51 (95% CI, 4.33–4.68) naloxone prescriptions per 100 opioid prescriptions (P < .001). The adjusted odds of naloxone coprescribing after the alert…

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^117K5PBr]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our strategy extends beyond opioid antidotes. For example, prodrugs can replace naloxone in opioid abuse-deterrent drugs like suboxone. Controlled and slow release of antagonists can reduce withdrawal symptoms, benefiting neonates, children, the elderly, and those with cardiovascular issues. It is also useful in post-surgical recovery where gradual analgesia loss is preferred. This is critical when the analgesic is morphine, which has a half-life of 2–3 hours but can result in prolonged overdose durations of up to 120 hours. The extended duration of a single subcutaneous injection would also reduce staff burden and medical costs, such as the need for 24-hour hospital monitoring for children with opioid overdose. Overall, our strategy could significantly improve therapeutic outcomes for various opioid antagonists and agonists.

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^115HvxsR]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A promising alternative to traditional naloxone would be single-dose extended-release naloxone (e.g. AG10-L-E2-Naloxone). AG10-L-E2-Naloxone or its analogues could offer sustained opioid antagonism, minimizing the need for frequent re-dosing and continuous infusions. It would also be highly advantageous in rural or remote areas, as it allows time for EMS assistance to arrive without requiring urgent, continuous naloxone administration.

The extended-release format of AG10-L-E2-Naloxone offers flexibility for both opioid-naive and opioid-dependent patients. Opioid-naive individuals who lack tolerance typically require higher naloxone doses (0.4 to 2 mg) for effective reversal, which could be potentially addressed by co-administering a small dose of free naloxone with AG10-L-E2-Naloxone in a single s.c. injection. In contrast, opioid-dependent individuals benefit from lower naloxone doses (0.1 to 0.2 mg) to avoid severe withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, AG10-L-E2-Naloxone could be particularly advantageous for opioid-dependent groups, as the concentration of released naloxone is low and steady.

Extended-release naloxone can potentially heighten withdrawal symptoms (something not observed with our efficacy studies in rats); however, it does offer sustained protection against re-narcotization, which is crucial for overdose management. In essence, withdrawal might be unavoidable, but steady, extended naloxone dosing can offer better overdose protection.

### Acute opioid withdrawal following intramuscular administration of naloxone 1.6 mg: A prospective out-of-hospital series [^116PxctF]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to explore the occurrence of severe agitation following a 1.6 mg intramuscular (IM) dose of naloxone, which is commonly used in out-of-hospital settings to counteract opioid toxicity but is less frequently employed in hospitals due to concerns about opioid withdrawal and resulting agitation.

Methods were employed to undertake a prospective study with adult patients (> 15 years old) receiving treatment from an Australian state ambulance service. These patients were administered 1.6 mg IM naloxone for respiratory depression. The primary measure was a respiratory rate of 1 within one hour post-administration. Secondary outcomes included presentations of acute opioid withdrawal symptoms, such as tachycardia (pulse rate > 100 beats/min), hypertension (systolic > 140 mm Hg), vomiting, agitation, seizures, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, or pulmonary edema. Reversal of respiratory depression was defined as a respiratory rate > 10 breaths/min with a saturation > 92% or a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15.

Results showed that from October 2019 to July 2021, there were 197 presentations involving 171 patients, with a median age of 41 years (range 18–80 years). Among these patients, 119 were men (70%). The predominant opioids involved were heroin (131 presentations, 66%), oxycodone (14 presentations, 7%), and morphine (11 presentations, 6%). Severe agitation was observed in 14 presentations (7% [95% confidence interval, 4% to 12%]), and opioid withdrawal occurred in 76 presentations.

### Naloxone dosing in the era of synthetic opioids: Applying the Goldilocks principle [^116nZA5q]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

The opioid overdose epidemic remains a critical public health crisis. In recent years, synthetic opioids like fentanyl and nitazenes have driven a sharp rise in deaths. Naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, has been established as a key intervention for reversing opioid overdoses and saving lives. However, there remains a critical need to optimize naloxone dosing strategies.

This article examines the challenges of both under-dosing and over-antagonism in naloxone administration, emphasizing the importance of a tailored approach to overdose management. A 'just the right dose' approach is essential for minimizing the risks of over-antagonism while still reversing opioid overdose. This involves starting with a modest naloxone dose and carefully titrating it based on the patient's response, considering factors such as opioid type, overdose severity, and opioid tolerance.

A tailored approach to naloxone dosing may present challenges for non-medically trained responders, but it can ensure that as many people as possible receive the right dose of naloxone when they need it. Training programs should also emphasize the importance of first aid and supportive care, including airway management and alerting emergency services, as well as careful monitoring of the patient's response.

### Subsys [^113eCzQm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose when initiating and renewing treatment with Subsys. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g. by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose. Explain to them that naloxone's effects are temporary and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see Overdosage (10)].

If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers on the following:

- **Application of naloxone**: How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose.
- **Notification and accessibility**: To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency.
- **Educational materials**: To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do.

### Moving naloxone over the counter is necessary but not sufficient [^111nZKSX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist available in numerous formulations and can be easily administered to avert death from opioid overdose. Amid a historic overdose crisis in the United States, naloxone plays a crucial role in stemming the loss of life. However, it remains largely inaccessible to the public. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the approval of the first over-the-counter formulation of naloxone. Although this historic change provides an important opportunity to increase the distribution of naloxone, we must take careful steps during this transition to ensure that it does not paradoxically threaten overall access to this life-saving medication.

Specifically, we must ensure that a larger supply of naloxone will meet the newly increased demand at a sustainable price for consumers most in need. We must also continue to prioritize comprehensive methods of distribution, such as overdose education and naloxone distribution programs, which are important tools to reach the most vulnerable populations. In addition, simultaneous investment in harm-reduction strategies, such as supervised consumption spaces, is critical to ensure that naloxone is available in settings where its life-saving potential can be most fully realized.

### Pulmonary complications of opioid overdose treated with naloxone [^1123oN1S]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

We aim to determine whether administration of higher doses of naloxone for the treatment of opioid overdose is associated with increased pulmonary complications. This was a retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study of 1,831 patients treated with naloxone by the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services. Emergency medical services and hospital records were abstracted for data regarding naloxone dosing, route of administration, and clinical outcomes, including the development of complications such as pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonitis. For the purposes of this investigation, we defined high-dose naloxone as total administration exceeding 4.4 mg. Multivariable analysis was used to attempt to account for confounders such as route of administration and pretreatment morbidity.

Patients receiving out-of-hospital naloxone in doses exceeding 4.4 mg were 62% more likely to have a pulmonary complication after opioid overdose (42% versus 26% absolute risk; odds ratio 2.14; 95% confidence interval 1.44 to 3.18). This association remained statistically significant after multivariable analysis with logistic regression (odds ratio 1.85; 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 3.04). A secondary analysis showed an increased risk of 27% versus 13% (odds ratio 2.57; 95% confidence interval 1.45 to 4.54) when initial naloxone dosing exceeded 0.4 mg. Pulmonary edema occurred in 1.1% of patients.

Higher doses of naloxone in the out-of-hospital treatment of opioid overdose are associated with a high risk of pulmonary complications.

### Best evidence topic report. Intranasal naloxone in suspected opioid overdose [^1166BFqA]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short cut review was conducted to determine whether intranasal naloxone is effective in suspected opiate overdose. A total of 596 papers were screened, of which eight provided the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date, and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated.

The clinical bottom line is that intranasal naloxone is likely to be a safe and effective first-line prehospital intervention for reversing the effects of an opioid overdose and helping to reduce the risk of needle stick injury. However, a large, well-conducted trial is required to confirm its usage.

### Naloxone administration in US emergency departments, 2000–2011 [^116bD9tb]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Rates of opioid overdose and opioid-related emergency department (ED) visits have increased dramatically. Naloxone is an effective antidote to potentially fatal opioid overdose, but little is known about naloxone administration in ED settings. We examined trends and correlates of naloxone administration in ED visits nationally from 2000 to 2011. Using data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, we examined ED visits involving the administration of naloxone or a diagnosis of opioid overdose, abuse, or dependence. We assessed patient characteristics in these visits, including concomitant administration of prescription opioid medications. We used logistic regression to identify correlates of naloxone administration.

From 2000 to 2011, naloxone was administered in an estimated 1.7 million adult ED visits nationally; 19% of these visits recorded a diagnosis of opioid overdose, abuse, or dependence. An estimated 2.9 million adult ED visits were related to opioid overdose, abuse, or dependence; 11% of these visits involved naloxone administration. In multivariable logistic regression models, patient age, race, insurance, and non-rural facility location were independently associated with naloxone administration. An opioid medication was provided in 14% of visits involving naloxone administration. Naloxone was administered in a minority of ED visits related to opioid overdose, abuse, or dependence. Among all ED visits involving naloxone administration, prescription opioids were also provided in one in seven visits. Further work should explore the pr

### Vital signs: Pharmacy-based naloxone dispensing - United States, 2012–2018 [^111fPEoC]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

Among the 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2017 (the last year for which complete data are available), a total of 47,600 (67.8%) involved opioids. Millions of Americans are at increased risk for an opioid overdose, including persons who use illicit opioids, those who use or misuse prescription opioids, and those with an opioid use disorder. A population particularly at risk includes persons who use illicit drugs (e.g. cocaine and methamphetamine) that might be mixed with illicit opioids.

The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain recommends considering prescribing naloxone when factors that increase risk for overdose are present (e.g. history of overdose or substance use disorder, opioid dosages ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents [MME] per day [high-dose], and concurrent use of benzodiazepines). Given that approximately two-thirds of overdose deaths involved opioids, 36% of which in 2017 were prescription opioids, the distribution of naloxone to reverse an overdose is an important element of the public health response to the opioid overdose epidemic.

For decades, emergency medical service (EMS) providers, first responders, and emergency department clinicians have administered naloxone in cases of suspected drug overdose, and community-based organizations have offered naloxone through education and distribution programs. Recent efforts have focused on expanding naloxone access through clinician prescribing and pharmacy dispensing. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws permitting pharmacy-based naloxone.

### Comparison of intranasal and intramuscular naloxone in opioid overdoses managed by ambulance staff: a double-dummy, randomised, controlled trial [^114kJeuH]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

The study aimed to measure and evaluate the clinical response to nasal naloxone in opioid overdoses in the pre-hospital environment. This was a randomised, controlled, double-dummy, blinded, non-inferiority trial conducted at two centres in Oslo and Trondheim, Norway. Participants were included by ambulance staff and treated at the site of the overdose.

Men and women over the age of 18 with miosis, a rate of respiration of ≤ 8/min, and a Glasgow Coma Score < 12/15 were included. Informed consent was obtained through a deferred consent procedure. The intervention compared a commercially available 1.4 mg/0.1 mL intranasal naloxone with 0.8 mg/2 mL naloxone administered intramuscularly.

- **Measurements**: The primary endpoint was the restoration of spontaneous respiration of ≥ 10 breaths/min within 10 minutes. Secondary outcomes included time to restoration of spontaneous respiration, recurrence of overdose within 12 hours, and adverse events.

- **Findings**: In total, 201 participants were analysed in the per-protocol population, with heroin suspected in 196 cases. Of the participants, 82% were men. In the intramuscular group, 105 (97.2%) participants returned to adequate spontaneous respiration within 10 minutes after one dose, compared to 74 (79.6%) in the intranasal group. The estimated risk difference was 17.5% (95% CI, 8.9%–26.1%) in favour of the intramuscular group. The risk of receiving additional naloxone was 19.4% (95% CI, 9.0%–29.7%) higher in the intranasal group. Adverse reactions were evenly distributed, except for drug withdrawal reactions.

### Naloxone dosing after opioid overdose in the era of illicitly manufactured fentanyl [^113t5cQU]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). Low credibility.

Illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) is responsible for a growing number of deaths. Some case series have suggested that IMF overdoses require significantly higher naloxone doses than heroin overdoses. Our objective was to determine if the naloxone dose required to treat an opioid overdose is associated with the finding of fentanyl, opiates, or both on urine drug screen (UDS).

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted at a single emergency department and its affiliated emergency medical services (EMS) agency. The charts of all patients who received naloxone through this EMS from January 1, 2017, to June 15, 2018, were reviewed. The study included patients diagnosed with a non-suicidal opioid overdose whose UDS was positive for opiates, fentanyl, or both. Data collected included demographics, vital signs, initial GCS, EMS and ED naloxone administrations, response to treatment, laboratory findings, and ED disposition. The fentanyl-only and fentanyl + opiate groups were compared to the opiate-only group using the stratified (by ED provider) variant of the Mann-Whitney U test.

- **Results**: Eight hundred and thirty-seven charts were reviewed, and 121 subjects were included in the final analysis. The median age of included subjects was 38 years and 75% were male. In the naloxone dose analysis, neither the fentanyl-only (median 0.8 mg, IQR 0.4–1.6; p = 0.68) nor the fentanyl + opiate (median 0.8 mg, IQR 0.4–1.2; p = 0.56) groups differed from the opiate-only group (median 0.58 mg, IQR 0.4–1.6).

- **Conclusion**: Our findings refute the notion that high potency synthetic opioids lead to significantly higher naloxone dosing requirements.

### Attitudes toward naloxone prescribing in clinical settings: A qualitative study of patients prescribed high dose opioids for chronic non-cancer pain [^114Q53Eq]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Over the last two decades, medical providers have increasingly prescribed pharmaceutical opioids for chronic non-cancer pain, while opioid overdose death rates have quadrupled. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can be prescribed to patients with chronic pain to reverse an opioid overdose, yet little is known about how patients perceive this emerging practice.

- **Objective**: This study assessed the knowledge and attitudes toward naloxone prescribing among non-cancer patients prescribed opioids in primary care.

- **Design**: Qualitative study design using semi-structured interviews.

- **Participants**: Adults (N = 24) prescribed high-dose (≥ 100 morphine mg equivalent daily dose) chronic opioid therapy in eight primary care internal medicine, family medicine, and HIV practices in three large Colorado health systems.

- **Approach**: Inductive and deductive methods were used to analyze interview transcripts.

- **Key results**: Themes emerged related to knowledge of, and benefits, barriers, and facilitators to naloxone in primary care. Patients reported receiving limited education about opioid medication risks from providers and limited knowledge of naloxone. When provided with a description of naloxone, patients recognized its ability to reverse overdoses. In addition to pragmatic barriers, such as medication cost, barriers to naloxone acceptance included the perception that overdose risk stems from medication misuse and that providers might infer that they were misusing their opioid medication if they accepted a naloxone prescription, prompting an opioid taper. Facilitators to the acceptance of naloxone included clear communication from providers about its benefits.

### Systematic review of naloxone dosing and adverse events in the emergency department [^114GksWL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Experts recommend using the lowest effective dose of naloxone to balance the reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression and avoid precipitated opioid withdrawal. However, there are no established dosing standards within the emergency department (ED).

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to determine naloxone dosing practice in the ED and their association with adverse events.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review by searching PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and EBSCO from 2000–2021. Articles containing patient-level data for initial ED dose and patient outcome had data abstracted by two independent reviewers. Patients were divided into subgroups depending on the initial dose of i.v. naloxone: low dose ([LD], < 0.4 mg), standard dose ([SD], 0.4–2 mg), and high dose ([HD], > 2 mg). Our outcomes were the dose range administered and adverse events per dose. We compared groups using chi-squared difference of proportions or Fisher's exact test.

- **Results**: The review included 13 articles with 209 patients in the results analysis: 111 patients in LD (0.04–0.1 mg), 95 in SD (0.4–2 mg), and 3 in HD (4–12 mg). At least one adverse event was reported in 37 SD patients (38.9%), compared with 14 in LD (12.6%, p < 0.0001) and 2 in HD (100.0%, p = 0.16). At least one additional dose was administered to 53 SD patients (55.8%), compared with 55 in LD (49.5%, p < 0.0001), and 3 in HD (100.0%, p = 0.48).

- **Conclusions**: Lower doses of naloxone in the ED may help reduce related adverse events without increasing the need for additional doses. Future studies should evaluate these findings further.

### The evolution of recommended naloxone dosing for opioid overdose by medical specialty [^112Q4Mha]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Opioid abuse and opioid overdose deaths have increased significantly over the past decade. Naloxone is a potentially life-saving medication that can reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression, though precipitated opioid withdrawal can pose acute risks to the patient and medical personnel. The optimal naloxone dose is unclear and few studies address this question.

- **Methods**: A convenience sample of commonly available references were queried for the recommended IV naloxone dose. When dosing recommendations were different for opioid-tolerant patients, these were also recorded.

- **Results**: Twenty-five references were located. Forty-eight percent recommended a starting dose ≤ 0.05 mg, while 36% recommend a dose ten-fold higher. More than half of medical toxicology and general medical sources recommended a low-dose strategy with a starting dose lower than 0.05 mg IV.

- **Conclusion**: There are variations in the recommended doses for naloxone, with ranges spanning an order of magnitude. Further exploration is needed to determine the dose that balances reversal of respiratory depression with mitigation of withdrawal.

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^112utnHE]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Reversal of fentanyl OIRD by naloxone, nalmefene, and AG10-L-E2-Naloxone was assessed through several tests:

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Single subcutaneous (s.c.) doses of test compounds (60 µmol kg⁻¹; equivalent to 20 mg kg⁻¹ of naloxone and 63 mg kg⁻¹ of AG10-L-E2-Naloxone) were administered in rats. Data are expressed as means ± standard deviation (s.d.) of three biological replicates.

- **Dosing schedule**: Fentanyl and antagonists (60 µmol kg⁻¹) were dose-scheduled to evaluate the reversal of OIRD, represented by Minute Volume relative to baseline. Minute Volume (mean ± s.d.; n = 6 biological replicates per group) was plotted as a function of time after:
	- The first dose of fentanyl and antagonists.
	- The second fentanyl dose after 6 hours.
	- The third fentanyl dose after 24 hours. Animals were monitored in a plethysmography chamber for 90 minutes after each fentanyl dose.

- **Intravenous injection**: A single intravenous (i.v.) injection of 60 µmol kg⁻¹ of the test compound was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 3 for each group). The concentration of the test compounds in plasma was determined at different time points and expressed as means ± s.d. of three biological replicates.

- **Reversal of fentanyl-induced OIRD**: Intravenously administered naloxone and AG10-L-E2-Naloxone were tested. Minute Volume (mean ± s.d.; n = 6 biological replicates per group) was plotted as a function of time after:
	- The first dose of fentanyl (3 mg kg⁻¹; i.v. dose) followed by an antagonist (60 µmol kg⁻¹; single i.v. dose) within 1 minute.
	- The second dose of fentanyl (1.5 mg kg⁻¹; i.v. dose).
	- The third dose of fentanyl (1.5 mg kg⁻¹; i.v. dose). Animals were monitored in a plethysmography chamber for 90 minutes after each administration.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^115usEHY]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

- **Study participants**: Thirty-eight subjects (age 20–54 years) were randomized, including 27 males and 11 females. Before period 2 dosing, there were four subject discontinuations (three subjects tested positive for drugs of abuse, and one subject withdrew consent). The protocol allowed for replacement subjects, so three additional subjects were randomized to the next available treatment sequence, exceeding the original enrolment target of 35 subjects. In total, six subjects did not complete the study, resulting in 21 sessions handled as missing data: six missed the 0.4 mg i.m. session; five missed the 1 mg i.n. session; four missed the 4 mg i.n. and 0.4 mg i.v. sessions; and two missed the 2 mg i.n. session. Consequently, values reported below refer to sample sizes of n = 32 (0.4 mg i.m.), n = 33 (1 mg i.n.), n = 34 (4 mg i.n. and 0.4 mg i.v.), and n = 36 (2 mg i.n.), unless specified otherwise.

- **Safety**: No severe adverse events (AEs) occurred. A total of 17 subjects (of n = 38) experienced 24 AEs, of which 11 in nine subjects were assessed as naloxone-related. The occurrence of AEs did not appear to be dose-related: seven subjects experienced AEs after the 2 mg i.n. dose, while only three subjects experienced AEs after the 4 mg i.n. dose.

### Community-based opioid overdose prevention programs providing naloxone - United States, 2010 [^116iaZLA]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

Drug overdose death rates have increased steadily in the United States since 1979. In 2008, a total of 36,450 drug overdose deaths (i.e. unintentional, intentional [suicide or homicide], or undetermined intent) were reported, with prescription opioid analgesics (e.g. oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone), cocaine, and heroin the drugs most commonly involved. Since the mid-1990s, community-based programs have offered opioid overdose prevention services to persons who use drugs, their families and friends, and service providers.

Since 1996, an increasing number of these programs have provided the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride, the treatment of choice to reverse the potentially fatal respiratory depression caused by overdose of heroin and other opioids. Naloxone has no effect on non-opioid overdoses (e.g. cocaine, benzodiazepines, or alcohol).

In October 2010, the Harm Reduction Coalition, a national advocacy and capacity-building organization, surveyed 50 programs known to distribute naloxone in the United States to collect data on local program locations, naloxone distribution, and overdose reversals. This report summarizes the findings for the 48 programs that completed the survey and the 188 local programs represented by the responses. Since the first opioid overdose prevention program began distributing naloxone in 1996, the respondent programs reported training and distributing naloxone to 53,032 persons and receiving reports of 10,171 overdose reversals. Providing opioid overdose education and naloxone to persons who use drugs and to persons who might assist in an overdose situation is a critical public health strategy.

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^113xDE2z]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Male Sprague Dawley rats (225–250 g; 7–8 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Rats were randomly assigned to three groups: vehicle, naloxone, and AG10-L-E2-Naloxone. Initially, each rat received a subcutaneous (s.c.) dose of 100 mg kg⁻¹ of morphine (n = 9 per group). Five minutes after receiving the morphine dose, rats were administered a single s.c. dose of either vehicle, naloxone (15 µmol kg⁻¹, equivalent to 5 mg kg⁻¹), or AG10-L-E2-Naloxone (15 µmol kg⁻¹, equivalent to 15.8 mg kg⁻¹). Both naloxone and AG10-L-E2-Naloxone were dissolved in the same vehicle dosing solution, while morphine was dissolved in water. The injection volumes for morphine and the antagonists were 200 and 500 µL, respectively. Rats were then returned to their cages under routine conditions. The number of deaths and the approximate time of death for the rats were recorded. Six hours after the first morphine dose, all surviving rats received a second s.c. dose of 50 mg kg⁻¹ morphine. Rats were again placed back into their cages and observed for any deaths, with total fatalities recorded and survival rates calculated for each group.

For the fentanyl mortality study, rats initially received a s.c. dose of 3 mg kg⁻¹ fentanyl (n = 8 per group). Five minutes after the fentanyl dose, each rat was administered a single s.c. dose of either vehicle, naloxone (15 µmol kg⁻¹, equivalent to 5 mg kg⁻¹), or AG10-L-E2-Naloxone (15 µmol kg⁻¹, equivalent to 15.8 mg kg⁻¹). Both naloxone and AG10-L-E2-Naloxone were similarly dissolved in the same vehicle dosing solution.

### Heroin overdose resuscitation with naloxone: Patient uses own prescribed supply to save the life of a peer [^113rFEHT]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Opiate overdose is the primary cause of death among injection-drug users, representing a major public health concern worldwide. Opiate overdose can be reversed through timely administration of naloxone, and users have expressed willingness to carry the antidote for emergency use (take-home naloxone). In November 2014, new WHO guidelines identified that naloxone should be made available to anyone at risk of witnessing an overdose.

We present the case of a 46-year-old man in opioid-maintenance treatment who used take-home naloxone to rescue an overdose victim. This is the first-ever account of a patient using dose titration of naloxone to restore respiratory function while minimizing the risk of adverse effects.

To improve the safety of take-home naloxone, the authors call for clinicians involved in the treatment of opiate users to:

- **Prescribe take-home naloxone**: To all patients.
- **Forewarn patients of potential side effects**.
- **Instruct patients in naloxone dose titration**.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115oyzQ8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically concerning buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend allowing 7–14 days to elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone. This period is crucial when considering a transition from buprenorphine to naltrexone to ensure that the patient is not physically dependent on opioids before commencing naltrexone.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^117AX8X4]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Take-home naloxone can prevent death from heroin/opioid overdose, but pre-provision is difficult because naloxone is usually given by injection. Non-injectable alternatives, including naloxone nasal sprays, are currently being developed. To be effective, the intranasal (i.n.) spray dose must be adequate but not excessive, and early absorption must be comparable to intramuscular (i.m.) injection. We report on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a specially produced concentrated novel nasal spray. The specific aims were to: (1) estimate PK profiles of i.n. naloxone, (2) compare early systemic exposure with i.n. versus i.m. naloxone, and (3) estimate i.n. bioavailability.

- **Design**: Open-label, randomized, five-way cross-over PK study.

- **Setting**: Clinical trials facility (Croydon, UK).

- **Participants**: Thirty-eight healthy volunteers (age 20–54 years; 11 female).

- **Intervention and comparator**: Three doses of i.n. (1 mg/0.1 ml, 2 mg/0.1 ml, 4 mg/0.2 ml) versus 0.4 mg i.m. (reference) and 0.4 mg intravenous (i.v.) naloxone.

- **Measurements**: Regular blood samples were taken, with high-frequency sampling during the first 15 minutes to capture early systemic exposure. PK parameters were determined from plasma naloxone concentrations. Exploratory analyses involved simulation of repeat administration.

- **Findings**: Mean peak concentration (C max) values for 1 mg (1.51 ng/ml), 2 mg (2.87 ng/ml), and 4 mg (6.02 ng/ml) i.n. exceeded 0.4 mg i.m. (1.27 ng/ml) naloxone. All three i.n. doses rapidly achieved plasma levels > 50% of peak concentrations (T50%) by 10 minutes, peaking at 15–30 minutes.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray over first 30 minutes post-dosing: Analysis of suitability for opioid overdose reversal [^112W1s9c]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Lack of non-injectable naloxone formulations has impeded widespread take-home provision for the prevention of heroin/opioid overdose deaths. For non-injectable formulations that are finally being investigated, rapid onset of action and sufficient bioavailability will be vital. We present an analysis of data from a study of concentrated naloxone nasal spray formulations. Our aims are to assess (1) pharmacokinetic properties and (2) suitability for overdose reversal in terms of naloxone absorption within 30 minutes post-dosing.

- **Design and interventions/comparator**: Open-label, randomized, four-way cross-over Latin-square pharmacokinetic study of naloxone administration by three routes: intranasal at two doses (8 mg/0.4 ml, 16 mg/0.4 ml) versus sublingual (16 mg/ml) versus intravenous reference (1 mg/ml).

- **Setting**: Clinical Pharmacology Unit at The Ohio State University (Columbus, OH, USA).

- **Participants**: Twelve healthy volunteers (age 20–41; seven female).

- **Measurements**: From blood plasma naloxone concentrations, (1) standard pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum plasma concentration (C max) and mean absolute bioavailability (F%, relative to intravenous injection), were determined; as well as (2) partial area under the curve (AUC) values, t max (time to maximum plasma concentration), and t 50% (time to 50% of maximum plasma concentration) as measures of early absorption.

- **Findings**: Bioavailability was F% = 25–28% for intranasal naloxone. Sublingual had low bioavailability (F% = 2%) and was not considered further. Mean C max values for 8 mg (12.8

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^112Ryg16]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

The 2 mg intranasal (i.n.) dose produced a speed of onset and early exposure comparable to the 0.4 mg intramuscular (i.m.) dose while maintaining plasma levels for the next 2 hours at twice the level of the i.m. reference. Plasma concentrations from the 2 mg i.n. dose exceeded those from the 0.4 mg i.m. dose within 6 minutes post-dosing on average. The focus on this 2 mg i.n. dose may be particularly applicable to emergency administration using a dose-escalation schedule, as recommended with i.m. doses starting at 0.4 mg and increased at intervals (e.g. 3-minute intervals) to a total of 2 mg.

A comparable i.n. dose-escalation schedule would involve an initial 2 mg dose to achieve an onset comparable to i.m. 0.4 mg, followed by a second 2 mg i.n. dose 3 minutes later. This is the hypothetical schedule examined in the repeat-dosing simulation. As the second i.n. dose is given to the unused nostril, absorption from both administrations should be equal, and the similarity between the simulation and the 4 mg tested dose supports this assumption. Furthermore, the sustained plasma concentrations for the 2 mg i.n. dose, compared with the i.m. reference, may benefit post-resuscitation care. Given that the half-life of some opioids substantially exceeds that of naloxone (1–1.5 hours), sustained plasma naloxone concentrations from i.n. administration would probably reduce the risk of rebound toxicity when naloxone concentrations drop following intravenous (i.v.) or i.m. administration.

### Characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder associated with performing overdose reversals in the community: An opioid treatment program analysis [^116r5RQQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The opioid crisis is a US public health epidemic. Drug overdose (OD) deaths exceed all other causes of injury, including motor vehicle accidents and gun-related violence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates there are 91 US deaths per day involving opioids. Approximately 3 million Americans suffer from opioid use disorder (OUD), a condition manifested by escalating physical and psychological cravings for opioid analgesics.

People begin using opioid analgesics for many different reasons. Some initially obtain prescription opioids from a medical provider for a diagnosis of acute or chronic pain. Others may begin to use prescription opioids from a friend, a relative, or a stranger for the psychoactive feeling of well-being. Ultimately, the majority of people who develop OUD will switch to heroin because of the lower cost and accessibility. Polydrug use among people who use heroin, especially the use of alcohol and benzodiazepines, is an important contributor to drug OD.

Although self-administration of naloxone is not possible during an OD event, people who OD, especially from heroin, are usually not alone. Community members present, when trained and supplied with naloxone, can serve as first responders by performing OD reversals on others in their community. Community members who perform OD reversals are often reluctant to call emergency medical services due to fear of police. Other barriers to naloxone access include cost, inadequate first responder training, and lengthy response times, especially in rural communities.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^112R6yAt]. Addiction (2018). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetic profiles are illustrated through various parameters. The mean plasma naloxone concentrations during the first 2 hours post-dosing are displayed, including an expanded depiction of the first 20 minutes.

- **Plasma concentration following i.v. administration**: After a 0.4 mg dose, the concentration spiked and reached an early peak with a geometric mean C_max of 5.94 ng/ml and a median T_max of 2 minutes, followed by a rapid decline during the next 10 minutes and a gradual decline thereafter.

- **I.m. administration results**: The 0.4 mg dose showed a more gradual early uptake, with a lower and later peak (geometric mean C_max 1.27 ng/ml, median T_max 10 minutes) and a flatter, slower decline thereafter. Overall AUCt-based exposure was comparable for both i.m. and i.v. administrations.

- **I.n. doses (1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg)**: All doses achieved maximum plasma levels within 15–30 minutes (median T_max). Geometric mean C_max values for 1 mg i.n. (1.51 ng/ml), 2 mg i.n. (2.87 ng/ml), and 4 mg i.n. (6.02 ng/ml) were greater than those for i.m.

- **Comparison of AUCt values**: For all three i.n. doses, geometric mean AUCt values (2.56–10.01 h × ng/ml) exceeded those of the 0.4 mg i.m. and i.v. doses (both: 2.01 h × ng/ml). Of the three i.n. doses, the 2 mg dose followed the 0.4 mg i.m. curve most closely during the first 10 minutes post-dose, reached blood levels at twice the 0.4 mg i.m. dose by 15 minutes, and maintained blood levels at more than twice the 0.4 mg i.m. dose for the next 2 hours.
