## Question

A 12-year-old boy with a history of mild persistent asthma presents for routine follow-up. His asthma is generally well-controlled with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. He has no complaints of increased symptoms at home, and his parents deny any obvious triggers. On further questioning, there is no history of sneezing, nasal congestion, or wheezing specifically related to being indoors, and there are no pets or visible mold in the home. Skin prick testing for common indoor allergens (dust mites, pet dander, mold, cockroach, and rodent allergens) is negative.

Based on current NHLBI asthma guidelines, should you recommend routine allergen mitigation interventions (such as air purifiers, mattress covers, or pest control) for this patient as part of his asthma management? Justify your answer according to the guideline.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether routine allergen mitigation interventions should be recommended for a 12-year-old with well-controlled mild persistent asthma, negative skin prick testing, and no indoor allergen–related symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk profile and whether there is identifiable allergic asthma. Then, I should verify what the NHLBI 2020 focused update actually recommends for patients without sensitization or symptoms. Next, I will review the evidence quality and why single-component strategies often fail. After that, I should consider exceptions and practical burdens. Finally, I will align the recommendation with guideline language and outline what to do instead of blanket allergen mitigation [^a71aeff6] [^d9baf661].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. This patient has mild persistent asthma that is well controlled on low-dose ICS, no reported indoor allergen–related symptoms, and negative skin prick testing to common indoor allergens; there are no pets or visible mold, which further lowers the likelihood of clinically relevant exposure to those triggers, so I should be cautious not to over-attribute symptoms to allergens that are neither present nor provocative in his environment [^a71aeff6] [^d9baf661].

> Wait, let me verify the core recommendation from the NHLBI 2020 focused update. The Expert Panel conditionally recommends against routine allergen mitigation interventions in individuals with asthma who do not have sensitization to specific indoor allergens or symptoms related to exposure to those allergens; conversely, it conditionally recommends multicomponent, allergen-specific mitigation only when there are symptoms related to identified indoor allergens confirmed by history or testing, which is not the case here [^a71aeff6] [^d9baf661] [^0d608364].

> I need to check the rationale and evidence quality. The certainty of benefit for most single-component allergen mitigation strategies is low to very low, and many studies show no improvement in critical outcomes like exacerbations, control, or quality of life; importantly, mattress and pillow covers alone have moderate-certainty evidence of no benefit, and integrated pest management is the only single-component approach with any signal of benefit, but again that applies when there is sensitization and exposure to pests, which this patient lacks [^8099bc6a] [^1fa7c92e] [^7eae8567].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider exceptions and practical burdens. Even when sensitization exists, benefits are small and interventions can be costly or difficult to sustain, so routine deployment without a matching exposure–sensitization–symptom triad risks low yield and added burden; the guidelines emphasize tailoring to exposure, sensitization, and symptoms, and they caution against acaricides and most single-component strategies outside of a targeted bundle, reinforcing that we should avoid blanket recommendations here [^c054427b] [^ec1d5518] [^63b828e5].

> Let me reconsider whether any subgroup guidance would change this. The NHLBI recommendations are framed for individuals aged 12 years and older and consistently apply the same conditional stance: no routine mitigation without sensitization or symptoms, and multicomponent strategies only when both exposure and sensitization or symptoms are present; GINA similarly advises against routine allergen avoidance and highlights limited benefit even in sensitized patients, which supports withholding mitigation in this scenario [^7bd758a7] [^796eae7c] [^ef1a4c97].

> Next, I should review what to do instead. I will continue guideline-based pharmacologic control and reinforce general environmental hygiene and trigger avoidance education, while reserving allergen-specific mitigation for patients with a compatible history or positive testing and confirmed exposure; if control worsens, I should reassess exposures and consider targeted testing, but I should not default to unproven mitigation in the absence of a clear allergen–symptom link [^a71aeff6] [^d9baf661] [^7320caf4].

> Final recommendation: I should not recommend routine allergen mitigation interventions such as air purifiers, mattress covers, or pest control for this patient, because he lacks sensitization on testing, has no indoor allergen–related symptoms, and there is no identified exposure of concern; the NHLBI 2020 guideline conditionally recommends against routine mitigation in this exact circumstance, and any future consideration would require evidence of sensitization, exposure, and symptom correlation before instituting a tailored, multicomponent approach [^a71aeff6] [^d9baf661] [^0d608364].

Routine allergen mitigation is **not recommended** for this patient because he has no sensitization or symptoms related to indoor allergens [^a71aeff6]. The NHLBI 2020 guidelines advise against routine allergen mitigation in patients without sensitization or symptoms, as benefits are small and uncertain [^d9baf661] [^796eae7c], and single-component measures (e.g. air purifiers, mattress covers) are ineffective [^8099bc6a] [^1fa7c92e]. Instead, prioritize **general environmental measures** (regular cleaning, humidity control, smoke avoidance) and continue guideline-based pharmacotherapy [^c054427b] [^90940596]. Reserve allergen-specific interventions for patients with confirmed sensitization and symptoms [^70116e93] [^d9baf661].

## NHLBI 2020 guidelines on allergen mitigation

The NHLBI 2020 guidelines provide **clear recommendations** on allergen mitigation in asthma management:

- **Routine allergen mitigation is not recommended**: For patients without sensitization or symptoms related to specific indoor allergens, the guidelines conditionally recommend against routine allergen mitigation interventions [^a71aeff6] [^d9baf661].

- **Tailored interventions for sensitized patients**: For patients with confirmed sensitization and symptoms related to exposure, multicomponent, allergen-specific mitigation strategies are conditionally recommended [^70116e93] [^d9baf661].

- **Single-component interventions are ineffective**: Single-component interventions, such as mattress covers or air purifiers alone, have not demonstrated significant clinical benefits and are not recommended as standalone strategies [^8099bc6a] [^1fa7c92e].

---

## Evidence supporting the guidelines

The guidelines are based on **systematic reviews and meta-analyses** showing that routine allergen mitigation does not significantly improve asthma outcomes in patients without sensitization or symptoms [^f861e631] [^f53758b7]. Specifically:

- **Low certainty of evidence**: The certainty of evidence for routine allergen mitigation interventions is low, indicating limited confidence in their effectiveness [^f53758b7] [^2f71b040].

- **Small benefits in sensitized patients**: Even in patients with confirmed sensitization, the clinical benefits of allergen mitigation are modest and vary depending on the specific allergen and intervention [^2b51a100] [^f79d8834].

- **Burden and cost**: Routine allergen mitigation interventions can be burdensome and costly, particularly for families with limited resources, without proven benefit [^63b828e5] [^c054427b].

---

## Applicability to the patient scenario

In this case, the patient has **no sensitization** to common indoor allergens (dust mites, pet dander, mold, cockroach, or rodent allergens) and reports no symptoms related to indoor exposures. Therefore, routine allergen mitigation interventions such as air purifiers, mattress covers, or pest control are not recommended by the NHLBI 2020 guidelines [^a71aeff6] [^d9baf661].

---

## Alternative environmental management strategies

While routine allergen mitigation is not recommended, **general environmental measures** should still be emphasized:

- **Regular cleaning**: Encourage regular house cleaning and laundering of bedding materials to maintain a clean indoor environment [^c054427b] [^fba2515a].

- **Humidity control**: Maintain indoor humidity levels below 50% to reduce dust mite proliferation and mold growth [^notfound].

- **Smoke avoidance**: Avoid exposure to tobacco smoke and other irritants that can exacerbate asthma symptoms [^219322d2].

- **Ventilation**: Ensure adequate ventilation in living spaces to reduce indoor pollutant concentrations [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Based on the NHLBI 2020 guidelines, the following **clinical recommendations** are appropriate for this patient:

- **Continue current pharmacotherapy**: Maintain the current low-dose inhaled corticosteroid regimen, as it is effective in controlling mild persistent asthma [^90940596] [^83a21991].

- **No routine allergen mitigation**: Do not recommend routine allergen mitigation interventions such as air purifiers, mattress covers, or pest control, as there is no evidence of benefit in patients without sensitization or symptoms [^a71aeff6] [^d9baf661].

- **Monitor and reassess**: Regularly monitor asthma control and reassess the need for allergen mitigation if symptoms arise or sensitization is identified in the future [^7bd758a7] [^7320caf4].

---

## Conclusion and clinical decision

Routine allergen mitigation interventions are **not recommended** for this patient because he lacks sensitization or symptoms related to indoor allergens. The NHLBI 2020 guidelines emphasize tailoring allergen mitigation to patients with confirmed sensitization and symptoms, and single-component interventions are ineffective. Therefore, the focus should remain on **general environmental hygiene** and continued pharmacologic management, with reassessment if clinical status changes [^a71aeff6] [^d9baf661].

For individuals with asthma who have allergy symptoms or a test result suggesting that they are allergic to dust mites, the Expert Panel recommends using multicomponent interventions to reduce dust mite levels in the home and improve asthma outcomes. Use of pillow and mattress covers alone does not improve asthma outcomes.

Overall, the studies of allergen mitigation strategies provide low certainty of evidence that these strategies are beneficial for key asthma outcomes. Therefore, the Expert Panel recommends tailored allergen intervention strategies only for individuals with asthma who are exposed to these specific allergens and have either symptoms based on clinical history or an allergy to these substances based on allergy testing.

Based on current data on the use of a variety of single-component and multicomponent strategies to reduce exposure to allergens, the Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementing allergen exposure reduction strategies:
Allergen mitigation strategies can be used in individuals of all ages with asthma of all levels of severity.
Clinicians need to tailor mitigation strategies to the individual based on their allergy symptoms, sensitization, and exposures. Clinicians should consider allergen testing when appropriate, before committing individuals to specific allergen mitigation strategies that may be burdensome. See Table IIIA for allergen-specific mitigation interventions addressed in the systematic review report. Table IIIB summarizes the certainty of evidence on various allergen mitigation interventions.
The Expert Panel recognizes the existing inequities in access to specialists and allergen testing. The panel therefore advises clinicians to, at a minimum, take a clinical history of symptoms and exposures for all individuals with asthma to help determine the need for allergen mitigation.
Allergy testing (with a skin prick or allergen-specific IgE test) may have false-positive and false-negative results, and certain allergens (eg, dust) may also act as irritants. For an individual whose symptoms worsen on exposure to specific aeroallergens, the Expert Panel recommends that the clinician consider mitigating that aeroallergen even if the individual's test result is negative.
Some of the interventions examined provide no or low certainty of evidence about their efficacy in improving asthma outcomes (including exacerbations, quality of life, asthma control, and symptoms). The Expert Panel recognizes that some of the interventions, especially integrated pest management and mold mitigation, may have broader public health benefits. However, these interventions do not replace routine good practices, including regular and frequent house cleaning and laundering of bedding materials.
Some people are allergic to dander (flakes of skin) or saliva from pets. The few studies on pet removal have had inconclusive results. However, if an individual with asthma experiences symptoms around a pet, the individual should consider removing the pet from the home, keeping the pet outdoors, or, if neither of these options is feasible, keeping the pet out of commonly used rooms. Testing for sensitization to pets may be particularly worthwhile for those with chronic or uncontrolled symptoms and might help support what can be a difficult decision to remove a pet from the home.
Some cleaning and integrated pest management interventions may trigger asthma and/or be hazardous. Individuals with asthma need to balance the potential benefits and harms of interventions before implementing them.
If an individual with asthma has sensitization to an allergen on skin prick testing and is exposed to that allergen but has no objective evidence of worsened disease control and denies having symptoms, chronic exposure could have led to the development of clinical tolerance to that allergen in that environment. Allergen-specific mitigation strategies could adversely modify this established balanced relationship between the individual and the environment.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians need to consider the complexity of the patient population and the limitations of the evidence identified. Clinicians may also find it helpful to consider the severity of a patient's asthma, the small benefit, and the extent of previous symptoms and exacerbations when recommending allergen mitigation interventions. Allergen mitigation interventions may be expensive or difficult for patients to use or maintain. Clinicians should consider the cost implications of certain interventions, especially among those with limited financial resources, and assess the magnitude of the potential value of an intervention in improving an individual's asthma outcomes.

Allergen mitigation in asthma — In individuals with asthma without sensitization to specific indoor allergens or without symptoms related to exposure to specific indoor allergens, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against allergen mitigation interventions as part of routine asthma management; in those with symptoms related to identified indoor allergens confirmed by history or testing, it conditionally recommends a multicomponent allergen-specific mitigation intervention. For sensitization or symptoms related to pests (cockroaches and rodents), it conditionally recommends the use of integrated pest management alone or as part of a multicomponent allergen-specific mitigation intervention; for dust mite exposure, it conditionally recommends impermeable pillow/mattress covers only as part of a multicomponent allergen mitigation intervention, not as a single-component intervention.

SECTION III: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INDOOR ALLERGEN MITIGATION IN MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Environmental control is one of the four cornerstones of asthma management in Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. The Expert Panel was tasked with examining the effectiveness of single-component and multicomponent allergen mitigation strategies directed at common, indoor aeroallergens, with the goal of improving asthma outcomes for individuals with asthma. The key questions for this priority topic and the recommendations by the Expert Panel are provided for single-component and multicomponent allergen mitigation strategies.

Not included in the scope of work for this priority topic is an examination of the utility of clinical testing for sensitivity to allergens (eg, using skin prick tests or tests of allergen-specific IgE), mitigation strategies for out door allergens, and mitigation of environmental irritants (eg, tobacco smoke). Specific occupational exposures were also outside the scope of work, although the indoor allergens addressed in these recommendations can be encountered in work settings.

Heterogeneity of studies.

The Expert Panel found the heterogeneity of available studies to be challenging. As outlined in the allergen reduction systematic review report, participants' baseline clinical characteristics were variable, and the findings from these studies suggested that participants were not equally likely to benefit from the interventions reviewed.

In addition, the Expert Panel preserved the systematic review report authors' distinction between single-component interventions designed to mitigate a single allergen (eg, an acaricide for house-dust mite allergens); single-component interventions that address multiple allergens (eg, air purifiers to control mold and animal dander); and multicomponent interventions, which usually target more than one allergen (see Table IIIA).

Many of the studies available to the Expert Panel examined multicomponent interventions in mixed populations of patients with varying severities of asthma and sensitizations to allergens. Moreover, the combinations of components examined in each study were rarely the same across studies, and most studies did not assess adherence to or use of the interventions. The Expert Panel concurred with the systematic review report authors' assessment that the interplay between allergen type, intervention type, and individual patient characteristics could have strongly modified the effects of these interventions in these studies.

Targeting recommendations to individuals who are both exposed and allergic to specific allergens.

It was the Expert Panel's judgment that individuals with asthma should not burden themselves with allergen mitigation interventions if they are both not regularly exposed to an allergen and not allergic to a specific allergen. Given that certain populations might not have ready access to allergy specialists and allergen skin prick or IgE testing, the Expert Panel noted that patient histories (eg, symptoms related to exposure to specific indoor allergens) to assess patient sensitivities could suffice. Therefore, the Expert Panel is not recommending allergen mitigation interventions for all individuals with asthma. Instead, the panel is recommending basing decisions about allergen mitigation interventions on a combination of the exposures, symptoms, and sensitization of individuals with asthma.

Environmental indoor allergen mitigation in asthma — Expert Panel conditional recommendations are as follows: In individuals with asthma who do not have sensitization or symptoms related to specific indoor allergens, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against allergen mitigation interventions as part of routine asthma management. In individuals with asthma who have symptoms related to exposure to identified indoor allergens confirmed by history or allergy testing, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends a multicomponent allergen-specific mitigation intervention. For sensitization or symptoms related to exposure to pests (cockroaches and rodents), the Expert Panel conditionally recommends the use of integrated pest management alone, or as part of a multicomponent allergen-specific mitigation intervention. For sensitization or symptoms related to exposure to dust mites, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends impermeable pillow/mattress covers only as part of a multicomponent allergen mitigation intervention, not as a single-component intervention.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^ec1d5518]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma environmental allergen mitigation — targeting and general considerations emphasize that the Expert Panel does not recommend the use of acaricides and is not recommending allergen mitigation interventions for all individuals with asthma, instead recommending basing decisions on exposures, symptoms, and sensitization; the panel judged that individuals with asthma should not burden themselves with interventions if they are both not regularly exposed to an allergen and not allergic to a specific allergen, and noted that when access to testing is limited, patient histories could suffice; potential harms and burdens vary, as impermeable pillow and mattress covers are low-risk with limited costs but likely require frequent cleaning of bedding above the covers to be effective, whereas interventions for mold mitigation and carpet removal could be associated with risks or be costly or difficult to complete.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^7320caf4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Allergen mitigation implementation guidance in asthma emphasizes appropriate targeting and testing: For individuals with asthma who do not exhibit any allergy symptoms or for whom testing has not suggested an allergy to specific indoor substances (eg, dust mites or cat dander), the Expert Panel recommends no specific environmental interventions within the home. For exposure to cockroaches or rodents with allergy symptoms or sensitization by skin testing or specific IgE, the Expert Panel recommends using integrated pest management, which can be used alone or with other interventions to reduce exposure. For suspected dust mite allergy, the Expert Panel recommends using multicomponent interventions to reduce dust mite levels and improve asthma outcomes, and use of pillow and mattress covers alone does not improve asthma outcomes. Overall evidence is of low certainty for benefit, so the Expert Panel recommends tailored allergen intervention strategies only for individuals exposed to specific allergens with symptoms by history or allergy by testing. Allergen mitigation strategies can be used in individuals of all ages and severities of asthma, and clinicians should tailor strategies to symptoms, sensitization, and exposures; clinicians should consider allergen testing when appropriate before committing individuals to burdensome strategies. Given inequities in access to specialists and testing, the panel advises at minimum taking a clinical history of symptoms and exposures for all individuals with asthma. Allergy testing may have false-positive and false-negative results and some allergens may act as irritants; if symptoms worsen with specific aeroallergens, the Expert Panel recommends that the clinician consider mitigating that aeroallergen even if testing is negative.

Allergen mitigation interventions — single-component recommendations — Based on the reviewed studies, the Expert Panel made a conditional recommendation against most single-component allergen mitigation interventions as part of routine asthma management for individuals without specific identified triggers or exposure and included a conditional recommendation against impermeable pillow and mattress covers as a single-component allergen mitigation interventions; however, it made a conditional recommendation in favor of using integrated pest management as a single-component allergen mitigation strategy based on evidence showing a reduction in asthma symptoms with low certainty of evidence, noting that many RCTs of impermeable mattress and pillow covers showed no benefit for critical outcomes and that results for pet removal were inconclusive.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^796eae7c]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — indoor allergen avoidance advice — Allergen avoidance is not recommended as a general strategy for people with asthma (Evidence A). For sensitized patients, although it would seem logical to attempt to avoid allergen exposure in the home, there is little evidence for clinical benefit with single avoidance strategies (Evidence A) and only limited evidence for benefit with multi-component avoidance strategies (in children) (Evidence B). Although allergen avoidance strategies may be beneficial for some sensitized patients (Evidence B), they are often complicated and expensive, and there are no validated methods for identifying those who are likely to benefit (Evidence D).

Question 3.1

Among individuals with asthma, what is the effectiveness of interventions (eg, pesticides, air filters/purifiers, mattress covers, and pest control) to reduce or remove indoor inhalant allergens on asthma control, exacerbations, quality of life, and other relevant outcomes?

In some individuals, asthma can have an allergic component. Therefore, clinicians should take a history of the individual's environmental allergen exposure and pursue testing for specific allergen sensitization, when appropriate. The Expert Panel has several recommendations for this question:

Recommendation 5: In individuals with asthma who do not have sensitization to specific indoor allergens or who do not have symptoms related to exposure to specific indoor allergens, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against allergen mitigation interventions as part of routine asthma management.

Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence

Recommendation 6: In individuals with asthma who have symptoms related to exposure to identified indoor allergens, confirmed by history taking or allergy testing, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends a multicomponent allergen-specific mitigation intervention.

Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence

Recommendation 7: In individuals with asthma who have sensitization or symptoms related to exposure to pests (cockroaches and rodents), the Expert Panel conditionally recommends the use of integrated pest management alone, or as part of a multicomponent allergen-specific mitigation intervention.

Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence

Recommendation 8: In individuals with asthma who have sensitization or symptoms related to exposure to dust mites, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends impermeable pillow/mattress covers only as part of a multicomponent allergen mitigation intervention, not as a single-component intervention.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

### Managing asthma in adolescents and adults: 2020 asthma guideline update from the national asthma education and prevention program [^ce068196]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Asthma is a major public health problem worldwide and is associated with excess morbidity, mortality, and economic costs associated with lost productivity. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program has released the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update with updated evidence-based recommendations for treatment of patients with asthma.

Objective

To report updated recommendations for 6 topics for clinical management of adolescents and adults with asthma: (1) intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs); (2) add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists; (3) fractional exhaled nitric oxide; (4) indoor allergen mitigation; (5) immunotherapy; and (6) bronchial thermoplasty.

Evidence Review

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council chose 6 topics to update the 2007 asthma guidelines based on results from a 2014 needs assessment. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted systematic reviews of these 6 topics based on literature searches up to March-April 2017. Reviews were updated through October 2018 and used by an expert panel (n = 19) that included asthma content experts, primary care clinicians, dissemination and implementation experts, and health policy experts to develop 19 new recommendations using the GRADE method. The 17 recommendations for individuals aged 12 years or older are reported in this Special Communication.

Findings

From 20 572 identified references, 475 were included in the 6 systematic reviews to form the evidence basis for these recommendations. Compared with the 2007 guideline, there was no recommended change in step 1 (intermittent asthma) therapy (as-needed short-acting β2-agonists [SABAs] for rescue therapy). In step 2 (mild persistent asthma), either daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA therapy or as-needed concomitant ICS and SABA therapy are recommended. Formoterol in combination with an ICS in a single inhaler (single maintenance and reliever therapy) is recommended as the preferred therapy for moderate persistent asthma in step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol therapy) and step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol therapy) for both daily and as-needed therapy. A short-term increase in the ICS dose alone for worsening of asthma symptoms is not recommended. Add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists are recommended in individuals whose asthma is not controlled by ICS-formoterol therapy for step 5 (moderate-severe persistent asthma). Fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing is recommended to assist in diagnosis and monitoring of symptoms, but not alone to diagnose or monitor asthma. Allergen mitigation is recommended only in individuals with exposure and relevant sensitivity or symptoms. When used, allergen mitigation should be allergen specific and include multiple allergen-specific mitigation strategies. Subcutaneous immunotherapy is recommended as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy for individuals with symptoms and sensitization to specific allergens. Sublingual immunotherapy is not recommended specifically for asthma. Bronchial thermoplasty is not recommended as part of standard care; if used, it should be part of an ongoing research effort.

Conclusions and Relevance

Asthma is a common disease with substantial human and economic costs globally. Although there is no cure or established means of prevention, effective treatment is available. Use of the recommendations in the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update should improve the health of individuals with asthma.

Asthma environmental allergen mitigation — patient counseling and safety considerations — include that "Some cleaning and integrated pest management interventions may trigger asthma and/or be hazardous. Individuals with asthma need to balance the potential benefits and harms of interventions before implementing them". For pet-related exposures, the page notes "The few studies on pet removal have had inconclusive results", but "if an individual with asthma experiences symptoms around a pet, the individual should consider removing the pet from the home, keeping the pet outdoors, or, if neither of these options is feasible, keeping the pet out of commonly used rooms", and "Testing for sensitization to pets may be particularly worthwhile for those with chronic or uncontrolled symptoms and might help support what can be a difficult decision to remove a pet from the home". It also cautions that in sensitized individuals without symptoms "chronic exposure could have led to the development of clinical tolerance to that allergen in that environment", and that "Allergen-specific mitigation strategies could adversely modify this established balanced relationship between the individual and the environment". Additionally, "Clinicians need to consider the complexity of the patient population and the limitations of the evidence identified", and these approaches "do not replace routine good practices, including regular and frequent house cleaning and laundering of bedding materials".

### Question 6: what is the use of allergy testing in children with asthma? [^f69809af]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Disagreement exists between asthma guidelines on the routine use of allergy testing in the diagnostic work-up of a child with persistent asthma, although the important role of inhalant allergy in the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis is undisputed. The usefulness of screening for inhalant allergies in asthma is connected to the efficacy of allergen reduction measures and specific immunotherapy, both of which appear to be more effective in children than in adults. Allergen-specific exposure reduction recommendations are therefore an essential part of childhood asthma management. Such recommendations should be guided by appropriate diagnosis of inhalant allergy, based on a structured allergy history and results of sensitization tests. Specific IgE testing and skin prick testing show comparable results in identifying clinically important sensitizations. Although a therapeutic medication trial can be started pragmatically in children with asthma without diagnosing their inhalant allergy, we recommend making or excluding an accurate diagnosis of inhalant allergy.

### Indoor environmental control practices and asthma management [^5549c139]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Indoor environmental control practices and asthma management — assessment and tailored interventions include tailoring strategies to each potentially relevant indoor exposure based on allergic sensitivities and indoor exposures, using serum allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing or referral for allergy skin testing for patients who meet National Asthma Education and Prevention Program criteria for persistent asthma, which include patients taking a long-term controller medication as well as patients having symptoms ≥ 2 days per week or nocturnal symptoms more than twice per month. Serum IgE testing and allergy skin testing are both appropriate methods of assessing allergic sensitivities; neither is clearly better than the other, and there is no lower age limit for either test. Environmental histories for allergic children include questions about furry pets or pests or evidence of pests, and for pollutants the history focuses on smokers in the home or caregivers and the use of gas stoves and appliances. Environmental control strategies include source removal, source control, and mitigation strategies such as using high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers and allergen-proof mattress/box spring and pillow encasements, and individually tailored, multifaceted environmental interventions are endorsed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines and may be similar in terms of efficacy to controller medications.

Asthma environmental allergen mitigation — single-component interventions are characterized by low or very low certainty of evidence or results limited to one or two critical outcomes that were inconclusive or showed no improvement; integrated pest management was the only single-component approach with beneficial effects, while single-component dust mite interventions using pillow and mattress covers demonstrated no benefit for any of the critical outcomes, including asthma symptoms, leading to the Expert Panel's judgment that single-component approaches to mitigating an allergen are rarely effective.

Environmental evaluation and management for the pediatric patient with asthma — An assessment of environmental triggers and education regarding evidence-based approaches to exposure reduction are an integral part of asthma management in the pediatric patient. Children are vulnerable to respiratory effects of indoor environmental exposures and may experience lasting pulmonary effects into adulthood. To assess clinical relevance of indoor allergens, an assessment of allergic sensitization is useful; allergen-specific IgE tests can be ordered from commercial laboratories by a primary care provider. Testing to large panels is not helpful; instead, testing to selected relevant allergens is preferred, guided by the clinical scenario, such as testing to common indoor allergens for pediatric patients with persistent asthma.

Asthma non-pharmacological interventions — avoidance of indoor allergens: Allergen avoidance is not recommended as a general strategy in asthma. For sensitized patients, there is limited evidence of clinical benefit for asthma in most circumstances with single-strategy indoor allergen avoidance. Remediation of dampness or mold in homes reduces asthma symptoms and medication use in adults. For patients sensitized to house dust mite and/or pets, there is limited evidence of clinical benefit for asthma with avoidance strategies (only in children). Allergen avoidance strategies are often complicated and expensive, and there are no validated methods for identifying those who are likely to benefit.

### Allergen avoidance in asthma: what do we do now? [^edb7bc62]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Although allergen exposure can clearly aggravate the condition of sensitized patients with asthma, there is uncertainty and controversy about exactly which allergen avoidance interventions should be recommended to patients with asthma. Interventions that appear logical may fail to be clinically efficacious for several reasons. Although narrow interventions, such as allergen-impermeable mattress covers to reduce exposure to dust mite allergens, may offer little benefit if used alone, recent evidence suggests that a multifaceted, home-based environmental intervention focusing on multiple exposures may provide clinical benefits to patients with asthma. The role of allergen avoidance in infancy in the primary prevention of asthma is a subject of active investigation, but data remain too preliminary to make public health recommendations in this regard.

### Indoor environmental control practices and asthma management [^c31de21a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Indoor environmental control in pediatric asthma — Asthma affects as many as 10% of children across the United States, with prevalence as high as 25% in some communities, and major risk factors include self-reported black race, Puerto Rican ethnicity, and poverty. Sensitized children exposed to dust mite, rodent, cockroach, and pet allergens have worse asthma control and lung function and greater airway inflammation and morbidity, and exposure to secondhand smoke and nitrogen dioxide exacerbates asthma regardless of sensitization. An estimated 20% of school-aged children with persistent asthma are not atopic. Assessment may include serum allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing or referral for allergy skin testing for patients meeting National Asthma Education and Prevention Program persistent asthma criteria, which include patients taking a long-term controller medication and those having symptoms ≥ 2 days per week or nocturnal symptoms more than twice per month; serum IgE and allergy skin testing are both appropriate, neither is clearly better, and there is no lower age limit. For allergic children, environmental history includes pets and pests, and for pollutants focuses on indoor sources and household chemicals. Environmental control strategies include source removal, source control, and mitigation such as high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers and mattress/box spring and pillow encasements; individually tailored, multifaceted interventions are endorsed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines and may be similar in terms of efficacy to controller medications.

Future research opportunities

The Expert Panel has identified the following topics related to allergen mitigation interventions (eg, acaricides, air purifiers, HEPA vacuum cleaners, carpet removal, pet removal, cleaning products, and mold mitigation) that require additional research:
Effectiveness of allergen mitigation interventions that use the validated outcome measures recommended by the Asthma Outcomes Workshop
Effectiveness of allergen mitigation interventions in individuals with asthma who have demonstrated exposure and/or sensitization to these allergens at home, school, or work
Multicomponent interventions targeted to specific allergens in study populations consisting only of people with demonstrated sensitization and exposure to those allergens
Comparisons of different combinations of multicomponent interventions to determine the optimal combination(s) of allergen-specific mitigation strategies that improve outcomes
Studies to determine the allergen reduction thresholds for symptoms
Interactions and necessity of exposure, sensitization, and symptoms to determine which individuals with asthma will benefit most from allergen mitigation strategies (eg, whether an allergen-specific mitigation strategy is beneficial for an individual with asthma who has sensitization on skin prick testing to an allergen, is exposed to that allergen, and denies having symptoms)

In addition, reports of studies on the effectiveness of allergen mitigation interventions must include details on the intervention studied (eg, the models of air purifiers used) and the protocols for using the intervention (eg, how often the air purifier was turned on, where it was located, and how often the filter was changed). These aspects of the intervention need to be measured, and levels of adherence to the protocol need to be reported.

Adolescents and adults with mild persistent asthma (age 12 years and older) — the Expert Panel conditionally recommends two Step 2 options: either daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for quick relief or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly, with a conditional recommendation and moderate certainty of evidence. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly; the recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years, and the Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence. For implementation, individuals aged 12 years and older with a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy and regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred; one studied approach is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed, administered sequentially in two separate inhalers. Individuals can initiate intermittent therapy at home but should receive regular follow-up, and clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations, with side effects equally infrequent; shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^9cdf510b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mild asthma management in children and adolescents — In preschool-aged children with intermittent wheezing at high risk to develop asthma, daily ICS and intermittent high-dose ICS were associated with decreased symptoms and exacerbations. In preschool-aged children with mild persistent asthma with markers of T2 inflammation such as aeroallergen sensitization or a blood eosinophil count of > 300 cells/μl, a differential response favored daily ICS compared with LTRAs or ICS taken whenever albuterol was used for symptoms. In adolescents aged 12–17 years with mild asthma, as-needed budesonide–formoterol was superior to as-needed terbutaline for severe exacerbation reduction, with similar efficacy to budesonide maintenance. The text notes that adherence to controller medication is key to asthma control and that an as-needed controller approach may improve adherence when it is most needed, during a period of increased symptoms. A recent meta-analysis of nonpharmacological approaches for children and adults found that patient education programs, multifaceted interventions, renovating homes to reduce environmental exposures, and air filtration systems significantly improved asthma control, and the psychosocial environment is recognized as a significant contributor to asthma morbidity.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified four outcomes (exacerbations, asthma quality of life, asthma control, and asthma symptoms) as critical outcomes when it reviewed the evidence. The panel considered outcomes related to health care utilization to be important outcomes. The Expert Panel gave higher priority to outcomes measured in studies that used validated outcome instruments than those assessed with nonvalidated outcome measures. When data on validated outcome measures were not available, the Expert Panel used data from nonvalidated outcome measures, such as asthma symptoms. Table IIIB summarizes the Expert Panel's assessments of the certainty of evidence for each of the allergen mitigation interventions examined, when used as a single-component intervention or as part of a multicomponent intervention.

Additional considerations.

For most of these interventions, the certainty of evidence is low, and the benefits are small. It is not the Expert Panel's intent to suggest that all four of these interventions (mattress and pillow covers, integrated pest management, HEPA vacuum cleaners, and mold mitigation), when used as part of a multicomponent strategy, serve as the optimal allergen mitigation package. Instead, the Expert Panel is indicating that individuals who have symptoms related to exposure to specific allergens should consider using these interventions when appropriate.

The Expert Panel recognizes that patients, providers, and other stakeholders generally find mattress and pillow covers to be an acceptable, noninvasive strategy to reduce exposure to dust mites. However, the Expert Panel cautions individuals with asthma not to use these covers as the sole strategy for mitigating dust mites. Studies that applied mattress and pillow covers solely either showed no effect on asthma outcomes or had inconclusive results. It was the Expert Panel's judgment that mattress and pillow covers should only be applied as part of a multicomponent intervention targeting dust mites.

In summary, the studies of allergen mitigation strategies provided lower certainty of evidence of effectiveness for key asthma outcomes than studies of asthma controller medications. For these reasons, the Expert Panel recommends only tailored allergen intervention strategies for individuals with asthma who have symptoms related to exposure confirmed by allergy testing or clinical history for identified indoor allergens.

### Controlling indoor allergens [^e0b0f1cc]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Reading of this article reinforces the reader's knowledge of the role of allergen exposure in relation to asthma and its severity, as well as the relevance of allergen avoidance in the treatment of asthma.

Data Sources

Initial literature search for existing evidence-based guidelines, reviews, and meta-analyses was carried out, and further literature searches were performed to review individual randomized controlled trials. Evidence level was graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network recommendations.

Results

There is good evidence for the link between mite and cockroach allergen exposure and sensitization, and between sensitization and asthma. For pet allergens, some studies found that exposure to pets in early life was associated with specific immunoglobulin E sensitization and allergic disease later in childhood, whereas others reported a protective effect. The effectiveness of allergen reduction in the treatment of asthma is suggested by studies in which the patients improve substantially when moved into the low-allergen environment of hospitals or high-altitude sanatoria. Because of limitations in the design of the most clinical of studies, we do not yet have a conclusive answer on the effectiveness of domestic aeroallergen avoidance.

Conclusions

Minimizing the impact of identified environmental risk factors is an important first step to reduce the severity of asthma. Although environmental control is difficult, it should be an integral part of the overall management of sensitized patients. However, what is unclear is which patients would benefit and by how much, and whether the intervention is cost-effective. These questions will be answered satisfactorily only by large randomized trials.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^6e371ac6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma pharmacotherapy for children of 5 years of age or younger — good control of asthma can be achieved in the overwhelming majority of young children with a pharmacological intervention strategy, and a stepwise treatment approach is recommended based on symptom patterns, risk of exacerbations and side-effects, and response to initial treatment; generally, treatment includes the daily, long-term use of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to keep asthma well controlled and reliever medications for as-needed symptom relief, and the choice of inhaler device is also an important consideration. When recommending treatment for a young child, both general and individual questions apply, including identifying the 'preferred' medication option at each treatment step to control asthma symptoms and minimize future risk, with decisions based on data for efficacy, effectiveness and safety from clinical trials and on observational data, considering that studies suggest factors such as allergic sensitization and/or peripheral blood count may help to better identify which children are more likely to have a short-term response to ICS, and accounting for response to previous treatment, patient characteristics that contribute to symptoms or risk of flare-ups, preferences of the parent/caregiver, and practical issues.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^15733375]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — avoidance of indoor allergens — Because many asthma patients react to multiple factors that are ubiquitous in the environment, avoiding these factors completely is usually impractical and very burdensome for the patient. Inhaled corticosteroid‑containing medications to maintain good asthma control have an important role because patients are often less affected by environmental factors when their asthma is well controlled. There is conflicting evidence about whether measures to reduce exposure to indoor allergens are effective at reducing asthma symptoms, and the majority of single interventions have failed to achieve a sufficient reduction in allergen load to lead to clinical improvement. It is likely that no single intervention will achieve sufficient benefits to be cost effective, though one study of insecticidal bait in homes eradicated cockroaches and led to a significant decrease in symptoms, improvement in pulmonary function, and less health care use for children with moderate to severe asthma.

Asthma environmental allergen mitigation — multicomponent strategies are potentially beneficial when mattress and pillow covers, integrated pest management, HEPA vacuum cleaners, and mold mitigation are used as part of a multicomponent allergen mitigation strategy, but the benefits are small; mattress and pillow covers did not show improvements when validated outcome measures were used, yet small symptom reductions with low risk and relative cost led to the Expert Panel's conditional recommendation for use of these interventions only as part of a multicomponent allergen mitigation strategy; the evidence was stronger for improvements with integrated pest management and HEPA vacuum cleaners than for impermeable covers; only three studies examined multicomponent interventions including mold mitigation, and the panel considered reduced health care utilization with mold mitigation and broader public health benefit in making its conditional recommendation; overall, for most of these interventions, the certainty of evidence is low and the benefits are small, so individuals with symptoms related to exposure to specific allergens should consider using these interventions when appropriate.

Indoor allergen mitigation in asthma — definitions and examples are provided to frame interventions. An allergen mitigation intervention aims to decrease an individual's exposure to allergens and can have a single component or multiple components. A single-component intervention is an individual mitigation strategy targeted at one or more specific allergens to which an individual is both exposed and sensitized. Examples include acaricide for house-dust mites; air filtration systems and air purifiers including those with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters; carpet removal of wall-to-wall or area rugs from one or more rooms; HEPA vacuum cleaners; impermeable pillow and mattress covers; integrated pest management; and mold mitigation. The Expert Panel considered integrated pest management and mold mitigation to be single-component interventions even though each may include prevention, mitigation, and removal strategies. These definitions are situated within environmental control as one of the four cornerstones of asthma management.

### Indoor allergen interventions in homes and schools for managing asthma [^e467437e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma remains a prevalent and burdensome chronic disease in the United States, disproportionately affecting low-income populations and placing a significant strain on the health care system. Environmental allergen exposure, particularly in urban areas, has been extensively linked to asthma development and exacerbations. Identifying effective strategies for reducing allergen exposure could help mitigate asthma morbidity, decrease health care utilization, and improve patients' quality of life. Studies evaluating environmental interventions, including home- and school-based allergen reduction strategies, have reported mixed results. Although some interventions, such as targeted allergen reduction, pest management, and air filtration, demonstrate improvements in asthma symptoms and health care utilization, others show limited impact on long-term asthma control and controller medication use. In this review, we assess the impact of environmental allergens on asthma prevalence, morbidity, and health care burden in the United States. We also examine the effectiveness of various allergen-reduction strategies in achieving sustained clinical benefits for asthma management and make practical recommendations for patient care.

The 2020 Focused Updates to the Asthma Management Guidelines: A Report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group was coordinated and supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health. It is designed to improve patient care and support informed decision making about asthma management in the clinical setting. This update addresses six priority topic areas as determined by the state of the science at the time of a needs assessment, and input from multiple stakeholders:
Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide Testing
Indoor Allergen Mitigation
Intermittent Inhaled Corticosteroids
Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonists
Immunotherapy in the Treatment of Allergic Asthma
Bronchial Thermoplasty

A rigorous process was undertaken to develop these evidence-based guidelines. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Evidence-Based Practice Centers conducted systematic reviews on these topics, which were used by the Expert Panel Working Group as a basis for developing recommendations and guidance. The Expert Panel used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation), an internationally accepted framework, in consultation with an experienced methodology team for determining the certainty of evidence and the direction and strength of recommendations based on the evidence. Practical implementation guidance for each recommendation incorporates findings from NHLBI-led patient, caregiver, and clinician focus groups. To assist clincians in implementing these recommendations into patient care, the new recommendations have been integrated into the existing Expert Panel Report-3 (EPR-3) asthma management step diagram format.

Single-component allergen mitigation interventions

For the majority of single-component allergen mitigation interventions, studies to assess the effectiveness of the interventions were limited. For the single-component interventions with enough studies to assess their impact on critical outcomes, the certainty of the evidence was either low or very low, or the results were limited to one or two critical outcomes on which results were inconclusive or that did not improve. The studies included mixed populations, which made it difficult to determine whether better-defined populations might benefit from the intervention. Certainty of evidence was often downgraded because of the limitations of several studies, including those of single-component interventions with acaricides, and air purifiers. – These limitations included insufficient descriptions of the randomization scheme, absence of a placebo intervention, and imprecision related to small sample size. No single-component intervention studies examining HEPA vacuum cleaners, carpet removal, or mold mitigation were available for review. The evidence was insufficient to allow the Expert Panel to examine the use of cleaning products. In contrast, dust mite mitigation using impermeable mattress and pillow covers as a single intervention was the subject of many RCTs, which yielded moderate certainty of evidence of no benefit for the critical outcomes, including asthma symptoms. – Results for pet removal were inconclusive.

Based on these studies, the Expert Panel made a conditional recommendation against most single-component allergen mitigation interventions as part of routine asthma management for individuals without specific identified triggers or exposure. The Expert Panel also included in the recommendation a conditional recommendation against impermeable pillow and mattress covers as a single-component allergen mitigation intervention.

One RCT and one pre- and postintervention study suggested that integrated pest management for cockroaches and rodents reduces the number of asthma exacerbations but has no effect on asthma control. As a result, the Expert Panel made a conditional recommendation in favor of using integrated pest management as a single-component allergen mitigation strategy based on the evidence showing a reduction in asthma symptoms (low certainty of evidence). The Expert Panel also noted the importance of pest control as an established public health principle and practice.

### Treatment… [^26f0d8ab]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

2, 3 In children younger than 15 years, asthma accounts for 3 million physician visits, 570, 000 emergency department visits, 164, 000 hospital stays, 8. 7 million prescriptions and 10 million missed school days per year. 4, 5 These statistics highlight the need to aggressively manage this disease and its symptoms. Unfortunately, anti-inflammatory agents such as inhaled corticosteroids are not yet prescribed for all patients with persistent asthma. 6 and, even when these medications are prescribed, they may be underutilized because parents fear the possibility of adverse side effects or children have difficulty using metered-dose inhalers. New therapeutic options are available and with aggressive, appropriate therapy, physicians can prescribe an asthma management regimen to ameliorate symptoms, control disease and allow normal activity even in children as young as one to two years. Diagnosis Fifty to 80 percent of children with asthma develop symptoms before five years of age.

12 Asthma symptoms vary widely and may mimic other childhood diseases. When parents report episodic or persistent coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, rapid breathing or chest tightness, and if these symptoms are worse during the evening or early morning hours, or are associated with triggers, the physician should suspect asthma. Obtaining a medical history is essential to establishing the diagnosis of asthma. Factors associated with the onset of asthma symptoms include allergy, family history of asthma or allergy, perinatal exposure to tobacco smoke, viral respiratory infections, male gender and low birth weight.

13 Young children who develop persistent asthma are likely to have increased serum IgE levels at nine months of age, atopic dermatitis and rhinitis during their first year, severe lower respiratory infections requiring hospitalization and diminished airway function by six years of age.
13. 14 Pulmonary function tests should be, and allergy tests may be conducted to confirm the diagnosis. 15 Spirometry performed before and 15 to 20 minutes after the child inhales a short-acting bronchodilator assesses airflow obstruction and determines its reversibility. Pulmonary function results consistent with asthma include variable airflow obstruction with serial spirometry or peak expiratory flow measurements, and an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second of 12 percent or more after bronchodilator therapy.

COMPLIANCE Poor compliance is a major problem in pediatric asthma management, and several factors play a role in this. These include the route of administration, 23 frequency of dosing, 24 medication effects and the risk or concern of side effects. Overuse indicates that asthma is not controlled and requires increased anti-inflammatory treatment. Therefore, refills of reliever medications should be closely monitored. Most MDIs hold 120 two-spray doses and should last one month if used four times daily. With well-controlled asthma, one inhaler ideally should last for one year.

### Indoor environmental exposures and their relationship to allergic diseases [^95c0a39e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Cockroach, dust mite, cat, dog, mouse, and molds are major indoor allergens that have been associated with the development of allergic diseases and disease morbidity in allergen-sensitized individuals. Physical characteristics, such as allergen particle size, hydrophobicity, and charge, can determine an allergen's propensity to become airborne, location of respiratory tract penetration, and ability to elicit IgE responses in genetically predisposed individuals. Standardization and recent advancements in indoor allergen assessment serve to identify sources and distribution of allergens in a patient's home and public environment, inform public policy, and monitor the efficacy of allergen avoidance and therapeutics. Allergen exposure interventions have yielded mixed results with current US and international asthma guidelines differing on recommendations. A pragmatic, patient-centered approach to allergen avoidance includes: (1) tailoring intervention to the patient's sensitization and exposure status, (2) using a rigorous multifaceted intervention strategy to reduce allergen exposure as much as possible, and (3) beginning the intervention as soon as the patient is diagnosed. Further research into the risks/benefits of early allergen exposure, rapid and affordable in-home allergen assessment, and best practices for environmental control measures for asthma is needed.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical report — indoor environmental control for pediatric asthma — states that indoor environmental exposures, particularly allergens and pollutants, are major contributors to asthma morbidity in children, and that environmental control practices aimed at reducing these exposures are an integral component of asthma management. It notes that some individually tailored environmental control practices have been shown to reduce asthma symptoms and exacerbations and are similar in efficacy and cost to controller medications. As part of tailored strategies, an environmental history can be obtained to evaluate key indoor exposures that are known to trigger asthma symptoms and exacerbations, including both indoor pollutants and allergens, with questions on pets or pests and whether community climatic characteristics favor dust mites, and with attention to sources of indoor air pollution such as the presence of smokers and the use of gas stoves and appliances. Diagnostic options include serum allergen-specific immunoglobulin E antibody tests or referral for allergy skin testing to identify clinically relevant indoor allergens. Environmental control strategies are tailored to each potentially relevant exposure and are based on knowledge of its sources and characteristics, and include source removal, source control, and mitigation measures such as high-efficiency particulate air purifiers and allergen-proof mattress and pillow encasements, alongside education that can be delivered by primary care pediatricians, allergists, pediatric pulmonologists, other health care workers, or community health workers trained in asthma environmental control and asthma education. This clinical report was reaffirmed February 2024.

### The role of allergens in asthma [^efb840bc]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel guidelines for the management of asthma recommend that patients who require daily asthma medications have allergy testing for perennial indoor allergens and that, when triggers are found, exposure to allergens and pollutants be controlled through avoidance and abatement. For patients whose symptoms are not controlled adequately with these interventions and who are candidates for immunotherapy, the guidelines recommend referral to an allergist. However, the data supporting these recommendations are not consistent. Although there is evidence that simple allergen avoidance measures are ineffective, there is good evidence for the effectiveness of a comprehensive approach based on known sensitization. Thus, allergen avoidance may include removal of pets, use of high-efficiency particulate air filtration and vacuum cleaners, use of allergen-impermeable mattress and pillow covers, cockroach extermination, smoking cessation, and measures to control mold growth in the home. All allergen-specific treatment is dependent on defining sensitization. This can be achieved through serum assays of immunoglobulin E antibodies or skin tests with aeroallergens. Information on sensitization can be used to educate patients about the role of allergens in their symptoms, to provide avoidance advice, or to design immunotherapy.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^a1e4e844]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Some but not all study findings suggested that multicomponent interventions that included mold mitigation reduce symptoms to an extent. The results of studies of multicomponent interventions that included pet removal were inconclusive.

Most studies did not examine harms, and none reported any important harms from the various allergen mitigation strategies studied. Because of the lack of benefits identified and the potential harms from applications of chemicals, the Expert Panel does not recommend the use of acaricides.

Rationale and discussion

Overall approach for developing allergen mitigation recommendations.

When developing each of the four recommendations in this section, the Expert Panel considered the benefits and harms of each of the allergen mitigation interventions and the level of evidence available for assessing the interventions. In addition, the Expert Panel considered the acceptability of the interventions to individuals with asthma and their providers as well as the ease of use, costs, and impact on health equity of each intervention.

Potential harms.

Although the identified harms from most of the interventions were minimal, studies rarely examined harms. Therefore, the Expert Panel considered theoretical harms, patient burden, and initial and ongoing costs in its recommendations. For example, the Expert Panel's judgment was that interventions for mold mitigation and carpet removal could be associated with risks or be costly or difficult to complete. Another Expert Panel determination was that impermeable pillow and mattress covers are low-risk interventions with limited costs but are likely to require frequent cleaning of the bedding above the covers to be effective.

Prioritization of outcomes.

Furthermore, the Expert Panel considered the impact of the interventions on asthma symptoms as a critical outcome. The Expert Panel recognized that none of the studies used a validated outcome measure of asthma symptoms, and the definition of asthma symptoms was not standardized across studies. However, asthma symptoms are a relevant patient-centered outcome that was important to individuals with asthma in focus groups and that could be particularly relevant to assess for low-risk interventions.

Health effects — sensitization to dust mite and primary prevention guidance state: "Advise patients to minimize exposure of susceptible children to dust mite allergens to decrease their risk of developing mite-specific IgE. Because intermittent exposure to mite allergens can lead to sensitization, primary prevention may not be possible to achieve in regions where mite exposure is prevalent. (Strength of recommendation: strong, A evidence)". Supporting observations include that in New Zealand "IgE to dust mite was associated with a greater than 5-fold increase in the odds of wheezing", and early sensitization predicted later symptoms, with "a positive skin prick test reaction to dust mite at 1 or 2 years of age" predicting wheeze at "12 years".

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^dacbbb75]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinician's Summary:

For individuals with asthma who do not exhibit any allergy symptoms or for whom testing has not suggested that they have an allergy to certain indoor substances (eg, dust mites or cat dander), the Expert Panel recommends no specific environmental interventions to reduce these allergens within the home.

For individuals with asthma who are exposed to an allergen within the home and who have allergy symptoms or a positive test result suggesting that they have an allergy to certain indoor substances (eg, dust mites or cat dander), the Expert Panel recommends using a multicomponent intervention to try to control the indoor allergen in question. Single-component interventions often do not work.

For individuals with asthma who are exposed to cockroaches or rodents (eg, mice) in the home and who have allergy symptoms or sensitization to these allergens demonstrated by allergy skin testing or a specific IgE, the Expert Panel recommends using integrated pest management to improve asthma outcomes. Integrated pest management can be used alone or with other interventions to reduce exposure to pest-related allergens in the home.

### National asthma education and prevention program 2020 guideline update: where Do we Go from here? [^b410abaa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) oversaw the development of national asthma guidelines nearly 30 years ago. Since that time, there have been two major revisions (1997 and 2007) and one interim update (2002). In December 2020, the 2020 Focused Update to the Asthma Management Guidelines was released — the first update to the guidelines in 13 years.

The NAEPP 2020 update adheres to standards for trustworthy guidelines promulgated by the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, including a systematic review of the evidence that addresses specific questions, a multidisciplinary panel of experts and representatives of key affected groups, consideration of important patient subgroups and preferences, an explicit and transparent process to minimize bias and conflicts of interest, and ratings of both the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. An Expert Panel coordinated by the NHLBI of the NIH was first convened in July 2018 to examine six priority topics that were selected after an extensive needs assessment. The six topics included intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), add-on inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists, bronchial thermoplasty, indoor allergen mitigation strategies, immunotherapy, and use of fractional exhaled nitric oxide. No other aspects of asthma management in the NAEPP 2007 asthma guidelines were considered by the Expert Panel.

### Indoor environmental control practices and asthma management [^c7c1ece8]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Indoor environmental control practices for asthma — key points indicate that individually tailored environmental control measures have been shown to reduce asthma symptoms and exacerbations, are similar in efficacy to controller medications, and appear to be cost-effective, and the efficacy of environmental control measures has been sustained for up to 1 year after the intervention. As part of developing tailored strategies, an environmental history may be obtained to evaluate the key indoor environmental exposures that are known to trigger asthma symptoms and exacerbations, including both indoor pollutants and allergens, and the leading indoor environmental contributors to asthma symptoms are indoor allergens (pets, dust mites, rats, cockroaches, molds) and pollutants (airborne particulate matter [PM], secondhand smoke [SHS], nitrogen dioxide [NO2]). An environmental history may include questions regarding the presence of pets or pests, or evidence of pests in the home, as well as knowledge regarding whether the climatic characteristics in the community favor dust mites, and in addition, the history may focus on sources of indoor air pollution, including smokers in the home, use of gas stoves and appliances, and presence of mold in the home. Serum allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody tests may be performed or the patient may be referred to a board-certified allergist for evaluation and allergy skin testing to identify indoor allergens that are most likely to be clinically relevant. Environmental control strategies are tailored to each potentially relevant indoor exposure and are based on knowledge of the sources and underlying characteristics of the exposure, and strategies include source removal, source control, and mitigation strategies.

### Asthma guidelines: comparison of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute expert panel report 4 with Global Initiative for Asthma 2021 [^93b537f8]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma continues to be a prevalent respiratory disease that affects lives within the United States and worldwide. Clinical asthma guidelines based on scientific evidence on testing and therapeutic interventions are needed to control this disease better. To meet this need, the NAEPP (National Asthma Education and Prevention Program) and GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) were formed to assist with best practice diagnosis and treatments for asthma. This paper reviews the subtle differences and similarities between the most recent recommendations put forth by NAEPP 2020 and GINA 2021, mainly examining the six selected topics, as well as methodology, guidance on emerging topics, and implementation.

Recent Findings

In December 2020, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee released their focused update on fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, indoor allergen mitigation, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, allergen immunotherapy, and bronchial thermoplasty. The Global Initiative for Asthma comprehensive document is published annually as a framework for all nations. Therefore, it is timely to consider the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee 2020 in relation to the GINA 2021.

Summary

The comparison provides a better understanding of evidence-based recommendations for asthma. The NAEPP 2020 and GINA 2021 will equip providers with the knowledge to provide their patients with the best and most updated asthma care.

### Indoor environmental control practices and asthma management [^f1555bf3]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Indoor environmental exposures, particularly allergens and pollutants, are major contributors to asthma morbidity in children; environmental control practices aimed at reducing these exposures are an integral component of asthma management. Some individually tailored environmental control practices that have been shown to reduce asthma symptoms and exacerbations are similar in efficacy and cost to controller medications. As a part of developing tailored strategies regarding environmental control measures, an environmental history can be obtained to evaluate the key indoor environmental exposures that are known to trigger asthma symptoms and exacerbations, including both indoor pollutants and allergens. An environmental history includes questions regarding the presence of pets or pests or evidence of pests in the home, as well as knowledge regarding whether the climatic characteristics in the community favor dust mites. In addition, the history focuses on sources of indoor air pollution, including the presence of smokers who live in the home or care for children and the use of gas stoves and appliances in the home. Serum allergen-specific immunoglobulin E antibody tests can be performed or the patient can be referred for allergy skin testing to identify indoor allergens that are most likely to be clinically relevant. Environmental control strategies are tailored to each potentially relevant indoor exposure and are based on knowledge of the sources and underlying characteristics of the exposure. Strategies include source removal, source control, and mitigation strategies, such as high-efficiency particulate air purifiers and allergen-proof mattress and pillow encasements, as well as education, which can be delivered by primary care pediatricians, allergists, pediatric pulmonologists, other health care workers, or community health workers trained in asthma environmental control and asthma education.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^86c2ca15]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinician's Summary:

The Expert Panel conditionally recommends SCIT as an adjunctive treatment for individuals who have demonstrated allergic sensitization and evidence of worsening asthma symptoms after exposure to the relevant antigen or antigens either acutely (eg, allergy to pets) or on a seasonal basis (eg, allergy to grass or ragweed) or a chronic basis (eg, allergy to dust mites). Individuals who place a high value on possible small improvements in quality of life, symptom control, and a reduction in long-term and/or quick-relief medication use and a lower value on the risk of systemic reactions of wide-ranging severity might consider SCIT as adjunct therapy.

For individuals with allergic asthma, the Expert Panel makes the following suggestions to implement SCIT:
Clinicians can consider SCIT for adults and children (at a developmental stage at which allergic sensitization can be demonstrated) with allergic asthma, a history compatible with a temporal association of worsening symptoms with exposure to aeroallergens, and testing (as described previously) that confirms this sensitization.
Clinicians can consider SCIT for individuals whose asthma is not well controlled by their current medical therapy and the treating clinician considers allergen exposure to be a significant contributor to this lack of asthma control. However, clinicians should attempt to optimize asthma control before initiating SCIT to reduce the potential for harm.
Clinicians can consider SCIT for individuals whose asthma is well controlled by their current therapy when these individuals and/or their clinicians want to reduce the individuals' medication burden.
In addition to assessing whether an individual with allergic asthma has an appropriate history before considering SCIT, clinicians must formally assess allergic sensitization using either immediate hypersensitivity skin testing or in vitro antigen-specific IgE antibody testing. This evaluation needs to be performed by a trained health care professional skilled in proper testing and result interpretation. The need for these types of specialty evaluations, as with the need for many diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions, may limit access to care, depending on local availability of these tests and the patient's health insurance coverage of testing.
Clinicians should not administer SCIT in individuals with severe asthma. Furthermore, clinicians should not initiate, increase, or administer maintenance SCIT doses while individuals have asthma symptoms. These individuals should achieve optimal asthma control before beginning SCIT to minimize the harms (systemic reactions) associated with SCIT, which tend to intensify as baseline asthma severity increases.
The presence of allergic sensitization is necessary but not sufficient to define the allergic asthma phenotype. A positive test result may not be associated with asthma control over time but might, instead, reflect sensitivity in a different organ (eg, the nose in allergic rhinitis).
Allergen exposure could be the only triggering mechanism for allergic asthma symptoms, or it could be just one triggering factor for an individual, and another factor or factors (eg, respiratory tract infections, irritant exposure, or exercise) might also play a role in triggering allergic asthma symptoms. Because of the heterogeneous nature of allergic asthma, determining the precise efficacy of immunotherapy in reducing the allergic component of an individual's asthma can be difficult.
Clinicians should administer SCIT in their offices and provide direct supervision because of the risk of systemic reactions. Such reactions can include a range of anaphylactic symptoms involving the skin (urticaria), respiratory tract (rhinitis and asthma), gastrointestinal tract (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension and arrhythmias). Although rare, deaths after injections have been reported.
Individuals with asthma should not administer SCIT at home.
Because clinicians should administer SCIT with direct supervision, personnel with appropriate training should prepare and administer injections for each individual's dosing schedule, from the build-up to the maintenance phase. Equipment and personnel should be available to treat serious anaphylactic reactions.
One of the potential benefits of SCIT is its immunomodulatory effects, which can reduce the allergic inflammatory response in various tissues. Thus, SCIT has the potential to be disease-modifying and to reduce the clinical expression or severity of asthma over time.
Before administering each SCIT injection, clinicians should assess individuals with asthma for worsened asthma symptoms that suggest recent loss of asthma control. Physicians should consider withholding SCIT injections temporarily in patients whose asthma symptoms have worsened until their asthma control is restored.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma who are considering SCIT that this treatment has the potential to reduce asthma symptoms and the severity of disease over time. Individuals need to come to their doctor's office for SCIT because of the associated risk of systemic reactions. Local and systemic reactions of SCIT include a range of anaphylactic symptoms involving the skin (urticaria), respiratory tract (rhinitis and asthma), gastrointestinal tract (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension and arrhythmias). Although rare, deaths after injections have been reported. Individuals with asthma should not administer SCIT at home. Before initiating immunotherapy, clinicians must review with the individual who has asthma the travel arrangements and time needed to travel to and from the clinic as well as the requirement for at least a 30minute observational period after each injection. These requirements may complicate compliance. Missed appointments due to scheduling problems are a safety and an efficacy concern because they may increase the likelihood of local and systemic reactions. Missed appointments can also complicate the ability to reach a maintenance dosing regimen that maximizes therapeutic benefit. Delayed systemic reactions (those occurring more than 30 minutes after injection) occur in approximately 15% of individuals after injection. The Expert Panel recommends that individuals who have had previous clinically significant reactions to immunotherapy ideally should have injectable epinephrine and carry it on their person to and from the clinic on the day of their injection.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^c42dd1fa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma — SCIT candidate selection and testing: Clinicians can consider SCIT for adults and children with allergic asthma when allergic sensitization can be demonstrated and a history shows a temporal association of worsening symptoms with exposure to aeroallergens, with testing that confirms sensitization. Clinicians can consider SCIT for individuals whose asthma is not well controlled by their current medical therapy when allergen exposure is a significant contributor, but clinicians should attempt to optimize asthma control before initiating SCIT to reduce the potential for harm. Clinicians can consider SCIT for individuals whose asthma is well controlled by their current therapy when they or their clinicians want to reduce the individuals' medication burden. In addition to history, clinicians must formally assess allergic sensitization using either immediate hypersensitivity skin testing or in vitro antigen-specific IgE antibody testing. Clinicians should not administer SCIT in individuals with severe asthma, and clinicians should not initiate, increase, or administer maintenance SCIT doses while individuals have asthma symptoms. The presence of allergic sensitization is necessary but not sufficient to define the allergic asthma phenotype.

### Indoor environmental control practices and asthma management [^0a3bc227]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Indoor environmental control practices for asthma management emphasize that individually tailored environmental control measures have been shown to reduce asthma symptoms and exacerbations, are similar in efficacy to controller medications, and appear to be cost- effective when the aim is to reduce days of symptoms and their associated costs; the efficacy of environmental control measures has been sustained for up to 1 year after the intervention.

The leading indoor environmental contributors to asthma symptoms are indoor allergens (pets, dust mites, mice, rats, cockroaches, molds) and pollutants (airborne PM [particulate matter], SHS [secondhand smoke], NO2 [nitrogen dioxide]). For evaluation, serum allergen-specific IgE (immunoglobulin E) antibody tests may be performed or the patient may be referred to a board-certified allergist for evaluation and allergy skin testing to identify indoor allergens that are most likely to be clinically relevant. Environmental control strategies are tailored to each potentially relevant indoor exposure and are based on knowledge of the sources and underlying characteristics of the exposure, and strategies include source removal, source control, and mitigation strategies.

### Environmental management of asthma in clinical practice: results from the 2012 national ambulatory medical care survey [^6495a354]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Most clinicians recommended pet removal to patients with pet sensitivities, but a relatively high proportion of clinicians, up to one third, reported recommending pet removal for all patients. Given that allergy testing was largely performed by specialists, this is not necessarily surprising, although the guidelines recommend allergen mitigation interventions to patients who are both exposed to and either sensitized to or develop symptoms on exposure to specific allergens. Yet specialists outside large metro areas less frequently recommended pet removal than those in urban areas, possibly reflecting regional differences in pet-keeping habits (eg, pets might be kept outdoors in less urbanized areas). Practice parameters and guidelines encourage pet removal from homes of patients with atopic asthma because numerous studies have shown that exposures to pet allergens exacerbate asthma in pet-sensitized individuals. Compelling evidence for this recommendation was recently presented in a large, national study that estimated that among pet-sensitive patients with asthma, more than 1,700,000 excess asthma attacks and nearly 700,000 excess asthma emergency department/urgent care visits are associated annually with elevated pet allergen levels in the bedroom. Further research, however, is warranted, as noted in the recent NAEPP guideline update; only a few small-scale studies have examined the effects of pet removal, and results have been inconclusive.

Dampness and mold in homes — Moisture-related exposures contribute to asthma, and risk quantification and management steps are described: "Excessive moisture in homes can contribute to asthma through an increase in mold exposure as well as increased cockroach and dust mite allergen". In children with persistent asthma, "The prevalence of mold sensitization… is approximately 50%", and nationally "56% of homes had levels of some molds above thresholds observed to be associated with asthma symptoms". "Children sensitized and exposed to the major indoor molds appear to be at greater risk of asthma exacerbations", and "Remediation of mold has been shown to reduce symptoms and medication use… and its effects may not depend on whether the population is sensitized to mold". Evaluation "includes an assessment of sensitization to the major indoor molds, which can be accomplished with specific IgE testing… or through referral to a board-certified allergist for skin testing". To identify moisture problems, "Air sampling, thermography, moisture meters, environmental history, and direct observation are all useful", and parental report "suggests that the parents be counseled to intervene on the home environment". Caution is noted that "reports from air sampling are uninterpretable without concomitant indoor and outdoor sampling".

### Associations of aeroallergen testing with reduced oral corticosteroid bursts among adults with asthma [^7b91fc41]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease in adults and a major public health burden in the United States. A key component of asthma care is to reduce symptoms and exacerbations by addressing modifiable risk factors, including aeroallergen exposure in sensitized patients. Pollens, dust mite, cat, dog, and molds are common allergens and important asthma triggers. Addressing allergic asthma triggers is beneficial in adults with asthma; most are sensitized to aeroallergens, and aeroallergen exposure is nearly universal in US homes. In studies of adults with asthma, aeroallergen testing with allergen avoidance education improved patients' awareness of perceived asthma triggers and lung functionand complemented asthma self-management. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–led online focus groups of people with asthma that explored patients' values and priorities related to their asthma found that most patients took steps to mitigate indoor allergen exposure. Thus, testing aligns with patients' strategies to reduce asthma symptoms.

### Childhood asthma management and environmental triggers [^6a64cf00]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children. It cannot be prevented but can be controlled. Industrialized countries experience high lifetime asthma prevalence that has increased over recent decades. Asthma has a complex interplay of genetic and environmental triggers. Studies have revealed complex interactions of lung structure and function genes with environmental exposures such as environmental tobacco smoke and vitamin D. Home environmental strategies can reduce asthma morbidity in children but should be tailored to specific allergens. Coupled with education and severity-specific asthma therapy, tailored interventions may be the most effective strategy to manage childhood asthma.

### Asthma management guidelines: focused updates for 2020… [^0c68849e]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The 2020 Focused Updates to the asthma management guidelines represent the first revision of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines in more than 10 years. 1 The report differs from the Global Initiative for Asthma recommendations because of the focused number of issues addressed and the nature of the evidence review.
2. Whereas the GINA guidelines are an ongoing series of revisions on a broad range of asthma topics, the 2020 Focused Updates targeted six key areas of asthma care for which there was strong interest and sufficient evidence to influence patient care. In addition, it used Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality systematic reviews and the rigorous GRADE methodology to assess study design and relevance of the current evidence. 3 Other strengths include attention to the perspective of primary care and participation by primary care representatives in leadership roles on the panel.

Inhaled Corticosteroids INTERMITTENT ASTHMA GINA recommends treating patients with mild intermittent asthma with as-needed inhaled corticosteroids with short-acting beta. 2 agonists for children six to 11 years of age and as-needed ICS/formoterol in adults. 4 However, the Focused Updates panel did not address this topic and carried forward its previous recommendation for as-needed SABA use. The panel identified limitations in the literature describing the risks of albuterol but chose to emphasize the importance of patient education with SABA use instead of discouraging its use. Switching rescue therapy from a SABA to ICS/formoterol for intermittent asthma would also incur a significant additional cost. PERSISTENT ASTHMA For patients with mild persistent asthma, the Focused Updates recommend either of the following: daily low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA or as-needed ICS with SABA for worsening asthma.

For mild to moderate persistent asthma, single maintenance and reliever therapy is preferred. This approach reduces the potential adverse effects of chronic steroid use, lowers emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and simplifies patients' medication regimens. 1 For patients four years or older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, SMART with ICS/formoterol, used daily and as needed, is preferred. For patients 12 years or older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, a single ICS/formoterol inhaler, used daily and as needed, is conditionally preferred. 5 GINA recommends daily moderate-dose ICS or ICS/long-acting beta 2 agonist with as-needed ICS/formoterol as equivalent options; however, the Focused Updates panel found the evidence for ICS/formoterol daily and as-needed to be more compelling. SMART carries several caveats. Budesonide/formoterol is not approved by the U. S.

Food and Drug Administration for use as a quick relief agent. The device most studied was the dry-powder Symbicort Turbohaler; however, in the United States, only the metered-dose device is available. Studies suggest that salmeterol is less effective, and it is not recommended as an alternative to formoterol. As of September 30, 2021, studies of as-needed use of vilanterol or mometasone/formoterol have not been published. ACUTE ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS The use of ICS for acute asthma without the concomitant use of oral steroids was previously discouraged. However, for patients from birth to four years of age with recurrent wheezing triggered by respiratory tract infections only and no wheezing between infections, the Focused Updates now conditionally recommend a short course of ICS at the onset of an upper respiratory tract infection with an inhaled SABA as needed.

Definitions of terms used in this section

An allergen mitigation intervention aims to decrease an individual's exposure to allergens. The intervention can have a single component or multiple components.

A single-component intervention is an individual mitigation strategy targeted at one or more specific allergens to which an individual is both exposed and sensitized. Single-component allergen mitigation interventions examined in this report include the following:
Acaricide: a house-dust mite pesticide that can be applied to carpets, mattresses, and furniture.
Air filtration systems and air purifiers, including those with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters: devices that filter indoor air and remove solid particulates, such as dust, pollen, mold, and bacteria, from the air.
Carpet removal: removal of wall-to-wall or area rugs from one or more rooms.
Cleaning products: including application of bleach or similar products.
HEPA vacuum cleaners: vacuum cleaners that have a HEPA filter.
Impermeable pillow and mattress covers: covers placed on mattresses and pillows that are impermeable to dust mites.
Integrated pest management: a comprehensive approach to removing and controlling common indoor pests (eg, cockroaches and mice) using, for example, traps, poison, and barriers to influx. The Expert Panel considered integrated pest management to be a single-component intervention even though it may include prevention, mitigation, and removal strategies.
Mold mitigation: professional removal, cleaning, sanitization, demolition, or other treatment to remove or prevent mold. The Expert Panel considered mold mitigation to be a single-component intervention even though it may include prevention, mitigation, and removal strategies.
Pet removal: complete removal or confinement of furry pets (eg, dogs and cats) to specific rooms in a house.

A "multicomponent intervention" is defined as the use of two or more of the aforementioned single-component interventions at the same time as part of a bundled approach targeted at one or more allergens to which the individual is both sensitized and exposed. An example of a multicomponent intervention is the use of three single-component interventions (eg, air purifiers, impermeable pillow and mattress covers, and HEPA vacuum cleaners) for individuals sensitized and exposed to dust mites and mold.

"Sensitization" is defined in this section as the production of a specific IgE to an aeroallergen whose presence can be confirmed by skin prick testing or assays for a specific IgE.

### EAACI guidelines on environmental science for allergy and asthma-recommendations on the impact of indoor air pollutants on the risk of new-onset asthma and on asthma-related outcomes [^8d9f9ce2]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

The EAACI Guidelines used the GRADE approach to evaluate the impact of major indoor air pollutants (dampness and mould, cleaning agents, volatile organic compounds and pesticides) on the risk of new-onset asthma and on asthma-related outcomes. The guideline also acknowledges the synergies among indoor air pollutants and other components of the indoor exposome (allergens, viruses, endotoxins). Very low to low certainty of evidence was found for the association between exposure to indoor pollutants and increased risk of new-onset asthma and asthma worsening. Only for mould exposure there was moderate certainty of evidence for new-onset asthma. Due to the quality of evidence, conditional recommendations were formulated on the risk of exposure to all indoor pollutants. Recommendations are provided for prevention, patient care and mitigation in a framework supporting rational decisions for healthcare professionals and patients to individualize and improve asthma management. For policymakers and regulators this evidence-informed guideline supports setting legally binding standards and goals for indoor air quality at international, national and local levels. Asthma management counselled by the current EAACI guidelines can improve asthma-related outcomes but community and governmental measures for improved indoor air quality are needed to achieve significant impact.

Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) strategies and ICS-formoterol — In children aged 0–4 y with recurrent wheezing triggered by respiratory tract infections and no wheezing between infections, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends starting a short course of daily ICS at the onset of a respiratory tract infection with as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy compared to as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy only. In individuals aged 12 y and older with mild persistent asthma, it conditionally recommends either daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly. In individuals aged 4 y and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to be adherent to daily ICS treatment, it conditionally recommends against a short-term increase in the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow. In individuals aged 4 y and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, it recommends ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared to either higher-dose ICS as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy or same-dose ICS-LABA as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy, and in individuals aged 12 y and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, it conditionally recommends ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared to higher-dose ICS-LABA as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy.

### Environmental assessment and exposure control of dust mites: a practice parameter [^2b8331f8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Pediatric asthma dust mite allergen avoidance — randomized trials and implementation guidance are summarized as follows: In 1 study, 23 children with asthma in Atlanta were randomized to active or placebo groups, with active treatment including allergen-impermeable encasings and 3% tannic acid spray; allergen levels decreased in both groups and peak expiratory flow increased in the active group and in sensitized patients whose allergen decreased, regardless of group. In another Atlanta study, 104 children were randomized to active or placebo avoidance, and there was a difference between groups for asthma visits and dust mite concentrations. The authors state that there is little evidence for the clinical benefits of single avoidance; such interventions should be tailored to the patient's sensitization and allergen exposure, should be multifaceted addressing facilititative factors, sources, and reservoirs, and should be implemented as early as possible, especially for children.

### Guidelines for the management of work-related asthma [^66e03278]. The European Respiratory Journal (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for work-related asthma, more specifically with respect to allergen and irritant avoidance, ERS 2012 guidelines recommend to consider offering reduction of exposure to the causal agent as an alternative to complete avoidance, in order to minimize adverse socioeconomic consequences. Insufficient evidence to recommend this option as a first-line therapeutic strategy. Obtain careful medical monitoring to ensure an early identification of asthma worsening when choosing this approach.

Limitations and research gaps

The Expert Panel identified several limitations in the process it used to identify topics and develop recommendations, including the following:
A better mechanism is needed to identify topics that need updating and to decrease the time between updates.
The process would benefit from a discussion and development of a plan about how to tailor guideline recommendations in the emerging era of personalized medicine.
Expanding engagement with professional societies might benefit both the development and the implementation of new recommendations.

The Expert Panel also identified several overarching research gaps listed below. Research gaps that are specific to individual topics are listed at the end of each topic section.

Research studies need to use the core outcome measures identified in the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop. Federal agencies that contributed to the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop report should require the studies they fund to measure outcomes as recommended in that report. Because new information on asthma outcomes is now available, the workshop report should be reexamined to determine whether it needs to be revised.
The clinical relevance of changes in outcome measures should be formally established to provide MIDs for all asthma outcomes (eg, exacerbations and asthma symptoms) and the cutoffs for tests (eg, F). Clinical relevance should be established using a wide range of stakeholder input, especially from individuals with asthma, who should also be included as members of the Expert Panel.
Updates are needed to the definitions of asthma severity that incorporate asthma phenotypes and endotypes. The definitions of low-, medium-, and high-dose ICSs also need to be updated.
Biologically appropriate subpopulations with asthma should be established and standardized. Although the populations of interest for the focused updates were defined for the systematic reviews, the characterizations of study participants did not reflect current understanding of relevant phenotypes and endotypes (eg, based on asthma severity, allergen-specific sensitization, or airway inflammatory type).
Standard reporting of results stratified by race and ethnicity as well as by age groups (0–4 years, 5–11 years, and 12 years and older) is needed to combine results across studies.
The vast majority of studies used to inform the guidelines were designed as efficacy studies, which evaluate treatment effects in relatively homogeneous populations and conditions in which fidelity to study protocols is actively promoted. Applicability to real-world clinical and community contexts requires studies with comparative effectiveness designs. Such research would benefit from the use of validated outcome measures and definitions of biologically appropriate subpopulations.
Studies need to use measures and outcomes that are important to individuals with asthma. The GRADE methodology gives highest priority to patient-centered outcomes. However, the studies that the Expert Panel used to develop the recommendations often did not measure outcomes that are most relevant or important to individuals with asthma. Research is needed to understand how preferred outcomes vary by race or ethnicity, asthma severity, age (eg, children or older adults), and socioeconomic status.
All measures and outcomes relevant to making judgments need to be included in the systematic reviews. For example, although cost-effectiveness data are available for some asthma interventions, the systematic review reports used for the updates did not include these data. Moreover, data regarding the safety of all interventions should be explicitly reported in publications on clinical trials.

Multicomponent allergen mitigation interventions

The effectiveness of multicomponent mitigation interventions was difficult to evaluate because of inconsistencies in the designs used in different studies. Studies on most multicomponent interventions demonstrated minimal or no improvement in critical outcomes. Some studies did, however, demonstrate a reduction in asthma symptoms. The systematic review, using a qualitative comparative analysis, was unable to determine whether specific combinations of interventions were necessary or sufficient to improve the outcomes of interest.

For multicomponent interventions that included integrated pest management, results were mixed. These studies provided high certainty of evidence of no reduction in exacerbations, although the same studies provided moderate to low certainty of evidence of a reduction in asthma symptoms and exacerbations when a composite measure was used. When examined in the context of a multicomponent intervention, acaricides had no effect on asthma symptoms (high certainty of evidence) and had inconclusive results for exacerbations (very low certainty of evidence). – Multicomponent intervention studies that included the use of HEPA vacuum cleaner shad mixed results; some RCTs demonstrated changes in exacerbations, asthma-related quality of life, or asthma symptoms. – Most of the studies that demonstrated improvements in critical outcomes using HEPA vacuum cleaners were conducted in children.

In multicomponent studies that included air filtration systems and air purifiers (three of the four studies used devices with HEPA filters), the results showed no decrease in exacerbations or improvement in quality of life (high certainty of evidence). The results were mixed for asthma control (no benefit, low certainty of evidence) and asthma symptoms (decreased severity or number of reported symptoms in children but not in mixed populations, low certainty of evidence).,

Studies on the use of impermeable pillow and mattress covers as part of a multicomponent intervention strategy provided high certainty of evidence of a decrease in the number of asthma symptom days but did not show other benefits for any of the critical outcomes examined.– Studies using a composite score for asthma symptoms or cough and wheeze frequency provided very low to moderate certainty of no benefit of impermeable pillow and mattress covers, depending on the outcome examined.

Allergen immunotherapy in asthma — In individuals aged 5 y and older with mild to moderate allergic asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends the use of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) as an adjunct treatment to standard pharmacotherapy in those whose asthma is controlled at the initiation, build-up, and maintenance phases of immunotherapy; in individuals with persistent allergic asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against the use of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in asthma treatment.
