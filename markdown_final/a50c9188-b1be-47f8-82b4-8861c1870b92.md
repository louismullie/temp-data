## Question

What is the treatment for Streptococcus pneumoniae?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical syndrome and severity to anchor empiric choices. Then, I should assess patient-specific resistance risk and local susceptibility patterns. Next, I will outline empiric regimens by care setting, address management of MDRSP, and specify dosing and duration. After that, I should plan for culture-guided de-escalation and review resistance dynamics to justify shorter courses. Finally, I'll consider prevention via vaccination, special populations, and summarize a practical algorithm supported by guidelines and regulatory data [^112hi12x] [^116LD2BE] [^114NQhP1].

> Let me first confirm the primary syndromes in which S. pneumoniae is implicated and how severity frameworks guide therapy, because conflating CAP with meningitis or bacteremia leads to errors in drug selection and dosing; the key adult syndromes include community-acquired pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media or sinusitis, bacteremia/sepsis, and less commonly septic arthritis, and severity tools such as PSI or CURB-65 guide site-of-care and intravenous versus oral therapy decisions for CAP, with pneumococcus remaining the leading CAP pathogen in adults worldwide [^112hi12x] [^112fwpR7].

> I need to check individual risk factors for drug-resistant pneumococcus before committing to an empiric regimen; higher risk is seen at the extremes of age and with cardiopulmonary, hepatic, renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, malignancy, asplenia, immunosuppression, recent antibiotic exposure, daycare exposure, or residence in long-term care, and contemporary outpatient CAP guidelines stratify recommendations by comorbidity profile in precisely this way, which I should keep front of mind when selecting macrolides or fluoroquinolones empirically [^114NQhP1] [^1122RpZY].

> Hold on, I should verify local and institutional resistance patterns because macrolide resistance varies widely and hospital antibiograms are notoriously heterogeneous; surveillance shows substantial pneumococcal resistance to penicillin and macrolides in the United States with marked geographic variability, and single-hospital reported penicillin nonsusceptibility fluctuates year to year such that local validation is essential when considering macrolide monotherapy thresholds, while importantly penicillin MICs ≤ 1 mcg/mL can still be clinically overcome with appropriate high-dose β-lactams in non-meningeal infections [^113vU2tu] [^116AkGd4] [^114huJwJ].

> Next, I should review outpatient CAP regimens and be careful not to overextend macrolide monotherapy where resistance exceeds thresholds; for adults without comorbidities, amoxicillin or doxycycline are preferred, while macrolide monotherapy is reasonable only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is under approximately 25 percent and there has been no recent macrolide exposure, and for adults with comorbidities a β-lactam such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime plus a macrolide, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, are recommended, which I should confirm aligns with ATS/IDSA 2019 outpatient guidance [^114NQhP1].

> I will now examine inpatient non-severe CAP regimens to ensure atypical coverage is addressed; combination therapy with a parenteral β-lactam such as ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, or ceftaroline plus a macrolide is recommended, with respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy as an alternative where MRSA and Pseudomonas risks are absent, and I should double-check dosing ranges for accuracy against guideline tables before finalizing orders [^116LD2BE].

> Wait, let me verify how to handle severe CAP and ICU patients, because broadening without indication risks harm; in severe disease, guideline-concordant broad-spectrum combination therapy with attention to validated MRSA and Pseudomonas risk factors is appropriate, and when Pseudomonas risk is present, antipseudomonal coverage principles from ATS/IDSA HAP/VAP guidance inform dual-class empiric strategies while CAP-specific guidance directs MRSA and Pseudomonas add-ons when risk factors are present, which I should reconcile with local pathways [^112hi12x] [^111bvyr5].

> For meningitis or other invasive pneumococcal infections, I should confirm that CNS penetration dictates early combination therapy; empirically, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime plus vancomycin is standard to cover high-level β-lactam resistance, with adjunctive dexamethasone when indicated, and although cefuroxime is labeled for meningitis, it is not preferred for empiric adult pneumococcal meningitis, while vancomycin remains without documented resistance in pneumococcus per surveillance summaries, which I must keep in mind when narrowing therapy on susceptibilities [^116pMNrF] [^113vU2tu].

> I need to ensure an evidence-based approach for MDRSP, and I should verify FDA data; levofloxacin carries efficacy data in CAP with MDRSP with approximately 95 percent clinical and bacteriologic success in microbiologically evaluable patients, moxifloxacin demonstrates in vitro and clinical activity across penicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, and linezolid offers an oral option for severe resistant gram-positive infections though it is generally bacteriostatic against pneumococcus, while clindamycin can retain activity in select isolates, all of which should be weighed against local resistance and safety profiles [^111EAxHC] [^116ZQPwM] [^116jh4f2] [^112Mbsge] [^113vU2tu].

> Let me think about dosing and duration pragmatically, and I should avoid drifting from guidelines; for CAP, high-dose amoxicillin, β-lactam plus macrolide combinations, or respiratory fluoroquinolones follow specific dosing endorsed by ATS/IDSA, whereas FDA labels provide dosing for agents like cefuroxime IV for pneumonia and oral cephalosporins such as cefaclor or cephalexin for respiratory tract infections, but wait, I initially considered cephalexin as a routine CAP option; hold on, that is not guideline-concordant for adult CAP despite respiratory tract labeling, so I should reserve such agents for labeled indications like streptococcal pharyngitis or select non-CAP respiratory infections and adhere to guideline-preferred CAP regimens instead [^116LD2BE] [^114NQhP1] [^116pMNrF] [^116FqGir] [^111vbtb1] [^114x9JRk].

> I should confirm duration targets that balance efficacy and resistance; for uncomplicated CAP, 5 to 7 days with documented clinical stability for 48 to 72 hours is sufficient, and shorter effective courses align with individual-level resistance dynamics showing emergence during and shortly after therapy with subsequent waning, which supports avoiding unnecessary prolonged exposure once stability criteria are met [^116LD2BE] [^113kh49V] [^112aT6f7] [^116U2v6M].

> Next, I should review a monitoring and de-escalation plan; obtain blood and respiratory cultures before antibiotics where feasible, reassess at 48 to 72 hours, de-escalate to the narrowest active agent on susceptibilities, and recognize that in a large cohort of microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal infections, discordant empiric therapy was not associated with higher 30-day mortality, which reassures me that guideline-concordant empiric strategies are generally robust while I await culture results [^1127e7fP].

> I will now examine resistance dynamics to optimize timing, and I should double-check the temporal peaks; β-lactam resistance in carried pneumococci tends to peak around day 14 with penicillin-specific peaks noted shortly after therapy and then wanes by approximately one month, while macrolide-associated resistance peaks later between about 30 and 60 days, implying that shorter CAP courses and avoidance of unnecessary macrolide exposure can mitigate selection pressure without compromising outcomes when stability criteria are met [^113kh49V] [^112aT6f7] [^111sa4N4] [^116U2v6M].

> But wait, preventing disease remains critical, so I need to ensure vaccination status and stewardship; conjugate pneumococcal vaccines reduce invasive disease and carriage of resistant serotypes with herd effects, polysaccharide vaccines contribute protection in adults albeit with variable effectiveness by endpoint, and stewardship and education initiatives correlate with stabilization or decline in resistant pneumococcal isolates, all of which should be embedded in discharge planning and primary care follow-up [^116UqkPH] [^117DcXAa] [^116PxoyZ] [^115STtLR].

> I should consider special populations and scenarios deliberately; in nursing home-acquired pneumonia, broader empiric coverage with either an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone or high-dose β-lactam plus azithromycin is reasonable given higher risk of drug-resistant organisms, in children amoxicillin remains first-line for otitis media and pneumonia while fluoroquinolones are generally avoided, and I need to remember that single-dose azithromycin can transiently increase pneumococcal resistance at two weeks but this signal resolves by six months, which should temper indiscriminate macrolide use in pediatrics [^112nLfsX] [^1158qBEX] [^115QPgAi] [^117SmP81].

> Finally, let me summarize a practical treatment algorithm and ensure alignment with high-credibility guidance; confirm the diagnosis and severity, assess resistance risk factors and local susceptibility data, select guideline-concordant empiric therapy by setting and comorbidity, dose appropriately with high-dose β-lactams when indicated, obtain cultures and reassess at 48 to 72 hours for de-escalation, target a 5 to 7 day CAP course contingent on clinical stability, update pneumococcal vaccination status, and monitor for treatment failure, recognizing that timely, guideline-aligned empiric therapy performs well even when susceptibilities later diverge [^116LD2BE] [^114NQhP1] [^1127e7fP].

Treat Streptococcus pneumoniae **first-line with beta-lactams** (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) for most infections; use **respiratory fluoroquinolones** (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) when beta-lactam resistance or allergy is present [^116LD2BE] [^111EAxHC]. For **severe infections**, combine a beta-lactam with a macrolide or use a respiratory fluoroquinolone alone. In **meningitis**, give high-dose ceftriaxone or cefotaxime plus vancomycin until susceptibilities are known. Adjust therapy based on **local resistance patterns** and **susceptibility results**, and use **pneumococcal vaccination** to prevent disease and reduce resistance [^112AuHia] [^112vDCmJ] [^116UqkPH].

---

## First-line antibiotic therapy

- **Beta-lactam antibiotics** are the cornerstone of treatment for S. pneumoniae infections given their proven efficacy and safety [^112hi12x]. The following agents are commonly used:

- **Amoxicillin**: Preferred for mild to moderate infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and non-severe pneumonia.

- **Amoxicillin-clavulanate**: Used for infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing organisms or when broader coverage is needed [^1149P7zb].

- **Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime**: Recommended for severe infections, including bacteremia, meningitis, and severe pneumonia [^113vU2tu].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapy

In cases of **beta-lactam allergy or resistance**, alternatives include:

- **Respiratory fluoroquinolones**: Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin are effective against multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae [^111EAxHC] and are recommended for severe infections or when beta-lactams cannot be used [^116LD2BE].

- **Macrolides**: Azithromycin or clarithromycin may be used for mild infections, but resistance rates are increasing, limiting their use as monotherapy [^1122RpZY] [^113CX6u6].

- **Clindamycin**: Effective for certain infections, particularly in penicillin-allergic patients, but resistance is a concern [^113vU2tu] [^112bzRxV].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

- **Empiric antibiotic therapy** should be initiated promptly based on clinical presentation, illness severity, and local resistance patterns [^112hi12x]. The following regimens are recommended:

| **Clinical setting** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| - Outpatient <br/> - No comorbidities | - Amoxicillin <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - Macrolide (if resistance < 25%) [^112hi12x] |
| - Outpatient <br/> - Comorbidities | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate + macrolide <br/> - Respiratory fluoroquinolone [^114NQhP1] |
| - Inpatient <br/> - Non-severe | - Beta-lactam + macrolide <br/> - Respiratory fluoroquinolone [^116LD2BE] |
| - Inpatient <br/> - Severe | - Beta-lactam + macrolide <br/> - Beta-lactam + respiratory fluoroquinolone [^116LD2BE] |
| Meningitis | - Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime + vancomycin |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **duration of antibiotic therapy** depends on the clinical syndrome and severity of infection [^112hi12x]:

- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: 5–7 days, provided the patient is afebrile for 48–72 hours and clinically stable [^116LD2BE].

- **Bacteremia without focal infection**: 10–14 days.

- **Meningitis**: 10–14 days, depending on clinical response and susceptibility results.

- **Otitis media or sinusitis**: 5–10 days, depending on clinical response.

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

**Clinical response** should be monitored closely, with adjustments based on culture and susceptibility results. If the patient does not improve within 48–72 hours, reassess and modify antibiotic therapy as necessary [^112hi12x].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention of S. pneumoniae infections is critical and includes **vaccination** with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV13, PCV15, PCV20) and the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), which reduce pneumococcal disease and antibiotic resistance [^112vDCmJ] [^117DcXAa]. Antibiotic stewardship and infection control measures — hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and isolation precautions in healthcare settings — also limit transmission and resistance [^116PxoyZ].

---

## Emerging antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae is a growing concern, particularly to **beta-lactams, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones**. Ongoing surveillance and adherence to antibiotic stewardship programs are essential to manage and prevent resistance [^116LFnxf] [^111r22ej].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Effective antibiotic therapy significantly reduces **morbidity and mortality** associated with S. pneumoniae infections. However, complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, meningitis, and chronic lung disease can occur, particularly in high-risk populations [^112fwpR7].

---

## Special considerations

Pediatric patients should receive **amoxicillin** as the preferred antibiotic for mild to moderate infections, with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime recommended for severe infections [^1158qBEX]. Immunocompromised patients may require **broad-spectrum antibiotics** and **longer treatment durations** owing to increased risk of severe infections and complications [^113vU2tu].

---

Beta-lactam antibiotics are **first-line** for Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, with respiratory fluoroquinolones or macrolides used as alternatives based on resistance patterns and patient factors [^116LD2BE]. Prevention through **vaccination** and **antibiotic stewardship** is essential to reduce disease burden and resistance [^112vDCmJ].

### Streptococcus pneumoniae: Epidemiology and patterns of resistance [^113vU2tu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, and sinusitis; it results in significant morbidity and mortality in patients with pneumonia and meningitis. The pneumococcus is a common colonizing bacterium in the respiratory tract and is especially prevalent in children, where it is frequently exposed to antimicrobial agents. This exposure can lead to resistance.

Penicillin non-susceptibility is found in nearly 40% of strains causing disease in adults, although these cases are often treatable with appropriate dosing regimens of many oral and parenteral beta-lactam agents. In the United States, resistance to macrolides is widespread — averaging approximately 28% — but geographically variable, ranging from 23% in the northwest to 30% in the northeast. Resistance to tetracyclines and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is reported in approximately 20% and 35% of isolates, respectively. Moreover, resistance to multiple classes of agents is increasingly common.

Amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, respiratory fluoroquinolones, and clindamycin are currently the most effective agents for the treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae, with more than 90% of isolates in the United States being susceptible. Vancomycin is the only agent against which resistance has not emerged.

Patient groups that are at increased risk for developing resistant pneumococcal infections have been identified and include patients with malignancies, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and sickle-cell disease. Judicious use of antimicrobials is recommended to combat resistance.

### Levofloxacin [^111EAxHC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levofloxacin was effective for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by multi-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP). MDRSP isolates are defined as those resistant to two or more of the following antibacterials: penicillin (MIC ≥ 2 mcg/mL), second-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefuroxime), macrolides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Of 40 microbiologically evaluable patients with MDRSP isolates, 38 patients (95%) achieved clinical and bacteriologic success at post-therapy. The clinical and bacterial success rates for levofloxacin-treated MDRSP in community-acquired pneumonia patients are documented in the population valid for efficacy.

- **Patient data**:
	- One patient had a respiratory isolate that was resistant to tetracycline, cefuroxime, macrolides, and TMP/SMX and intermediate to penicillin, as well as a blood isolate that was intermediate to penicillin and cefuroxime and resistant to the other classes. The patient is included in the database based on the respiratory isolate.

- **Data annotations**:
	- **†**: n = the number of microbiologically evaluable patients who were clinical successes; N = the number of microbiologically evaluable patients in the designated resistance group.
	- **‡**: n = the number of MDRSP isolates eradicated or presumed eradicated in microbiologically evaluable patients; N = the number of MDRSP isolates in a designated resistance group.

### Serotype competence and penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae [^116UqkPH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of bacteremia, sinusitis, otitis media, bacterial meningitis, and bacterial pneumonia, causes substantial illness and death worldwide. In recent decades, the increase in S. pneumoniae strains resistant to β-lactam antimicrobial drugs and other classes of antimicrobial drugs has further complicated the treatment of pneumococcal infection. Although the introduction of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has successfully reduced invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes and effectively decreased the spread of antimicrobial drug–resistant isolates, pneumococcal infection remains a major issue due to the selective pressure invoked by vaccination programs.

At least two consequences have been noted since the large-scale use of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine:

- **Serotype replacement**: Serotypes not covered by the conjugate vaccine have increased both in nasopharyngeal colonization and clinical illness.

- **Serotype switching**: This can occur through recombination in naturally transformable clones, resulting in the acquisition of a nonvaccine capsule.

Investigating how competent pneumococci are for genetic transformation is useful because this factor plays a role in the evolution of S. pneumoniae, especially concerning virulence and antimicrobial drug resistance. The ability of S. pneumoniae to undergo horizontal gene transfer leads to genetic diversity and helps the organism adapt to environmental changes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116LD2BE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically concerning empiric antibiotic therapy in the inpatient setting for non-severe CAP, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend combination therapy. This involves administering a β-lactam — such as ampicillin/sulbactam (1.5–3 g every 6 hours), cefotaxime (1–2 g every 8 hours), ceftriaxone (1–2 g daily), or ceftaroline (600 mg every 12 hours) — along with a macrolide, such as azithromycin (500 mg daily) or clarithromycin (500 mg BID). Alternatively, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin (750 mg daily) or moxifloxacin (400 mg daily), is suitable for adult inpatients with non-severe CAP who have no risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa.

### Appropriate use of antimicrobials for drug-resistant pneumonia: Focus on the significance of beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [^114huJwJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalosporins, are commonly prescribed for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. However, Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common etiologic agent of this disease, has become increasingly resistant to beta-lactams over the past decade. Several studies suggest that penicillins remain effective for treating streptococcal pneumonia when the infecting pathogen has a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of less than or equal to 1 microgram/mL. For cases where the MIC is greater than or equal to 4 microgram/mL, increased mortality rates (for patients who survive their first four days of hospitalization) may occur. Currently, 3.5%-7.8% of S. pneumoniae clinical isolates have MICs in this latter category, but these rates may rise in the future. The clinical relevance of in vitro resistance may be related to at least three factors: concordance of antimicrobial therapy, severity of illness, and virulence.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^116U2v6M]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The REMR DRMA used time since first antibiotic as a proxy for "dose", thus producing output that shows how resistance risk increases and then decreases following drug treatment. Fitting these temporal changes in resistance risk to probability distributions enabled estimates for how risk cumulates over different time spans. We made no a priori assumption of the distribution shape and instead fit a range of probability distributions (using a Python library called Reliability) and selected the best fit. These fitted distributions normalize the risk of transmitting resistant pathogens, ensuring the area under the curve summed to 1. Knowing how resistance emergence changed over time allowed estimation of how different patient isolation scenarios reduced the risk that a transmitted pathogen was resistant.

- **Naive scenario**: Measured the duration of isolation required to halve the risk that a transmitted pathogen was resistant, assuming isolation was initiated from the first day of treatment.
- **Targeted scenario**: Measured the duration of isolation needed to equivalently impact risk when the isolation window prioritized peak resistance levels.

### Oxazolidinone antibiotics [^112Mbsge]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Many common gram-positive pathogens (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents, and new drugs with activity against gram-positive bacteria are urgently needed. The oxazolidinones, a new chemical class of synthetic antimicrobial agents, have a unique mechanism of inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.

Linezolid, the first oxazolidinone to be approved for clinical use, displays in vitro activity (generally bacteriostatic) against many important resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant Strep. pneumoniae. Linezolid is a parenteral agent that also possesses near-complete oral bioavailability, as well as favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles.

Clinical trials confirm the activity of linezolid in the treatment of pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infections, and infections due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Linezolid shows promise as an alternative to glycopeptides and streptogramins in treating serious infections due to resistant gram-positive organisms. New agents with greater potency and novel spectra of activity could arise from further modification of the oxazolidinone nucleus.

### What is the relevance of antimicrobial resistance on the outcome of community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae? (Should macrolide monotherapy be used for mild pneumonia?) [^113CX6u6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Multidrug-resistant pneumococci continue to increase worldwide. Although questions remain regarding the relevance of β-lactam resistance, the recommendation for using macrolides as monotherapy for mild community-acquired pneumonia should be revisited. This is due to high rates of resistance, the association of clinical failures with both low-level and high-level resistance, and the lack of clinical data to support their necessity for empirical therapy for atypical cases.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae: The evolution of antimicrobial resistance to beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones and macrolides [^116K6e5d]. Microbes and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae constitutes a major public health concern worldwide. In this review, we discuss how the transformable nature of the pneumococcus, in parallel with antimicrobial-induced stress, contributes to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance; and how the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has affected the situation.

### Factors associated with 30-day mortality rate in respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae [^1127e7fP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). High credibility.

In a multivariable analysis of associations between initial antibiotic therapy and clinical outcomes in 5005 patients with microbiologically confirmed Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, "discordant" empiric antibiotic therapy was not associated with a 30-day mortality rate (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, .67–1.32).

### Resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae: Implications for drug selection [^112j74Po]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important pathogen in many community-acquired respiratory infections in the United States and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Unfortunately, S. pneumoniae is becoming increasingly resistant to a variety of antibiotics. Results of recent surveillance studies in the United States show that the prevalence of penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae ranges from 25% to > 50%, and rates of macrolide resistance among pneumococci are reported to be as high as 31%. A high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial classes is found among penicillin-resistant strains.

Newer quinolones (e.g. gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin) that have better antipneumococcal activity in vitro are the most active agents and therefore are attractive options for the treatment of adults with community-acquired respiratory infections. Efforts should be made to prevent pneumococcal infections in high-risk patients through vaccination.

### Effect of single-dose azithromycin on pneumococcal carriage and resistance: A randomized controlled trial [^115QPgAi]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). High credibility.

We evaluated antibiotic resistance selection in *Streptococcus pneumoniae* isolates from children participating in an individually randomized trial of single-dose azithromycin versus placebo. After 14 days, the prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, oxacillin, and clindamycin was elevated in the azithromycin group compared to the placebo group. However, there was no difference observed at 6 months.

### Levofloxacin [^116ZQPwM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

Levofloxacin was found to be effective for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP). MDRSP isolates are defined as being resistant to two or more of the following antibacterials: penicillin (MIC ≥ 2 mcg/mL), second-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefuroxime), macrolides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Of 40 microbiologically evaluable patients with MDRSP isolates, 38 patients (95.0%) achieved clinical and bacteriologic success post-therapy.

- **Clinical details**: One patient presented a respiratory isolate resistant to tetracycline, cefuroxime, macrolides, and TMP/SMX, with intermediate resistance to penicillin, and a blood isolate intermediate to penicillin and cefuroxime and resistant to the other classes. This patient was included in the database based on the respiratory isolate.

- **Definitions of terms**:
	- †n refers to the number of microbiologically evaluable patients who were clinical successes.
	- N represents the number of microbiologically evaluable patients in the designated resistance group.
	- ‡n denotes the number of MDRSP isolates eradicated or presumed eradicated in microbiologically evaluable patients.
	- N refers to the number of MDRSP isolates in a designated resistance group.

Not all isolates were resistant to all antimicrobial classes tested. Success and eradication rates are further summarized elsewhere.

### Increasing antibiotic resistance of streptococcus species in New York City [^112bzRxV]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus species are common pathogens in head and neck infections and are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Emerging penicillin-resistant streptococcal pathogens have shifted empirical antibiotic therapy in favor of valuable alternatives, including erythromycin and clindamycin. This study was undertaken to determine the magnitude of antimicrobial resistance to these antibiotics.

- **Study design**: Retrospective review.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study of two streptococcal species isolates, Streptococcus pyogenes (163 specimens) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (164 specimens), was conducted. Specimens were collected between January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002, at two academic institutions. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns were analyzed for penicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards.

- **Results**: Fourteen percent to 34% of S. pyogenes isolates were erythromycin-resistant, and 0% to 28% were clindamycin-resistant. None of the S. pyogenes isolates were resistant to penicillin. Of the S. pneumoniae isolates, 33% to 50% were resistant to erythromycin, and 18% to 33% were resistant to clindamycin. The penicillin resistance levels for S. pneumoniae were 0% to 45%.

- **Conclusions**: Our antimicrobial resistance levels for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae significantly exceeded national and worldwide levels of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance. With a diverse population of over 8 million residents and high physician supply, our model is a microcosm for the study of antimicrobial use and susceptibility patterns.

### Hospital-reported pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin [^111qJawX]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Geographic variation in drug susceptibility among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae has influenced national treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. Whether individual hospital susceptibility data provide reliable and valid information for providers is unclear. We examined the geographic and temporal variability in hospital-reported rates of pneumococcal susceptibility. We surveyed all 52 hospitals that provided acute adult care in the five counties surrounding Philadelphia and collected data on levels of penicillin susceptibility among all pneumococcal blood isolates from 1998 to 2000. In 1998, pneumococcal nonsusceptibility to penicillin varied from 0% to 67% of all blood isolates across the 33 hospitals with more than 10 isolates in that year. Hospital location did not correlate with the level of reported pneumococcal susceptibility (p = 0.8). In addition, correlations were not significant in reported pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin within individual hospitals during the three years.

### Rethinking recommendations for use of pneumococcal vaccines in adults [^115STtLR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major cause of disease worldwide; the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains emphasizes the importance of disease prevention through the use of vaccines. Recent studies have provided information that is useful for evaluating vaccine recommendations. These recommendations target most people who are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease. However, a higher risk has also been identified for African Americans and smokers, but these groups are not specifically targeted by current recommendations.

The vaccine is effective against invasive disease in immunocompetent individuals, although studies in immunocompromised subjects have found few subgroups in which the vaccine appears to be effective. Questions regarding the optimal timing and indications for revaccination remain a challenge because the duration of protection and effectiveness of revaccination are unknown.

New pneumococcal vaccines appear promising but will need to be tested against the performance of the polysaccharide vaccine. Improving the delivery of the currently available pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to benefiting adults should be a high priority.

In the United States, guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired RTIs have been established by several groups, including the American Thoracic Society, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership. These guidelines have addressed the clinical relevance of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae in updates for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and in a report published by the Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group, convened by the CDC.

The consensus among these guidelines is that empiric therapy should be stratified based on the likely cause, treatment setting (inpatient versus outpatient), and the risk for pneumococcal antimicrobial resistance. In general, all three guidelines recommend that monotherapy with macrolides should be restricted to specific patient subgroups, such as those with no coexisting cardiopulmonary disease and no risk factors for infection with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae (e.g. recent antimicrobial drug use).

For outpatients with risk factors for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae, recommended treatment options include combination therapy with a β-lactam (such as high-dose amoxicillin or high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate) plus a macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone. The increased use of fluoroquinolones has been associated with the emergence and spread of resistance to these agents, along with local clonal dissemination of S. pneumoniae strains with very high resistance levels.

### Safety of Streptococcus pyogenes vaccines: Anticipating and overcoming challenges for clinical trials and post-marketing monitoring [^115VWbf8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Strep A), a human pathogen, afflict more than 800 million people each year and result in an estimated 639,000 deaths, most attributable to rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and invasive infections. Clinical manifestations vary from mucosal diseases (pharyngitis, tonsillitis, superficial skin infections) to locally invasive and systemic diseases (bacteremia, meningitis, puerperal sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome) and immune-related sequelae including acute rheumatic fever (ARF), acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and RHD. While most manifestations of S. pyogenes infection can be treated with penicillin, the lack of prevention strategies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), allows infections to progress to severe disease and death. Hence, the 71st World Health Assembly asked the World Health Organization (WHO) in May 2018 to prioritize the development of a safe and effective S. pyogenes vaccine.

### Vaccines for preventing pneumococcal infection in adults [^117DcXAa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) continue to cause substantial morbidity and mortality globally. Whilst pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPVs) have the potential to prevent disease and death, the degree of protection afforded against various clinical endpoints and within different populations is uncertain.

- **Objective**: To assess the efficacy and effectiveness of PPVs in preventing pneumococcal disease or death in adults. We did not assess adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 6, MEDLINE (January 1966 to June Week 2, 2012), and EMBASE (1974 to June 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults, provided the study outcome met the definition of the outcome considered in the review. We also considered non-RCTs in adults where the study assessed PPV effectiveness against culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), provided the study controlled for important confounding factors.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed trial quality of RCTs and three review authors extracted the data. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. Two review authors assessed study quality and extracted data for non-RCTs. We calculated ORs and 95% CIs using a random-effects model following the conversion of each study outcome to a log OR and standard error (SE).

- **Main results**: Twenty-five studies met our inclusion criteria, comprising 18 RCTs involving 64,852 participants and seven non-RCTs involving 62,294 participants.

### Resistance decay in individuals after antibiotic exposure in primary care: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116GbDWA]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae and penicillin exposure were studied in only one controlled study (with 35 participants). Before exposure to penicillin, resistance was not significantly different between the group of patients subsequently exposed and those not exposed [OR 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5–15.3]. After exposure, the OR of resistance in those exposed was 9.4 [95% CI 0.6–149.3]. After 3 months, there was no longer a significant difference in resistance [OR 0.4, CI 0.02–9.8; Fig. 3].

There were more data from prospective repeated measures cohort studies that compared resistance rates before antibiotic exposure (baseline data) and after penicillin exposure after 1 week (0 to 7 days; 6 studies, 1060 participants, and 8 antibiotic exposure groups) and after 1 month (> 1 week to ≤ 1 month; 4 studies, 772 participants, and 5 antibiotic exposure groups). After 1 week, resistance had increased significantly [OR 4.2, 95% CI 3.3–5.4]. Thereafter, resistance had reduced after 1 month [OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.1; Fig. 3].

One RCT investigated reported resistance in isolates (rather than individuals) after exposure to amoxicillin and its data are analysed separately. It found that the changes in resistance following amoxicillin exposure were short-lived, returning to normal by 1 month after the end of treatment [Fig. 3].

S. pneumoniae and cephalosporin exposure showed no RCTs. Four cohort studies (519 participants and 8 different antibiotic exposure groups) reported that resistance had increased at 1 week after exposure [OR 2.2].

### Treatment of nursing home-acquired pneumonia [^112nLfsX]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in nursing home residents, with 30-day mortality rates ranging from 10 to 30 percent. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of nursing home-acquired pneumonia, although Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative organisms may be more common in severe cases. Antibiotic therapy for nursing home-acquired pneumonia should target a broad range of organisms, and drug-resistant microbes should be considered when making treatment decisions.

In the nursing home setting, treatment should consist of an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone or either a high-dose beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor or a second- or third-generation cephalosporin, in combination with azithromycin. Treatment of hospitalized patients with nursing home-acquired pneumonia requires broad-spectrum antibiotics with coverage of many gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Appropriate dosing of antibiotics for nursing home-acquired pneumonia is important to optimize effectiveness and avoid adverse effects. Because many nursing home residents take multiple medications, it is important to consider possible drug interactions.

### Antimicrobial-drug use and changes in resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae [^112AuHia]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

Resistance of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* to antimicrobial drugs is increasing. To investigate the relationship between antimicrobial use and susceptibility of *S. pneumoniae* isolates at 24 U.S. medical centers, we obtained data on outpatient antimicrobial-drug use for the regions surrounding 23 of these centers. We found an association between decreased penicillin susceptibility and use of beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs.

### Therapeutic potential of kaempferol on Streptococcus pneumoniae infection [^1173na1f]. Microbes and Infection (2022). Low credibility.

Co-infections with pathogens and secondary bacterial infections play significant roles during the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenetic process, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Notably, co-infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), a major Gram-positive pathogen causing pneumonia or meningitis, severely threaten the diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of COVID-19 worldwide.

Accumulating evidence indicates that S. pneumoniae evolves multiple virulence factors, including pneumolysin (PLY) and sortase A (SrtA), which have been extensively explored as alternative anti-infection targets. In our study, the natural flavonoid kaempferol was identified as a potential candidate drug for infection therapeutics via anti-virulence mechanisms. We found that kaempferol could interfere with the pore-forming activity of PLY by engaging with catalytic active sites and consequently inhibiting PLY-mediated cytotoxicity.

- **Inhibition of bacterial enzymes**: Exposure to kaempferol significantly reduced SrtA peptidase activity by occupying the active sites of SrtA.
- **Impact on bacterial adhesion and biofilms**: Further, biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion to the host cells could be significantly thwarted by kaempferol incubation.

In vivo infection models by S. pneumoniae highlighted that kaempferol oral administration exhibited notable treatment benefits, as evidenced by decreased bacterial burden, suggesting that kaempferol has tremendous potential to attenuate S. pneumoniae pathogenicity. Scientifically, our study implies that kaempferol is a promising therapeutic option.

### Activity of oral beta-lactam antimicrobial agents versus respiratory tract isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in the era of antibiotic resistance [^114hPot1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The management of outpatient respiratory tract infections with oral beta-lactam antimicrobial agents has been complicated by the emergence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, and isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae that express varying levels of beta-lactam resistance because of altered penicillin-binding proteins. There is no question that all three of these important respiratory tract pathogens have changed conspicuously in the context of decreased activity of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents. The question arises, what does this change mean from a clinical perspective?

In this review, the in vitro activity of various oral beta-lactam antimicrobial agents versus contemporary isolates of H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and S. pneumoniae will be compared. The approach that is used in defining organisms as being susceptible or resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobial agents will be elucidated. Finally, an effort will be made to assess the ramifications of beta-lactam resistance for therapeutic efficacy in patients with respiratory tract infections caused by these three bacteria. We conclude that, notwithstanding diminished beta-lactam activity for many clinical isolates of H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and S. pneumoniae, certain agents remain effective in treating outpatient respiratory tract infections.

### Morphine disrupts interleukin-23 (IL-23)/IL-17-mediated pulmonary mucosal host defense against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection [^116CQy9a]. Infection and Immunity (2010). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a pathogen that causes serious respiratory diseases and meningitis in the immunocompromised drug abuse population. However, the precise mechanisms by which drug abuse compromises the host immune defense to pulmonary S. pneumoniae infection are not fully understood. Using a well-established murine model of opiate abuse and S. pneumoniae lung infection, we explored the influence of morphine treatment on the interleukin-23 (IL-23)/IL-17 axis and related innate immunity.

Impairment of early IL-23/IL-17 production caused by morphine treatment was associated with delayed neutrophil migration and decreased pneumococcal clearance. Furthermore, morphine treatment impaired MyD88-dependent IL-23 production in alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells in response to in vitro S. pneumoniae cell infection. Moreover, morphine treatment significantly inhibited the S. pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of interferon response factor 3 (IRF3), ATF2, and NF-kappaBp65. T-cell receptor delta (TCRdelta)-deficient mice showed a decrease in IL-17 production and a severely weakened capacity to clear lung S. pneumoniae infection.

Finally, morphine treatment resulted in diminished secretion of antimicrobial proteins S100A9 and S100A8/A9 during the early stages of S. pneumoniae infection. In conclusion, morphine treatment causes dysfunction in IL-23-producing dendritic cells and macrophages and IL-17-producing gammadeltaT lymphocytes in response to S. pneumoniae lung infection, leading to diminished release of antimicrobial S100A8/A9 proteins and compromised neutrophil recruitment.

### Effect of single-dose azithromycin on pneumococcal carriage and resistance: A randomized controlled trial [^117SmP81]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). High credibility.

We evaluated antibiotic resistance selection in Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from children participating in an individually randomized trial of single-dose azithromycin versus placebo. After 14 days, the prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, oxacillin, and clindamycin was elevated in the azithromycin versus placebo group. There was no difference at 6 months.

### Antibiotic resistant infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae: impact on therapeutic options and clinical outcome [^113AyidT]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. The development of increasing resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics is making the treatment of infections due to this organism much more difficult. The ultimate impact of high-level antibiotic resistance on therapeutic options and clinical outcomes of various pneumococcal infections is unclear and remains to be determined. The use of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has markedly decreased invasive pneumococcal disease in children under 5 years of age; however, its impact on decreasing antibiotic resistance is currently unknown.

- **Recent findings**: Studies suggest that the response to therapy and clinical outcome of infections due to pneumococcal isolates with intermediate resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotics is no different from that of infections due to susceptible isolates. However, evidence is accumulating that infections caused by highly resistant pneumococcal isolates are associated with higher rates of treatment failure and mortality than infections due to susceptible strains.

- **Summary**: The use of a conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in conjunction with educational intervention programs that promote appropriate and judicious antibiotic use is a safe and effective means of decreasing the prevalence of pneumococcal disease in the pediatric population. It also aids in decreasing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic agents and potentially reducing the extent of antibiotic resistance currently being observed.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^112aT6f7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Patient exposure to antibiotics promotes the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. The aim of this study was to identify whether the temporal dynamics of resistance emergence at the individual-patient level were predictable for specific pathogen-drug classes.

- **Methods**: Following a systematic review, a novel robust error meta-regression method for dose-response meta-analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for carrying resistant bacteria during and following treatment compared to baseline. Probability density functions fitted to the resulting dose-response curves were then used to optimize the period during and/or after treatment when resistant pathogens were most likely to be identified.

- **Results**: Studies of Streptococcus pneumoniae treatment with β-lactam antibiotics demonstrated a peak in resistance prevalence among patients 4 days after completing treatment with a 3.32-fold increase in odds (95% confidence interval, 1.71–6.46). Resistance waned more gradually than it emerged, returning to preexposure levels 1 month after treatment (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.55–1.75]). Patient isolation during the peak dose-response period would be expected to reduce the risk that a transmitted pathogen is resistant equivalently to a 50% longer isolation window timed from the first day of treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Predictable temporal dynamics of resistance levels have implications both for surveillance and control.

### Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and tolerance in Streptococcus pneumoniae [^111r22ej]. Microbes and Infection (2000). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major pathogen causing potentially life-threatening community-acquired diseases in both the developed and developing world. Since 1967, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of penicillin-resistant and multiply antibiotic-resistant pneumococci worldwide. Prevention of access of the antibiotic to the target, inactivation of the antibiotic, and alteration of the target are mechanisms that S. pneumoniae has developed to resist antibiotics. Recent studies on antibiotic-tolerant pneumococcal mutants permitted the development of a novel model for the control of bacterial cell death.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^111iSPHV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of penicillin, antibiotics have significantly contributed to extending human life expectancy by 23 years. Widespread resistance among common bacterial pathogens and the slow development of replacement compounds or alternative therapies threaten these recent gains. It is estimated that approximately 1.27 million annual deaths are attributable to bacterial antimicrobial resistance.

Antibiotic resistance is selected for when bacteria are exposed to subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics that would otherwise inhibit their growth or kill them, making the remedy itself one of the primary drivers and risk factors for antibiotic resistance. The relationship between antibiotics and resistance is dose-dependent: Higher antibiotic consumption correlates with more resistant infections. The association between the level of antibiotics administered and resistance development has been demonstrated at the bacterial colony level, the individual-patient level, and among human populations at the country level.

However, resistance is not necessarily a persistent trait of pathogens, and decreased resistance rates have been demonstrated following antibiotic withdrawal both at the individual and community levels. Prolonged treatment to ensure clearing the infection, therefore, comes at the cost of providing more sustained periods over which resistant pathogens have a competitive advantage. This has led to a recent challenge in the dogma of always completing antibiotic courses. For example, randomized controlled trials have shown that shorter treatment schedules for both hospital and community-acquired infections can be effective.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114NQhP1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients with comorbidities, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend:

- **Combination therapy**: Administer a combination of a β-lactam (amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day and 250 mg PO daily thereafter, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily).

- **Monotherapy**: Alternatively, use a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily).

These treatments are recommended for outpatients with CAP who have comorbidities such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### Antimicrobial-drug use and changes in resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae [^114xQgYe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to antimicrobial drugs is increasing. To investigate the relationship between antimicrobial use and susceptibility of S. pneumoniae isolates at 24 U.S. medical centers, we obtained data on outpatient antimicrobial-drug use for the regions surrounding 23 of these centers. We found an association between decreased penicillin susceptibility and use of beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^113kh49V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The discussion explores the significant impact of antibiotic resistance on morbidity, mortality, and societal costs. Previous studies have highlighted nonlinear temporal trends in the emergence of resistance among patients following exposure to antibiotics. Using a novel meta-analytical approach, this study aims to enhance our understanding of the temporality of resistance emergence and waning.

After pooling evidence from eight studies involving 3101 participants, an increased risk of resistant S. pneumoniae was identified among patients. This risk peaked at day 14 for β-lactams, with the penicillin subgroup peaking four days after treatment cessation. Evidence suggests an eventual waning in resistance 30 days following the cessation of the antibiotic course, aligning with findings from earlier studies.

Identifying consistent dynamics in resistance emergence and waning presents new opportunities for understanding the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. Surveillance plays a crucial role in tracking the spread of resistance and targeting its control. It is one of the five strategic priorities of the Global Action Plan on antimicrobial resistance. Research on resistance is largely focused on surveillance reports. A recent report from the Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance outlines several ways in which surveillance can support efforts to curb antimicrobial resistance. It can enhance the detection of the emergence and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, guide patient treatment, identify populations at risk, inform policy development, and assess the impact of interventions.

### Penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae: Review of moxifloxacin activity [^116jh4f2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a significant pathogen in respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia, sinusitis, meningitis, and acute otitis media. Rising incidences of antimicrobial resistance among pneumococcal strains have been reported worldwide, prompting research into and development of advanced antibacterials with improved gram-positive activity. Moxifloxacin, a new 8-methoxy quinolone, has been tested against a variety of S. pneumoniae strains, including penicillin-sensitive, intermediately resistant, and penicillin-resistant strains. We review the preclinical data corroborated by the available clinical experience to demonstrate moxifloxacin's activity against S. pneumoniae strains, irrespective of penicillin susceptibility.

### Hospital-reported pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin [^116AkGd4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Geographic variation in drug susceptibility among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae has influenced national treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. Whether individual hospital susceptibility data provide reliable and valid information for providers is unclear. We examined the geographic and temporal variability in hospital-reported rates of pneumococcal susceptibility. We surveyed all 52 hospitals that provided acute adult care in the five counties surrounding Philadelphia and collected data on levels of penicillin susceptibility among all pneumococcal blood isolates from 1998 to 2000. In 1998, pneumococcal nonsusceptibility to penicillin varied from 0% to 67% of all blood isolates across the 33 hospitals with more than 10 isolates in that year. Hospital location did not correlate with the level of reported pneumococcal susceptibility (p = 0.8). In addition, correlations were not significant in reported pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin within individual hospitals during the three years.

### Treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis caused by antimicrobial-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [^1149P7zb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a secondary bacterial infection of the nose and paranasal sinuses, usually following a viral upper respiratory infection or allergy. It is characterized by symptoms that have not improved after 10 days or that have worsened after 5 to 7 days. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the most common causes of ABRS in adults.

Increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance among S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase production among H. influenzae pose formidable challenges to the effective treatment of these infections. In response, various formulations of amoxicillin-clavulanate have been developed. The most recent formulation is pharmacokinetically enhanced and provides a total daily dose of 4,000 mg of amoxicillin and 250 mg of clavulanate. This formulation has been shown to be safe and effective in treating infections caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 microg/mL. Additionally, the clavulanate component provides adequate coverage against beta-lactamase-producing pathogens.

### Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines - implications for community antibiotic prescribing [^1139nJiw]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2000). Low credibility.

Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population worldwide. The development of increasing resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics is making the treatment of infections caused by this organism much more difficult. In order to prevent disease, a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is available. However, this vaccine is poorly immunogenic in infants and young children. The development and licensing of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that are safe and effective in the pediatric population is an important step in our ability to decrease the prevalence of pneumococcal disease.

### Pneumococcal resistance in perspective: How well are we combating it [^116PxoyZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Because Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most commonly isolated community-acquired respiratory tract pathogen, the reports of high rates of antibiotic resistance throughout the world highlight the need for intervention to stem any further increases in resistance. Efforts to reduce the incidence of pneumococcal resistance have been mainly two-fold, involving attempts to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, as well as to assure early childhood immunization with the pneumococcal heptavalent conjugate vaccine.

To reduce unnecessary prescribing for infections that are typically viral in etiology, such as acute bronchitis, education efforts have been focused not only on clinicians but also on parents and patients. These education efforts significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, and initial evidence suggests that they may stabilize, if not reduce, the incidence of penicillin and macrolide-resistant pneumococcal isolates.

Utilization of the relatively new pneumococcal heptavalent conjugate vaccine not only reduces the incidence of acute otitis media caused by pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine, as well as disease caused by related serotypes, but also has a highly significant effect on reducing the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in children and potential adult contacts. More recent data have established that vaccination is also decreasing the carriage and transmission of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal isolates.

Education and vaccine programs that attempt to stabilize and/or reduce the rate of pneumococcal resistance are crucial in these efforts.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens.

- **Guidelines from major health organizations**: Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation: The key to pneumococcal disease [^114ES1XA]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important pathogen causing invasive diseases such as sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia. The burden of disease is highest in the youngest and oldest segments of the population in both more and less developed countries. Treatment of pneumococcal infections is complicated by the worldwide emergence of resistance in pneumococci to penicillin and other antibiotics. Pneumococcal disease is preceded by asymptomatic colonisation, which is particularly high in children. The seven-valent conjugate vaccine is highly effective against invasive disease caused by vaccine-type strains. However, vaccine coverage is limited, and replacement by non-vaccine serotypes, resulting in disease, poses a serious threat for the near future.

The search for new vaccine candidates that elicit protection against a broader range of pneumococcal strains is therefore important. Several surface-associated protein vaccines are currently under investigation. An important consideration is whether the goal should be to prevent pneumococcal disease by eradicating nasopharyngeal colonisation or to prevent bacterial invasion while leaving colonisation relatively unaffected, hence preventing the occurrence of replacement colonisation and disease.

To illustrate the importance of pneumococcal colonisation in relation to disease and prevention, we discuss the mechanism and epidemiology of colonisation, the complex relationships within and between species, and the consequences of various preventive strategies for pneumococcal colonisation.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae causes experimental meningitis following intranasal and otitis media infections via a nonhematogenous route [^116Whdac]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Using two different animal models of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, we have demonstrated that this organism is able to spread to the central nervous system and cause meningitis by bypassing the bloodstream. Following respiratory tract infection induced via intranasal inoculation, bacteria were rapidly found in the bloodstream and brains in the majority of infected mice. A similar pattern of dissemination occurred following otitis media infection via transbullar injection of gerbils. However, a small percentage of animals infected by either route showed no bacteria in the blood and yet did have significant numbers of bacteria in brain tissue. Subsequent experiments using a galU mutant of S. pneumoniae, which is impaired in its ability to disseminate to the bloodstream following infection, showed that this organism is able to spread to the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. These results demonstrate that, unlike many bacterial pathogens that cause meningitis, S. pneumoniae is able to do so independent of bloodstream involvement upon different routes of infection. This may address the difficulty in treating human infections caused by this organism.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^114NWazJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

To further refine the temporal dynamics of patient-level resistance emergence and waning, the odds of antibiotic resistance are modeled over time using a dose-response meta-analysis (DRMA) framework, which incorporates time since antibiotic exposure as a continuous variable. This approach has the advantage over fixed time intervals (as done in previous meta-analyses) by reducing information loss, thus minimizing the risk of distorting exposure-outcome relationships. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between different antibiotic therapies and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens over time. To achieve this aim, the meta-analysis conducted by Bakhit et al. was updated, and the data were reanalyzed using a DRMA.

### Management of antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infections and the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines [^115KNkFY]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major cause of meningitis, pneumonia, bacteraemia, and acute otitis media in both children and adults, has been altered by the availability of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and selection pressure from broad-spectrum antibiotics. In Spain, the rates of antimicrobial consumption and resistance are high; of all S. pneumoniae isolates collected between 2001 and 2003, 9.2% were penicillin-resistant and 26.4% were penicillin-intermediate. These rates were even higher in children aged ≤ 4 years; 52.3% of isolates were penicillin-resistant or penicillin-intermediate.

Serogroup 14 comprises nearly 9% of pneumococcal strains and exhibits the highest resistance to penicillin (69%). Since the introduction of PCV7 in Madrid, the isolates collected from hospitalized children aged < 15 years from 21 hospitals revealed that only 8% of cases involving S. pneumoniae isolates were due to PCV7 serotypes, and no PCV7 vaccination failures were identified. These isolates demonstrated low rates of penicillin-non-susceptible and erythromycin-non-susceptible strains. Among multiresistant strains, serotype 19A was identified as the most important. Although the recent WHO position paper on childhood immunizations speaks to the growing resistance of pneumococci, antibiotic resistance in Spain is noted to be decreasing and must be evaluated in conjunction with global studies.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114anNs8]. The Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

This seminar reviews important features and management issues of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that are especially relevant to immunocompetent adults in light of new information about cause, clinical course, diagnostic testing, treatment, and prevention. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen; however, emerging resistance of this organism to antimicrobial agents has affected empirical treatment of CAP. Atypical pathogens have been quite commonly identified in several prospective studies. The clinical significance of these pathogens (with the exception of Legionella spp) is not clear, partly because of the lack of rapid, standardized tests.

Diagnostic evaluation of CAP is important for the appropriate assessment of the severity of illness and for establishing the causative agent in the disease. Until better rapid diagnostic methods are developed, most patients will be treated empirically. Antimicrobials continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and decisions about specific agents are guided by several considerations that include spectrum of activity, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Several factors have been shown to be associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in patients with CAP. These factors include the timely administration of antimicrobials, choice of antibiotic therapy, and the use of a critical pneumonia pathway.

The appropriate use of vaccines against pneumococcal disease and influenza should be encouraged. Several guidelines for management of CAP have recently been published, the recommendations of which are relevant to clinical practice.

### Aggregated antibiograms and monitoring of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [^116LFnxf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Infections from Streptococcus pneumoniae tax the healthcare system in the United States and other countries. Scientific advances have been made in the treatment and prevention of pneumococcal infections through antibiotics and licensure of vaccines for both adults and children. However, the last few decades have witnessed the emergence of S. pneumoniae resistance to antibiotics. In a multistate, population-based surveillance system that follows invasive disease from pneumococcus and other bacterial pathogens, the percentage of isolates resistant to penicillin reached 24% in 1998. Increases in resistance to other antimicrobial drugs have also been noted among penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

- **Implications of drug-resistance**: Extend beyond the laboratory and into clinical practice as treatment failures from drug resistance have been reported with meningitis and otitis media. In some studies, increased death and disease in patients hospitalized with pneumonia caused by high-level β-lactam-resistant pneumococci have been reported.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^111sa4N4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Consistent patterns across studies emerged from the dose-response analyses, indicating that the odds of resistance for β-lactams increased to a maximum level by day 14 (Figure 2). Macrolide treatment studies also showed consistency, with peak resistance occurring much later, between approximately days 30 and 60 (see Supplementary Material 5). Knowledge of these temporalities could be used to inform strategically timed sampling to improve estimates of resistance incidence and prevalence. This information could also contribute toward temporally targeted isolation of patients, aiming to reduce the risk that transmitted pathogens are drug resistant.

The relative reduction in the risk that a transmitted pathogen is resistant when isolating patients from the first day of treatment was compared with isolation during the period when the odds of resistance was found to be highest in the meta-analysis. Both scenarios for β-lactams, including the subgroup of penicillin, are shown in Figure 3 (for macrolide treatments of S. pneumoniae, see Supplementary Material 5).

- **Figure 3**: Strategically timed isolation of patients treated for Streptococcus pneumoniae infection can reduce the risk that transmitted pathogens are resistant. Alternative isolation windows are shown: time extending from the first day of treatment ("naive"; solid line) or during windows of highest resistance risk as identified in the meta-analysis ("targeted"; dashed line). The dotted lines denote the durations of isolation required to halve the risk that transmitted S. pneumoniae are resistant.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^113T9x2Y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The foundation of this study is the systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Bakhit et al. from which the eligibility criteria were adopted, along with part of the risk of bias assessment and the included studies. This study was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), with a checklist available in Supplementary Material 1.

- **Study search and selection**:
	- The study search was updated with a forward citation search using Elsevier's Scopus on 31 October 2019. The basis for the forward citation search consisted of the primary studies included in the Bakhit et al. and Costelloe et al. meta-analyses. No limits were applied to the study search. In cases of ambiguity regarding study eligibility at any stage, L. Y. was consulted.

	- **Studies were included if they met the following eligibility criteria**: (1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental pre–post studies, or prospective cohort studies; (2) studies compared patients treated with antibiotics versus controls (i.e. not treated or prior to treatment with antibiotics); (3) patients were treated in the community or had community-acquired infections; (4) patients received antibiotic therapy of any class, or combination of classes, for a maximum duration of 14 days; and (5) studies reported the prevalence or incidence of resistant bacteria among patients, isolates, or specimens over time. Case reports and conference abstracts were excluded. Studies including patients with hospital-associated, device-related, or persistent infections were also excluded.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae septic arthritis in adults [^117DJAYZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae septic arthritis is an uncommon infection. The classic clinical picture includes concomitant pulmonary and/or meningeal and joint infections in the presence of predisposing local and systemic factors. Initial laboratory tests are usually inconclusive, and joint aspiration is required for a definitive diagnosis. Treatment options include antibiotic therapy, usually with penicillin, combined with closed or open joint drainage. Increasing reports of infections involving penicillin-resistant strains are a concern. The prognosis is usually favorable, but early recognition and aggressive management are essential to reduce the likelihood of significant joint injury.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat [^113bY21x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Sore throat is a common condition caused by viruses or bacteria and is a leading cause of antibiotic prescription in primary care. The most common bacterial species is group A Streptococcus ('strep throat'). Between 50% to 70% of pharyngitis cases are treated with antibiotics, despite the majority of cases being viral in origin. One strategy to reduce antibiotics is to use rapid tests for group A Streptococcus to guide antibiotic prescriptions. Rapid tests can be used alone or in combination with a clinical scoring system.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of strategies based on rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat in primary care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS, as well as the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP on 5 June 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid tests with management based on clinical grounds to guide the prescription of antibiotics for people with a sore throat in ambulatory care settings. We included trials that randomized individuals, as well as cluster-RCTs in which individual practitioners (or practices) or emergency departments were randomized.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data on the primary outcomes (number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription; number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed) and secondary outcomes (duration of sore throat symptoms; duration of other symptoms; quality of life measures).

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^117D5zA2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia based on the best available evidence. This review aims to compare these guideline recommendations.

- **Recent findings**: Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors, including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as differences in the interpretation of existing evidence.

- **Summary**: The lack of robust evidence behind certain guideline recommendations and the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112hi12x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations.

- **Results**: The panel addressed 16 specific areas for recommendations spanning questions of diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, the availability of results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Antibiotic consumption and generation of resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae: the paradoxical impact of quinolones in a complex selective landscape [^112WU47A]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

The development of resistance to different antibiotics by the majority of bacterial species of clinical importance seems unavoidable. However, not all drugs have the same efficiency in selecting for resistance. Large differences in the qualitative and quantitative consumption of antibiotics among countries are known to exist. Several authors have consistently reported a direct relationship between consumption and selection of resistance for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli in relation to beta-lactams and macrolides use.

In Spain, extensive surveillance started in 1996 with the Willow (SAUCE) Project to monitor and update resistance in respiratory pathogens and couple those data with national antibiotic consumption (IMS) from both temporal and geographical approaches. Temporally, despite a continuous increase of 16% in quinolone consumption from 1997 to 2001 — basically due to the arrival of respiratory quinolones, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin — a continuous linear increase in the resistance rates to ciprofloxacin in S. pneumoniae was not observed. There was also an inverse correlation between provincial consumption of quinolones and resistance to ciprofloxacin.

Several hypotheses are proposed and discussed to explain these apparent paradoxical observations, such as the replacement of ciprofloxacin by more potent antipneumococcal quinolones, the possibility of an antibiotic pressure threshold, and the influence of other nonquinolone drugs on the expression of ciprofloxacin-resistance biological costs.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^116DFxue]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for an atypical pathogen.

Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^115WGnja]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Strengths of this study include the novel statistical approach, which allowed for time to be treated as a continuous variable instead of being categorized (e.g. before vs. after, or intervention vs. control). This meant that the multiple, longitudinal observations per study could be capitalized upon more effectively for analysis. Limitations of this study include the fact that extracted data from the reviewed studies were insufficient to analyze pathogens other than S. pneumoniae, and this analysis was restricted to a single antibiotic class with two subclasses. It was also not possible to assess the differences between high- and low-dose antibiotics, or between adults and children.

This study identified consistent temporal dynamics in the emergence and waning of drug resistance for specific drug-pathogen combinations. Acknowledging the shortfall in the development of new drugs, the World Health Organization recently reiterated the critical importance of alternative infection control strategies. Implications of predictable dynamics extend beyond improved targeting for future surveillance and highlight a potential novel strategy of temporally optimized patient isolation to reduce transmission of resistant pathogens. Future work will explore alternative data sources beyond published research (e.g. hospital records) to investigate the generalizability of the new methods and results presented here to other pathogen-drug class combinations.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^111bvyr5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, specifically in the context of empiric antibiotic therapy (Pseudomonas coverage), ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend considering the administration of antibiotics from two different classes with activity against *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. This is advised for patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia who are at high risk of mortality or have risk factors for Pseudomonas or other Gram-negative infections, such as prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae and community-acquired pneumonia: A cause for concern [^112fwpR7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the sixth most common cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of death from infectious diseases. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and poses a major economic burden on the healthcare system. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of CAP. Other common bacterial causes include Haemophilus influenzae, as well as atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella species.

Increasing resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents has been documented in S. pneumoniae and is common in H. influenzae as well. Successful empiric therapy is paramount to the management of CAP to avoid treatment failure and subsequent associated costs. Given that resistance is increasing among respiratory pathogens and S. pneumoniae is the most common etiologic agent identified in CAP, strategies for antimicrobial therapy should be based on the likely causative pathogen, the presence of risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, and local resistance patterns.

### Cefoxitin [^1153iuCw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cefoxitin for Injection, USP, is indicated for the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below.

- **Lower respiratory tract infections**: These include pneumonia and lung abscesses caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci (excluding enterococci, e.g. Enterococcus faecalis [formerly Streptococcus faecalis]), Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides species.

- **Urinary tract infections**: Caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia species (including P. rettgeri).

- **Intra-abdominal infections**: These include peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscesses caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Bacteroides species including Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium species.

- **Gynecological infections**: Including endometritis, pelvic cellulitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease caused by Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including penicillinase-producing strains), Bacteroides species including B. fragilis, Clostridium species, Peptococcus niger, Peptostreptococcus species, and Streptococcus agalactiae.

Cefoxitin for injection, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when cefoxitin is used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and C. trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be considered.

### Antibiotics in childhood pneumonia [^1158qBEX]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the most common global childhood illnesses. The diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical judgement and radiological and laboratory investigations. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important cause of childhood community-acquired pneumonia. In addition, viruses (including respiratory syncytial virus) and atypical bacteria, such as Mycoplasma and Chlamydia, are likely pathogens in younger and older children in developed countries. In the minority of cases, the actual organism is isolated to guide treatment. Antibiotics effective against the expected bacterial pathogens should be instituted where necessary. The route and duration of antibiotic therapy, the role of emerging pathogens, and the impact of pneumococcal resistance and conjugate pneumococcal vaccines are also discussed.

### Non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia due to vaccine serotypes: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112vDCmJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the most commonly implicated bacterial pathogen, and the spectrum of pneumococcal disease ranges from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage to localized infections and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common manifestation. The Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that in 2016, pneumococcal lower respiratory infections caused approximately 1.2 million deaths worldwide and 197 million episodes. The burden of pneumococcal disease follows a U-shaped curve, with the greatest incidence and mortality occurring in young children under 5 years and older adults aged 65 and above.

With 100 documented pneumococcal serotypes varying in disease severity, invasiveness, and antimicrobial susceptibility, pneumococcal disease is at least partially vaccine-preventable. Many countries have established infant immunization programs against pneumococcal disease, most using either a 13-valent or 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). The introduction of childhood PCV immunization has been associated with a reduction in overall and serotype-specific IPD in young children. Furthermore, infant PCV immunization reduces nasopharyngeal carriage in those vaccinated, preventing onward transmission to unvaccinated children and adults, resulting in reductions in both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia across all ages. Some higher-income countries offer PPV2.
