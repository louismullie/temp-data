## Question

What is the ICD-10 code for hepatocellular carcinoma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the ICD-10 code is for hepatocellular carcinoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative sources that explicitly define HCC in ICD-10. Then, I should verify whether there are any commonly confused alternatives like intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or unspecified liver malignancy. Next, I will check for any regional or modification-specific nuances that could change the code. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, reference-backed answer and note any exceptions or clarifications that might matter in practice.

> Let me first confirm the primary code from high-quality epidemiologic and registry studies. Multiple large cohorts and cancer registries consistently identify hepatocellular carcinoma using ICD-10 code C22.0, often alongside morphology code M8170 for histologic specificity, which reinforces that C22.0 is the correct diagnosis code for HCC in ICD-10 [^1c8fc933] [^1c9e1c90] [^451ec069].

> Wait, let me verify the alternatives so I don't conflate entities. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is coded as C22.1, which is a different primary liver cancer and should not be grouped with HCC. Unspecified primary liver malignancy falls under C22.9, and other specified carcinomas of liver are C22.7, so using those would be imprecise if the intent is specifically HCC [^3d3822f4] [^09dcb02b].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any modifications change this. The Australian ICD-10-AM validation work also treats hepatocellular carcinoma with C22.0 and reports high positive predictive value for this code, supporting that C22.0 is appropriate across ICD-10 variants used in administrative datasets, including ICD-10-AM [^9507c31b].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing any edge cases. Some studies broaden to C22.8 or C22.9 when morphology is unavailable, but they typically exclude cholangiocarcinoma to improve specificity; this is a sensitivity approach rather than a standard definition, and the most specific and consistent HCC code remains C22.0 when known [^2fee0697] [^9a0dfbf0].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final answer succinctly. The ICD-10 code for hepatocellular carcinoma is C22.0, with optional use of morphology code M8170 when histology is specified; avoid C22.1 for cholangiocarcinoma and C22.7/C22.9 for unspecified liver malignancy unless the subtype is truly unknown [^1c8fc933] [^1c9e1c90] [^3d3822f4].

---

The ICD-10 code for hepatocellular carcinoma is **C22.0** (malignant neoplasm of liver cell carcinoma) [^1c8fc933]. This code is used to document HCC in medical records and billing systems, and is the standard across epidemiologic and clinical studies [^1c9e1c90] [^451ec069]. For specificity, some registries and studies also include the ICD-O morphology code **M8170** for hepatocellular carcinoma [^1c8fc933] [^1c9e1c90].

---

## ICD-10 code for hepatocellular carcinoma

The ICD-10 code for hepatocellular carcinoma is **C22.0**, defined as malignant neoplasm of liver cell carcinoma [^1c8fc933]. This code specifically denotes HCC and distinguishes it from other liver malignancies, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (C22.1) and other specified or unspecified liver cancers (C22.7 and C22.9) [^3d3822f4].

---

## Clinical significance of the ICD-10 code C22.0

The ICD-10 code C22.0 is **essential for accurate documentation, billing, and epidemiological tracking** of HCC. It enables healthcare providers to:

- **Document diagnoses**: Clearly record HCC in patient medical records, ensuring accurate communication among healthcare professionals [^1c8fc933].

- **Facilitate billing**: Enable appropriate reimbursement from insurance companies and healthcare systems [^notfound].

- **Support epidemiological research**: Allow researchers to track incidence, prevalence, and outcomes of HCC across populations [^1c9e1c90] [^451ec069].

---

## Additional ICD-10 codes related to hepatocellular carcinoma

While C22.0 is the primary code for HCC, **additional ICD-10 codes** may be used to specify related conditions or complications:

| **ICD-10 code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| C22.1 | Malignant neoplasm of intrahepatic bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma) |
| C22.2 | Malignant neoplasm of liver, primary, unspecified as to type |
| C22.7 | Other specified carcinomas of liver |
| C22.9 | Malignant neoplasm of liver, unspecified |
| K70.3 | Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver |
| K74.3 | Primary biliary cirrhosis |
| K74.6 | Other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver |

---

These codes are often used in conjunction with C22.0 to provide a **comprehensive clinical picture** of the patient's condition, particularly when HCC arises in the context of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis [^451ec069].

---

## ICD-O morphology code for hepatocellular carcinoma

In addition to the ICD-10 code, the **ICD-O morphology code M8170** is frequently used to specifically identify hepatocellular carcinoma in cancer registries and research studies [^1c8fc933]. This code provides additional specificity regarding the histological type of liver cancer, ensuring accurate classification and analysis of HCC cases [^1c9e1c90].

---

## Clinical documentation and coding practices

Accurate clinical documentation is **critical** for proper coding of HCC. Healthcare providers should ensure that the diagnosis of HCC is clearly documented in the patient's medical record, including:

- **Histological confirmation**: Whenever possible, document histological confirmation of HCC to support the use of specific ICD-10 and ICD-O codes [^a6b2b319].

- **Underlying liver disease**: Document any underlying liver conditions, such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis, as these may influence treatment decisions and coding practices [^451ec069].

- **Complications**: Document any complications or comorbidities related to HCC, as these may require additional ICD-10 codes for accurate representation of the patient's condition [^566120a2].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10 code for hepatocellular carcinoma is **C22.0**, with the ICD-O morphology code M8170 providing additional specificity. Accurate documentation and coding of HCC are essential for clinical care, billing, and epidemiological research, enabling healthcare providers to effectively manage and track this significant global health burden [^1c8fc933] [^1c9e1c90] [^451ec069].

Introduction

International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) codes stored in large health system databases are increasingly used in epidemiological studies and health services research to explore the burden of cirrhosis and its complications. These data can provide valuable information about the distribution and determinants of chronic liver disease to guide delivery of health services and strategies to improve health outcomes. However, the utility of ICD codes relies on the accuracy of clinical reporting and administrative coding, which may be influenced by country-specific codes and coding rules, or changes in codes during ICD revisions.

The 9th revision of the ICD (ICD-9) and, more recently, selected ICD-10 codes for cirrhosis and related complications have been validated in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative databasesand other US health system databases. ICD code lists generated from these studies have formed the basis for case definition of many clinical and epidemiological studies of cirrhosis and its complications. While the Australian Modification of the ICD-10 (ICD-10-AM) is similar to its parent classification, the ICD-10-AM does not have specific codes for certain common cirrhosis complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatic encephalopathy (HE), which may lead to discrepancies in the reporting of these problems.

The aim of this study was to: (i) evaluate the performance of ICD-10-AM codes to detect the presence of cirrhosis and a subset of key complications (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ascites, varices, SBP and HE) in admitted episodes of care for which they are coded; (ii) explore limitations of individual codes to accurately detect cirrhosis and complications and (iii) evaluate (and if needed, revise) an algorithm of ICD-10-AM codes for cirrhosis and related complications to identify admitted episodes of care among patients with known cirrhosis, for the purpose of future large-scale epidemiological research and healthcare studies.

### The global, regional, and national burden of cirrhosis by cause in 195 countries and territories, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017 [^8a146b92]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Overview

This study is part of GBD 2017, which was a systematic effort to estimate the levels and trends of burden caused by 359 diseases and injuries by sex, age, year (1990–2017), and location, including seven super-regions, 21 regions, and 195 countries and territories. We modelled the mortality and prevalence of cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, hereafter collectively referred to as cirrhosis. We report numbers and age-standardised and age-specific rates for mortality, prevalence, and DALYs, which are the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death and years lived with disability (YLDs). This study is compliant with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting.

We considered diagnoses coded as B18 and K70–77 in the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) to be compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. ICD-10 codes B18.0–18.2 were mapped to chronic viral hepatitis B and C in the GBD cause list, B18.8 and 18.9 to other causes, K70 to alcohol-related liver disease, K75.81 to NASH, and the rest of the codes to the category of other causes, which included but was not limited to autoimmune hepatitis (K75.4). The detailed list of ICD-10 codes mapped to the GBD cause list is reported in the appendix (p 4). The causes grouped in the "other chronic liver diseases" category mainly included autoimmune hepatitis, toxic liver diseases, other inflammatory liver diseases, chronic hepatitis not specified, and other diseases of the liver (K76). ICD-10 codes for acute hepatitis were not included in this study. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was considered to be a separate entity from compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, and codes for diabetes were also excluded. Finally, deaths caused by hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded because: ICD-10 codes define hepatocellular carcinoma as a cause irrespective of liver cirrhosis; hepatocellular carcinoma can be distinguished from cirrhosis in countries with adequate data; and implications on natural history and management of the two causes are not similar.

Existing evidence shows that ICD-10 coding is valid for defining overall cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases in most of the data sources used to assemble the cause-of-death database but does not have the required accuracy for reporting cirrhosis by the five causes estimated in the current study. The models that we used to split the parent cirrhosis mortality and morbidity into the five causes are described below.

### ICD-10-AM codes for cirrhosis and related complications: key performance considerations for population and healthcare studies [^9507c31b]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Objective

The utility of International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) codes relies on the accuracy of clinical reporting and administrative coding, which may be influenced by country-specific codes and coding rules. This study explores the accuracy and limitations of the Australian Modification of the 10th revision of ICD (ICD-10-AM) to detect the presence of cirrhosis and a subset of key complications for the purpose of future large-scale epidemiological research and healthcare studies.

Design/method

ICD-10-AM codes in a random sample of 540 admitted patient encounters at a major Australian tertiary hospital were compared with data abstracted from patients' medical records by four blinded clinicians. Accuracy of individual codes and grouped combinations was determined by calculating sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value and Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ).

Results

The PPVs for 'grouped cirrhosis' codes (0.96), hepatocellular carcinoma (0.97) ascites (0.97) and 'grouped varices' (0.95) were good (κ all > 0.60). However, codes under-detected the prevalence of cirrhosis, ascites and varices (sensitivity 81.4%, 61.9% and 61.3%, respectively). Overall accuracy was lower for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ('grouped' PPV 0.75; κ 0.73) and the poorest for encephalopathy ('grouped' PPV 0.55; κ 0.21). To optimise detection of cirrhosis-related encounters, an ICD-10-AM code algorithm was constructed and validated in an independent cohort of 116 patients with known cirrhosis.

Conclusion

Multiple ICD-10-AM codes should be considered when using administrative databases to study the burden of cirrhosis and its complications in Australia, to avoid underestimation of the prevalence, morbidity, mortality and related resource utilisation from this burgeoning chronic disease.

Case definition of liver cirrhosis

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) instruction manual permits assignment of an ICD code to the underlying cause of death as noted in a death certificate. Depending on information available on the death certificate, a specific cause of death is assigned, for example, alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, or a more general code can only be assigned, for example, unspecified cirrhosis of the liver. The immediate and intermediate causes of death are attributed to the underlying cause. Consequently, there has been large variation in assignment of ICD codes to liver cirrhosis deaths across the published literature, and no standard definition has been consistently utilized. Based on the GBD2010 Gastrointestinal Diseases expert group recommendations, we included in our definition the following underlying causes of death: liver cirrhosis, chronic viral hepatitis infections and hepatic decompensation events. Table 1 expands on the specific ICD codes used and Additional file 1: Table S1 specifies the fraction of liver cirrhosis deaths under each ICD code. We opted for a broad definition in order to better accommodate differences across ICD revisions, variation in diagnostic accuracy across countries and discrepancies in reporting causes of death in different cultural contexts; for example, purposefully under-reporting deaths due to alcohol-related liver cirrhosis in cultures that prohibit alcohol intake. Deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. While hepatocellular carcinoma generally develops on a background of liver cirrhosis, we elected to keep deaths due to this malignant entity separate for several reasons: 1) ICD rules on coding causes of death assign hepatocellular carcinoma as an underlying cause of death irrespective of the presence or absence of liver cirrhosis; 2) the distinction between liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is possible with minimal misclassification in countries with adequate cause of death data; and 3) the implication on survival and the management of each condition are different.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^d719b817]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: evolving strategies in management and treatment [^09dcb02b]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is the second most frequent primary liver cancer after hepatocellular carcinoma. According to International Classification of Diseases-11 (ICD-11), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is identified by a specific diagnostic code, different with respect to perihilar-CCA or distal-CCA. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma originates from intrahepatic small or large bile ducts including the second-order bile ducts and has a silent presentation that combined with the highly aggressive nature and refractoriness to chemotherapy contributes to the alarming increasing incidence and mortality. Indeed, at the moment of the diagnosis, less than 40% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are suitable of curative surgical therapy, that is so far the only effective treatment. The main goals of clinicians and researchers are to make an early diagnosis, and to carry out molecular characterization to provide the patient with personalized treatment. Unfortunately, these goals are not easily achievable because of the heterogeneity of this tumor from anatomical, molecular, biological, and clinical perspectives. However, recent progress has been made in molecular characterization, surgical treatment, and management of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and, this article deals with these advances.

### Regional variations in hepatocellular carcinoma incidence, routes to diagnosis, treatment and survival in england [^1c8fc933]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data on all patients resident in England diagnosed with HCC (defined as ICD10 C22.0 and the ICDO2 morphology code M8170) between 1st January 2010 and 31 st December 2016 were extracted from the National Cancer Registration Dataset. 60% of diagnoses were based on clinical investigations such as imaging (as recommended for cirrhotic patients in the EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines), 35% were based on pathology, and the remaining 5% were death certificate only or the basis of diagnosis was unknown. The English cancer registry includes all cases of cancer diagnosed and treated in the National Health Service (NHS) in England, which funds 98–99% of all hospital activity, and also some treated privately. The National Cancer Registration Dataset is outlined in detail in Henson et al. but data feeds are extensive and include multidisciplinary teams meetings, hospital activity records, patient administration systems in hospitals, pathology reports, molecular test reports and death certification from the Office for National Statistics. The proportion of cancers identified through death certification alone, a marker of registry quality, is less than 1%. This indicates that the large majority of data relevant to a cancer diagnosis is being captured and hence very high population completeness of the cancer registry.

### Routes to diagnosis for hepatocellular carcinoma patients: predictors and associations with treatment and mortality [^1c9e1c90]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Registry data

Patient-level data on England residents diagnosed with HCC (defined as 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) code C22.0 and the second edition ICD Oncology (ICD-O) morphology code M8170) between 1st January 2006 and 31st December 2017 were extracted from the National Cancer Registration Dataset. The Registration Dataset uses data from a wide range of sources including hospital activity records, multidisciplinary teams meetings, patient administration systems, pathology reports, molecular test reports and death certificates from the Office for National Statistics. It includes all cases of cancer diagnosed and treated in the National Health Service (NHS) in England (which funds 98–99% of all hospital activity), as well as some treated privately. A marker of registration quality is the proportion of cancers identified through death certification alone. In the English National Cancer Registration Database this is less than 1%, indicating that the vast majority of data relevant to a cancer diagnosis is being captured and the cancer registry has very high population completeness.

If a patient had two HCC tumours diagnosed during the study period, only the first tumour was included. Only patients aged 20 or over were included, due to rare aetiologies and subtypes of HCC in young people (47 aged < 20 years excluded). HCC diagnoses were based on clinical investigations (imaging) in 60% of cases (as recommended for cirrhotic patients by EASL), pathology in 35% of cases, and death certificate only or unknown in the remaining 5%. Data extracted included diagnosis date, death date, vital status (alive/dead/emigrated), date of last vital status (follow-up to 02/03/2020), age at diagnosis, gender, ethnicity (broad groups) and Charlson comorbidity score (categorical: no known comorbidities, 1, 2, 3 or more) and index of multiple (IMD) deprivation quintile (depending on year of diagnosis, income domains 2007, 2010, 2015, or 2019 as measured for each lower super output area (administrative areas of approximately 400–1200 households) was used, linked via patient postal address code at diagnosis). Data on these variables was complete except for 3 people in which a Charlson score had not been derived.

### Development and assessment of a new framework for disease surveillance, prediction, and risk adjustment: the diagnostic items classification system [^db9dd258]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

The DXIs were developed by augmenting the May 2020 (version 2020.3) AHRQ CCSR classification system because it comprehensively mapped all ICD-10-CM codes and had more categories (540) than the HHS-HCC, which recognized only 14% of all diagnoses (9757 diagnosis codes) and used only 127 categories for prediction. Furthermore, the HHS-HCC sample frequencies and rationale for disease category inclusion or exclusion were not publicly available. The HHS-HCC model embedded clinical judgment about which diagnoses are appropriate to use for payment, which may not be the correct approach for other uses. Its fixed set of hierarchies and coarse set of diagnostic groups may do poorly in predicting other outcomes, such as quality measures used for performance assessment or benchmarking.

Methods

Study design and data source

The main data source of this population-based unmatched case control study was the 2008–2018 National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The NHIRD contains health care data of 99% of the population of Taiwan and includes comprehensive claims and enrollment information, including demographic data, dates of clinical visits and admission, diagnostic codes, and prescription details. NHIRD used the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to record diagnoses prior to January 2016 and used the 10th Revision (ICD-10-CM) thereafter.

### Cost of hepatocellular carcinoma to the national health service in england: a registry-based analysis [^451ec069]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Methods

A retrospective descriptive data analysis of resource use was undertaken for patients aged ≥ 18 years and diagnosed with HCC in England, defined as International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICDO) code 8170 (HCC); or an ICD10 code C220 (liver cell carcinoma) and either an ICDO code 8000 (neoplasm, malignant), 8001 (Tumour cells, malignant) or 8010 (carcinoma, NOS), recorded in the National Cancer Registration Dataset between 2010 and 2016.

The National Cancer Registration Dataset contains patient, tumour, treatment information and route to diagnosis and is a subset of the COSD, linking to treatment data including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The National Cancer Registration Dataset is linked to HES, which records inpatient admissions, outpatient appointments and accident and emergency attendances. These data were used to describe the resource use at a patient level for secondary and tertiary care, primary care is not reported in these datasets. A NHS England perspective was taken for the analysis.

Date of diagnosis was assigned in the registry using the European Network of Cancer Registries rules. This date can be reassigned within 3 months of the initial assignment if a higher priority event occurs, such as initial diagnosis by imaging and subsequent histological diagnosis, although this should not be later than the date of initial treatment. Therefore, resource use 90 days prior to diagnosis was captured to account for any HCC-related events in the lead up to registry date of diagnosis. All diagnosis codes were requested as part of the dataset including those related to the liver. Recognising that the majority of patients with HCC would have significant underlying liver damage and that the codes were not specific enough to separate resource use for HCC from that due to underlying cirrhosis, it was agreed with the HCC-UK research team that patients with HCC should be stratified by their cirrhosis status, defined using the algorithm developed by Driver et al. Patients were designated as having compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis or non-cirrhotic or with unknown cirrhosis status.

Given that 2-year survival for people with HCC is less than 34%, a 2-year follow-up period (to 31 December 2018) was assumed sufficient to capture most HCC treatments. Survival time was calculated from date of diagnosis to death (event) or to the end of the 2-year follow-up period (censored alive) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Median survival, SE and 95% CIs were calculated. Survival was stratified by cirrhosis status and the difference in survival between groups was tested using the Breslow (generalised Wilcoxon) test.

Clinical Review

We used clinical review to explore potential reasons for large changes at the time of transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM for diabetes-, cardiac-, and pregnancy-related conditions in the examined classification systems. For each HHS-HCC and AHRQ-CCS condition category with a statistically significant change of 20% or more in prevalence level or trend that was selected for clinical review, we examined frequencies of individual ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnoses before and after the ICD-10-CM transition. We also reviewed guidance documents for hospital coding staff regarding changes in coding practices related to the ICD-10-CM transition for these diagnostic categories.

Epidemiology and prevention — incidence and mortality — primary liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths both worldwide and in the United States as of 2020, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer, accounting for 75% – 86% of cases. Men are affected approximately two to three times more than women. In the United States, HCC incidence and mortality rates increased from 1970 to 2010, but incidence began to decrease in 2011 and mortality plateaued in 2013, with one study showing a subsequent ~3% decrease per year.

Follow-up and ascertainment of incident cirrhosis and HCC

To ascertain the incidence of end-stage liver diseases (cirrhosis and HCC) and vital status from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2019, we used computerized data linkage using 3 nationwide registries: the National Health Insurance database, the National Cancer Registration Profiles, and the National Death Certification system, which cover nearly 100% of the Taiwanese population. These comprehensive registries, established by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan, provide complete and accurate administrative and claims data, making them ideal for biomedical research. For cirrhosis diagnosis, we used the National Health Insurance database, identifying patients meeting at least 1 hospital admission code or with 2 or more outpatient visits. The date of first hospital admission or outpatient visit served as incident event date. We used the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 571.2 and 571.5 and ICD-10 codes K70.2, K70.3, and K74 to identify cirrhosis events. To detect HCC occurrence and diagnostic dates, we conducted computerized data linkage with the National Cancer Registry, identifying HCC using ICD-9 codes 155.0 and 155.2 and ICD-10 code C22 (but excluded C22.1).

### Positive predictive value of international classification of diseases, 10th revision, codes for cirrhosis and its related complications [^7a9e696f]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Large administrative databases using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes are useful for epidemiologic, health services, and outcomes research. 1,2 However, coding accuracy of disease conditions could be a limiting factor. Cirrhosis prevalence is increasing because of an aging hepatitis C cohort and an increase in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. 3 We previously examined the validity of ICD, 9th revision (ICD-9), codes for cirrhosis in US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative databases. 4,5 This work has formed the basis for many clinical, epidemiologic, and health services research studies. However, with transition from the ICD-9 to ICD, 10th revision (ICD-10), coding system, it is important to determine the validity of these new cirrhosis codes in administrative databases. Although the greater number of codes in the ICD-10 system may be associated with greater specificity and coding accuracy than with the ICD-9 system, this hypothesis remains untested.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

Background: The HCC-UK/NCRAS partnership was created in 2017 to facilitate a wide programme of research relating to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using data available within the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS). NCRAS data includes tumour- and patient-specific variables, diagnosis and treatment information. These individual-level data are linked to multiple datasets including Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES). Aim: The partnership programme is examining the epidemiology of HCC in England, including regional variation in incidence, routes to diagnosis, treatment and survival, as well as the economic burden.

Method: HCC cases were identified using ICD10-O-2 code C22.0 and morphology code M8170. Demographic characteristics were explored and European age-standardised incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 person years calculated. Linked HES codes were used to identify the presence and severity of cirrhosis.

Results: 62,135 primary liver cancer cases were diagnosed in England between 1997 and 2016. 29,906 of these were HCC. For HCC the mean age at diagnosis was 68.4 years and the male to female ratio was 3.4. Overall 25% of all HCC cases were from the most deprived population quintile. 58% of HCC cases were identified as having cirrhosis and, of these, 42% had decompensated cirrhosis, through linked HES data. The majority of HCC patients did not receive specific anticancer treatment. The two most common Routes to Diagnosis were emergency presentation (35%) and GP referral (30%).

Conclusion: HCC incidence and mortality have tripled over the last 20 years; the most deprived individuals are most at risk. HCC is often associated with cirrhosis and more than one in five individuals diagnosed with HCC has advanced cirrhosis such that treatment options for HCC are severely limited. These trends highlight the urgent need to address prevention strategies for both liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma specifically at regional and population level.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^db3b6dae]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Our findings have important implications for interpreting differences in billing-code-derived disease prevalence over time. For epidemiology, it is critical to distinguish between changes in actual disease prevalence and changes in coding behaviors and mappings, which are often responsible for observed changes in coded prevalence. We have seen that 3 separate, widely used classification systems made different distinctions that affected apparent diagnostic category prevalence. Given that HHS payment formulas rely on the prevalence of HCC categories to set billions of dollars in payments, our finding of many large (artifactual) changes in diagnostic category prevalence has potentially large implications for reimbursement.

Although HHS-HCCs are used for the ACA's marketplace risk adjustment payments, this study did not examine financial outcomes. Because the ACA uses risk adjustment to reallocate the available funds among plans in a given region rather than to decide on the size of the funds available (as is done in Medicare Advantage and Part D), changes in diagnostic category prevalence may have had less financial effect in the marketplace than in Medicare Advantage. Classifications used for bonus or performance evaluation are also vulnerable to large changes in level or trend when preexisting ICD-9-CM –derived formulas are used across the ICD-10-CM transition. In addition, claims-based analyses of disease prevalence may also be misleading if changes in the underlying classification system are not recognized.

Our study used the earliest mappings accommodating all valid 2017 diagnoses for the included classification systems. In 2019, the WHO, HHS, and AHRQ released new classification systems with expanded diagnostic categories designed for 2019 diagnoses. Future research will need to examine changes under these new systems. In the meantime, it is important to understand the current mappings that will continue to be used to set payments and evaluate performance for several more years.

### Trends in burden of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma by underlying liver disease in US veterans, 2001–2013 [^0e39526b]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are predicted to increase in the United States but the accuracy of prior forecasts and the contributions from various liver disease etiologies remain unclear. We aimed to determine the burden of cirrhosis and HCC according to underlying cause from 2001 to 2013.

Methods

We developed a national retrospective cohort of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with the diagnosis of cirrhosis (n = 129,998) or HCC (n = 21,326) from 2001 to 2013. We used laboratory results, International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition (ICD-9) codes, and body mass index to identify underlying etiologies.

Results

In 2013, VA provided care to 5,720,614 individuals, of whom 60,553 (1.06%) had cirrhosis and 7,670 (0.13%) had HCC. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was present in an increasing proportion of cirrhosis and HCC between 2001 and 2013, reaching 48% of cirrhosis cases and deaths and 67% of HCC cases and deaths by 2013. Cirrhosis prevalence nearly doubled from 2001 to 2013 (664 to 1058 per 100,000 enrollees), driven by HCV and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Cirrhosis incidence ranged from 159 to 193 per 100,000 patient-years. Deaths in patients with cirrhosis increased from 83 to 126 per 100,000 patient-years, largely driven by HCV. HCC incidence was 2.5-fold increased from 17 to 45 per 100,000 patient-years. HCC mortality tripled from 13 to 37 per 100,000 patient-years, driven overwhelmingly by HCV, with much smaller contributions from NAFLD and alcoholic liver disease.

Conclusions

Cirrhosis prevalence and mortality and HCC incidence and mortality increased from 2001 to 2013, driven by HCV, with a smaller contribution from NAFLD. If current trends continue, cirrhosis prevalence will peak in 2021. Health care systems will need to accommodate rising numbers of patients with cirrhosis and HCC.

### Mortality due to cirrhosis and liver cancer in the United States, 1999–2016: observational study [^249a17d5]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data were obtained from the CDC WONDER platform (see supplemental material for more details). Our primary aim was to describe temporal trends in death rates attributable to cirrhosis (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes K70.3, K74.5, and K74.6) and hepatocellular carcinoma (C22.0) as the primary or underlying cause of death for adults in the USA. We adjusted rates for age — that is, age specific mortality was weighted according to the age distribution in a standard year (2000). We also sought to describe how these trends differed based on demographic subgroups; age, sex, race (Asian or Pacific Islander, Native American (designated as "American Indian" in the census database) or Alaska Native, black or African American, and white American), Hispanic ethnicity, and geographic area of residence. We also aimed to describe trends in causes of death related to specific complications associated with cirrhosis. Specifically, we examined death due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage (ICD-10 K25-K28, K92.0-K92.2, I85.0), peritonitis (K65), sepsis (A41), hepatorenal syndrome (K76.7), and traumas (V01-Y89). Given the association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and complications of the metabolic syndrome such as cerebrovascular disease and ischemic heart disease (I20-I25, I60-I69), we evaluated trends in mortality due to cirrhosis comorbid with these conditions. We also compared trends in deaths due to alcohol use disorder (F10).

### Risk score for hepatocellular cancer in adults without viral hepatitis or cirrhosis [^9a0dfbf0]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

For implementation of the model, we translated regression output into a single risk score used for subsequent analyses. For each variable, we multiplied regression coefficients by each patient's individual values and then summed to create a linear predictor (Xbeta in SAS). Next, we scaled to 0 to 100 by dividing each patient's Xbeta by the difference of highest and lowest values across all patients in the development sample. We estimated incidence by using the risk score in a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Observed event rates as a function of score were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. For each 5-point interval of score, we calculated HCC incidence with 95% CI. We compared plots of HCC incidence with HCC risk score at 1, 5, and 10 years in the development and validation samples. Satisfied with the concordance, we used the full sample to assess equality of performance (fairness) in subgroups (age < 65 years or ≥ 65 years; females or males; Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, or non-Hispanic White; FIB-4 level; diabetes status; smoking status; alcohol use; and BMI). We compared performance characteristics of the HCC risk score with those of FIB-4 threshold of 3.25.

We conducted 4 sensitivity analyses. Because the extent of missing AUDIT-C scores was much higher in 2008 than in other years, we reran the risk score model, excluding index visits in 2008. We also reran the model that restricted to AUDIT-C scores within 1 year of the index visit and to BMI within 1 year to account for any missingness more proximate to the baseline visit. Additionally, we expanded the outcome to include malignant neoplasm of liver, which was not specified as primary or secondary (ICD-9 or ICD-10-CM codes 155.2 and C22.9) and other specified carcinomas of liver (ICD-10-CM code C22.7).

### Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma and survival in patients with cirrhosis after hepatitis C virus cure [^90bbc8ea]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes of this study were incident HCC (measured in the total sample) and survival after diagnosis of HCC. The index date was the date of first DAA prescription that was followed by a negative HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction test 12 weeks after therapy completion. Patients were followed up for incident HCC and death beginning 1 year from the index date. Patients who did not develop HCC or die were censored at their last follow-up or on December 31, 2022, whichever came first. Incident HCC was defined using 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient ICD-9-CM and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) primary or secondary diagnosis codes for malignant neoplasm of the liver or liver cell carcinoma (ICD9-CM, 155.0 and 155.2; ICD10-CM, C22.0) with no ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM codes for cholangiocarcinoma (ICD-9-CM, 155.1; ICD-10-CM, C22.1). These codes have a positive predictive value of 78.2% for confirmed HCC in VA data. All-cause mortality and date of death were ascertained using the VA Vital Status Master File.

Cancer stage at HCC diagnosis was defined using the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual, which classifies liver cancers by stage groupings from I (least advanced) to IV (most advanced). In patients with HCC, multifocal disease and microvascular invasion (characteristics of AJCC stage II disease) are poor prognostic markers. Therefore, stage at diagnosis was categorized as early (AJCC stage I) vs all other stages.

The first HCC-directed treatment received (defined as surgical resection, ablation, embolization, radiation, or systemic or supportive therapy) was classified using VA data tables as described previously (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Resection and ablation are potentially curative therapies for HCC.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^32577e99]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

In the US, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been the most rapidly increasing cancer since 1980, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is expected to soon become the leading cause of HCC.

Objective

To develop a prediction model for HCC incidence in a cohort of patients with MASLD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prognostic study was conducted among patients aged at least 18 years with MASLD, identified using diagnosis of MASLD using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes; natural language processing of radiology imaging report text, which identified patients who had imaging evidence of MASLD but had not been formally diagnosed; or the Dallas Steatosis Index, a risk equation that identifies individuals likely to have MASLD with good precision. Patients were enrolled from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated health delivery system with more than 4.6 million members, with study entry between January 2009 and December 2018, and follow-up until HCC development, death, or study termination on September 30, 2021. Statistical analysis was performed during February 2023 and January 2024.

Exposure

Data were extracted from the electronic health record and included 18 routinely measured factors associated with MASLD.

Main Outcome and Measures

The cohort was split (70:30) into derivation and internal validation sets; extreme gradient boosting was used to model HCC incidence. HCC risk was divided into 3 categories, with the cumulative estimated probability of HCC 0.05% or less classified as low risk; 0.05% to 0.09%, medium risk; and 0.1% or greater, high risk.

Results

A total of 1 811 461 patients (median age [IQR] at baseline, 52 [41–63] years; 982 300 [54.2%] female) participated in the study. During a median (range) follow-up of 9.3 (5.8–12.4) years, 946 patients developed HCC, for an incidence rate of 0.065 per 1000 person-years. The model achieved an area under the curve of 0.899 (95% CI, 0.882–0.916) in the validation set. At the medium-risk threshold, the model had a sensitivity of 87.5%, specificity of 81.4%, and a number needed to screen of 406. At the high-risk threshold, the model had a sensitivity of 78.4%, a specificity of 90.1%, and a number needed to screen of 241.

Conclusions and Relevance

This prognostic study of more than 1.8 million patients with MASLD used electronic health record data to develop a prediction model to discriminate between individuals with and without incident HCC with good precision. This model could serve as a starting point to identify patients with MASLD who may need intervention and/or HCC surveillance.

### Do patients with NASH-related cirrhosis have better overall survival compared with other etiologies of cirrhosis? A population-based study [^deb49b6e]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Goals and Background

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of cirrhosis. We aim to explore the clinical outcomes of NASH cirrhosis compared with other etiologies of cirrhosis.

Methods

We utilized an EHR-based database (TriNetX) to study the outcomes of NASH cirrhosis. Patients diagnosed with NAFLD or NASH and cirrhosis between January 2016 and December 2019 were identified utilizing appropriate ICD-10-CM codes. The primary outcome was 3-year overall survival. Secondary outcomes were decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation. The Control group was patients with other etiologies of cirrhosis than NASH. Study and control groups were matched for demographic characters and comorbidities using propensity score matching.

Results

We identified 45,063 patients with NASH cirrhosis. The NASH cirrhosis cohort comprised older (61 vs. 59 y) White (78% vs. 64%) women (58% vs. 38%) with more comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, obesity, ischemic heart disease, history of cancer, chronic kidney disease). After propensity score matching, patients with NASH cirrhosis had a better 3-year survival (78% vs. 74%, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.77–0.82) compared with patients with non-NASH cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed less commonly in patients with NASH cirrhosis (6.7% vs. 10.6%, P < 0.001), and liver transplantation was performed more often for NASH cirrhosis compared with non-NASH cirrhosis [Risk ratio 1.13 (1.08–1.18)].

Conclusions

Patients with NASH cirrhosis probably have better 3-year overall survival than other etiologies of cirrhosis. This is an interesting finding, as patients with NASH are older and have more comorbidities. Improved survival can be partly explained by a higher probability of liver transplantation and improvements in cardiovascular outcomes.

### Late hepatitis C virus diagnosis among patients with newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma: a case-control study [^177c4e1c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Study population

We used the NHI claims files to identify individuals with an initial occurrence of liver cancer (ICD-9-CM codes 155.0, 155.2/ICD-10-CM codes C22.0, C22.2, C22.3, C22.4, C22.7, C22.8, C22.9, Z51.12) from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2018. The eligible participants were divided into two groups based on the amount of time between HCV diagnosis (ICD-9-CM codes V02.62, 070.41, 070.44, 070.51, and 070.54/ ICD-10-CM codes B17.11, B19.21, B18.2, B17.10, B19.20, B18.2, Z22.52) and occurrence of HCC. The late group was defined as having a time lag of 3 years or fewer between HCV diagnosis and HCC diagnosis, including the HCC diagnosis elicited testing and subsequent HCV diagnosis. This indicated delayed diagnosis of HCV infection due to the slow progression nature of HCV. The control group was defined as if individuals were diagnosed with HCV more than 3 years before their HCC diagnosis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using two alternative time cut-offs (2 years and 5 years) in the definitions of late diagnosis of HCV. We identified 14,337 patients with HCC who had been previously diagnosed with HCV. The exclusion criteria included hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, end stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic hepatitis in other disease. After these patients were excluded, we identified 6703 documented clinical diagnoses of HCV-related HCC, 3733 of which were in the late group and 2970 of which were in the control group (Fig. 1).

### Risk score for hepatocellular cancer in adults without viral hepatitis or cirrhosis [^2fee0697]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Primary Outcome

The primary outcome was first HCC diagnosis during follow-up. We defined HCC in 2 ways. First, we used the VA national cancer registry, which records cancers diagnosed or treated within the VA. HCC diagnoses were identified by topography codes (C22.0, liver) and histology codes (8170–8180, HCC) from the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Revision (ICD-O-3). Second, we used ICD-9 or ICD-10-CM codes (155.0, malignant neoplasm of liver, primary; C22.0, liver cell carcinoma; C22.8, malignant neoplasm of liver, primary, unspecified as to type), requiring 1 inpatient diagnosis or more than 1 outpatient diagnosis. Prior to ICD-10-CM, there was no HCC-specific code, so we used nonspecific codes. We increased specificity by requiring the absence of bile duct disease (codes 155.1, intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma; C22.1, malignant neoplasm of intrahepatic bile ducts). We chose these codes based on comparison with the VA cancer registry and extensive review of medical records.

Covariates

We chose variables associated with HCC based on those identified in the literature but routinely available and directly analyzable within EHRs. These variables included age, sex, race and ethnicity, FIB-4, diabetes status, smoking status, alcohol use, and BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, with a BMI of 25–29 indicating overweight and ≥ 30 indicating obesity). Race and ethnicity (recorded in the VA EHR from self-report) was categorized as Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, other (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and multiracial), and unknown. Given that genetic (PNPLA3 gene) sequence variations associated with HCC are prevalent in Hispanic people but less so among White and Black individuals, it is important to include race and ethnicity in risk prediction.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma amongst aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples of Australia [^81401e6c]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Measures

Indigenous status was identified via cancer registry coding and included all cases identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. Patients' residential postcodes were used to determine area-based measures of remoteness of residence (Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA+) score)and socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage (IRSAD score).

The specific aetiology of liver disease/HCC and presence of comorbidities were determined based on recorded primary or other diagnosis, coded using ICD-10-AM (10th edition). As exposures to risk factors are likely to have occurred over decades (e.g. cirrhosis, chronic viral hepatitis, excess alcohol, NAFLD), are inherited (e.g. Wilson's Disease), or may be diagnosed at an earlier time point when patients have compensated liver disease, we considered cases having presumed aetiology if they had the specific ICD codes as primary or other diagnosis in any admission during the study period. As the quality of documentation of ICD codes in elective day case admissions (e.g. for a procedures related to portal hypertension) has been reported to be poor, for comorbidities we considered co-existing conditions in any admission during the year of HCC diagnosis. Comorbidity was measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). All diseases listed in the CCI as primary or other diagnosis were analysed (excluding liver disease and HCC). Alcohol misuse as a cofactor was counted if any relevant ICD-10 codes pertaining to alcohol related disorders were identified from hospital coding. Curative HCC therapies were considered to be transplantation, liver resection or percutaneous ablation. The presence of cirrhosis was confirmed by relevant ICD-10 codes.

### Association of statin use with risk of liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality [^5c74e227]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Exclusion Criteria

Criteria for exclusion from the UKB cohort were missing body mass index (BMI), age, and survival data; HIV (ICD-10 codes B20-B24); or chronic hepatitis (ICD-10 code B18) (Figure). We excluded individuals with any liver disease diagnosis (ICD-10 codes K70, alcohol-associated liver disease; K71, toxic liver disease; K72, hepatic failure, not elsewhere classified; K73, chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified; K74, fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver; K75, other inflammatory liver diseases; K76, other diseases of liver; and K77, liver disorders in diseases classified elsewhere) or HCC (ICD-10 code C22.0) at baseline as well as pathological alcohol consumption (> 60 g/d for men and > 40 g/d for women). Alcohol consumption and quantity were evaluated using a cascading questionnaire. First, it was determined how often alcoholic beverages were consumed. The second question was asked when a choice other than never was given and referred to the amount of alcohol consumed in a day. A drink was evaluated by the UKB as 1 U of alcohol. The third question asked how many alcohol-containing drinks were consumed on a typical day when drinking. Response options included 1 or 2; 3 or 4; 5 or 6; 7, 8, or 9; or 10 or more.

### The association of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis And hepatocellular carcinoma [^4a7d6517]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk patients. This high risk is defined by the presence of cirrhosis. However, HCC due to underlying nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), even without progressing to cirrhosis, is a rising concern. Hence, we aimed to determine the association of HCC with NASH using a large national database.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was performed using the 2012 National Inpatient Sample. The study group was all adult patients' age 18-90years who have a diagnosis of NASH which was identified using the International Classification of Diseases 9th version (ICD-9) codes. The control group included the rest of adult individuals without discharge records of NASH. We identified the diagnosis of HCC in both study and control groups using the ICD-9 codes. We calculated the association between NASH and HCC using univariable and multivariate logistic regression.

Results

Totally, 30712524 hospitalizations were included in our study. This cohort included 218950 patients with NASH (study group) and 30493574 patients without NASH (control group). The study group patients aged 57.3 ± 0.10years (59.4% females) comparing to 54.5 ± 0.11years (57.1% female) in the control group. HCC prevalence in subjects with NASH was 0.50% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.41–0.59] compared to 0.21% (95% CI: 0.20–0.23) in subjects without NASH (P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, smoking, alcohol use, obesity, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, hemochromatosis, HIV, cirrhosis and the modified comorbidity index, subjects with NASH were 60% more likely to have HCC than those without NASH (adjusted odds ratio: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.4–1.9, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Our study showed that NASH patients are 60% more likely to develop HCC compared with patients without NASH. Close monitoring and even periodical surveillance might be needed.

### Comparison of models to predict incident chronic liver disease: a systematic review and external validation in Chinese adults [^10464aec]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Validation cohorts

The models were externally validated according to the TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis) guidelines. Details of the CKB study and methods for external validation are reported in Additional file 1: Method S2.

Model predictors and outcomes

During the external validation stage, we first attempted to match the predictors of the original model with the available variables in CKB. When a direct match could not be achieved, a proxy variable was defined as closely as possible to the original predictor. The measurement and definition of CKB variables are described in detail in Additional file 1: Method S3. If none of the above situations could be achieved, the model was excluded.

All eligible models were classified according to the target population. General population included population-based cohorts with no specific restrictions on CLD risk factors. HBV infected individuals included patients with CHB and individuals with positive serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). HCV infected individuals included patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), individuals with positive serum anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (Anti-HCV Ab), and individuals with positive serum HCV RNA. Patients with NAFLD, diabetes, and individuals with high CLD risk (including diabetes, obesity, and high alcohol consumption) were included.

Outcomes of the prediction models were categorized into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and CLD. HCC was defined by the ICD-10 code C22.0 and C22.9 excluding other subtypes of liver cancer (i.e. intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma, hepatoblastoma). Sensitivity analysis was conducted using different definitions of HCC (ICD-10 code: C22.0 or C22). CLD included advanced liver disease and liver-related mortality, involving liver cirrhosis, NAFLD, and liver fibrosis (ICD-10 code: K70, K72, and K74 alongside other complications of CLD, Additional file 1: Method S4). We selected these ICD-10 codes to define CLD for the following reasons: (1) these are the standard definitions used in large-scale population-based studies including the UK Biobank and CKB and in well-established risk prediction models for CLD; (2) several previous models included in the systematic review did not report the detailed ICD-10 codes so standard definitions need to be applied to improve the generalizability of these models. Based on the prediction time frame, models were further classified into five time intervals: < 5 years, 5 years, 5–10 years, 10 years, and > 10 years.

Patient selection

Patients were included in the study if they (1) had at least one HCC diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] codes: C22.0 and C22.8); (2) initiated at least one systemic therapy option recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Hepatobiliary Cancers after the initial HCC diagnosis and between January 2017 and October 2022; (3) were continuously enrolled during the 6 months prior to the initiation of the 1L systemic therapy; (4) had no diagnosis of other primary cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, other specified carcinomas of liver, and unspecified liver carcinomas) in the 6 months prior to the initiation of the 1L systemic therapy (to ensure HCC-specific treatment); (5) were at least 18 years of age when initiating the 1L systemic therapy; (6) were not enrolled in a clinical trial during the 6 months before the initiation of the 1L systemic therapy (to ensure patients were not treated with investigational agents, as this study focused on the real-world management of HCC); and (7) received cabozantinib monotherapy as the 2L treatment (Figure 1).

Included patients were further divided into the following three cohorts based on their 1L treatments: (1) IO monotherapy or IO + IO combination therapy ("IO mono or IO + IO combo cohort"), (2) IO + non–IO combination therapy ("IO + non–IO combo cohort"), or (3) TKI monotherapy ("TKI mono cohort").

Methods

Data Source

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the largest integrated health care system in the US, equipped with a centralized EHR that contains data from over 1200 care centers, including hospitals, medical centers, and outpatient clinics. We obtained information from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, a repository of nationwide patient-level data from all VA care centers. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic data, including International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes, were extracted for inpatient and outpatient VA visits as well as treatments rendered outside of the VA system and covered by Medicare. Deaths were identified from the Veterans Health Administration Vital Status File, which uses data from the Social Security Administration Death Master File, Medicare Vital Status File, and Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator Subsystem. The VA Connecticut Healthcare System and Yale School of Medicine Institutional Review Boards approved this cohort study and waived the informed consent requirement because the study was based exclusively on data already collected as part of routine medical care. The study was compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. We followed the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis reporting guideline.

We identified all individuals aged 18 to 90 years who were newly prescribed treatment with statins and nonusers between January 2011 and December 2020. Follow-up ended in September 2022. The cohort included 784 397 individuals per group after matching. Clinical variables and death data are directly retrieved from the EHR via an integrated system of clinical records. Individuals had no diagnosis of liver disease (ICD-10 codes K70-K77) or HCC (ICD-10 code C22.0) at baseline.

Medication

Exposure to statins was lagged by 6 months to account for an adequate duration of drug use and possible latency period and to minimize reverse causality. First contact with a statin was defined as an index event. Prescriptions of statins before December 31, 2010, were excluded, so only new users were included.

Exclusion Criteria

Criteria for exclusion from the TriNetX cohort were missing BMI, age, and survival data; HIV infection; liver disease before December 2010; and the use of statins before the index date. Data on alcohol intake were not available. Further methods can be found in the eAppendix in Supplement 1.

Primary and Secondary Outcomes

Primary outcomes of the study were incident liver disease, HCC, and liver-related mortality. Individuals had no preexisting liver disease (ICD-10 codes K70-K77 or C22.0) at baseline examination. We considered any new diagnosis of ICD-10 codes K70 to K77 after baseline as incident liver disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma was defined as C22.0. Liver-related death was defined as death by ICD-10 codes K70 to K77 or C22.0. Secondary outcomes were drug-induced myopathy (ICD-10 code G72.0) and diabetes type 2 (ICD-10 code E11).

### Risks and clinical predictors of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma diagnoses in adults with diagnosed NAFLD: real-world study of 18 million patients in four European cohorts [^e3cdb7de]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study design

We conducted a matched cohort study. All patients with a diagnosis of NAFLD or NASH (termed NAFLD/NASH) prior to 01/01/2016 were identified in the four databases using harmonisation methods previously described. Patients were included in the analysis if they were aged ≥ 18 at diagnosis and had medical records available for ≥ 12 months from registration with the practice. Exclusion criteria were missing information on age and sex, a record of alcohol abuse at any time prior to diagnosis and a history of liver morbidity within the 12 months prior to diagnosis (see Additional file 1: Supplementary Methods for exclusion diagnoses).

Each NAFLD/NASH patient was matched with up to 100 'non-exposed' controls who did not have a NAFLD or NASH diagnosis at or prior to the index date (defined as the date of diagnosis of the matched NAFLD/NASH patient). Matching was done by practice site, age at index date ± 5 years, sex and a visit at the practice within ± 6 months of the index date.

In the THIN and SIDIAP databases, the terminology of the database (Read code and International Classification of Disease version 10, ICD10, respectively) allowed NAFLD and NASH diagnoses to be distinguished from each other. Therefore, in these databases, a matched control cohort was constructed for each of the diagnoses: NAFLD, NASH and, to enable comparison between all databases, NAFLD/NASH. If a patient had both NAFLD and NASH diagnoses recorded, the earliest event was used to define index date of NAFLD/NASH diagnosis, and the NASH diagnosis deemed an incident event. In HSD (ICD 9) and IPCI (IPCI Dutch), where NAFLD and NASH could not be distinguished, only one cohort (NAFLD/NASH) was defined and controls matched to this.

Patients were followed up from the index date until the earliest of occurrence of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or NASH (where this could be identified), end of the study period (31/12/2015) and loss of follow-up due to exit out of the database or death. Events of interest were incident diagnosis of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or NASH, where this could be identified. See Additional file 1: Supplementary Methods for variable extraction and data analysis.

Definitions of primary liver cancer cases

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and for Oncology (ICD-O-2) codes were used to identify primary liver cancer cases (C22). Patients with additional ICD-10 codes (C77–C79, indicating secondary malignant neoplasm) were excluded to ensure that all the included cases were primary liver cancer. There were only a small proportion (< 1%) of cases of hepatoblastoma (C22.2), angiosarcoma of liver (C22.3), and other sarcomas of liver (C22.4), also difficult to group them with other liver cancer subtypes. Therefore, we did not include them in the analysis. We grouped "other specified carcinomas of liver" (C22.7) and "liver, unspecified" (C22.9) together, and thus have three primary liver cancer subtypes in this study, which are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, C22.0 in ICD-10 code, or 817/818 in ICD-O-2 codes), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA, C22.1), and other specified or unspecified liver cancer (C22.7 and C22.9). The case definitions in this study are similar to previous studies. We provide a flowchart visualising the primary care population and how to select primary liver cancer cases (Fig. 1).

### Oral contraceptive use and risk of liver cancer: a population-based study, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^6668fd76]. The Lancet: Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Procedures

Incident liver cancer diagnoses were determined using linkage to NHS cancer registries. Specifically, data were provided from NHS England for participants in England and Wales, and the NHS Central Register for participants in Scotland. Participants contributed follow-up time from date of recruitment until the date of first registration of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer [ICD-10 code C44]), date of death, or last day of follow-up from the cancer registry, whichever came first. The MWS date for end of follow-up was Dec 31, 2020. The UK Biobank dates for end of follow-up were Dec 31, 2020, for participants in England; Nov 30, 2021, for participants in Scotland; and Dec 31, 2016, for participants in Wales. Participants were coded as having a primary event if they had an incident diagnosis of liver cancer (ICD-10 code C22). We only included incident liver cancer cases from the cancer registry and not from death records with no previous record due to potential coding issues (eg, death due to metastatic spread from another primary cancer site coded as death due to liver cancer). If available, liver cancer histological subtypes were determined using ICD-O-3 morphology codes — ie, for hepatocellular carcinoma, codes 8170–8175, and for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, codes 8032–8033, 8041, 8050, 8070–8071, 8140–8141, 8160, 8260, 8480, 8481, and 8490.

### Association of GLP-1 receptor agonists and hepatocellular carcinoma incidence and hepatic decompensation in patients with type 2 diabetes [^1166a714]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cohorts were propensity score matched (1:1 using nearest neighbor greedy matching) for risk factors for HCC, including demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity), adverse socioeconomic determinants of health (housing and economic circumstances, upbringing, education, physical environment, social environment), lifestyle factors (exercise, diet, smoking, alcohol drinking), family history of cancers, genetic susceptibility to cancer, obesity (3 International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] diagnosis codes and 15 body mass index [BMI] categories ranging from BMI 30 to BMI 70 or greater), T2DM complications (10 different categories), hypertension, alcohol use disorders, benign neoplasm of liver, chronic hepatitis, MASLD, MASH, liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis; and procedures including cancer screening, bariatric surgery, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases including disorders of lipoprotein metabolism and other lipidemias, heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and peripheral artery disease; and prior prescription of anti-diabetes medications, aspirin, statins, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics (details in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Two outcomes were examined: first-time diagnosis of HCC (ICD-10 code C22.0 "liver cell carcinoma")and hepatic decompensation events (ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices). Patients were followed for 5 years after the index event or time zero (the prescription of GLP-1RA for the exposure cohort vs the prescription of other non-GLP-1RA anti-diabetes medications for the comparison cohorts that occurred in January 2010 to February 2019). The outcomes were compared between the propensity score matched GLP-1RAs and non-GLP-1RA anti-obesity medications cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied. When the last fact (the outcome of interests, death, or other medical encounters) in the patient's record is in the time window for analysis, the patient was censored on the day after the last fact in the record. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% Cis) were used to describe the relative hazard of the outcomes based on a comparison of time to event rates.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^6464b907]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Deaths from the majority of cancers are falling globally, but the incidence and mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in the United Kingdom and in other Western countries. HCC is a highly fatal cancer, often diagnosed late, with an incidence to mortality ratio that approaches 1. Despite there being a number of treatment options, including those associated with good medium to long-term survival, 5-year survival from HCC in the UK remains below 20%. Sex, ethnicity and deprivation are important demographics for the incidence of, and/or survival from, HCC. These clinical practice guidelines will provide evidence-based advice for the assessment and management of patients with HCC. The clinical and scientific data underpinning the recommendations we make are summarised in detail. Much of the content will have broad relevance, but the treatment algorithms are based on therapies that are available in the UK and have regulatory approval for use in the National Health Service.

### A record-linkage study of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with hepatitis C infection in scotland [^6fd6bd4a]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Additional risk factors identified by previous research as predictors of the development of HCC were coded for each person. These included age (time-dependent: < 50, 50–59 and 60+ years) and reported risk activity leading to infection (injecting drug use (IDU), non-IDU, not known). The non-IDU group included persons who had reported potential acquisition of HCV infection through receipt of blood or blood products, tattoo/body piercing, needlestick injury, sexual contact, or perinatal transmission. Previous hospitalisation for cirrhosis was also assessed by searching the database linkage for mention of non-biliary cirrhosis among the discharges occurring before first mention of HCC, or at any time before 31 December 2006 for those with no admission/death for HCC. Cirrhosis codes comprised alcoholic cirrhosis of liver (ICD-10 K70.3; ICD-9 571.2), cirrhosis of liver without mention of alcohol (ICD-9 571.5), and other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver (ICD-10 K74.6). The occurrence of a previous hospital discharge with mention of HBV (ICD-10 B16, B18.0, B18.1; ICD-9 070.2, 070.3) was similarly noted.

### Risk score for hepatocellular cancer in adults without viral hepatitis or cirrhosis [^f5ef2fef]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is typically detected only at advanced stages when treatment options are limited. Most of the current HCC risk models focus on patients with viral hepatitis or diagnosed cirrhosis or require variables not routinely available in clinical care.

Objective

To identify modifiable HCC risk factors in the general population and to develop a risk score to inform HCC screening and risk-factor modification interventions for high-risk individuals without viral hepatitis or decompensated cirrhosis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study analyzed demographic, clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic health records. Data were divided into development and validation samples. Veterans aged 30 to 95 years were included, and those with hepatitis B or C virus infection, hepatic decompensation, or prevalent HCC were excluded. Patients were followed up until the occurrence of HCC diagnosis, death, or December 31, 2021. A Cox proportional hazards regression model for 10-year risk of HCC was developed and used to create an HCC risk score, and performance in development and validation samples and in patient subgroups was evaluated. One outpatient visit date per person at least 18 months after VA entry, between October 1, 2007, and March 31, 2020, was randomly selected and used as the index date for the start of follow-up. Analyses were performed from March 2023 to May 2024.

Exposures

Age, sex, race and ethnicity, body mass index, liver fibrosis (detected with Fibrosis-4 Index [FIB-4]), diabetes status, smoking status, and alcohol use.

Main Outcomes and Measures

First HCC diagnosis during follow-up. This information was ascertained from VA national cancer registry topography and histology codes and from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes for the inpatient or outpatient visits.

Results

This study of 6 509 288 veterans included 6 048 917 males (92.9%), with a median (IQR) age of 65 (54–74) years, who identified as being of Hispanic (5.3%), non-Hispanic Black (15.0%), non-Hispanic White (68.9%), or other (4.6%) race and ethnicity. Overall, 15 142 patients (0.2%) developed HCC, 69.5% of whom had FIB-4 of 3.25 or lower at baseline. While FIB-4 was the most important variable, age, sex, race and ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes, smoking, and alcohol use were also informative. Discrimination in the development sample was better than FIB-4 alone (C statistic, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.82–0.85] vs 0.79 [95% CI, 0.77–0.80]). The HCC risk score performed consistently well in the validation sample and in all subgroups. A FIB-4 threshold of 3.25 would screen 5.0% of the cohort at a cost of 28 false-positives for every true-positive; a model risk score of 58 would screen 4.7% of the cohort at a cost of 23 false-positives for every true-positive.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this study suggest that a multivariable risk score that uses routinely available clinical data outperforms FIB-4 alone in identifying patients at risk of HCC who do not have viral hepatitis or hepatic decompensation at baseline.

### Primary liver cancer disease burden in Cambodia during 1990–2021: a systematic analysis of datasets from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^17d56287]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources

The GBD 2021 database provides comprehensive data on deaths, DALY, incidence, and prevalence for 369 diseases and injuries in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. This study represents the most detailed and scientific assessment of the global epidemiological burden, leveraging systemic data collection methods such as censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, disease notifications, and health service resources.

To assess the burden of HCC in Cambodia, we retrieved data from the Global Health Data Exchange, including DALY, incidence, incidence, and prevalence rates, along with corresponding 95% uncertainty interval (UI).

The GBD 2021 database, our data source, has a series of strict data filtering and cleaning procedures. The data from various collection methods, such as censuses, household surveys, and disease registries, undergo multiple-level quality control. Outliers are identified through statistical methods and domain-specific knowledge. Extreme values inconsistent with historical trends and population characteristics are flagged. If determined to be errors, they are either corrected or excluded at the database-level. In our study, we did not independently exclude any data points, relying on the quality-controlled data provided by the GBD 2021 database.

Regarding missing data, the GBD 2021 database uses multiple imputation methods. For continuous variables, techniques like multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) are applied, which predict and fill in missing values based on variable relationships. For categorical variables, methods such as hot-deck imputation are used. We did not perform additional imputation in our study as the GBD 2021 database had already addressed missing data. When using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th (codes 155–155.963) and 10th (codes C22.0–22.9) editions to classify HCC cases, the GBD 2021 database has established cross-walk tables and algorithms. These ensure consistency between the two versions by mapping ICD-9 codes to ICD-10 codes. The mapping is based on a comprehensive understanding of disease concepts and is updated regularly to reflect the latest medical knowledge, enabling accurate case classification across the study period. The data used for the risk factor analysis in this study were also sourced from the GBD 2021 database. For more detailed information on the data related to risk factor analysis, please refer to the Global Health Data Exchange.

### A record-linkage study of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with hepatitis C infection in scotland [^6a56a4c0]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

We computed standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for HCC in the HCV-diagnosed population by age, sex, and calendar-year standardising to expected incidence rates derived from all HCC registrations in Scotland during 1996–2004 and the national mid-year population estimates for the same period. All data analyses were carried out using R version 2.4.0.

For each person diagnosed with HCV, the occurrence of at least one alcohol-related hospital episode was coded as a time-dependent variable. This involved searching the linked hospital records for alcohol-related discharges occurring before the date of first mention of HCC, or, for those with no HCC admission/death, at any time before 31 December 2006. The set of alcohol-related diagnosis codes comprised alcohol use (ICD-10 Z72.1), mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (ICD-10 F10; ICD-9: 291, 303, 305), degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (ICD-10 G31.2, G62.1, G72.1, I42.6, K29.2; ICD-9 357.5, 425.5, 535.3), toxic effects of alcohol (ICD-10 T51.0, T51.9; ICD-9 980.0), alcoholic liver disease (ICD-10 K70.1–3; ICD-9 571.0–571.2), alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis (ICD-10 K86.0), evidence of alcohol involvement (ICD-10 Y90-1), finding of alcohol in blood (ICD-10 R78.0; ICD-9 790.3), alcohol rehabilitation (ICD-10 Z50.2), personal history of psychoactive substance abuse (ICD-10 Z86.4; captures non-current mental/behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol), and accidental or intentional self-poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (ICD-10 X45, X65; ICD-9 E860.0, E860.9).

### Mortality trends and racial disparities in hepatocellular carcinoma associated with metabolic syndrome in the United States and Texas: a 21-year analysis (1999–2020) using CDC WONDER database… [^7622532a]. ASCO (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract 525 Background: The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma and metabolic syndrome is increasing globally. This study aims to examine annual trends of mortality in MetS-associated HCC in the United States and its state of Texas, from 1999 to 2020, to evaluate public health initiatives and identify socioeconomic factors. Methods: Mortality trends for adults aged ≥ 25 years with MetS-associated HCC were analyzed using CDC WONDER database, identifying deaths through ICD-10 codes C22. 9 "Liver Malignant neoplasms" and E88. 9 "Metabolic Syndrome". Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates per 100, 000 people were extracted. Annual percent changes in AAMRs, with 95% confidence intervals, were determined across various demographic and geographic subgroups. Results: Between 1999 and 2020, 271, 046 documented deaths were attributed to HCC due to metabolic syndrome.

The AAMR for MetS-related HCC mortality increased in the US from an adjusted rate in 1999 to in 2009, after which it increased to in 2018 and increased to 9. 9 in
2020. In Texas, AAMR for MetS-related HCC mortality increased from AR in 1999 to in 2015 after which it increased to in 2020. Men had consistently higher AAMRs than women. The AAMR in U. S. men increased from in 1999 to in 2020. The AAMR in U. S. women increased from in 1999 to in 2020. The non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native population has the greatest AAMR, followed by the NH Black or African American and the Hispanic or Latino population with AAMR. The low-risk population was NH White with AAMR and NH Asian or Pacific Islander. The AAMR also varied by region and non-metropolitan areas had higher AAMR than metropolitan areas. The states in the upper 90th percentile of MetS-related HCC AAMRs were Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Michigan, Nevada exhibited an approximately two-fold increase in AAMRs, compared to states falling in the lower 10th percentile Nebraska, Wisconsin, Washington, Maine. Conclusions: Mortality rates from hepatocellular carcinoma associated with metabolic syndrome have risen in the United States and Texas over the past two decades. However, significant demographic and geographic disparities in MetS-related HCC mortality continue, emphasizing the need for further investigation and the development of targeted treatment strategies.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^6d87b2f8]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Statistical Tests

We used 2-sided t tests to identify statistically significant changes in level or trend in regression results and F tests to look for the joint significance of level and trend changes. We performed 2 F tests for each diagnostic category: one to test the hypothesis of a straight line with no change in October 2015 (ie, test of linearity), and the other to test whether the predicted diagnostic category prevalence in December 2017 differed from a prediction based on extending the straight line fit to pre– ICD-10-CM data (ie, cumulative effect of changes in level and time trend).

For all tests, we applied the Bonferroni multiple-testing correctionso that P values were considered statistically significant only when they were less than.05 divided by the number of categories in the classification system. For example, in HHS-HCC regressions, statistical significance required P < .0004 (ie,.05/127) for statistical significance in F tests. We considered changes of 20% or more to be large.

Each monthly rate was calculated on more than 18 million individuals, making them extremely precise. However, each statistical test examined changes in time using 96 observations. A significant finding indicates that inclusion of a level or slope change at October 2015 describes the temporal pattern in the observed data better than a straight line.

Data Interpretation and Visualization

To facilitate meaningful comparisons of changes across condition categories with vastly different mean prevalence, we normalized all findings by dividing rates by the mean diagnostic category prevalence from September 2015, the month prior to the ICD-10-CM transition. To visualize patterns of observed changes, we created time series graphs for all diagnostic categories in each classification system. Each graph depicts 3 normalized series: (1) observed diagnostic category prevalence, (2) piecewise linear model predicted prevalence, and (3) locally estimated scatterplot smoothing curves, fit separately to the pretransition and posttransition periods. This last series helps to visualize possible nonlinear trends. While raw (ie, nonnormalized) rates were used for regression modeling and testing, we describe these changes as percentages to focus on their size relative to the base rate in September 2015.

### Epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma [^420326b3]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common histologic type of primary liver cancer, accounting for between 85% and 90% of these malignancies. The overall prognosis of patients with liver cancer is poor, and an understanding of this disease and its risk factors is crucial for screening at-risk individuals, early recognition, and timely diagnosis. Most HCCs arise in the background of chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and chronic excessive alcohol intake. These underlying causes are characterized by marked variations in geography, gender, and other well-documented risk factors, some of which are potentially preventable.

### Risks and clinical predictors of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma diagnoses in adults with diagnosed NAFLD: real-world study of 18 million patients in four European cohorts [^0de8b908]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

This study is subject to limitations. The nature of real-world data is such that we cannot ascertain the origin of codes nor the motivation for adding diagnoses to the patient record. Although the study is based in primary care, it is likely that a large proportion of diagnoses will have been made with some involvement of secondary care. It would be inaccurate to assume that all patients who carry the code 'NASH' have had a liver biopsy and histological assessment and it might be that the diagnosis was assumed and recorded based on, for example, ultrasound evidence of fatty liver and elevated serum transaminases or increased stiffness on transient elastography. Similarly, it was not possible to confirm that the matched controls did not have NAFLD/NASH. However, the clinical features of patients with coded NAFLD/NASH are consistent with the diagnostic codes, although if patients with NAFLD/NASH do exist in the control group then the effect sizes reported here are underestimates of the real risk. This means that there are individuals living with diabetes in primary care who have not been diagnosed with NAFLD/NASH but are at significantly increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis and cancer.

The estimated size of the NAFLD problem has raised fears of large unmanageable patient numbers who are not at immediate threat of disease. Notwithstanding our expectation that many cases have not been identified in this study, we have shown that 0.6% of patients with an existing coded diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH acquire a diagnosis of cirrhosis and/or HCC within a 3-year follow-up period. This gives us insight into the rate at which advanced disease is discovered, even if this is not the natural history in the general population. The clinical impact of our data is that they highlight the large gaps in diagnosis and risk assessment of NAFLD and NASH with variable rates of risk stratification, staging of disease and seemingly late diagnosis.

### Routes to diagnosis for hepatocellular carcinoma patients: predictors and associations with treatment and mortality [^dcd4fb7b]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This study used a population-based dataset including the vast majority of HCC cases diagnosed and treated in England. The results are therefore representative of and generalisable to the population. 12 years of data were included which allowed examination of differences over time. The sample size was large (n = 23,555), despite liver cancer being classified as a rare cancer. RtD is a well-established metric derived from linked routinely-collected population-based datasets. We were able to examine associations of RtD with a wide range of factors known to cause variation in mortality available within and derived from the high-quality National Cancer Registration Dataset. We present a novel method for identification of primary liver cancer from HES codes, validated by comparison with PLD from clinical records.

There are limitations. As data was not collected specifically for the purpose of this study, in common with other observation studies based on routine data, some variables that would have been informative were not available in the dataset. In particular, Barcelona liver cancer stage or variables to derive this (TNM stage, Child-Pugh liver function and ECOG performance status) were not available for the majority of cases. Some important liver cancer risk factors such as BMI, smoking and alcohol consumption, or indicators of liver function, were not available. In our study, underlying cause of primary liver cancer, comorbidity score, and cirrhosis stage were inferred from HES codes, which are dependent on hospital admissions and accurate coding practices. PLD and cirrhosis status were not derivable for around 40% of patients, and it was not possible to know if this was true absence of a PLD or just absence of a code. Furthermore, we used data to identify underlying PLD both before and after the diagnosis of HCC. This was done to improve classification recognising that this is an understudied area, but there is the risk of bias through differential misclassification by RtD. Liver surveillance status was unknown. The deprivation measure used was based on area of residence, therefore there may be residual confounding by socioeconomic status. There were insufficient numbers of inpatient presentations to assess associations with this RtD metric. In addition, we were unable to use cause of death to identify cancer-related death due to the propensity to assign deaths in people with HCC as cancer-related although many would have been due to complications of cirrhosis (77% of deaths were attributed to C220 in our cohort).

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^3f880b19]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

The analytic sample contained information on 2.1 billion enrollee person-months with 3.4 billion clinically assigned diagnoses; the mean (range) monthly sample size was 22.1 (18.4 to 27.1) million individuals. The transition from ICD-9-CM was effectively instantaneous, with 99.8% of all diagnoses coded using ICD-10-CM in October 2015.

We examined study population characteristics by month from 2010 through 2017 to look for changes that might have introduced trend artifacts (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Although the number of eligible enrollees varied by year, population characteristics remained nearly constant across all months. In particular, no noteworthy changes in the number of eligible enrollees, mean age, sex, health insurance plan type, or fraction of enrollees located in California occurred at the October 2015 transition to ICD-10-CM. The proportion of enrollees with at least 1 eligible diagnosis in a month was consistent over the sample period.

Table 1 summarizes overall findings on changes in diagnostic category prevalence rates within each classification system. No large changes were observed in the WHO chapters, suggesting that overall coding practice (and population health) was relatively stable across the transition. However, the F test rejects simple linearity in favor of a model with a discontinuity in slope or trend for 11 of 17 WHO chapters (58%), identifying small changes at the ICD-10-CM transition but none that approached the threshold that we considered large (ie, ≥ 20%).

Outcomes

Primary Outcomes

HCC cases were identified using 2 methods. First, we used the VA Central Cancer Registry (VACCR), which constitutes a national repository of all cancer cases within the VHA since 1995. In the VACCR, each case is validated by a manual record abstraction using the North American Association for Central Cancer Registries standards with more than 90% accuracy. Second, we used ICD-9 and ICD-10 32 codes if they occurred twice in the patient's outpatient medical records, which has been well validated with positive estimated values of 84% to 94%. To assess the accuracy of the VACCR, we identified 40 cases and confirmed the diagnosis by conducting a manual record abstraction at GLAHCS. Of the 40 patients selected in the VACCR at GLAHCS, 90% were correctly identified, as confirmed by manual record abstraction of hepatology, gastroenterology, or oncology clinical notes. Using the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, we identified 3469 veterans with HCC. Of those, we explored 31 cases, and HCC was correctly identified in 74% of the cases. We found that most incorrectly identified cases were secondary malignant neoplasms to the liver from other primary cancers, mostly of gastrointestinal origin (67% of the cases). To enrich cases with HCC using the ICD-9 and ICD-10 algorithm, we identified all gastrointestinal cancer malignant neoplasms using ICD-9 and ICD-10 (eTable 3 in Supplement 1) and removed them from the HCCs.

Secondary Outcomes

To identify death outcomes, we linked the VA CDW cohort to the VA-Department of Defense Mortality Data Repository (MDR), which provides reliable and quality-controlled data for death in veterans and a sensitivity of more than 90%. Next, we cross-referenced the death date from the VACCR, CDW, and MDR. We defined death outcomes as in MDR death file, in CDW death (if the date was between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2019), or in VACCR death data. All death dates were between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2019, with the latter date used as a censor date. Liver transplantation (LT) was identified using validated ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

### Hepatocellular carcinoma: trends of incidence and survival in Europe and the United States at the end of the 20th century [^efe19484]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is large geographic variation in incidence levels and time trends of hepatocellular carcinoma. We compared population-based liver cancer incidence and survival in European and U.S. populations in order to elucidate geographic differences and time trends for these variables.

Methods

Since comparisons based on cancer registry data are problematic because of variations in liver cancer definition and coding, we considered a subset of cases likely to be mainly hepatocellular carcinoma, suitable for international comparison. Incidence and 5-yr relative survival were calculated from cases diagnosed in five European regions (30,423 cases) and the United States (6,976 cases) in 1982–1994.

Results

Age-standardized incidence was highest in southern Europe (12/100,000 in men and 3/100,000 in women in 1992–94) and lowest in northern Europe, where incidence was similar to that of the United States (3/100,000 in men, < 1/100,000 in women). Over the study period, incidence remained stable in the United States and most of Europe, except for a notable increase in southern Europe. Five-year relative survival was < 10% in Europe, ranging from 8% (southern Europe) to 5% (eastern Europe), and 6% in the United States. Survival increased slightly with time, mainly in southern Europe and was unaffected by sex, but was better in younger patients.

Conclusions

Increasing incidence in southern Europe is probably related to hepatitis B and C infection and increasing alcohol intake, while improving survival may be due to greater surveillance for cirrhosis. The survival gap between clinical and population-based series suggests management is better in centers of excellence.

- 2016 Issue 1; Ask the Editor. Biliary Obstruction due to Hepatocellular Malignancy A 69-year-old patient with nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, status post radioembolization, presented with two weeks of progressive hyperbilirubinemia. He underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which revealed biliary obstruction from HCC progression. The provider performed biliary sphincterotomy and insertion of biliary stent into the common bile duct. There is confusion as to whether it is appropriate to sequence the carcinoma as the principal diagnosis, since it is the underlying cause of the obstruction, or whether the obstruction is sequenced as the principal diagnosis, since it was the reason for the admission, and no treatment was directed to the carcinoma. What is the correct sequencing of the biliary obstruction and the hepatocellular carcinoma for this encounter.

Measurements

The exposure was statin use. We identified all lipophilic statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and cerivastatin) and hydrophilic statins (rosuvastatin and pravastatin) prescription code in the K-NHIS database after the index visit. We performed an intention to treat analysis. Subjects were assigned into a statin user group if the prescription was at least one day.

The primary endpoint was development of HCC during follow-up. HCC was defined as the presence of cancer-specific insurance claim code (V193 code) with a C22.0 code which was an ICD-10 code for HCC. Secondary endpoints were liver cancer or liver-related mortality, defined by presence of C22, B15-19, K70-75 codes in the death certificate, and all-cause mortality. In addition, we defined extrahepatic cancer-related mortality when the cause of mortality was cancer other than liver cancer (C code except for C22). Cardiovascular disease-related mortality was defined when the cause of mortality was cardiovascular diseases by following ICD-10 codes (I69, I63, I62, I61, I60, I50, I48, I46, I35, I34, I26, I25, I21, I20, I11, I10). Vital status and cause of death were obtained from death certification collected by Statistics Korea, part of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance of South Korea.

For covariates, the following information were collected: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), drinking status, smoking status, physical activity per week, laboratory variables (serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT]), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, hypertension (ICD-10 codes: I10-13, I15), diabetes (ICD-10 codes: E11-14), and concomitant medications. For concomitant medication, information on other lipid lowering drugs (e.g. fibrate), calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blocker, warfarin, aspirin, and anti-HBV medication were collected. Concomitant medications were defined if the patient had prescription identified based on Korean Drug and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Codes for the medication at 90 days prior to the index date.

### Changes in antiviral treatment rate for hepatitis B virus before hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis: a nationwide Korean study [^9656d865]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Study population and operational definition

HCC was defined when patients were assigned both the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 code C220 and the rare incurable disease code V193, which designates cancer. Among the patients diagnosed with HCC, we classified them as having etiological chronic liver diseases [HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)], when the ICD-10 code for the disease or prescription for its treatment was assigned in the year of the HCC diagnosis date (index date) or within 1 year before or after that year (3 years). When multiple etiologic diseases were present, patients were classified into the higher-ranked condition in the following order: HBV, HCV, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and others. Patients with HBV were identified by the presence of the disease codes Z22.51, B18.0, B18.1, B18.10, or B18.18 or by having received a prescription for AVT to control HBV. The AVTs included lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, tenofovir alafenamide, tenofovir fumarate, telbivudine, clevudine, and besifovir. Operational definitions for other diseases are described in Supplementary Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content 1.

Patients with AVT before HCC diagnosis were defined as those who received the above AVTs for HBV more than 90 days before HCC diagnosis. Patients who did not receive AVT at the time of HCC diagnosis were categorized into two groups. The first group was comprised of patients who subsequently started AVT after their diagnosis and were referred to as the 'posttreated group'. The second group consisted of patients who did not receive AVT throughout their lifetime and were referred to as the 'never-treated group'. Patients who started AVT before HCC diagnosis but received fewer than 90 days of prescription were classified into the never-treated group.

The operational definitions of HCC treatments are described in Supplementary Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content 1. If the patient received more than two treatments for HCC, the classification was based on the first treatment received, and in cases where simultaneous treatment was performed during a single admission, the classification was made in the order of liver transplantation, surgical resection, local ablation (radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy), transarterial therapy, and systemic therapy.

### Optimal intervals of ultrasonography screening for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan [^225a2962]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

We analyzed the underlying liver disease in patients with HCC for each screening subcohort, including hepatitis B virus infection (ICD-9-CM code: 070.20–070.23, 070.30–070.33, and V02.61), hepatitis C virus infection (ICD-9-CM code: 070.41, 070.44, 070.51, 070.54, 070.70, 070.71, and V02.62), liver cirrhosis (ICD-9-CM code: 571.2, 571.5, and 571.6), alcoholic liver disease (ICD-9-CM code: 571.0–571.3), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (ICD-9-CM code: 571.8 and 571.9). We also analyzed major comorbidities that typically result in premature mortality, including ischemic heart disease (ICD-9-CM code: 410–414), heart failure (ICD-9-CM code: 428), diabetes (ICD-9-CM code: 249, 250, 357.2, 362.0, and 366.41), cerebrovascular disease (ICD-9-CM code: 430–438), chronic kidney disease (ICD-9-CM code: 585), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ICD-9-CM code: 491 and 492). For each subcohort, we calculated the proportions of patients who received antiviral therapies for either hepatitis B virus infection or hepatitis C virus infection and for patients with different treatments for HCC after diagnosis, including liver transplantation, liver resection, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, transarterial embolization or transarterial chemoembolization, and chemotherapy.

Cancer Stage Distribution

The TCR typically has 2 staging systems recorded for each patient: the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system. Because BCLC staging was not a required field in the TCR database until 2010, many patients with HCC diagnosed before 2010 had data only for AJCC staging. Because the BCLC staging system incorporates liver function and physical factors into tumor profiles with better predictive power for HCC survival, we analyzed the stage distribution and lifetime survival function based on BCLC staging. We also performed a similar analysis for patients with HCC based on the seventh edition of the AJCC staging system to test robustness and sensitivity.

### Defining incidence and complications of fibrolamellar liver cancer through tiered computational analysis of clinical data [^8832722c]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

A comprehensive understanding of rare diseases requires accurate identification of patients — a challenge often compounded by a lack of disease-specific ICD coding. This problem can be self-perpetuating, as imprecise billing data can lead to underestimation of incidence, which decreases prioritization of disease-specific ICD-code creation. Our findings suggest significantly higher national FLC incidence than previous estimates. Furthermore, our approach can capture incidence, detailed clinical information, and potential systemic issues regarding misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. Integrated analysis of rich computational data sources thus complements patient-led research findings to advance care for patients with rare diseases.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with or without cirrhosis: a population-based study [^94867241]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

A commercial database (Explorys Inc, Cleveland, OH), which includes EHR data from 26 major integrated US healthcare systems, was used for this study. The participating health care systems are distributed across all 50 states of the United States. The database uses de-identified inpatient and outpatient data from each participating health care organization. The data were collected from a variety of health information systems, including EHR, billing inquiries, and lab systems. The de-identified data are then standardized and normalized and are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Explorys database categorizes the diagnoses, laboratory findings, and procedures by the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) hierarchy, and the prescription drug orders are categorized by SNOMED terms for the pharmacologic class or RxNorm for each drug. SNOMED-CT is a comprehensive hierarchical code set, which provides more detailed information of a disease than ICD-10 code. It has been widely used in EHR for clinical data capture, storage, and research. The data are presented in number and proportion for each diagnosis, findings, procedures, and prescription drug. The database rounds cell counts to the nearest 10 for the identity protection of patients. It should be noted that all cell counts of less than five were treated as zero in this database.

Study populations

We identified a cohort of adults 18 years of age or older with NAFLD from June 2015 to May 2020. NAFLD patients included were those who had diagnoses based on SNOMED-CT of "nonalcoholic liver disease", which is use as a synonyms for "fatty metamorphosis of the liver", or "nonalcoholic steatohepatitis". Patients with the diagnosis of "chronic viral hepatitis" and/or "autoimmune hepatitis" and/or "hemochromatosis" and/or "disorder caused by alcohol" were excluded. Cirrhosis patients were defined as those ever having a diagnosis of "cirrhosis" and/or "esophageal varices", and HCC patients were defined as those having a diagnosis of "liver cell carcinoma" without the diagnosis of "secondary malignant neoplasm of the liver" and "bile duct neoplasm".

### Global burden of primary liver cancer in 2020 and predictions to 2040 [^21172a25]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The number of new cases of, and deaths from, primary liver cancer (ICD-10 C22), were obtained from the GLOBOCAN 2020 database for 185 countries and territories, by sex and 18 age groups (0–4, 5–9, …, 80–84, 85 and over). Corresponding population data for 2020 were extracted from the United Nations (UN) website. The data sources and hierarchy of methods used in compiling the cancer estimates have been described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, the GLOBOCAN estimates are assembled at the national level using the best available sources of cancer incidence and mortality data within a given country.

We predicted the future number of primary liver cancer cases and deaths up to the year 2040 based on the medium-variant UN population projections and the current global-level incidence and mortality rates of primary liver cancer for 2020. The predicted number of new cancer cases or deaths was computed by multiplying the age-specific incidence or mortality rates for the world for 2020 by the corresponding projected world population estimate. These expected populations differ from that of 2020 in terms of age structure and size. The key assumption is that national rates, as estimated in 2020, will not change between 2020 and 2040 and thus changes in number of cases or deaths are solely due to the growth and aging of the population. To show the impact of changes in rates on the future primary liver cancer burden, we also predicted number of cases and deaths from seven scenarios of uniformly increasing or decreasing rates by 3%, 2%, and 1% annually from the baseline year of 2020 to 2040.

Characteristics of the primary care cohort and the liver cancer cases

Among the 8,519,717 individuals in the dynamic primary care cohort with 51,581,631 person-years of follow-up, 7331 patients were diagnosed with liver cancer, including 4063 HCC cases, 2323 CCA cases, and 945 cases of other specified/unspecified liver cancer. The sociodemographic characteristics of the primary care cohort and the liver cancer cases are shown in Table 1. The mean age for patients diagnosed with liver cancer was 69.9 years (standard deviation 12.0 years). Women were diagnosed at an older age than men in all three liver cancer subtypes. The sex distribution differed among the three liver cancer subtypes. The proportion of men in patients diagnosed with HCC was 77.9%, CCA 49.8%, and other specified/unspecified liver cancer 60.5%. The clinical characteristics of the three liver cancer subtypes are shown in Table 2, Table 3, Fig. 1, Fig. 2. The median observation period of patients diagnosed with liver cancer from entering the QResearch database to the endpoint (death or censoring) in this study was 11.1 years, interquartile range (IQR) [4.7, 17.3] years, minimum 1 year, while the longest observation was 31.3 years.

### Quantitative estimated exposure to vinyl chloride and risk of angiosarcoma of the liver and hepatocellular cancer in the US industry-wide vinyl chloride cohort: mortality update through 2013 [^e740fb9b]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Our results for the risks of cumulative exposure to VC and ASL mortality are consistent with those reported in the European study. Prior to the 10th revision of the ICD, ASL did not have its own ICD code, limiting valid ascertainment of ASL. Since ultrasound and CT scanning were introduced in the 1970s, diagnostic sensitivity improved considerably, and HCC is commonly diagnosed based on imaging, without histological confirmation. Nevertheless, a definitive diagnosis of ASL or HCC requires histopathological confirmation from a liver biopsy, and considerable potential for misclassification remains. Although we report a clear association between VC exposure and HCC mortality, the median latency for HCC deaths was 48 years, ranging from 31.5 to 66.6 years, and was considerably longer than the median latency for ASL deaths (36 years, range: 13.5–55.9 years). Also, the HRs for HCC increased with longer lagging periods up to 30 years, whereas lagging of exposure had little impact on ASL risk. While this may reflect a true difference in the risk for different liver cancer cell types, it also — at least in part — reflects the greater probability of misclassifying ASL as HCC in earlier decades.

Then, we created a diet quality score based on the following 10 foods: vegetables, fruits, fish, dairy, whole grains, vegetable oils, refined grains, processed meats, unprocessed red meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages (Supplementary Table 2). Each dietary component was scored from 0 (unhealthiest) to 10 (healthiest) points, and a higher score represents a higher intake of vegetables, fruits, fish, dairy, whole grains, and vegetable oils or a lower intake of refined grains, processed meats, unprocessed red meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages. The total diet quality score was the sum of all the diet component scores, with a higher score representing a higher overall diet quality.

Outcome ascertainment

All participants gave consent for continued follow-up by linkage to electronic health records, including hospital records (held by the Department of Health's Hospital Episode Statistics and the Scottish Morbidity Record), and death records as well as cancer registers (maintained by the Office for National Statistics and the Registrar General's Office). Each record was coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th revision (ICD-10).

We examined 2 primary endpoints: (i) incident cases of HCC (ICD-10 code C22.0) and (ii) fatal (underlying cause) CLD, defined as death from alcoholic liver diseases, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and MASLD (ICD-10 codes K70, K74, K75.8, and K76.0).

At the time of analysis, the updating dates of linkages to hospital inpatient admission, cancer registries and death registries were 31 October 2022, 1 June 2022 and 19 December 2022, respectively. Follow-up time in person-years was calculated from the date of attendance until the date of HCC diagnosis or death, whichever occurred earlier.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: the roles of HIV, hepatitis C infection, and alcohol abuse [^3b87bbd0]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To explore the relationship of HIV, hepatitis C (HCV), and alcohol abuse/dependence to risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

Patients and Methods

Male veterans (n = 14,018) with a first HIV diagnosis in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System from October 1997 to September 2004; and 28,036 age-, race-, sex-, and location-matched HIV-negative veterans were identified. We examined the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and NHL and presence of HCV and alcohol abuse/dependence using International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9-CM) codes. HIV-positive to HIV-negative incident rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs for the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma and NHL were calculated using Poisson regression models.

Results

HIV-positive veterans were at greater risk for hepatocellular carcinoma than HIV-negative veterans (IRR = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.77). After adjusting for HCV infection and alcohol abuse/dependence, HIV status was not independently associated with hepatocellular cancer (IRR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.63). HIV-positive veterans had 9.71 times (95% CI, 6.99 to 13.49) greater risk of NHL than HIV-negative veterans. After adjusting for HCV and alcohol abuse/dependence, the IRR for NHL comparing HIV-positive with HIV-negative veterans is similar (IRR = 10.03, 95% CI, 7.19 to 13.97).

Conclusion

HIV-positive veterans have a higher relative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and NHL than HIV-negative veterans. For hepatocellular carcinoma, this association appears to be largely explained by the higher prevalence of HCV and alcohol abuse/dependence. Efforts to decrease hepatocellular carcinoma among persons with HIV should focus primarily on detecting and treating HCV and reducing heavy alcohol use.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^2079c164]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

On October 1, 2015, the US transitioned to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for recording diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. It is unknown whether this transition was associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence based on diagnosis classification systems commonly used for payment and quality reporting.

Objective

To assess changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined level and trend changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition and clinically reviewed a subset of diagnostic categories with changes of 20% or more. Data included insurance claim diagnoses from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, for more than 18 million people aged 0 to 64 years with private insurance. Diagnoses were mapped using 3 common diagnostic classification systems: World Health Organization (WHO) disease chapters, Department of Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCCs), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System (AHRQ-CCS). Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Exposures

US implementation of ICD-10-CM.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Monthly rates of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 eligible members.

Results

The analytic sample contained information on 2.1 billion enrollee person-months with 3.4 billion clinically assigned diagnoses; the mean (range) monthly sample size was 22.1 (18.4 to 27.1) million individuals. While diagnostic category prevalence changed minimally for WHO disease chapters, the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with level changes of 20% or more among 20 of 127 HHS-HCCs (15.7%) and 46 of 282 AHRQ-CCS categories (16.3%) and with trend changes of 20% or more among 12 of 127 of HHS-HCCs (9.4%) and 27 of 282 of AHRQ-CCS categories (9.6%). For HHS-HCCs, monthly rates of individuals with any acute myocardial infarction diagnosis increased 131.5% (95% CI, 124.1% to 138.8%), primarily because HHS added non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction diagnoses to this category. The HHS-HCC for diabetes with chronic complications increased by 92.4% (95% CI, 84.2% to 100.5%), primarily from including new diabetes-related hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia codes, and the rate for completed pregnancy with complications decreased by 54.5% (95% CI, -58.7% to -50.2%) partly due to removing vaginal birth after cesarean delivery as a complication.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with large prevalence changes for many diagnostic categories. Diagnostic classification systems developed using ICD-9-CM may need to be refined using ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for disease surveillance, performance assessment, and risk-adjusted payments.

Data Sources and Processing

Cancer estimation in GBD 2019 used 929 193 cancer-, location-, and year-specific sources of data, of which 767 514 (82.6%) were from vital registration systems, 155 542 (16.7%) from cancer registries, and 6137 (0.7%) from verbal autopsy reports (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The cancers presented in this analysis include malignant neoplasms or cancer as defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 140 to 209, or Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes C00 to C96. Incidence and mortality data with these ICD codes are mapped to GBD cancer causes(eAppendix and eTables 3–5 in the Supplement). One processing update for GBD 2019 was the remapping of deaths coded to ICD-10 code C22.9; because this code includes unspecified primary or secondary liver cancer, a subset of these deaths were redistributed to various other cancers that metastasize to the liver. Kaposi sarcoma was not estimated because deaths were primarily redistributed to be of HIV/AIDS (eAppendix in the Supplement). The GBD NMSC estimates included squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. Because NMSC reporting was incomplete in many cancer registries, GBD 2019 additionally incorporated data from the literature and clinical sources to estimate NMSC burden (eAppendix in the Supplement).

### Cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality among people with type 2 diabetes and alcoholic or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease hospital admission [^379aec4c]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe associations between alcoholic liver disease (ALD) or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) hospital admission and cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and mortality in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Research Design and Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study by using linked population-based routine data from diabetes registry, hospital, cancer, and death records for people aged 40–89 years diagnosed with T2DM in Scotland between 2004 and 2013 who had one or more hospital admission records. Liver disease and outcomes were identified by using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) from Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusting for key risk factors.

Results

A total of 134,368 people with T2DM (1,707 with ALD and 1,452 with NAFLD) were studied, with a mean follow-up of 4.3 years for CVD and 4.7 years for mortality. Among those with ALD, NAFLD, or without liver disease hospital records 378, 320, and 21,873 CVD events; 268, 176, and 15,101 cancers; and 724, 221, and 16,203 deaths were reported, respectively. For ALD and NAFLD, respectively, adjusted HRs (95% CIs) compared with the group with no record of liver disease were 1.59 (1.43, 1.76) and 1.70 (1.52, 1.90) for CVD, 40.3 (28.8, 56.5) and 19.12 (11.71, 31.2) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 1.28 (1.12, 1.47) and 1.10 (0.94, 1.29) for non-HCC cancer, and 4.86 (4.50, 5.24) and 1.60 (1.40, 1.83) for all-cause mortality.

Conclusions

Hospital records of ALD or NAFLD are associated to varying degrees with an increased risk of CVD, cancer, and mortality among people with T2DM.

### Mortality after liver surgery in Germany [^68520be8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Mortality rates after liver surgery are not well documented in Germany. More than 1000 hospitals offer liver resection, but there is no central regulation of infrastructure requirements or outcome quality.

Methods

Hospital mortality rates after liver resection were analysed using the standardized hospital discharge data (Diagnosis-Related Groups, ICD-10 and German operations and procedure key codes) provided by the Research Data Centre of the Federal Statistical Office and Statistical Offices of the Länder in Wiesbaden, Germany.

Results

A total of 110332 liver procedures carried out between 2010 and 2015 were identified. The overall hospital mortality rate for all resections was 5.8 per cent. The mortality rate among 17574 major hepatic procedures was 10.4 per cent. Patients who had surgery for colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) had the lowest mortality rate among those with malignancy (5.5 per cent), followed by patients with gallbladder cancer (7.1 per cent), hepatocellular carcinoma (9.3 per cent) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (11.0 per cent). Patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma had the highest mortality rate (14.6 per cent). The mortality rate for extended hepatectomy was 16.2 per cent and the need for a biliodigestive anastomosis increased this to 25.5 per cent. Failure to rescue after complications led to mortality rates of more than 30 per cent in some subgroups. There was a significant volume-outcome relationship for CRLM surgery in very high-volume centres (mean 26–60 major resections for CRLMs per year). The mortality rate was 4.6 per cent in very high-volume centres compared with 7.5 per cent in very low-volume hospitals (odds ratio 0.60, 95 per cent c.i. 0.42 to 0.77; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

This analysis of outcome data after liver resection in Germany suggests that hospital mortality remains high. There should be more focused research to understand, improve or justify factors leading to this result, and consideration of centralization of liver surgery.
