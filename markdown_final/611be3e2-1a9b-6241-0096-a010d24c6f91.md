## Question

A 52-year-old woman presents to your clinic for a routine check-up. She has been postmenopausal for 2 years and reports no significant symptoms. Her past medical history is notable for mild hypertension, well controlled on medication. She does not smoke and has no family history of premature cardiovascular disease. Her recent fasting lipid profile reveals an LDL cholesterol of 165 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 48 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 130 mg/dL. She asks whether she should start hormone therapy to help manage her cholesterol, as she has heard it may be beneficial for heart health.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate management regarding lipid-lowering therapy and the use of hormone therapy in this postmenopausal patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 52-year-old postmenopausal woman with LDL-C 165 mg/dL should start hormone therapy to manage her cholesterol and improve heart health, and what the most appropriate management should be instead. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about her baseline cardiovascular risk and how menopause affects lipid profiles. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about hormone therapy for lipid management and cardiovascular prevention. Next, I will review the evidence on statins for primary prevention in women, including risk-enhancing factors that might lower treatment thresholds. After that, I should calculate her likely 10-year ASCVD risk and align statin intensity with guideline targets. Finally, I will address lifestyle therapy, monitoring, and when, if ever, hormone therapy might be considered for other indications, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk framing. She is 52 years old, 2 years postmenopausal, with mild hypertension, no diabetes, no smoking, and no premature family history of ASCVD; her LDL-C is 165 mg/dL, HDL-C 48 mg/dL, and triglycerides 130 mg/dL. Menopause is associated with an atherogenic shift in lipids, with LDL-C and apoB rising and HDL-C tending to fall, which increases ASCVD risk independent of aging alone, so I need to keep that in mind as I assess her risk and treatment needs [^20bacfc0] [^23d6bdce].

> Wait, let me verify the role of hormone therapy for lipid management. Multiple high-credibility guidelines explicitly recommend statins rather than hormone therapy to treat dyslipidemia in postmenopausal women, because hormone therapy increases cardiovascular risk, particularly venous thromboembolism and stroke, and does not provide ASCVD benefit for this purpose. The Endocrine Society gives this a strong recommendation with low-to-moderate quality evidence, and the USPSTF concludes that hormone therapy should not be used for chronic disease prevention, including cardiovascular disease, given harms and lack of benefit [^7f17e904] [^a20e2e11] [^af8f4cc5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the mechanistic lipid effects of estrogen to ensure I'm not missing a misleading signal. Oral estrogen can lower LDL-C by about 10–20% and raise HDL-C by about 10–15%, but these favorable lipid changes do not translate into reduced ASCVD events; moreover, estrogen can worsen triglycerides in susceptible patients and, when combined with progestins, the lipid benefits are blunted, reinforcing that hormone therapy is not a lipid-lowering strategy [^a20e2e11].

> Next, I should review statin therapy for primary prevention in women. Statins are first-line to reduce ASCVD risk in appropriate-risk adults, with robust evidence that LDL-C lowering yields proportional reductions in events; in women aged 40–75, moderate- or high-intensity statins are indicated when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 7.5% or when LDL-C is ≥ 160 mg/dL with risk enhancers, and risk enhancers include LDL-C 160–189 mg/dL, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory disorders, premature menopause, and certain biomarkers, which can justify earlier initiation even at intermediate risk [^bad0e57c] [^f0cedafc] [^db656f16].

> I will now examine her risk calculation and treatment thresholds. With LDL-C 165 mg/dL and age 52, and assuming no additional risk enhancers beyond her blood pressure, her 10-year ASCVD risk is likely in the borderline-to-intermediate range; however, LDL-C 160–189 mg/dL is itself a risk enhancer, and menopause-related lipid changes further elevate lifetime risk, so a moderate-intensity statin is appropriate after shared decision-making, with a goal of achieving at least a 30% LDL-C reduction and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL in primary prevention, and intensification if these thresholds are not met [^f0cedafc] [^9ff423a2] [^d3b8f11e].

> Let me think about statin selection and intensity. Moderate-intensity options include rosuvastatin 5–10 mg or atorvastatin 10–20 mg, which typically lower LDL-C by 30–49%. Given her baseline LDL-C of 165 mg/dL, a 30% reduction would bring her to about 115 mg/dL, and many patients achieve even greater reductions, so I should recheck lipids in 4–12 weeks and escalate intensity or add nonstatin therapy if goals are not met or if her risk profile shifts upward [^d4ed0ce5] [^9ff423a2].

> I should confirm lifestyle therapy as the foundation. Regardless of drug therapy, emphasize dietary patterns high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish; at least 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity; weight maintenance; alcohol moderation; and smoking avoidance. These measures independently improve lipids and reduce ASCVD risk and should be reinforced at every visit, with adherence support to sustain behavior change [^e1128925] [^46594b47].

> But wait, what if she is interested in hormone therapy for vasomotor symptoms rather than lipids. I need to ensure I separate indications. Hormone therapy may be considered for bothersome vasomotor symptoms in women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause who are at low cardiovascular risk, using the lowest effective dose and preferring transdermal routes to mitigate thrombotic risk. It is not indicated for lipid management or cardiovascular prevention, and in women with higher baseline risk, nonhormonal options should be first-line for symptoms [^e714a14e] [^6f5adead] [^cec46da2].

> I should double-check monitoring and follow-up. Obtain a fasting lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiating or changing statin therapy to assess percent LDL-C reduction and on-treatment levels, monitor for muscle symptoms and liver enzyme abnormalities, and reassess global risk periodically. If she remains above LDL-C 100 mg/dL or has not achieved at least a 30% reduction on a moderate-intensity statin, consider escalating to high-intensity therapy or adding ezetimibe per guideline pathways [^9ff423a2] [^745e903a].

> In summary, I need to be clear and direct. Hormone therapy should not be used to manage cholesterol or for cardiovascular prevention in this patient. The evidence-based approach is to initiate statin therapy for primary prevention given her LDL-C 165 mg/dL and menopausal status, start with moderate intensity, reinforce lifestyle therapy, and intensify treatment based on response and risk enhancers, reserving hormone therapy only for compelling menopausal symptom indications after careful risk assessment and shared decision-making [^7f17e904] [^a20e2e11] [^bad0e57c].

Do not use **hormone therapy** for lipid management or cardiovascular risk reduction in this patient. Current guidelines recommend **statin therapy** as first-line treatment for dyslipidemia in postmenopausal women, with moderate-intensity statins indicated when LDL-C is ≥ 160 mg/dL or when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 7.5% [^bad0e57c] [^f0cedafc]. Hormone therapy is not indicated for lipid lowering and increases risks of venous thromboembolism and stroke; reserve it for bothersome menopausal symptoms only, using the lowest effective dose and transdermal routes when appropriate [^7f17e904] [^e714a14e]. Initiate a moderate-intensity statin (e.g. atorvastatin 10–20 mg or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg), reinforce lifestyle measures, and recheck lipids in 6–12 weeks to assess response and adherence [^d4ed0ce5].

---

## Lipid profile and cardiovascular risk assessment

Her lipid profile shows **LDL-C 165 mg/dL**, HDL-C 48 mg/dL, and triglycerides 130 mg/dL. LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL is a risk enhancer that lowers the threshold for statin therapy in primary prevention [^f0cedafc]. Given her age and sex, calculate 10-year ASCVD risk using the Pooled Cohort Equations; if ≥ 7.5%, statin therapy is recommended [^bad0e57c].

## Current guideline recommendations for lipid management in postmenopausal women

Current guidelines from the **Endocrine Society (2020)** and the **American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA, 2018)** provide clear recommendations for lipid management in postmenopausal women:

- **Statin therapy as first-line treatment**: Statins are recommended as the primary pharmacologic therapy for dyslipidemia in postmenopausal women, particularly when LDL-C levels are elevated (≥ 160 mg/dL) or when the 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 7.5% [^7f17e904] [^bad0e57c].

- **Hormone therapy not recommended for lipid management**: Hormone therapy (estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin) is not recommended for the treatment of dyslipidemia or for cardiovascular risk reduction in postmenopausal women. Instead, it is associated with increased risks of venous thromboembolism (VTE), stroke, and possibly coronary heart disease, particularly when initiated in older women or those with existing cardiovascular risk factors [^7f17e904] [^5d183bf1].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes, regular physical activity, weight management, and smoking cessation, remain foundational in managing dyslipidemia and reducing cardiovascular risk [^e1128925].

---

## Evidence on hormone therapy and cardiovascular risk

Large randomized controlled trials, including the **Women's Health Initiative (WHI)**, have demonstrated that hormone therapy does not confer cardiovascular benefit and may increase cardiovascular risk, particularly in older women or those initiating therapy long after menopause [^5d183bf1]. The **USPSTF (2022)** concluded that hormone therapy should not be used for primary prevention of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, due to potential harms and lack of benefit [^af8f4cc5].

---

## Clinical implications for the patient

Given her LDL-C of 165 mg/dL and postmenopausal status, **statin therapy is indicated** as first-line treatment for dyslipidemia. A moderate-intensity statin (e.g. atorvastatin 10–20 mg daily or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg daily) is recommended to achieve an LDL-C reduction of approximately 30–50% [^d4ed0ce5]. Hormone therapy should not be initiated for lipid management or cardiovascular risk reduction in this patient, as it does not provide cardiovascular benefit and may increase the risk of adverse events [^7f17e904].

---

## Recommended management plan

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Statin therapy | Initiate moderate-intensity statin (e.g. atorvastatin 10–20 mg or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg daily) [^d4ed0ce5] |
| Lifestyle modifications | - Dietary changes (reduce saturated fats, increase soluble fiber) <br/> - Regular physical activity (≥ 150 minutes/week) <br/> - Weight management <br/> - Smoking cessation [^e1128925] |
| Monitoring | Recheck lipid profile in 6–12 weeks to assess response and adherence [^notfound] |
| Hormone therapy | Not recommended for lipid management or cardiovascular risk reduction [^7f17e904] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Hormone therapy is **not recommended** for lipid management or cardiovascular risk reduction in this patient. Current guidelines strongly endorse **statin therapy** as first-line treatment for dyslipidemia in postmenopausal women, with lifestyle modifications as adjunctive therapy. Therefore, initiate a moderate-intensity statin, reinforce lifestyle changes, and monitor lipid levels to ensure adequate response and adherence.

Recent clinical trials have supported the use of cholesterol-lowering therapies to reduce cardiovascular events. Despite these results, a number of unanswered questions remain, including the appropriate intensity of lipid-lowering therapy and the role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or triglycerides in cardiovascular risk assessment and reduction. In addition, the optimal treatment strategies for women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes are more difficult to determine, as these groups have comprised a minority of subjects in prior trials. Studies in progress will provide guidance toward effective treatment of these populations, the appropriate degree of lipid-lowering therapy, and the role of estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. In the interim, a clinical strategy incorporating the lessons of recent clinical evidence is suggested.

Objective

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for women in the United States and is largely preventable. The American Heart Association has recently released evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of CVD in women; these include gender-specific recommendations for the management of dyslipidemia. This article reviews these recommendations and the evidence supporting them.

Design

This was a qualitative review of a systematic literature search related to lipid guidelines for women and discussion of rationale and evidence for new clinical recommendations.

Main Results

Lifestyle modifications are the cornerstone of lipid management. Substantial evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the use of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy (primarily statins) in all high-risk women and the use of niacin or fibrates when high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is low or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is elevated. Fewer data are available for women at lower or intermediate risk.

Conclusions

Encouragement of lifestyle modification and appropriate use of lipid-altering therapy will have a substantial impact on reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease in women.

Postmenopausal dyslipidemia — statins vs hormone therapy: In postmenopausal women, we recommend treating dyslipidemia with statin therapy rather than hormone therapy (1⊕⊕OO). Technical remarks note that hormone therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, specifically venous thromboembolism and stroke, but the absolute risk is lower in younger compared to older postmenopausal women, and hormone therapy is described as estrogen ± progesterone/a progestin. Oral estrogen therapy increases HDL-C by up to 15% and decreases LDL-C by up to 20%, while transdermal estrogen has similar effects but generally lesser lipid changes; progestins tend to decrease HDL-C so combined estrogen and progesterone tends to blunt lipid changes compared with estrogen alone. Estrogen may dramatically increase triglyceride levels in those predisposed to hypertriglyceridemia, potentially triggering acute pancreatitis, although a population-based case-control study found no significant increase in pancreatitis risk among current or former users of estrogen.

Postmenopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular risk — statin therapy: In postmenopausal women on hormone therapy and with other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), we recommend statin therapy to reduce CV risk. Hormone therapy is described as estrogen ± progesterone/progestin, and menopause may be associated with an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Hormone therapy regimens such as oral conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg, or oral conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg alone, increased CVD, especially when given to older women (> 10 years after age of menopause); in WHI, increased coronary heart disease risk was found with CEE + MPA at one year (HR 1.80; 95% CI, 1.08–2.99), and stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and total cardiovascular events were significantly increased with lower risk in younger women. Technical remarks note that hormone therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, specifically venous thromboembolism and stroke, although absolute risk is lower in younger compared to older postmenopausal women; risk factors may be traditional risk factors or risk-enhancing factors. A Cochrane review concluded no CVD benefit and potential harm of hormone therapy and stated that they do not recommend the use of hormone therapy to treat dyslipidemia.

Optimizing CVD risk in women prior to initiating MHT

Prior to consideration of MHT, it should be emphasized that all women need aggressive lifetime CVD risk factor identification and reduction. To this end, guidelines exist specifically for prevention of CVD in women – an effort that has grown to classify women systematically according to their risk and implement recommendations at all levels. General lifestyle recommendations include advising women to stop cigarette smoking, participate in at least 150 min/week of moderate exercise, consume a diet rich in fruits and vegetables with whole-grain foods and fish at least twice a week, and maintain a body mass index (BMI) < 25 or waist size < 35 inches. Interventions for major medical risk factors such as HTN, DM, and dyslipidemia have also been delineated. Women are advised to maintain an optimal blood pressure of < 120/80 mmHg and use appropriate pharmacotherapy when above 140/90 mmHg. With regard to lipids, women are recommended to have a goal LDL-C of < 100 mg/dl, HDL-C > 50 mg/dl, triglycerides < 150 mg/dl, and non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dl. LDL-C lowering drug therapy is recommended in conjunction with lifestyle modification to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dl in most women and < 70 mg/dl in very high-risk women. In women with DM, lifestyle and pharmacotherapy is recommended to achieve a hemoglobin A1c < 7%.

While MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD, pre-existing CVD risk should be assessed in all women considering these therapies prior to initiation. The 2013 ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Risk Equation for ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) is one tool that has been recommended. This tool estimates 10-year primary risk of ASCVD in patients without pre-existing CVD who are between 40 and 79 years of age. It takes into account race, lipids, as well as history of HTN, DM, and tobacco use. A score of under 5% is considered low risk, 5–7.4% moderate risk, and 7.5% or greater high risk. Those considered high risk with this calculator may seriously consider avoiding MHT while those who are low risk may be appropriate candidates for these therapies.

### A comparison of statin therapies in hypercholesterolemia in women: a subgroup analysis of the STELLAR study [^f547e2ff]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale comparative subgroup analysis of the lipid-lowering effects of statins across their dose ranges in hypercholesterolemic women in a clinical trial population. As in the total STELLAR population, rosuvastatin 10–40 mg reduced LDL-C and non-HDL-C more than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin, and milligram-equivalent and higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin. In our analysis, mean baseline LDL-C was 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L), indicating that the women had substantial hypercholesterolemia, with many of them fulfilling the ACC/AHA 2013 guideline criteria for high-intensity statin therapy according to their baseline LDL-C levels alone, irrespective of other risk factors.

Although the 2011 AHA and 2013 ACC/AHA lipid guidelines represent important directives in preventive cardiovascular care for women, and awareness of CVD among women has increased over the last couple of decades, significant gaps in the understanding and management of the disease remain, particularly among black and Hispanic women. Indeed, the majority of women (approximately 85%) in the STELLAR trial were white, and so results from this and other statin studies need to be interpreted with caution in women of ethnic minorities.

In addition, Mosca and colleagues have established that women with high cardiovascular risk rarely achieve established lipid goals in clinical practice. At a mean follow-up of 27 months in 8,353 high-risk women (CHD, CHD risk equivalent, or chronic kidney disease) in a managed care setting, only 7% had achieved AHA ideal lipid levels (12% after 36 months). Despite the substantial evidence available during the study period that lipid-modifying therapy would benefit these women, such treatment was initiated in only 32% of patients, including 35% with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.6 mmol/L).

Some of this undertreatment may be due to the misconception that risk factors in premenopausal women do not need to be managed aggressively and to the earlier belief, now disproved, that hormone replacement therapy reduced cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women. Some undertreatment may be due to lack of awareness of overall cardiovascular risk in womenand to differences in presentation and diagnosis of CVD in women compared with men.

### Effectiveness-based guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in women – 2011 update: a guideline from the American Heart Association [^e1128925]. Circulation (2011). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the prevention of CVD in women — lipids and lipoproteins: Through lifestyle approaches, women should target LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, HDL-C > 50 mg/dL, triglycerides < 150 mg/dL, and non–HDL-C (total cholesterol minus HDL) < 130 mg/dL (Class I; Level of Evidence B). LDL-C–lowering drug therapy is recommended simultaneously with lifestyle therapy in women with CHD to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (Class I; Level of Evidence A) and is also indicated in women with other atherosclerotic CVD or diabetes mellitus or 10-year absolute risk > 20% (Class I; Level of Evidence B). A reduction to < 70 mg/dL is reasonable in very-high-risk women with CHD and may require an LDL-lowering drug combination (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B).

### Optimal management of cholesterol levels and the prevention of coronary heart disease in women [^75a7afff]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death in women, is largely preventable. Lifestyle modifications (e.g., diet and exercise) are the cornerstone of primary and secondary prevention. Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are significant risk factors for coronary heart disease. Abundant data show inadequate utilization of lipid-lowering therapy in women. Even when women are given lipid-lowering agents, target levels often are not achieved. Recent guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology encourage a more aggressive approach to lipid lowering in women. The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III also supports this strategy and significantly expands the number of women who qualify for intervention.

### Advances in lipid therapy: the role of lipid treatment in women in primary prevention [^99e2ce22]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death for women. Given the overall prevalence of CVD and its risk factors in women, primary prevention is an important focus. In 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released guidelines for men and women on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk (ASCVD) in adults based on randomized-controlled trials. Fixed and appropriate intensity of a statin based on calculation of an individual's risk of ASCVD or in diabetics or those with severely elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol patients for primary prevention is recommended rather than cholesterol level goals. A more recent consensus statement regarding the role of non-statin therapies has been released, but like the prior guidelines released in 2013, there were no sex-specific recommendations. An evidence-based approach to ASCVD prevention should be used in women.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) estimation — LDL-C is commonly estimated by the Friedewald method by subtracting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides from total cholesterol, but this estimate is inaccurate with TG > 150 mg/dL and at very low LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. Hypercholesterolemia is usually due to increased LDL concentration, and the major cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins are LDL and HDL.

Among those treated with high-dose statin therapy, more than 40% did not reach their LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL, demonstrating that statin therapy alone may be insufficient for some individuals to reach goal.

National Lipid Association (NLA) 2015 recommendations — treatment goals prioritized non–HDL-C as primary with LDL-C and apolipoprotein B (apoB) as secondary, with numeric targets by risk group. For low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups, the primary goal was non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L), with secondary goals of < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) for LDL-C and < 90 mg/dL (0.002 mmol/L) for apoB. For the very high-risk group, NLA recommended a non-HDL-C goal of < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), with LDL-C and apoB goals of < 70 mg/dL (0.001 mmol/L) and < 80 mg/dL (0.002 mmol/L), respectively.

Early menopause — assessment and treatment of lipid and cardiovascular risk: In women who enter menopause early (< 40 to 45 years old), we recommend assessment and treatment of lipids and other CV risk factors. Technical remarks state that early menopause enhances CVD risk and that atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk should be calculated and followed after menopause. Evidence notes that a younger age at menopause predicts CVD independently of traditional risk factors, that adding early menopause (≤ 3 years from onset) to the 10-year risk estimators significantly improves predictive value, and that the risk of ASCVD, including MI, angina, and stroke, was 1.5-fold higher in women with premature menopause (< 40 years) and 1.3-fold higher in women with early menopause.

AACE/ACE 2017 dyslipidemia management goals — The update defines 5 risk categories with accompanying LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) goals. Extreme risk is defined as progressive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including unstable angina after achieving an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), and the treatment goals are LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L), non-HDL-C < 80 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L), or apoB < 70 mg/dL (0.7 g/L). For very high risk, treatment goals are LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), and apoB < 80 mg/dL (0.8 g/L). For high or moderate risk, LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) and apoB < 90 mg/dL (0.9 g/L) are recommended; for low CVD risk (zero risk factors) the LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L). Although LDL-C is the primary goal parameter, non-HDL-C is recommended first when triglycerides are between 200 and 500 mg/dL (2.3 and 5.6 mmol/L).

Menopausal sex HT — indications, cautions, dosing, and route considerations are provided: Menopausal sex HT is primarily indicated to control menopause-related quality of life issues and should not be prescribed for prevention or treatment of vascular diseases; because sex HT increases risk for thrombosis, there is a black box warning on oral estrogen for women with known coronary artery disease, thromboembolic disorders, or prior cerebrovascular accident. Women at higher ASCVD risk are more likely to have even higher risk when taking oral menopausal sex HT. In general, prescribing the lowest effective dose is recommended, but doses lower than 0.3 mg of oral conjugated estrogen given at night will not control hot flashes (though protective against bone loss). Transdermal or vaginal delivery may be associated with fewer adverse events than oral, have smaller effects on clotting factors, lipid metabolism, inflammatory biomarkers, and sex hormone-binding globulin, and observational data suggest less risk of venous thromboembolism and stroke than oral estrogen.

Statins in adults older than 75 years — A participant-level meta-analysis of 28 RCTs (median duration 4.9 years) including 186 854 participants (including 14 483 older than 75 years at randomization) found a significant 21% RR reduction in major vascular events per every 1.0 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C in adults older than 75 years at randomization. This RR reduction did not differ among the 6 subgroups by age (≤ 55, 56 to 60, 61 to 65, 66 to 70, 71 to 75, and > 75 years). These data suggest a benefit in continuing statin therapy in adults over the age of 75 who have an intermediate or high risk of ASCVD, and support consideration of using a moderate intensity statin at a lower dose, or a low intensity statin.

### Preventing clinically evident coronary heart disease in the postmenopausal woman [^7ec97aa0]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This review summarizes data on the prevalent coronary heart disease risk factors of postmenopausal women and the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies available for preventing or treating them.

Design

Medline searches from 1966 on were used to identify manuscripts for coronary heart disease risk factor information, lipid levels as predictors of cardiovascular disease in women, non-pharmacologic therapies, side effects of statins, and lipid-lowering trials that included women and had myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death as endpoints.

Results

Dyslipidemias that occur with menopause are particularly atherogenic and tend to cluster with other metabolic and nonmetabolic risk factors. Estrogen therapy, with or without progestogen, can no longer be recommended for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. Statins have been effective in reducing cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality and should be first-line therapy for lipid-lowering.

Conclusions

A considerable number of women look to obstetricians-gynecologists for primary care. For postmenopausal women especially, primary care must include management of risk factors for coronary heart disease. Estrogen or estrogen plus progestin should be used only for symptomatic hot flashes and at the lowest dose possible. Statins should be first-line therapy in preventive strategies for lipid-lowering.

### Antiatherosclerosis interventions in women [^54de0cd5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Although important in reducing atherosclerosis progression and cardiovascular events in women, lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is not sufficient for optimum prevention. Additional potential targets for intervention include reducing levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and replacing certain hormones that decrease during menopause. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for the reduction of atherosclerosis progression and cardiovascular events has become complicated because of conflicting outcomes from recent surrogate end point studies and secondary prevention randomized clinical trials. The key to HRT may be early intervention, when women first enter menopause and the atherosclerotic process appears to be relatively quiescent. Although many questions remain to be answered in this important area of women's health, there is a fact that is certain: administration of HRT for the reduction of cardiovascular events is not a straightforward proposition. Powerful imaging tools for monitoring atherosclerosis progression exist that can be used to help address many questions relating to type, dose, regimen, and timing of HRT.

Combined oral contraceptives (COC) and other contraceptive modalities — lipid and thrombotic effects are outlined: COC use carries thrombotic risk and most products contain ≤ 35 μg of ethinyl-estradiol; the estrogen component frequently increases triglycerides (TG) and HDL-C and lowers LDL-C, while androgenic progestins (norgestrel, levonorgestrel) can raise LDL-C and lower HDL-C; low-dose norethindrone COCs and desogestrel raise HDL-C and lower LDL-C, and higher estrogen content can cause severe hypertriglyceridemia in women with high baseline TG. Transdermal or vaginal contraceptives do not have a lower thrombotic risk than COC, but transdermal formulations are less prone to clinically important TG elevations. Progestin-only oral, injectable, and implantable options are available and efficacious, though they are not as effective for contraception and have greater risk of breakthrough bleeding.

### Effects of low-dose versus placebo or conventional-dose postmenopausal hormone therapy on variables related to cardiovascular risk: a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials [^097eec37]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Hormone therapy (HT), the most efficient treatment for menopausal symptoms, might have deleterious cardiovascular (CV) effects.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of low-dose estrogen HT on CV risk factors vs conventional-dose HT and placebo in postmenopausal women with no established CV disease.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, and EMBASE were searched for trials published in 1990–2013; a hand search of reference lists of selected articles was performed; and ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for unpublished trials.

Study Selection

Within randomized controlled trials of healthy postmenopausal women comparing low-dose HT to placebo or conventional-dose HT, 11 418 studies were initially identified.

Data Extraction

Data were independently extracted by two investigators. Disagreements were resolved by a third author.

Data Synthesis

Twenty-eight trials (3360 patients) were included. Low-dose HT vs placebo or conventional-dose HT did not effect weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, C-reactive protein, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Low-dose HT was associated with lower levels of total cholesterol (-12.16 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval [CI] -17.41 - -6.92) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (-12.16 mg/dL; 95% CI, -16.55 - -7.77) vs placebo. Compared with conventional-dose HT, low-dose HT was associated with higher total cholesterol (5.05 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.88–9.21) and LDL-C (4.49 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.59–8.39). Low-dose HT was not associated with differences in triglycerides vs placebo. Oral, low-dose HT was associated with lower triglycerides vs conventional-dose HT (-14.09 mg/dL; 95% CI, -24.2 - -3.93).

Conclusion

In this population of apparently healthy postmenopausal women, the effect of low-dose HT did not differ from that of placebo or conventional-dose HT regarding weight, BMI, blood pressure, CRP, or HDL-C. In contrast, low-dose HT was associated with better lipid profile vs placebo, and induced higher total and LDL-C and lower triglycerides vs conventional-dose HT.

### Women, lipids, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a call to action from the European Atherosclerosis Society [^77ee3de9]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Call to action for women and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

Although ASCVD is the leading cause of death in women, their cardiovascular health is often neglected. Underappreciation of women's ASCVD risk, missed or delayed diagnosis, and undertreatment are important contributors. Despite clear evidence that statin therapy is similarly efficacious in both sexes, women at high risk for ASCVD are less likely than men to be prescribed any statin therapy or to receive a statin at guideline-recommended intensity, and more likely to refuse or discontinue statin treatment due to perceived side effects. Clearly, action is needed to overcome these inequities.

As discussed in this EAS statement, there are also other important considerations. Women are disproportionately impacted by some lifestyle factors, and sociocultural components related to gender impact risk. Hormonal and chromosomal effects also influence ASCVD progression, although gaps remain in understanding the underlying mechanisms (Graphical abstract). Lipids influence ASCVD risk in women during life course events (pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause). During menopause transition, LDL-C levels increaseand elevated Lp(a) is more common than in men. In women with FH, discontinuation of statin therapy with pregnancy and breastfeeding contributes to greater cumulative cholesterol exposure compared with men with FH.

This panel stresses the importance of early assessment of cardiovascular risk and early treatment of dyslipidaemia in women (Table 2 and Graphical abstract). Further studies to understand the effects of female sex hormones on atherosclerosis development and progression are needed. Targeted action to address these gaps is a priority to reduce the unacceptably high burden of ASCVD in women.

Atherogenic cholesterol and ASCVD risk — Non–HDL-C has been regularly shown to be a better predictor of ASCVD event risk than LDL-C, and the panel included both LDL-C and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL-C is the sum of LDL-C and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol) as atherogenic cholesterol components. Reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced, and numerous clinical trials of atherogenic cholesterol–lowering therapies have demonstrated their ability to reduce the incidence of ASCVD in proportion to the amount of LDL-C and non–HDL-C reduction. Examinations of on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration compared with coronary heart disease (CHD) events in primary and secondary prevention also show a strong positive correlation, with effects evident with drug, diet/lifestyle, and surgical therapies and across the full spectrum of LDL-C and non–HDL-C levels. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' meta-analysis reported that a 1.0 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) change in LDL-C resulted in a 22% relative risk reduction.

Risk-enhancing factors for primary prevention — role and thresholds in clinician–patient decision-making: In the clinician-patient risk discussion they can be useful for identifying specific factors that influence risk, and their presence helps to confirm a higher risk state and thereby supports a decision to initiate or intensify statin therapy. Examples that denote high lifetime risk for ASCVD and favor initiation of statin therapy include LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.1 mmol/L), apoB ≥ 130 mg/dL (particularly when accompanied by persistently elevated triglycerides), and elevated Lp(a). Additional noted factors are family history of ASCVD, premature menopause, and South Asian race, which appear to convey a higher baseline risk and are stronger candidates for statin therapy, and conditions associated with systemic inflammation (chronic inflammatory disorders, metabolic syndrome, chronic renal disease, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]) which reasonably justifies statin therapy in intermediate-risk patients.

Introduction

Despite recent improvements in sex and gender research in cardiovascular disease (CVD), disparities still exist. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) in particular remains a leading cause of death in women. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include biological, social, environmental, and economic factors. While men and women share many traditional risk factors for CVD, these alone do not explain the sex-specific increased risk of CVD in women. Additional female-specific risk factors, most notably menopause, contribute significantly. Menopause has been associated with an increased CVD risk in women aged ⩾55 years. The transition to menopause has shown to be associated with negative alterations in the lipid profile, increased susceptibility to weight gain and metabolic syndrome, and both epicardial and paracardial fat deposition. – It represents a vulnerable time for women and an opportunity for consideration of menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

In prior decades, MHT was thought to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, large trials demonstrating the risks of MHT have changed clinician and public perception of these strategies. As our understanding of MHT has evolved, so has our knowledge regarding the appropriate timing and patient characteristics for safe administration. Given the efficacy of MHT in reducing the unpleasant vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, which can severely alter quality of life, understanding the safety and potential cardiovascular (CV) risks and benefits of MHT is important in optimizing the health of our female patients.

The treatment of lipid disorders begins with lifestyle therapy to improve nutrition, physical activity, weight, and other factors that affect lipids. Secondary causes of lipid disorders should be addressed, and pharmacologic therapy initiated based on a patient's risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients at extreme ASCVD risk should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of < 55 mg/dL, and those at very high ASCVD risk should be treated to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. Treatment for moderate and high ASCVD risk patients may begin with a moderate-intensity statin to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, while the LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL for those at low risk. In all cases, treatment should be intensified, including the addition of other LDL-C-lowering agents (i.e., proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, colesevelam, or bempedoic acid) as needed to achieve treatment goals. When targeting triglyceride levels, the desirable goal is < 150 mg/dL. Statin therapy should be combined with a fibrate, prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acid, and/or niacin to reduce triglycerides in all patients with triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and icosapent ethyl should be added to a statin in any patient with established ASCVD or diabetes with ≥ 2 ASCVD risk factors and triglycerides between 135 and 499 mg/dL to prevent ASCVD events. Management of additional risk factors such as elevated lipoprotein(a) and statin intolerance is also described.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^cec46da2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CV risk in women increases at the time of menopause, likely related to a combination of aging and the menopausal transition. Proper CVD risk assessment is imperative for improving long term CVD outcomes, guiding risk reduction therapy, and determining safety of MHT if needed. A thorough history of adverse pregnancy outcomes and complications is required in all perimenopausal women. Assessment of family history of CVD in addition to any personal history of autoimmune or rheumatologic disorders and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is essential. All traditional risk factors should be assessed as well as current lipid cholesterol levels, blood glucose levels, and blood pressure. All women should receive education on ideal body weight, a plant-based heart healthy diet, and optimal exercise routines.

MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD or in women with known ASCVD or high risk for CVD events. In select populations of women who may benefit from its vasomotor, genitourinary, and bone health effects, women at low CVD risk may be prescribed MHT safely until age 65. The principles underlying safe use of MHT include using low dose MHT for the shortest possible duration and employing transdermal, SERM, and topical formulations where appropriate, often as an initial strategy. Lastly, it is imperative that both patients and providers are aware of the appropriate indications for MHT and individual risks, especially from a CV standpoint. Several calculators are available to further risk-stratify these patients and enable safe shared-decision making, such as the ASCVD pooled-cohort risk calculator and the NAMS MenoPro app. Quality of life for postmenopausal women is an important consideration, and in addition to early risk assessment and CVD risk reduction, decisions regarding MHT should be made individually and reassessed over time.

### Anastrozole [^e860c315]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal women with early breast cancer scheduled to be treated with anastrozole tablets should have their bone status managed according to treatment guidelines already available for postmenopausal women at similar risk of fragility fracture.

Cholesterol

During the ATAC trial, more patients receiving anastrozole tablets were reported to have an elevated serum cholesterol compared to patients receiving tamoxifen (9% versus 3.5%, respectively).

A post-marketing trial also evaluated any potential effects of anastrozole tablets on lipid profile. In the primary analysis population for lipids (anastrozole tablets alone), there was no clinically significant change in LDL-C from baseline to 12 months and HDL-C from baseline to 12 months.

In secondary population for lipids (anastrozole tablets + risedronate), there also was no clinically significant change in LDL-C and HDL-C from baseline to 12 months.

In both populations for lipids, there was no clinically significant difference in total cholesterol (TC) or serum triglycerides (TG) at 12 months compared with baseline.

In this trial, treatment for 12 months with anastrozole tablets alone had a neutral effect on lipid profile. Combination treatment with anastrozole tablets and risedronate also had a neutral effect on lipid profile.

The trial provides evidence that postmenopausal women with early breast cancer scheduled to be treated with anastrozole tablets should be managed using the current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines for cardiovascular risk-based management of individual patients with LDL elevations.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^f8de5456]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction — For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk. Statins have been shown to reduce serum LDL-C levels by 18% to 55%, non–HDL-C by 15% to 51%, and triglycerides by 7% to 30% (in hypertriglyceridemia the reduction is typically by 20% to 50%, particularly with high-potency statins) and increase HDL-C by 5% to 15%. A large body of RCT evidence demonstrates that statins are safe and generally well tolerated by most patients and that they decrease risk for ASCVD events in both primary and secondary prevention in amounts proportional to their cholesterol lowering, and for these reasons, they are considered to be first-line drug treatment in both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^4aa6c079]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Women with moderate-risk scores may benefit from more thorough assessment using ASCVD "risk-enhancing factors" to guide decision making. Risk enhancing factors as defined in the 2019 ACC/AHA guideline on the primary prevention of CVD include family history of premature ASCVD, primary hypercholesterolemia, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammatory conditions, history of premature menopause, history of pregnancy associated conditions such as preeclampsia, high risk race/ethnicity, persistently elevated triglycerides, high lipoprotein (a), high apolipoprotein B, and ankle-brachial index < 0.9. The NAMS has created an app, MenoPro, which utilizes an algorithm accounting for severity of menopausal symptoms along with family history of breast cancer and CVD in conjunction with the ASCVD risk calculator to propose appropriate hormonal and non-hormonal therapeutic options for each individual. It seeks to streamline this multi-faceted decision-making process for both clinicians and patients alike. Figure 2 illustrates the steps involved in ideal ASCVD risk assessment for women at menopause.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^26480d9e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

The leadership of the National Lipid Association convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. An Executive Summary of those recommendations was previously published. This document provides support for the recommendations outlined in the Executive Summary. The major conclusions include (1) an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; (2) reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies; (3) the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event; (4) atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies; (5) for patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk; (6) nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus; and (7) the measurement and monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels remain an important part of a comprehensive ASCVD prevention strategy.

### Colestipol hydrochloride [^1344243e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Since no drug is innocuous, strict attention should be paid to the indications and contraindications, particularly when selecting drugs for chronic long-term use.

Colestipol hydrochloride tablets are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated serum total and LDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (elevated LDL-C) who do not respond adequately to diet. Generally, colestipol hydrochloride tablets have no clinically significant effect on serum triglycerides, but with their use, triglyceride levels may be raised in some patients.

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be a component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Treatment should begin and continue with dietary therapy (see NCEP guidelines). A minimum of six months of intensive dietary therapy and counseling should be carried out prior to initiation of drug therapy. Shorter periods may be considered in patients with severe elevations of LDL-C or with definite CHD.

According to the NCEP guidelines, the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, and LDL-C is to be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDL-C levels are not available, should the Total-C be used to monitor therapy. The NCEP treatment guidelines are shown below.

*Coronary heart disease or peripheral vascular disease (including symptomatic carotid artery disease).

†Other risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) include: age (males: ≥ 45 years; female: ≥ 55 years or premature menopause without estrogen replacement therapy); family history of premature CHD; current cigarette smoking; hypertension; confirmed HDL-C < 35 mg/dL (0.91 mmol/L); and diabetes mellitus. Subtract one risk factor if HDL-C is ≥ 60 mg/dL (1.6 mmol/L).

### Use of lipid-lowering therapies over 2 years in GOULD, a registry of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the US [^0cd94d51]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), how are lipids managed in real-world clinical practice?

Findings

GOULD is a prospective observational registry study tracking lipid-lowering therapies for patients with ASCVD who had baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 70 mg/dL or more or were taking a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor. Over a 2-year period, only modest intensifications of lipid-lowering therapies were observed (17.1%), with only 1 in 3 patients achieving a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 70 mg/dL at 2 years.

Meaning

Further lipid-lowering therapy intensification efforts are needed to achieve optimal cholesterol management in patients with ASCVD.

### Opportunity for intervention to achieve American Heart Association guidelines for optimal lipid levels in high-risk women in a managed care setting [^58fefad1]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The American Heart Association (AHA) recently established evidence-based recommendations for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention in women, including lipid management. This study evaluated optimal lipid-level attainment and treatment patterns on the basis of these guidelines in high-risk women in a managed care setting.

Methods and Results

We conducted a historical prospective cohort analysis of a 1.1-million-member, integrated, managed-care database. Eligible high-risk women were those with evidence of previous CVD or risk equivalent who had a full lipid panel available between October 1, 1999, and September 30, 2000; were naive to lipid therapy; and had a minimum of 12 months health plan eligibility preindex and postindex lipid panel. Optimal lipid levels were defined as LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) > 50 mg/dL, non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL, and triglycerides < 150 mg/dL. Laboratory values and lipid pharmacotherapy were assessed longitudinally over the postindex follow-up (up to 36 months). A total of 8353 high-risk women (mean age, 66 ± 14 years) with a mean follow-up of 27 ± 8 months were included. Only 7% attained optimal combined lipid levels initially, and this increased to 12% after 36 months. Lipid-modifying therapy was initiated in 32% of patients, including 35% of women with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL and 15% with LDL-C < 100 mg/dL.

Conclusions

Among high-risk women, few attained the AHA's standards for all lipid fractions, and only one third received recommended drug therapy, highlighting significant opportunities to apply evidence-based recommendations to manage lipid abnormalities in high-risk women.

### The 2018 AHA / ACC / multi-society cholesterol guidelines: looking at past, present and future [^23104331]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The authors review more than three decades of progress in providing clinicians and patients with guidance on risk assessment, patient evaluation and cholesterol management. Beginning with the National Cholesterol Education Program's Initial Adult Treatment Panel report, the cholesterol guidelines increasingly reflect the progress made in understanding the benefits of improved lifestyle and nutrition to improve lipid profiles, major risk factors and reduce ASCVD risk. Moreover, they now provide qualitative and quantitative assessment tools to guide appropriate risk reduction LDL-C lowering therapy. Use of the Pooled Cohort Equations to determine Low, Borderline, Intermediate and High 10-year ASCVD risk is now joined by recognition of conditions and biomarkers that enhance ASCVD risk. This personalizes the risk discussion for the patient. An important addition is the selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to reclassify risk in patients at borderline or intermediate risk, but for whom a risk decision regarding statin therapy is uncertain. In secondary prevention, current guidelines provide criteria for determining a "very high" risk group in whom risk is especially high and in whom aggressive LDL-C lowering can be shown to provide increased absolute benefit. Current guidelines provide a comprehensive look at children and adolescents, young adults, elderly, women and issues specific to women through the life course. They provide guidance for those adults at risk due to severe hypercholesterolemia, persistent hypertriglyceridemia after secondary causes have been addressed, those with inflammatory disorders and HIV, those adults with chronic kidney disease, and those affected by issues of race/ethnicity. They conclude with a brief summary of recommendations emphasizing important concepts for providing safety with LDL-C lowering therapy. This combination of best external evidence and clinical expertise from the expert panel should provide a solid foundation for lipid management of patients at risk for or with clinical ASCVD.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^2f73306c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — evidence on age and timing and use of risk tools: Results showing fewer excess CHD and stroke events when MHT was initiated in younger rather than older study participants in the WHI provide the foundation for the widely accepted consensus that MHT should be initiated primarily in younger women (age < 60 y) close in time (< 10 y) to menopause onset. We feel that methods to integrate these factors to categorize individual risk as minimal, moderate, and high are useful and can be accomplished qualitatively by clinical judgment or quantitatively by risk assessment tools, and country- and population-specific CVD risk calculators are available to quantify individual risk per local guidelines; however, specific cutoffs for the safe use of MHT have not been formally validated, and practice differs from country to country.

### American Heart Association national integrated ASCVD initiative: an implementation initiative to improve lipid management among patients with ASCVD [^2359437f]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, is a key clinical and public health priority. Cholesterol management is central to the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering being consistently proven to reduce rates of major adverse cardiovascular events. Clinical guidelines recommend lipid-lowering therapies for individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk, with therapeutic intensification to lower LDL-C targets in those with higher baseline risk, for whom the greatest absolute risk reduction is anticipated. For individuals with very high-risk ASCVD, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology Multisociety cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with the addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents if LDL-C remains at a threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. Despite extensive clinical trial evidence and strong guideline recommendations, many eligible individuals remain untreated or undertreated with statins and other lipid-lowering therapies. This indicates a need for an enhanced focus on implementation science to ensure that individuals at very high ASCVD risk receive appropriate lipid management.

National Lipid Association — ASCVD risk categories and atherogenic cholesterol targets are organized as follows: For low risk (0–1 major ASCVD risk factors), treatment goals are Non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL; for moderate risk (≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors), goals are Non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL; for high risk (criteria include ≥ 3 major ASCVD risk factors; diabetes mellitus [type 1 or 2]; CKD stage 3B or 4; LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL; or quantitative risk score reaching the high-risk threshold), goals are Non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL; for very high risk (ASCVD; diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 other major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage), goals are Non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL. For patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, consideration should be given to use of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to considerations for hormone therapy, NAMS 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- estrogen therapy carries a class effect risk of VTE

- low-dose vaginal estrogen may carry a very low risk but there has been no report of an increased risk in the vaginal estrogen clinical trials

- insufficient evidence in high-risk patients.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^5b5e4b39]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — statin therapy for primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention — reports that randomized controlled trial (RCT) data in individuals with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels < 190 mg/dL and > 70 mg/dL document benefit, that studies found high-level evidence for ASCVD riskreduction with initiation of moderate- or highintensity statins in those aged 40 to 75 years with a > 7.5% estimated 10-year risk for ASCVD, and that "it is recommended that individuals 40 to 75 years of age, who are not already candidates for statin therapy, receive moderateintensity statin therapy… when they have a > 7.5% estimated 10-year risk for ASCVD and an LDL-C value of 70 to 189 mg/dL," noting the reduction in ASCVD risk clearly outweighs potential adverse effects and is supported by meta-analysis across LDL-C levels > 70 mg/dL.

### Summary of updated recommendations for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women: JACC state-of-the-art review [^076ff52e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for women in the United States and worldwide. There has been no American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association guideline update specifically for the prevention of CVD in women since 2011. Since then, the body of sex-specific data has grown, in addition to updated hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and primary prevention guidelines. The ACC CVD in Women Committee undertook a review of the recent guidelines and major studies to summarize recommendations pertinent to women. In this update, the authors address special topics, particularly the risk factors and treatments that have led to some controversies and confusion. Specifically, sex-related risk factors, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, use of aspirin, perimenopausal hormone therapy, and psychosocial issues are highlighted.

Menopause and CVD risk

As early as 1976, Framingham investigators reported a 2.6-fold higher incidence of CV events in age-matched postmenopausal women when compared with premenopausal women. These same data also found that, on average, women develop CVD 7–10 years later in life compared with men. Observational studies since then have also consistently shown that early age at menopause is positively associated with IHD. – As a result, it has been hypothesized that the pronounced risk of IHD in older women is related to the mid-life withdrawal of endogenous sex steroids associated with the menopausal transition.

This hypothesis is supported by several observations. First, menopause has shown to be associated with more atherogenic shifts in the lipid profile. After menopause, women are noted to have higher total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in addition to reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. In the Study of Women Across the Nation, LDL-C and apolipoprotein B in particular, when compared with other common CV risk factors, were the only two factors to change in association with menopause and not just age. Second, studies have revealed that the weight gain experienced in midlife, specifically increased fat mass, loss of skeletal mass, and increased waist circumference, cannot be explained by increasing age alone but by ovarian aging associated with the last menstrual period. The menopause transition has shown to contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome by impairing glucose metabolism in addition to causing negative effects on blood pressure, weight gain, and central abdominal obesity. Third, menopause is associated with greater percentage of both epicardial and paracardial adipose tissue, two emerging risk factors for IHD.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^01cca5ef]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes — low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets: In adults with type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors, we suggest lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to achieve a goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) in order to reduce cardiovascular risk, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) in patients with established cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors; additional low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapy (ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor) may be needed if the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal is not reached with statins, and risk factors include traditional risk factors and risk-enhancing factors.

### Hormone therapy in menopause: an update on cardiovascular disease considerations [^ac107f47]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the number one cause of death and morbidity worldwide, and while overall CVD incidence rates declined in both genders between 1999 and 2007, age-specific data suggest that coronary risk factors in women are on the rise. While early observational data favored menopausal hormone therapy's (MHT's) role in primary CVD prevention, the initial interventional study data from the WHI did not. Further detailed analyses of both observational and interventional data have pointed to the possibility that MHT may play a role in primary CVD prevention if initiated within 10 years of menopause and less than 60 years of age (the timing hypothesis). Unanswered questions remain regarding the optimal route and dosage of estrogen in MHT. Data so far, favor transdermal estradiol over conventional-dose CEE with respect to CVD risk and oral estradiol over conventional-dose CEE with respect to stroke risk. Low-dose oral CEE may similarly have benefit over conventional-dose oral CEE for some CVD events. In addition, the transdermal route of delivery may avoid the excess risk of certain CVD events associated with MHT and lower doses of estrogen may have fewer adverse effects than the doses previously tested in WHI. Because questions regarding benefits versus risks remain, MHT is yet to be recommended for CVD prevention. However, it is indicated for menopausal symptom management in women within 10 years of menopause and under the age of 60 years, in whom it does not appear to carry increased cardiovascular risk. Additional research is ongoing and needed to confirm or refute the comparative safety of the various MHT options.
