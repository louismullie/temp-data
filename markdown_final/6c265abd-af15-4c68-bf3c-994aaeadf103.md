## Question

Treatment of hordeolum

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of hordeolum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining hordeolum and clarifying internal versus external forms. Then, I should verify the natural history and prognosis to anchor expectations. Next, I will examine the evidence base for non-surgical interventions, including warm compresses, lid hygiene, antibiotics, and steroids. After that, I should review alternative therapies like acupuncture and IPL. Then, I need to outline indications for surgical drainage and when to escalate care. Finally, I will integrate special populations, safety considerations, and synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm with monitoring and follow-up, while highlighting evidence gaps and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its subtypes. Hordeolum is an acute, painful inflammation of eyelid margin glands, typically bacterial, and can be internal (meibomian gland) or external (Zeis/Moll glands), with a tendency toward spontaneous drainage and resolution, though recurrences are common and persistent lesions may evolve into chalazia or cellulitis if unmanaged [^112A1PJV] [^1176g2NY].

> I should confirm the natural history and prognosis before proposing interventions. Many hordeola drain spontaneously within about a week, but inflammation can spread to adjacent glands or tissues, and recurrences are frequent; if unresolved, an acute internal hordeolum may become chronic or progress to a chalazion, so counseling on expected course and red flags is important [^112A1PJV] [^1176g2NY].

> Now, I will examine the evidence for non-surgical interventions, but wait, let me verify the highest-quality sources. Multiple Cochrane reviews found no randomized or quasi-randomized trials evaluating warm compresses, lid hygiene, antibiotics, or steroids for acute internal hordeolum, so the certainty of evidence for these common practices remains low to very low, and conclusions are largely extrapolated from clinical experience and indirect evidence [^112A1PJV] [^115keSsj] [^11238Lfh].

> Despite the lack of direct RCTs, I need to ensure that foundational supportive care remains reasonable. Warm compresses are widely recommended to promote drainage and relieve discomfort, and lid hygiene may reduce bacterial load; given the benign nature and low risk, these remain first-line conservative measures in typical cases, with counseling that evidence quality is limited and that persistence beyond 1–2 weeks warrants reassessment [^113gZopS] [^1176g2NY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I initially thought topical antibiotics might be standard for all hordeola, but I should double-check the evidence. The Cochrane reviews found no trials supporting routine antibiotic use for acute internal hordeolum, so antibiotics should be reserved for cases with significant surrounding cellulitis, immunocompromise, or failure of conservative therapy after a short trial, balancing potential benefit against resistance risks and limited evidence [^112A1PJV] [^115keSsj] [^11238Lfh].

> Let me consider steroids carefully. There is no direct evidence for topical or intralesional steroids in acute hordeolum, and given risks of masking infection and intraocular pressure effects with periocular steroids, I should avoid routine steroid use unless there is a compelling indication and ophthalmic oversight, particularly in internal hordeolum where infection is a concern [^112A1PJV].

> Next, I should review alternative therapies. Acupuncture has low-certainty evidence suggesting possible short-term benefits versus conventional care in small, heterogeneous RCTs from China, but risk of bias is high and generalizability is uncertain; patients may consider it as an adjunct, but I need to emphasize the weak evidence base and potential placebo effects [^1176g2NY].

> I will now examine IPL/BBL, but wait, I should verify whether data exist for hordeolum specifically. IPL/BBL has retrospective evidence of reducing hordeolum and blepharitis frequency in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction, with mostly transient adverse effects; however, this is indirect and not from RCTs in acute hordeolum, so it may be considered for recurrent disease in MGD contexts rather than as first-line for isolated acute hordeolum [^111N4wxV] [^112rDKbw] [^114AxHAW].

> Let me think about when to escalate to procedural management. Indications include persistence beyond 1–2 weeks despite conservative therapy, large or painful abscess, or progression to chalazion. Incision and drainage or intralesional steroid can be considered depending on lesion characteristics and patient factors, with the understanding that much of the procedural literature derives from chalazion rather than acute hordeolum per se [^11527rKe].

> I should confirm special populations and safety. In pregnancy, topical ophthalmic antibiotics were not associated with increased adverse neonatal outcomes in observational data, supporting their use when clinically indicated. In children, conservative therapy is generally preferred, with escalation if disease persists or vision is threatened. And in contact lens wearers, I need to ensure lenses are discontinued during active infection to reduce irritation and risk of spread [^112VUrDj].

> But wait, what if the "hordeolum" is actually something else. I need to check for masqueraders such as chalazion, preseptal/orbital cellulitis, herpetic disease, or malignancy. Persistent, nonresolving, or atypical lesions warrant biopsy to exclude entities like endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma, which can mimic a chalazion or hordeolum and delay definitive care if misdiagnosed [^116TyHyn] [^1114ePGE].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise algorithm and verify alignment with available guidance. Start with warm compresses and lid hygiene for 1–2 weeks, counsel on expected course and warning signs. Reassess at 1–2 weeks and consider topical antibiotics only if there is surrounding cellulitis, immunocompromise, or failure of conservative therapy. Refer for incision and drainage or intralesional steroid if persistent, large, or evolving to chalazion. And consider adjuncts like acupuncture or IPL selectively in recurrent MGD-associated cases, documenting shared decision-making given low-certainty evidence [^113gZopS] [^112A1PJV] [^1176g2NY] [^111N4wxV].

> I should double-check safety counseling and follow-up. Advise against squeezing or manipulating the lesion, reinforce hand hygiene, and arrange follow-up to confirm resolution. If not improving as expected, broaden the differential, reassess for complications, and consider imaging or biopsy when the presentation is atypical or refractory to appropriate therapy [^116TyHyn].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate uncertainties transparently. The core message is that most hordeola resolve spontaneously or with conservative measures, but high-quality evidence for specific interventions is limited. Decisions should balance low-risk supportive care, judicious use of antibiotics, and timely escalation when indicated, with shared decision-making about procedural options and alternative therapies given the current evidence gaps [^112A1PJV].

---

Hordeolum is best managed with **warm compresses** applied 3–4 times daily for 10–15 minutes to promote drainage and shorten the course [^113gZopS]. Most lesions resolve spontaneously within 1–2 weeks; **no antibiotics are needed** unless there is spreading cellulitis, immunocompromise, or failure of conservative care [^112A1PJV]. Avoid squeezing or lancing, and refer to ophthalmology for persistent lesions, suspected chalazion, or recurrence. Adjuncts such as topical antibiotics or steroids have limited evidence and are not routinely recommended [^115keSsj] [^11238Lfh].

---

## Conservative management

### Warm compresses

- **Mechanism**: Heat softens meibum, opens ducts, and promotes drainage [^notfound].
- **Application**: Clean cloth or commercial mask, 3–4 times daily for 10–15 minutes.
- **Evidence**: Widely recommended; no high-quality RCTs but strong clinical support [^112A1PJV].

---

### Lid hygiene

Lid hygiene — daily **lid margin cleansing** with diluted baby shampoo or commercial wipes — reduces bacterial load and recurrence [^112e95Eo].

---

### Avoidance of manipulation

Avoidance of manipulation — no **squeezing or lancing** — prevents spread and complications [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

### Topical antibiotics

Topical antibiotics are indicated only for **secondary bacterial infection** or when there is **spreading cellulitis**. Options include erythromycin or bacitracin ointment applied twice daily for 7–10 days; evidence is limited and routine use is not supported [^112A1PJV] [^115keSsj].

---

### Systemic antibiotics

Systemic antibiotics are reserved for **severe infection**, **cellulitis**, or **immunocompromised patients**. Common choices are oral cephalexin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for 7–10 days; MRSA coverage (e.g. doxycycline, TMP-SMX) is added when risk is high [^notfound].

---

### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended; **intralesional triamcinolone** may be considered for persistent or recurrent lesions, but evidence is limited.

---

## Surgical interventions

### Incision and drainage

Incision and drainage is indicated for **large, persistent, or refractory lesions** after 2–3 weeks of conservative therapy. The procedure involves a **vertical incision** to avoid lid-margin scarring and is performed under local anesthesia [^11527rKe].

---

### Intralesional steroid injection

Intralesional steroid injection is an alternative to surgery for **persistent or recurrent lesions**, typically using triamcinolone acetonide (5–10 mg/mL).

---

## Alternative therapies

Alternative therapies include **acupuncture**, for which low-certainty evidence suggests short-term benefits, and **intense pulsed light (IPL)**, which may reduce recurrence in Meibomian gland dysfunction but has limited evidence for acute hordeolum [^1176g2NY] [^111N4wxV].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Prevention of recurrence centers on **lid hygiene** with regular cleansing and warm compresses, and **meibomian gland dysfunction management** with omega-3s, IPL, or oral doxycycline as indicated [^112kMTiR] [^112rDKbw].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Persistent lesion**: > 2–3 weeks despite therapy.
- **Suspected chalazion**: Differentiation and management.
- **Recurrent hordeolum**: Evaluate for underlying disease [^112e95Eo].
- **Complications**: Cellulitis, vision changes, or systemic symptoms [^1176g2NY].

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Treatment** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | **Warm compresses** | All cases |
| 2 | **Lid hygiene** | All cases |
| 3 | **Topical antibiotics** | Secondary infection or cellulitis |
| 4 | **Systemic antibiotics** | Severe infection or immunocompromise |
| 5 | **Incision and drainage** | Persistent or large lesions |
| 6 | **Intralesional steroid** | Persistent or recurrent lesions |
| 7 | **Specialist referral** | Persistent, recurrent, or complicated cases |

---

Warm compresses and lid hygiene are **first-line**; antibiotics are reserved for specific cases, and surgery or steroids are for persistent or recurrent lesions.

### The role of inflammatory periocular, ocular surface and systemic diseases in involutional ectropion [^114h9aRJ]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This study investigated the association between involutional ectropion and chronic inflammatory diseases of the eyelid and ocular surface, and other systemic diseases.

Methods

This case-control study was conducted using electronic medical records from Clalit Health Services in Israel, 2001–2022. Patients diagnosed with involutional ectropion were compared to two control groups: one with senile cataracts and another with other ophthalmic diseases. The groups were matched 1:3 by birth year, sex, and ethnicity. Mixed models were used to assess differences in demographics, periocular, ocular, and systemic diseases between the groups. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and adjust for confounders.

Results

A total of 1786 patients with involutional ectropion and 5358 matched individuals in each control group were included. The average age of the patients with involutional ectropion was 77 ± 10 years, and 60% were men. Significant associations were found between involutional ectropion and several inflammatory diseases: blepharitis (OR 4.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.68–4.91), chalazion (OR 3.01, 95% CI: 2.3–3.94), hordeolum (OR 2.27, 95% CI: 1.8–2.86), dermatitis of the eyelid (OR 1.69, 95% CI: 1.16–2.47), chronic conjunctivitis (OR 3.49, 95% CI: 2.86–4.26), pterygium (OR 2.21, 95% CI: 1.71–2.86), hypertension (OR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.31–1.72), dyslipidaemia (OR 1.46, 95% CI: 1.3–1.64), and rheumatic disease (OR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5–2.4).

Conclusions

Periocular, ocular surface, and systemic inflammatory diseases are independent risk factors for involutional ectropion. Further research is necessary to fully understand these associations.

Types of outcome measures

We list primary and secondary outcome measures below. If a trial was otherwise eligible (correct study design, population, and intervention/comparator) but did not report a listed outcome, then we attempted to contact the study authors, in order to establish whether a relevant outcome was measured but not reported. However, we did not plan to exclude otherwise eligible studies solely on the basis of reported outcomes. In several instances author contact was not immediately successful and we recorded these studies as Studies awaiting classification.

Where possible, we anticipated grouping outcomes by the following time points; the review authors used their judgement as to whether statistical pooling within these time categories was appropriate:

short‐term: 30 days
medium‐term: more than 30 days to 12 months
long‐term: more than 12 months.

In practice we found that the overwhelming majority of the data reported were for time points of between two and eight weeks postoperatively, with the majority being at either four or six weeks, sometimes with interim but unreported follow‐up points. We therefore decided that we would group all the data together for the outcomes reported; we did not consider dividing data reported at points that narrowly spanned 30 days to be informative.

Primary outcomes

Surgical site infection measured as: occurrence of postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) as defined by the CDC criteria (Horan 2008), or the study authors' definition of SSI. We did not differentiate between superficial and deep incisional infection. We planned to document septicaemia or septic shock under this outcome.
Wound dehiscence within 30 days of operation. This included both superficial dehiscence (involving skin and subcutaneous tissues) or deep dehiscence (burst abdomen or dehiscence of fascia). Postoperative wound dehiscence refers to wound disruption resulting from poor wound healing. This may be caused by various factors, including infection, as well as the type of incision and patient characteristics, such as diabetes or smoking (Sandy‐Hodgetts 2015).

Secondary outcomes

30‐day mortality/in‐hospital mortality
Proportion of participants with postoperative SSI using systemic antibiotics within 30 days of surgery
Occurrence of infections that show antibiotic resistance
Adverse events including postoperative abscess formation; we planned to include these, where reported, as total number of individuals with an adverse event in each intervention group
Surgical re‐intervention rates (including the placement of radiologically‐guided drains and joint revision surgery)
Mean length of hospital stay
Number of hospital readmissions.

Adverse Events

Adverse events led to study discontinuation of one participant in the eye cream study (COVID-19) and two participants in the eye makeup remover study (one with periorbital swelling [considered treatment-related]; one who sustained a concussion with associated eye contusion [considered not treatment-related]) (Table 5). Across studies, all AEs except one were of mild or moderate intensity and resolved by the end of the study. There was one serious AE of pneumonia (rated as severe and considered unrelated to the test material) in a participant in the lash and brow serum study. Few AEs were considered by the investigator to be treatment-related. One participant in the eye cream study experienced mild, treatment-related skin exfoliation of both under-eye areas. In the eye makeup remover study, one participant had moderate, treatment-related periorbital swelling (both eyes) and one participant had moderate, treatment-related eye pruritus, eye irritation, eye pain, and skin tightness in the periocular area of both eyes. There were no treatment-related AEs in the lash and brow study. Periocular AEs considered unrelated to the test material were hordeolum (two participants in the lash and brow serum study), eyelid irritation and pain (one participant in the eye makeup remover study), an arthropod bite to the outer eye area (one participant in the eye cream study), and an eye contusion (one participant in the eye makeup remover study who also experienced a concussion).

### Bacterial etiology of ocular and periocular infections, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and associated factors among patients attending eye unit of shashemene comprehensive specialized hospital, shashemene, Ethiopia [^117F2f9m]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The eye is one of the sense organs in humans which is important throughout life for daily activities. The awareness given to eye health and cleanliness is essential. Dust, high temperature, microorganisms, and other factors can lead to eye diseases which may lead to loss of sight.

Although the eye can be infected, it is remarkably resistant to colonization and infection by microbes. There is disparity in the type of bacteria that colonize the eye and other parts of the body. Although the eye is remarkably resistant to colonization and infection by microbes, it is prone to infection because the lens and vitreous are avascular and protein-rich structures; thus, ideal media for the proliferation of many pathogenic bacteria. The external part of the eye is susceptible to bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infections. Microorganisms can also invade and damage the internal parts of the eye, which often results in loss of vision. The source of eye infection can be exogenous or endogenous. Clinically external eye infections can be presented as conjunctivitis, keratitis, blepharitis, canaliculitis, dacryocystitis, external hordeolum and cellulitis. The clinical signs and symptoms of inflammation of the eyes along with pus are frequently caused by bacteria. Globally, purulent bacterial conjunctivitis is mainly caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The most common causative agents are Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. The microbial etiology and drug susceptibility, as well as resistance profile may differ with geographic location.

The common way of transmission of pathogens is the contact with contaminated fingers, eyelids margins, and adjacent skin, from the nasopharynx via the nasolacrimal duct, from infected eye drops or contact lenses and more rarely from the genitals or via the bloodstream. Bacterial eye infection needs immediate treatment. Treatment of bacterial eye infections involves empirical treatment with topical ophthalmic broad-spectrum antibiotic formulations that become a prevailing practice among ophthalmologists and general practitioners. This along with the irrational use of drugs, availability of antibiotics without prescription, has led to the development of resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

There are 1.4 million blind children estimated worldwide, of whom about 320,000 live in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of blindness was reported to be 1.6% and about 87.4% of the cases were due to preventable causes, bacterial infection is one of them. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of ocular and periocular infections, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and associated factors.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^116EmP2a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Systemic antibiotic treatment alone is usually the most appropriate treatment for patients with a small (< 4 cm in diameter) diverticular abscess and image guided percutaneous drainage is for those with a large (> 4 cm in diameter) one (Recommendation 2 B).

For patients in whom diverticulitis is complicated by peridiverticular abscess formation, the size of the abscess is an important determinant of the need for percutaneous drainage. Many patients who have small pericolic abscesses (4 cm or less in diameter) without peritonitis (Hinchey stage 1) can be treated conservatively with bowel rest and broad-spectrum antibiotics. For patients with peridiverticular abscesses that are larger than 4 cm in diameter (Hinchey stage 2), observational studies indicate that CT-guided percutaneous drainage can be beneficial. This procedure typically eliminates or reduces the size of the abscess, with a reduction in pain, resolution of leukocytosis, and defervescence usually seen within several days. Percutaneous drainage may allow for elective rather than emergency surgery, increasing the likelihood of a successful one-stage procedure. Patients whose abscess cavities contain gross feculent material tend to respond poorly, and early surgical intervention is usually required.

Elective colon resection should typically be advised if an episode of complicated diverticulitis is treated non-operatively (Recommendation 2 C).

After percutaneous drainage of a diverticular abscess, a later colectomy usually should be planned, because 41 percent of patients will otherwise develop severe recurrent sepsis. Some, but not all, retrospective studies suggest that the number of recurrences is associated with the chance that emergency surgery will be required at some point in the future.

The resection should be carried proximally to the compliant bowel and extend distally to the upper rectum (Recommendation 1 C).

It is usually sufficient to remove only the most severely affected segment; however, the proximal margin of resection should be in an area of pliable colon without hypertrophy or inflammation. Not all of the diverticula-bearing colon must be removed. Usually a sigmoid colectomy will suffice; however, occasionally the proximal resection margin must extend well into the descending colon or to the left transverse colon. Distally, the margin of resection should be where the taenia coli splay out onto the upper rectum. After sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis, an important predictor of recurrent diverticulitis is a colosigmoid rather than a colorectal anastomosis.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^112e95Eo]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Management — detection and clinical suspicion are emphasized. Detection and appropriate treatment can reduce signs and symptoms of blepharitis, and in severe cases it can prevent permanent structural damage and possible vision loss. This is particularly important in children, in whom chronic blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is often unrecognized and can be more severe, and it should be suspected in a child with recurrent conjunctivitis, keratitis, neovascularization, eyelid inflammation, hordeolum, chalazia, corneal opacification, and amblyopia. The presentation can be asymmetric and is often confused with herpetic disease. Tear film break-up time using fluorescein is significantly shorter in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), even if aqueous tear production is normal, which suggests that meibomian gland secretions are important in maintaining a stable precorneal tear film.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^113GCxbA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — Table 8 shared decision grid (key action statement [KAS]) outlines options of observation, cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, and manual removal with key precautions and time requirements. For cerumenolytic agents, they are "not recommended for ages < 3 years and in patients with nonintact ear drums", patients "Instill several drops of earwax-softening products once or twice daily for 3 to 5 days", and application takes " < 5 minutes to instill drops". Irrigation "Should not take > 30 minutes (includes preparation time)", offers "Immediate resolution of symptoms caused by the cerumen impaction", but is "Not recommended for patients with pressure equalization tubes, nonintact eardrum, and susceptibility to ear infection (see KAS 2B)". Manual removal provides "Immediate resolution of symptoms caused by the cerumen impaction", and its method is described as "Earwax is removed by the clinician inserting a curette, forceps, or suction tip into the ear, dislodging the wax, and retracting it", with risks including "Trauma to the ear canal skin leading to bleeding or infection; discomfort from the instruments or noise of the suction; and/or rare tinnitus or hearing loss from the noise of the suction". With observation, a "Small amount of cerumen could progress to impaction".

### Interventions to reduce Staphylococcus aureus in the management of eczema [^116C31qV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can cause secondary infection in eczema, and may promote inflammation in eczema that does not look infected. There is no standard intervention to reduce S. aureus burden in eczema. It is unclear whether antimicrobial treatments help eczema or promote bacterial resistance. This is an update of a 2008 Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions to reduce S. aureus for treating eczema.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to October 2018: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We searched five trials registers and three sets of conference proceedings. We checked references of trials and reviews for further relevant studies. We contacted pharmaceutical companies regarding ongoing and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of products intended to reduce S. aureus on the skin in people diagnosed with atopic eczema by a medical practitioner. Eligible comparators were a similar treatment regimen without the anti-staphylococcal agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our key outcomes were participant- or assessor-rated global improvement in symptoms/signs, quality of life (QOL), severe adverse events requiring withdrawal, minor adverse events, and emergence of antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms.

Main Results

We included 41 studies (1753 analysed participants) covering 10 treatment categories. Studies were conducted mainly in secondary care in Western Europe; North America; the Far East; and elsewhere. Twelve studies recruited children; four, adults; 19, both; and six, unclear. Fifty-nine per cent of the studies reported the mean age of participants (range: 1.1 to 34.6 years). Eczema severity ranged from mild to severe. Many studies did not report our primary outcomes. Treatment durations ranged from 10 minutes to 3 months; total study durations ranged from 15 weeks to 27 months. We considered 33 studies at high risk of bias in at least one domain. We present results for three key comparisons. All time point measurements were taken from baseline. We classed outcomes as short-term when treatment duration was less than four weeks, and long-term when treatment was given for more than four weeks. Fourteen studies evaluated topical steroid/antibiotic combinations compared to topical steroids alone (infective status: infected (two studies), not infected (four studies), unspecified (eight studies)). Topical steroid/antibiotic combinations may lead to slightly greater global improvement in good or excellent signs/symptoms than topical steroid alone at 6 to 28 days follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.21; 224 participants; 3 studies, low-quality evidence). There is probably little or no difference between groups for QOL in children, at 14 days follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.18, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.04; 42 participants; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). The subsequent results for this comparison were based on very low-quality evidence, meaning we are uncertain of their validity: severe adverse events were rare (follow-up: between 6 to 28 days): both groups reported flare of dermatitis, worsening of the condition, and folliculitis (325 participants; 4 studies). There were fewer minor adverse events (e.g. flare, stinging, itch, folliculitis) in the combination group at 14 days follow-up (218 participants; 2 studies). One study reported antibiotic resistance in children at three months follow-up, with similar results between the groups (65 participants; 1 study). Four studies evaluated oral antibiotics compared to placebo (infective status: infected eczema (two studies), uninfected (one study), one study's participants had colonisation but no clinical infection). Oral antibiotics may make no difference in terms of good or excellent global improvement in infants and children at 14 to 28 days follow-up compared to placebo (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.18 to 3.50; 75 participants; 2 studies, low-quality evidence). There is probably little or no difference between groups for QOL (in infants and children) at 14 days follow-up (MD 0.11, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.32, 45 participants, 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). The subsequent results for this comparison were based on very low-quality evidence, meaning we are uncertain of their validity: adverse events requiring treatment withdrawal between 14 to 28 days follow-up were very rare, but included eczema worsening (both groups), loose stools (antibiotic group), and Henoch-Schönlein purpura (placebo group) (4 studies, 199 participants). Minor adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and stomach and joint pains, at 28 days follow-up were also rare and generally low in both groups (1 study, 68 infants and children). Antibiotic resistance at 14 days was reported as similar in both groups (2 studies, 98 infants and children). Of five studies evaluating bleach baths compared to placebo (water) or bath emollient (infective status: uninfected (two studies), unspecified (three studies)), one reported global improvement and showed that bleach baths may make no difference when compared with placebo at one month follow-up (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.63; 36 participants; low-quality evidence). One study showed there is probably little or no difference in QOL at 28 days follow-up when comparing bleach baths to placebo (MD 0.90, 95% CI -1.32 to 3.12) (80 infants and children; moderate-quality evidence). We are uncertain if the groups differ in the likelihood of treatment withdrawals due to adverse events at two months follow-up (only one dropout reported due to worsening itch (placebo group)) as the quality of evidence was very low (1 study, 42 participants). One study reported that five participants in each group experienced burning/stinging or dry skin at two months follow-up, so there may be no difference in minor adverse events between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.87, 36 participants, low-quality evidence). Very low-quality evidence means we are also uncertain if antibiotic resistance at four weeks follow-up is different between groups (1 study, 80 participants ≤ 18 years).

Authors' Conclusions

We found insufficient evidence on the effects of anti-staphylococcal treatments for treating people with infected or uninfected eczema. Low-quality evidence, due to risk of bias, imprecise effect estimates and heterogeneity, made pooling of results difficult. Topical steroid/antibiotic combinations may be associated with possible small improvements in good or excellent signs/symptoms compared with topical steroid alone. High-quality trials evaluating efficacy, QOL, and antibiotic resistance are required.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of heat illness: 2024 update [^112fZttN]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Chemical cold packs and ice packs — Limited studies show no benefit in heat reduction with traditional placement of ice or chemical cold packs over major vessels; ice packs have greater cooling capacity than chemical cold packs and, if used, are most efficacious when wet and covering the entire body; in a small translational study, chemical cold packs applied to the palms, soles, and cheeks showed twice the cooling rate compared to traditional major-vessel placements; Recommendations: If ice packs are used, we recommend applying them to cover the entire body (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). If too few ice packs are available to cover the entire body, we recommend they be applied to the cheeks, palms, and soles rather than the skin covering the major vessels (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Heated, humidified air for the common cold [^1143Lxhb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Heated, humidified air is used by common cold sufferers since the invention of the steam kettle. There is scientific literature available investigating this mode of therapy using a rhinotherm. The present reviews addresses to the use of hot, humid air in common cold.

Objectives

To assess the effects of inhaling heated water vapour with the help of a rhinotherm (an equipment designed to deliver heated water vapour to a person's nasal cavity), in the treatment of the common cold by comparing: a. symptoms b. viral shedding c. nasal resistance after a natural or experimentally induced common cold.

Search Strategy

In the initial review published in issue 3, 1999 of The Cochrane Library, we searched MEDLINE with MeSH headings: common cold, rhinopharyngitis, inhalation, steam, heated vapour, rhinothermy (January 1966 to July 1999). EMBASE, Current Contents, review articles, cross references were also searched. Attempts were also made to contact the manufacturers for any unpublished data. In this updated review, we have searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November Week 2, 2003), EMBASE (January 1990 to November 2003), and Current Contents (current five years).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials using heated water vapour in a standardized way in patients with the common cold or volunteers with experimental induction of rhinovirus infection were included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

All the articles retrieved were initially subjected to a review for inclusion / exclusion criteria. Review articles, editorials, abstracts with inadequate outcome description were excluded. Studies selected for inclusion were subjected to a methodological assessment.

Main Results

The results of a systematic review of six trials with 319 participants, support the use of warm vapour inhalations in the common cold in terms of relief of symptoms (Odds Ratio with 95% CI 0.31, 0.16–0.60, Relative risk 0.56, 0.4–0.79). Results on symptom score indices were equivocal. None of the studies demonstrated a worsening of clinical symptom scores. One study demonstrated increased nasal resistance one week after steam inhalation in contrast to an earlier study which showed improvement in the nasal resistance. There was no evidence of decreased viral shedding measured by virus isolation in the nasal secretions (Tyrrell 1989a) or measurement of viral titres in nasal washings among treatment group. The rhinovirus titres in the nasal washings from the treatment group were the same as those of the placebo group on day one prior to the treatment and on all four days after the treatment. The area under curve (Hendley 1994) was also similar in the placebo and treatment groups for titres of virus in the nasal washings as were the average viral titres across five days of follow up, the maximum values after treatment, and viral shedding velocity i.e. amount of virus shed per day (Hendley 1994). Minor side effects due to thermal stress were reported in all the studies.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Three trials demonstrated beneficial effects on the symptoms of the common cold. One study from Israel showed a decrease in nasal resistance measured by peak nasal expiratory and inspiratory flow rate. Studies done in North America failed to show any objective improvement in outcome measures with the study intervention. A multi-centre double blind randomised controlled trial testing this therapy with uniform outcome measures is recommended.

### Interventions for acute internal hordeolum [^11238Lfh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hordeolum is a common, painful inflammation of the eyelid margin that is usually caused by bacterial infection. The infection affects oil glands of the eyelid and can be internal or external. In many cases, the lesion drains spontaneously and resolves untreated; however, the inflammation can spread to other ocular glands or tissues, and recurrences are common. If unresolved, acute internal hordeolum can become chronic or can develop into a chalazion. External hordeola, also known as styes, were not included in the scope of this review.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of nonsurgical treatments for acute internal hordeolum compared with observation or placebo.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, (January 1950 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to July 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 26 July 2012.

Selection Criteria

The selection criteria for this review included randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials of participants diagnosed with acute internal hordeolum. Studies of participants with external hordeolum (stye), chronic hordeolum, or chalazion were excluded. Nonsurgical interventions of interest included the use of hot or warm compresses, lid scrubs, antibiotics, or steroids compared with observation, placebo, or other active interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the references identified by electronic searches for inclusion in this review. No relevant studies were found. The reasons for exclusion were documented.

Main Results

No trials were identified for inclusion in this review. Most of the references identified from our search reported on external hordeola or chronic internal hordeola. The few references specific to acute internal hordeolum reported mostly recommendations for treatment or were reports of interventional case series, case studies, or other types of observational study designs and were published more than 20 years ago.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find any evidence for or against the effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions for the treatment of hordeolum. Controlled clinical trials would be useful in determining which interventions are effective for the treatment of acute internal hordeolum.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of heat illness: 2019 update [^117My9H4]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Minor and moderate heat illness treatment strategies: Heat cramps are relieved with oral salt solutions or electrolyte replacement that may be isotonic or hypertonic, and heat edema is reversed by extremity elevation or wearing of compression stockings, whereas diuretics are ineffective and may worsen volume depletion. Heat syncope by definition is self-limiting; after consideration of other causes or trauma, treatment consists of ensuring replacement of vascular volume with isotonic oral fluids and rest in a cool environment, and individuals at risk for heat syncope should move often and flex their larger leg muscles to prevent peripheral pooling of blood from cutaneous vasodilation; an individual with heat syncope is likely underacclimatized to the heat, and caution is warranted before immediate return to regular activity. Heat exhaustion results from both cardiovascular and thermal strain; mild cases generally resolve with removing the patient from the hot environment, cessation of physical activity, and rehydration with oral isotonic fluids, while severe heat exhaustion may require intravenous replacement of fluids as well as conductive and convective cooling, and because heat exhaustion can lead to cessation of activity and collapse, it is important to actively reverse the process, which can progress to heat stroke without proper cooling techniques.

### Low level light therapy for the treatment of recalcitrant chalazia: a sample case summary [^11527rKe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The authors reviewed LLLT treatment of chalazia since 2017 in one practice in patients ranging in age from 4 to 93 years old. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first series of patients reported in the literature.

As noted earlier, alternative treatment options range from warm compresses to surgical excision. A randomized multicenter clinical trial of 105 patients (141 cases), found 18% (with an additional 30% lost to follow-up presumably due to chalazia resolving) had complete resolution after warm compresses treatment with or without the addition of topical antibiotic or antibiotic steroid combination; despite similar outcomes, patients had higher satisfaction if they were given prescription medication. Of the cases that completely resolved, 86% resolved within 6 months; chalazia that resolved fully took less time than those which partially resolved (1.5 vs 2.2 months). If chalazia were present for greater than 2 months, then they were more likely to benefit from the initial procedure being more invasive. Jackson et al noted that treatment success was 29% with warm compresses and chloramphenicol ointment within 3 months versus 72% after I&C. Steroid injections offer advantages over surgical excision since they can be used for multiple lesions and for chalazia close to the punctum to avoid injury and potential epiphora as well as when the patient is less cooperative such as in a pediatric population. Steroid injections using triamcinolone acetonide are usually administered directly to the lesion. Intralesional steroid injection reduced chalazia size by more than 80% in 60% of patients after one injection and 20% of patients after two injections over an average time of 2.5 weeks with no difference between new and recurrent cases; if significant improvement was not noted after two injections then surgical intervention appears more suitable.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

XDEMVY was evaluated in 833 patients with Demodex blepharitis in two randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled studies (Saturn-1 and Saturn-2) with 42 days of treatment. The most common ocular adverse reaction observed in controlled clinical studies with XDEMVY was instillation site stinging and burning which was reported in 10% of patients. Other ocular adverse reactions reported in less than 2% of patients were chalazion/hordeolum and punctate keratitis.

### Recommendations for rosacea diagnosis, classification and management: update from the global ROSacea COnsensus 2019 panel [^117PR9Y2]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

A transition from a subtyping to a phenotyping approach in rosacea is underway, allowing individual patient management according to presenting features instead of categorization by predefined subtypes. The ROSacea COnsensus (ROSCO) 2017 recommendations further support this transition and align with guidance from other working groups.

Objectives

To update and extend previous global ROSCO recommendations in line with the latest research and continue supporting uptake of the phenotype approach in rosacea through clinical tool development.

Methods

Nineteen dermatologists and two ophthalmologists used a modified Delphi approach to reach consensus on statements pertaining to critical aspects of rosacea diagnosis, classification and management. Voting was electronic and blinded.

Results

Delphi statements on which the panel achieved consensus of ≥ 75% voting 'Agree' or 'Strongly agree' are presented. The panel recommends discussing disease burden with patients during consultations, using four questions to assist conversations. The primary treatment objective should be achievement of complete clearance, owing to previously established clinical benefits for patients. Cutaneous and ocular features are defined. Treatments have been reassessed in line with recent evidence and the prior treatment algorithm updated. Combination therapy is recommended to benefit patients with multiple features. Ongoing monitoring and dialogue should take place between physician and patients, covering defined factors to maximize outcomes. A prototype clinical tool (Rosacea Tracker) and patient case studies have been developed from consensus statements.

Conclusions

The current survey updates previous recommendations as a basis for local guideline development and provides clinical tools to facilitate a phenotype approach in practice and improve rosacea patient management. What's already known about this topic? A transition to a phenotype approach in rosacea is underway and is being recommended by multiple working groups. New research has become available since the previous ROSCO consensus, necessitating an update and extension of recommendations. What does this study add? We offer updated global recommendations for clinical practice that account for recent research, to continue supporting the transition to a phenotype approach in rosacea. We present prototype clinical tools to facilitate use of the phenotype approach in practice and improve management of patients with rosacea.

### Safety and efficacy of broadBand intense pulsed light therapy for dry eye disease with meibomian gland dysfunction [^111N4wxV]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

BroadBand Light (BBL™) is a high-quality, enhanced IPL modality that uses polychromatic, non-coherent, continuous light waves from the visible (420 nm) to the infrared (1400 nm) spectrum.BBL-IPL is known for its relative safety, high skin coverage rate, and minimal recovery time. As compared to IPL alone, BBL offers larger spot sizes, a wider range of filters and a continuous pulsing mode, which enhance the efficacy and safety of treatments. Recently, Zhang-Nunes et alreported an improvement in dry eye symptoms and blepharitis and hordeolum frequency with some temporary adverse effects after BBL-IPL treatment in patients with DED from MGD. To our knowledge, no other studies have evaluated the use of Sciton ® BBL-IPL in treating DED with MGD. We carried out a single-center, retrospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BBL-IPL treatment in patients diagnosed with DED with MGD.

### Effects of chalazion and its treatments on the meibomian glands: a nonrandomized, prospective observation clinical study [^111Ussvc]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

A previous study found that the ratio of cholesterol/cholesterol esters (Chl/CE) was increased in the abnormal lipid component of chalazion and suggested that an increase in Chl levels might send a chemotactic signal to inflammatory cells to invade the meibomian gland. The inflammatory cells may cause a physical blockage of the meibomian gland or meibum thickening, which would obstruct the expression of meibum. As a result, this abnormal lipid material might invade the surrounding tissues and intensify the inflammatory response in the meibomian glands. This vicious cycle may exist during the formation and expansion of a chalazion before treatment, and occasionally, a chalazion may enlarge even during conservative treatment. As mentioned above, the range of meibomian gland loss was related to the range of chalazion itself. Therefore, the best strategy to reduce the range of meibomian gland loss is to cure the chalazion as soon as possible. Based on our observation, chalazion can be cured rapidly by surgery. In fact, one study showed that complete resolution rates were low for three conservative treatment methods and suggested that ophthalmologists, particularly those in subspecialty clinics such as oculoplastics, can use surgical or invasive therapy earlier during treatment. Another study showed that incision and curettage was a good therapeutic choice for all chalazia. Despite such recommendations, many ophthalmologists choose to try conservative treatment first even if the chalazion size is large and the chalazion duration is long because they fear that surgery will damage the meibomian glands. However, our result showed that surgery did not expand the range of meibomian gland loss. In addition, a previous study considered that starting with surgical options earlier may also reduce patients' exposure to antibiotics and/or steroids, which may cause antibiotic resistance or increased intraocular pressure and steroid-induced glaucoma when overused. Therefore, we suggest that ophthalmologists perform surgery sooner during treatment to cure chalazion rapidly and thus control the range of meibomian gland loss in a short time.

### Ocular infection and inflammation [^1123g5wo]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Managing the inflamed or infected eye in the emergency setting presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the emergency physician; the causes and prognoses range from benign, self-limited illness to organ-threatening pathology. A careful history, with attention to comorbid illnesses and time course, is paramount, as is knowledge of the complete ophthalmologic examination. Much of the organ morbidity is ameliorated with prompt therapy in the emergency department and by initiating ophthalmologic consultation. In this article, the authors discuss the diagnosis and treatment of several types of eye infection, including conjunctivitis, episcleritis, keratitis, uveitis, hordeolum and chalazion, dacryocystitis, and cellulitis.

### Pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis: findings and outcomes in hispanic vs. non-hispanic patients [^115T9qvP]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

A single-center, retrospective chart review selected for pediatric patients seen at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago between 2018 and 2022 with the presence of anterior and/or posterior blepharitis or MGD in conjunction with corneal neovascularization at initial presentation and at least 6 months of follow-up. Patients with a history of corneal abnormalities unrelated to BKC as well as patients with MGD without corneal findings were excluded. This study was approved as exempt without need for informed consent due to its retrospective nature by the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. The study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Data collection was de-identified and HIPAA-compliant.

Patients were identified using the following ICD-10 diagnoses codes: H10.5XX (blepharoconjunctivitis), H01.0XX (blepharitis), H17.XX (corneal scarring), H16.4 (corneal neovascularization), H00.XX (chalazion, hordeolum) and H16.XX (marginal keratitis, corneal ulcer). Charts were reviewed to determine whether the inclusion criteria were met at initial presentation. Marginal keratitis was defined as peripheral stromal infiltrates in the presence of blepharitis.

### Herbalism in wound care: a case of garlic burn [^113VDxe6]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Wound care is an important aspect of patient counseling after skin biopsies. The methods commonly used promote maintenance of a clean, insulated, moist wound surface with application of plain petrolatum or topical antibiotic ointment under a bandage. Recently, investigators explored the scientific evidence for alternative, herbal-based topicals, such as a 30% garlic ointment. When used in appropriate concentrations, such treatments can be medically efficacious. As some patients may prefer and attempt herbal wound care due to cultural background or beliefs, physicians should be aware of such practices and the associated benefits/risks. Here, we highlight a case of cultural influence on a patient's post-biopsy care causing localized garlic burn, and briefly discuss the scientific data pertaining to cutaneous application of garlic.

### Current indications for the intrathoracic transposition of the omentum [^1121DZY5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Review

We present a review concerning the indications and the main arguments for and against the use of the omentum flap (OF) in the following clinical situations: mediastinitis and deep sternal infections after median sternotomy, reinforcement of the eso-gastric anastomosis after esophagectomy, prevention and treatment of the bronchial fistula after pulmonary resection, space-filling procedures for empyema, mediastinal tracheostomy, management of the infected intrathoracic vascular grafts / ventricular assist devices and heart OP. An emphasys was put on the level of evidence for using OP in each of the aforementioned clinical situations.

Mediastinitis and deep sternal infections after median sternotomy are an excellent indication for OP, which may be used alone or together with other flaps (usually pectoralis), with or without skin grafts, in order to achieve complete and definitive wound healing. In a meta-analysis of 16 observational studies including 1046 patients treated in units using both OF and muscle flaps for the treatment of mediastinitis / deep sternal infections, van Wingerdeen et al. (2011) found that there is no evidence to prove the superiority of reconstruction with muscle flaps versus a laparotomy-harvested OF, while the use of the omentum may be associated with a lower mortality and fewer complications. The OF can be easily mobilized using a small upper midline laparotomy and brought to fill the anterior mediastinum after debridement and/or the use of negative pressure wound therapy. The possibility to mobilize the OF using a laparoscopic approach makes this flap even more attractive by avoiding the morbidity associated with laparotomy. A specific but rare complication of OP for mediastinitis and deep sternal wound infections is the possibility to develop a retrosternal herniation of the abdominal viscera through the diaphragmatic defect; reoperation and treatment of this particular hernia is possible without compromising the OF.

### The cost-effectiveness of a novel online social therapy to maintain treatment effects from first-episode psychosis services: results from the horyzons randomized controlled trial [^111D8wiS]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Our primary outcome measure was a change in social functioning from baseline to 18-month follow-up, measured by the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). The PSP provides a single, overall rating score ranging from 1 to 100, with higher scores representing better personal and social functioning. The PSP is a reliable and validated tool and is recommended for measuring social functioning in psychosis. The PSP formed the outcome measure of the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA).

We also undertook a cost-utility analysis (CUA) based on Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), measured using the Assessment of Quality of Life 8-Dimensions (AQoL-8D) questionnaire. The AQoL-8D is a multi-attribute utility instrument, developed for the purpose of increasing sensitivity to psychosocial and mental health-related domains of QoL. The AQoL-8D performs best in the mental health context, and comprises 35 items that assess eight domains of QoL, including independent living, relationships, mental health, coping, pain, senses, self-worth, and life satisfaction. A total utility score is calculated, ranging from 0 (denoting death) to 1 (denoting full health), based on preferences from the Australian general population.QALYs were calculated using the "area under the curve" approach based on the utility scores at baseline, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up. A 5% discount rate was applied to QALYs that occurred after 12 months.

Service use and cost

Service use and associated costs were measured from a healthcare sector and a societal perspective, as recommended by The Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, using a Resource Use Questionnaire (RUQ) that was administered by a research assistant at baseline, 6, 12, and 18-month follow-up interviews. The baseline RUQ was relatively brief, capturing key resources used over the past month. Components of the resources used over 6 months in follow-up RUQ included: (i) headspace services, (ii) specialized mental health clinical services, (iii) private mental health services, (iv) medication and diagnostic tests, (v) inpatient services and emergency services, (vi) productivity impacts, and (vii) other nonhealth services (eg, financial advice and vocational guidance). In Australia, headspace centres are one-stop-shop youth-friendly early intervention mental health services for young people aged 12–25 years with access to a range of health professionals.

### Safety and efficacy of broadBand intense pulsed light therapy for dry eye disease with meibomian gland dysfunction [^114AxHAW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Safety

Zhang-Nunes et alreported reduced blepharitis and hordeolum frequency after one to four sessions of BBL-IPL treatment. However, four of their patients experienced temporary adverse effects including corneal abrasion, hyperpigmentation, and eyelash thinning. Despite two patients using oral doxycycline, a known skin-sensitizing agent, we observed no temporary or permanent adverse events. We also did not observe worsening in VA after treatment. Some studies suggest limiting IPL exposure to only the lower eyelids and Fitzpatrick skin types I–IV. Even though BBL-IPL therapy delivers more evenly distributed heat than IPL alone, our findings support the safety of BBL-IPL in Fitzpatrick skin types I–IV and both eyelids in the context of adequate eye protection for improving MG function.

Overall, BBL-IPL therapy offers similar functional benefits as IPL therapy alone with respect to dry eye symptoms, tear film quality and quantity, conjunctival injection, visual acuity, and meibomian gland health. However, we believe that in routine practice, BBL-IPL is superior to IPL because continuous pulsed light delivers more evenly distributed energy and heat, without compromising safety. Furthermore, BBL-IPL has a wider range of spot sizes and filters allowing for targeted treatment and a better safety profile for darker skin types. Interestingly, some recent photobiomodulation modalities, such as low-level light therapy (LLT), which involves athermal photoactivation, have also been shown to improve dry eye symptoms, tear breakup times, and meibomian gland structure with minimal side effects. Future research can compare the effects of BBL-IPL with other athermal treatment modalities like LLT on the improvement of DED from MGD.

### Oregano extract ointment for wound healing: a randomized, double-blind, petrolatum-controlled study evaluating efficacy [^112RtHYQ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Wound healing is a dynamic and complex process affected by tissue hydration, the presence of bacteria, inflammation, and other variables. Oregano has potent antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Studies of oregano ointment on wound healing are lacking.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of 3% oregano extract ointment on wound healing.

Methods

An investigator initiated, randomized, double-blind, petrolatum-controlled study was performed to determine the effects of oregano ointment on wound healing. Forty patients who underwent surgical excision were enrolled and randomized. Cultures were obtained on day 12 and scars were evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment tool on day 12, 45, and 90.

Results

The oregano ointment group had 19 percent of cultures test positive for Staphlococcus aureus compared to 41 percent in the petrolatum group. One patient in the oregano ointment group developed a cellulitis compared to three patients in the petrolatum group. The oregano group had a statistically significant improvement over petrolatum in scar color, pigmentation, and pliability.

Conclusion

Oregano extract ointment decreased bacterial contamination and subsequent infection on post-surgical wounds and had equivalent overall scar appearance compared to petrolatum.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^115kbXLr]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, CT, MRI, and EUS could have a role in the diagnosis of perianal abscesses, with the principal aims of excluding related conditions and correctly determining the regional anatomy and extent of the disease; the choice of the appropriate imaging investigation should take into account multiple factors, such as patient's past medical history, clinical presentation, local availability of resources, and skills. After the resolution of the acute phase, routine imaging after incision and drainage of the anorectal abscess is usually not required. An imaging follow-up is otherwise suggested in cases of recurrence, in the presence of suspected IBD and when there is evidence of a fistula and/or non-healing wound.

1.C - In patients with an anorectal abscess, what are the indications for surgical treatment and what is the appropriate timing for surgery?

In patients with anorectal abscess, we recommend a surgical approach with incision and drainage (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C).

In patients with anorectal abscess, we suggest to base the timing of surgery on the presence and severity of sepsis (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In fit, immunocompetent patients with a small perianal abscess and without systemic signs of sepsis we suggest considering an outpatient management (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

The primary treatment of anorectal abscesses remains surgical drainage, with the timing being dictated by the severity and nature of any sepsis. In general, the incision should be kept as close as possible to the anal verge to minimize the length of a potential fistula, while still providing adequate drainage and avoiding sphincteral damage. It is important to stress the high rate of recurrence after drainage, which can be as high as 44%. The risk factors associated with recurrence are inadequate drainage, loculations, horseshoe-type abscess, and time from disease onset to incision. The high recurrence rate and the associated risk factors emphasize the need for a complete and accurate drainage of the abscess. A recent randomized prospective study on needle aspiration treatment vs. incision and drainage of acute simple perianal abscess emphasized the importance of a complete drainage of the perianal abscess, with recurrence rates of 41% following needle aspiration compared to 15% after incision and drainage.

### Low infection rates with long-term dupilumab treatment in patients aged 6 Months to 5 Years: an open-label extension study [^114Wet7x]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Exposure‐adjusted numbers of patients with treatment‐emergent infections during the study treatment period.

Nonskin infections were less frequent in the OLE study (92.9 patients/100PY) compared with both the dupilumab (152.7 patients/100PY) and placebo group (207.4 patients/100PY) in the earlier 16‐week trial (Table 1). Nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection were the most common treatment‐emergent infections in the OLE study; however, their incidence was lower compared with both the dupilumab and placebo groups in the 16‐week trial (Table 2). A total of 3.1 patients/100PY in the OLE study had PT conjunctivitis, compared with 11.8 patients/100PY in the dupilumab group and 0 patients in the placebo group from the 16‐week trial (Table 2, Figure 1b). A small increase in the incidence of hand‐foot‐and‐mouth disease (4.1 patients/100PY), streptococcal pharyngitis (3.2 patients/100PY), rhinitis (2.7 patients/100PY), bacterial conjunctivitis (2.2 patients/100PY), sinusitis (1.8 patients/100PY), and hordeolum (1.8 patients/100PY) was observed in the OLE study, compared with an incidence of 0 in both the dupilumab and placebo groups in the 16‐week trial (Table 2).

### An evidence-based review of the treatment of peritonsillar abscess [^111Hn52Y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is commonly seen but still controversial. We performed an evidence-based review to answer 3 questions: Are steroids beneficial? Which is the best technique for acute surgical management? When is tonsillectomy indicated?

Study Design

We performed a MEDLINE search of the published literature using appropriate search terms to identify pertinent articles, which were reviewed and graded according to the evidence quality.

Results

Forty-two articles were analyzed. There are no published studies on steroids in PTA. There were 5 level I clinical studies on surgical technique, which indicated that needle aspiration, incision and drainage, and quinsy tonsillectomy are all effective for initial management. The overall PTA recurrence rate is 10% to 15%.

Conclusions

Overall, grade C evidence indicates that several methods of initial surgical drainage are equally effective, and the recurrence rate is low. The literature does not specifically address different treatments for children and adults.

### Consensus recommendations for the use of retinoids in ichthyosis and other disorders of cornification in children and adolescents [^113DoK2c]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

6 SYSTEMIC RETINOID EFFECTS ON THE EYE

To date, there is limited literature about the ophthalmologic effects of retinoids in patients with ichthyosis to provide evidence‐based surveillance and management guidelines. Both topical and systemic retinoids have been shown to reduce the severity of ectropion in children and adults. 9, 17, 90 However, the potential side effects of systemic retinoids on eye health are compounded by any ocular manifestations of the underlying ichthyosis. The acute and long‐term effects of retinoid use on ocular health in children and adolescents are unknown. Most of the current evidence is based on retrospective reviews of short‐term, episodic systemic isotretinoin use in adolescents and young adults with acne vulgaris.

Approximately 13.8% of adolescents on isotretinoin for acne experience ocular side effects. 62, 91, 92 The most common complaints include pruritus, photophobia, eye pain, burning, and gritty feeling or visual disturbance that may occur within days up to a few months following initiation of isotretinoin. These symptoms are dose dependent and can be attributed to ocular surface diseases, as well as refractive changes and retinal dysfunction. 93 Ocular surface diseases including conjunctivitis, hordeolum, chalazion, blepharitis, and dry eyes are likely due to decreased secretion from Meibomian glands that results in poor tear‐film quality. 91, 94, 95, 96 Refractive changes are likely secondary to corneal steepening and edema that cause myopic shift. 97, 98 Corneal opacity resulting from systemic therapy is rare, but can be permanent. 99, 100 Ocular toxicity from acitretin use in psoriasis was not detected after one month of treatment. 101 Nonetheless, the lowest daily retinoid dose able to manage cutaneous symptoms is recommended to minimize risks of ocular toxicity.

### Expert committee recommendations for acne management [^1151Czj9]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In 2003, an international committee of physicians and researchers in the field of acne, working together as the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne, developed consensus guidelines for the treatment of acne. These guidelines were evidence based when possible but also included the extensive clinical experience of this group of international dermatologists. As a result of the evaluation of available data and the experience, significant changes occurred in the management routines for acne. The greatest change arose on the basis of improved understanding of acne pathophysiology. The recommendation now is that acne treatments should be combined to target as many pathogenic factors as possible. A topical retinoid should be the foundation of treatment for most patients with acne, because retinoids target the microcomedo, the precursor to all acne lesions. Retinoids also are comedolytic and have intrinsic antiinflammatory effects, thus targeting 2 pathogenic factors in acne. Combining a topical retinoid with an antimicrobial agent targets 3 pathogenic factors, and clinical trials have shown that combination therapy results in significantly faster and greater clearing as opposed to antimicrobial therapy alone. Oral antibiotics should be used only in moderate-to-severe acne, should not be used as monotherapy, and should be discontinued as soon as possible (usually within 8–12 weeks). Because of their effect on the microcomedo, topical retinoids also are recommended as an important facet of maintenance therapy.

### Restylane lyft for aesthetic shaping of the nasal dorsum and radix: a randomized, No-treatment control, multicenter study [^116M8dWw]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment Procedure

Any cosmetics were removed before treatment, and the treatment area was cleaned with antiseptic solution. Local anesthesia was used at the investigators' discretion. Figure 1 illustrates the timing of treatments and follow-up visits. Re-treatment was not to be done for subjects in case they had an ongoing treatment-related adverse event.

Day 1

Subjects in the treatment group received a single treatment with a maximum of 1 mL of Restylane Lyft slowly injected subcutaneously and/or in the supraperiosteal plane in the nasal dorsum and/or radix region. Injections were done using a co-packed 29-gauge thin-wall needle and an aseptic technique. Retrograde linear threading injection was recommended. Digital pressure was applied as applicable on both sides of the dorsum to avoid lateral spreading of the product. Gentle massage of the treatment area was allowed to smooth the contour to the surrounding tissues. To reduce swelling and discomfort, ice packs could be applied on the treatment site for approximately 15 minutes.

Month 6

Subjects in the no-treatment control group were offered optional treatment with a maximum of 1 mL of Restylane Lyft (administered as described for day 1 above). Subjects in the Restylane Lyft group were offered optional re-treatment with a maximum of 0.5 mL of Restylane Lyft at month 6 only if they did not consent to participate in the extension study, and if the treating investigator assessed that they had not maintained or achieved optimal aesthetic improvement. If re-treatment was done, subjects completed the study after follow-up at month 6.5.

Month 12

Subjects in the extension study who had not maintained or achieved optimal aesthetic improvement (as assessed by the treating investigator) were offered optional re-treatment with a maximum of 0.5 mL of Restylane Lyft. If re-treatment was done, subjects completed the study after follow-up at month 12.5. If re-treatment was not done, subjects completed the study at the month-12 visit.

Posttreatment Care

Subjects were asked to avoid intensive physical training and extensive heat/sun or extreme cold in the first 24 hours after treatment. To prevent infections, subjects were asked to avoid touching the treated area and to not apply creams or cosmetics before the skin had healed. Subjects were also asked not to use heavy glasses during the study.

### Non-surgical interventions for acute internal hordeolum [^112A1PJV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A hordeolum is a common, painful inflammation of the eyelid margin that is usually caused by a bacterial infection. The infection affects oil glands of the eyelid and can be either internal or external. In many cases, the lesion drains spontaneously and resolves without treatment; however, the inflammation can spread to other ocular glands or tissues, and recurrences are common. If unresolved, an acute internal hordeolum can become chronic, or can develop into a chalazion. External hordeola, also known as styes, were not included in the scope of this review.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness, and when possible, the safety, of non-surgical treatments for acute internal hordeola compared with observation or placebo.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (2016; Issue 12)), MEDLINE Ovid, MEDLINE Ovid Epub Ahead of Print, MEDLINE Ovid In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE(R) Ovid Daily (January 1946 to December 2016), Embase (January 1947 to December 2016), PubMed (1948 to December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS (January 1982 to December 2016)), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT; www.controlled-trials.com (last searched 26 July 2012)), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 December 2016.

Selection Criteria

The selection criteria for this review included randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials of participants diagnosed with an acute internal hordeolum. Studies of participants with external hordeola (styes), chronic hordeola, or chalazia were excluded. Non-surgical interventions of interest included the use of hot or warm compresses, lid scrubs, antibiotics, or steroids compared with observation, placebo, or other active interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the references identified by electronic searches for inclusion in this review. No relevant studies were found. The reasons for exclusion were documented.

Main Results

No trials were identified for this review. Most of the references identified through our search reported on external hordeola or chronic internal hordeola. The few references specific to acute internal hordeola reported recommendations for treatment, were reports of interventional case series, case studies, or other types of observational study designs, and were published more than 20 years ago.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find any evidence for or against the effectiveness of non-surgical interventions for the treatment of an internal hordeolum. Controlled clinical trials would be useful to determine which interventions are effective for the treatment of acute internal hordeola.

### Effects of chalazion and its treatments on the meibomian glands: a nonrandomized, prospective observation clinical study [^116sPQx3]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Subjects

From August 2017 to August 2018, 71 patients (82 eyelids) who were cured of chalazion were enrolled in this study conducted at the Hankou Aier Eye Hospital, including 28 patients (28 eyelids) who received conservative treatment and 43 patients (54 eyelids) who underwent surgery. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) patients with primary chalazion and a single chalazion on one eyelid; (b) patients who were able to cooperate during examinations and received local anesthesia during surgery; and (c) patients without any other previous treatment. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) patients who accepted both conservative treatment and surgery during the study (patients for whom conservative treatment failed who then accepted surgery); (ii) patients with a local anesthetic drug allergy history; and (iii) patients with a concurrent eyelid infection combined with pain (hordeolum, cellulitis or conjunctivitis).

Patients were treated with conservative treatment when either of the following criteria were met: (a) the duration of the chalazion was less than 2 months from the time of the patient's complaint. (b) The chalazion had a horizontal width of less than 5 mm. Given the difficulty of assessing the total volume of each chalazion, the horizontal width of each chalazion was used to represent this value. The measurement method consisted of directly measuring the horizontal width with an ophthalmic surgical caliper under a slit lamp microscope. (c) The patient refused surgery. Otherwise, patients were treated with surgery (incision and curettage). Patients were considered cured when the chalazion completely resolved.

Because no clear standard for chalazion treatment selection is currently available, the treatment strategy depended on clinical experience and past studies.

Ethics statement

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hankou Aier Eye Hospital and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Examinations

Each patient completed two parts of the clinical examinations before treatment and at 1 month after complete chalazion resolution: a meibomian gland function assessment and meibomian gland morphology analysis of the chalazion area. All examinations were conducted by the same observer during the whole course of the study.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^114yU9cw]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis history assessment — questions that may help elucidate information include symptoms and signs such as redness, irritation, burning, tearing, itching, crusting of eyelashes, loss of eyelashes, eyelid sticking, blurring or fluctuating vision, contact lens intolerance, photophobia, increased frequency of blinking, and recurrent hordeolum; time of day when symptoms are worse, with morning worsening typical of blepharitis and later-day worsening typical of aqueous deficient dry eye; duration of symptoms; unilateral or bilateral presentation; exacerbating conditions such as smoke, allergens, wind, contact lenses, low humidity, retinoids, diet and alcohol consumption, eye makeup, and aqueous tear deficiency; symptoms and signs related to systemic diseases such as rosacea, atopy, psoriasis, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); current and previous systemic and topical medications including antihistamines or drugs with anticholinergic effects and past drugs such as isotretinoin that might affect the ocular surface; and recent exposure to an infected individual such as pediculosis palpebrarum (P. pubis). The ocular history may include previous intraocular and eyelid surgery and local trauma (mechanical, thermal, chemical, radiation); a history of cosmetic blepharoplasty is important because increased surface exposure may increase tear evaporation; and a history of hordeola and/or chalazia is common in patients with posterior blepharitis.

### Pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis: findings and outcomes in hispanic vs. non-hispanic patients [^113wRHud]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Data including demographic information, medical and ocular history, ophthalmic diagnoses, examination findings, and BKC treatments were collected at initial presentation (baseline), 6-month, 1-year, and successive annual increments until disease clearance or final follow-up. Unilateral refractive amblyopia was defined as > 2 line interocular difference in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) due to anisometropia (hyperopic, myopic, or astigmatic). Bilateral refractive amblyopia secondary to high hyperopia (> + 3.00), high myopia (< -6.00), or high astigmatism (> + 2.00) was defined as BCVA less than 20/25 in both eyes. In addition, history of eye and eyelid surgeries (e.g. chalazion incision and drainage) was recorded. BCVA for each eye was measured with age-appropriate optotypes (e.g. LEA figures, HOTV, or Snellen) and then converted into LogMAR format. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured by iCare tonometry (Icare USA, Inc, Raleigh, NC) or Tonopen (Reichert, Depew, NY). Cycloplegic refraction was performed by retinoscopy and when age-appropriate fine-tuned in the phoropter. Slit lamp findings included MGD, punctate epithelial erosions/superficial punctate keratopathy (PEE/SPK) as identified by fluorescein staining, eyelid scurf, chalazion/hordeolum, corneal infiltrates, corneal neovascularization, and corneal stromal scarring. Treatments such as eyelid hygiene (e.g. warm compresses, eyelid scrubs), erythromycin ointment, topical steroids, and oral antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin, doxycycline) were recorded.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^112TTNqD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Eczema, also called atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema, is a common and burdensome skin disease. Eczema is most common in early life, affecting up to 20% of infants and about 6% of school‐age children and adolescents and 5% of adults worldwide (De Lusignan 2021; Hay 2014; Langan 2023; Williams 2008). It is a chronic, fluctuating condition that varies in severity. In mild eczema, individuals may have only occasional localised patches of inflamed skin that cause minimal symptoms, but severe eczema causes extensive erythema, excoriations and chronic skin changes such as lichenification.

Eczema can have a substantial impact on quality of life and psychosocial domains (social, academic, and occupational) through persistent itch and the stigma associated with having visibly affected skin (Carroll 2005; Chamlin 2004; Drucker 2017; Lewis‐Jones 2006). The impact on quality of life can exceed that reported in other chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes, especially when eczema is severe or affects readily visible areas (Beattie 2006; Drucker 2017; Kemp 2003; Vittrup 2023). Eczema also causes an economic burden and, in the USA alone, the direct costs of eczema are estimated as over 1 billion US dollars per year (Drucker 2017). Costs which affect people with eczema and their families include buying moisturisers, washing products or special clothing and taking time off work to care for a child with eczema (Carroll 2005).

### Peceleganan spray for the treatment of skin wound infections: a randomized clinical trial [^114G83xv]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Interventions

The site researcher decided the investigated wound area for each eligible patient based on the criteria described in the study protocol (Supplement 1). Clinicians were instructed to debride each wound using standard procedures before applying the investigation or control treatment after randomization. An adherence assessment was clearly and truthfully documented in each patient's electronic medical record. The details of the drug administration procedures were described in the study protocol (Supplement 1). For both groups, the dressing change and drug administration were performed once a day, at a fixed hour, and repeated for 7 consecutive days. Standard wound care was administered to the other wound areas not included in the study. During the observation period of the trial (days 1–8), drugs that could potentially promote wound healing were not applied to the wounds under study. In addition, topical and systemic application of any other antibiotics or any preparation with bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects was not permitted. Other topical agents such as local analgesics or local anesthetics, moisturizers, cosmetics, and sunscreens were also not applied. During the observation period, patients were forbidden to use any physical therapy on the wounds under study.

Outcome Measures

On days 5 and 8 after treatment onset (day 8 was also regarded as the first day after the end of the treatments), at each center, 1 or 2 assessors who were not aware of the patients' group randomization evaluated the wounds using the SIRS. The remaining drugs on the wounds were cleaned before the blinded evaluation. Photographs of each wound were taken using standard procedures. The clinical efficacy evaluation was performed by comprehensively considering the SIRS scores, the patient's clinical symptoms, physical examination results, and laboratory test results. The criteria for efficacy were reduction of SIRS scores greater than 50% and improved symptoms, physical examination signs, and nonmicrobiological laboratory test results. The treatments exhibiting decreases in SIRS scores of less than 50%, those exhibiting increases or no change in SIRS score, those showing recent signs of infection, and those in which the patients used other antimicrobial treatments were all considered as lacking efficacy. Cases for which it was impossible to determine the efficacy because of a lack of data were considered uncertain.

### Western black willow [^116cDNtv]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions include, but are not limited to urticaria; itching; edema of extremities; respiratory wheezing or asthma; dyspnea; cyanosis; tachycardia; lacrimation; marked perspiration; flushing of face, neck or upper chest; mild persistent clearing of throat; hacking cough or persistent sneezing.

1)	Local Reactions

A mild burning immediately after injection is expected; this usually subsides in 10–20 seconds. Prolonged pain or pain radiating up arm is usually the result of intramuscular injection, making this injection route undesirable. Subcutaneous injection is the recommended route.

Small amounts of erythema and swelling at the site of injection are common. Reactions should not be considered significant unless they persist for at least 24 hours or exceed 50 mm in diameter.

Larger local reactions are not only uncomfortable, but indicate the possibility of a severe systemic reaction if dosage is increased. In such cases dosage should be reduced to the last level not causing reaction and maintained for two or three treatments before cautiously increasing.

Large, persistent local reactions or minor exacerbations of the patient's allergic symptoms may be treated by local cold applications and/or use of oral antihistamines.

2)	Systemic Reactions

Systemic reactions range from mild exaggeration of patient's allergic symptoms to anaphylactic reactions.14Very sensitive patients may show a rapid response. It cannot be overemphasized that, under certain unpredictable combinations of circumstances, anaphylactic shock is always a possibility. Fatalities are rare but can occur.5Other possible systemic reaction symptoms are fainting, pallor, bradycardia, hypotension, angioedema, cough, wheezing, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and urticaria.13, 14

Careful attention to dosage and administration limit such reactions. Allergenic extracts are highly potent to sensitive individuals and OVERDOSE could result in anaphylactic symptoms. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians administering allergenic extracts understand and prepare for treatment of severe reactions. Refer to "OVERDOSAGE" section.

### Differential diagnosis of the swollen red eyelid [^116TyHyn]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The swollen red eyelid is a common presentation in primary care. An understanding of the anatomy of the orbital region can guide care. Factors that guide diagnosis and urgency of care include acute vs. subacute onset of symptoms, presence or absence of pain, identifiable mass within the eyelid vs. diffuse lid swelling, and identification of vision change or ophthalmoplegia. Superficial skin processes presenting with swollen red eyelid include vesicles of herpes zoster ophthalmicus; erythematous irritation of contact dermatitis; raised, dry plaques of atopic dermatitis; and skin changes of malignancies, such as basal or squamous cell carcinoma. A well-defined mass at the lid margin is often a hordeolum or stye. A mass within the midportion of the lid is commonly a chalazion. Preseptal and orbital cellulitis are important to identify, treat, and differentiate from each other. Orbital cellulitis is more often marked by changes in ability of extraocular movements and vision as opposed to preseptal cellulitis where these characteristics are classically normal. Less commonly, autoimmune processes of the orbit or ocular tumors with mass effect can create an initial impression of a swollen eyelid.

### Acupuncture for acute hordeolum [^1176g2NY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hordeolum is an acute, purulent inflammation of the eyelid margin usually caused by obstructed orifices of the sebaceous glands of the eyelid. The condition, which affects sebaceous glands internally or externally, is common. When the meibomian gland in the tarsal plate is affected, internal hordeolum occurs, while when the glands of Zeis or Moll associated with eyelash follicles are affected, external hordeolum, or stye occurs. The onset of hordeolum is usually self limited, and may resolve in about a week with spontaneous drainage of the abscess. When the condition is severe, it can spread to adjacent glands and tissues. Recurrences are very common. As long as an internal hordeolum remains unresolved, it can develop into a chalazion or generalized eyelid cellulitis. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical therapy aimed to treat disease by using fine needles to stimulate specific points on the body. However, it is unclear if acupuncture is an effective and safe treatment for acute hordeolum.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture to treat acute hordeolum compared with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or other active treatment. We also compared the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture plus another treatment with that treatment alone.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS), three major Chinese databases, as well as clinical trial registers all through 7 June 2016. We reviewed the reference lists from potentially eligible studies to identify additional randomised clinical trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of people diagnosed with acute internal or external hordeola. We included RCTs comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture or no treatment, other active treatments, or comparing acupuncture plus another treatment versus another treatment alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures used by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 6 RCTs with a total of 531 participants from China. The mean age of the participants ranged from 18 to 28 years. Four RCTs included participants diagnosed with initial acute hordeolum with a duration of less than seven days; one RCT included participants diagnosed with initial acute hordeolum without specifying the duration; and one RCT included participants with recurrent acute hordeolum with a mean duration of 24 days. About 55% (291/531) of participants were women. Three RCTs included participants with either external or internal hordeolum; one RCT included participants with only external hordeolum; and two RCTs did not specify the type of hordeolum. Follow-up was no more than seven days after treatment in all included RCTs; no data were available for long-term outcomes. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was low to very low, and we judged all RCTs to be at high or unclear risk of bias. Three RCTs compared acupuncture with conventional treatments. We did not pool the data from these RCTs because the conventional treatments were not similar among trials. Two trials showed that resolution of acute hordeolum was more likely in the acupuncture group when compared with topical antibiotics (1 RCT; 32 participants; risk ratio (RR) 3.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 9.70; low-certainty of evidence) or oral antibiotics plus warm compresses (1 RCT; 120 participants; RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.78; low-certainty of evidence). In the third trial, little or no difference in resolution of hordeolum was observed when acupuncture was compared with topical antibiotics plus warm compresses (1 RCT; 109 participants; RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; low-certainty of evidence). One RCT mentioned adverse outcomes, stating that there was no adverse event associated with acupuncture. Three RCTs compared acupuncture plus conventional treatments (two RCTs used topical antibiotics and warm compresses, one RCT used topical antibiotics only) versus the conventional treatments alone. One of the three RCTs, with very low-certainty evidence, did not report the resolution of acute hordeolum; however, it reported that acute hordeolum relief might be higher when acupuncture was combined with conventional treatments than with conventional treatments alone group (60 participants; RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.00 to 3.23). Pooled analysis of the remaining two RCTs, with low-certainty evidence, estimated resolution of acute hordeolum was slightly higher in the combined treatment group compared with the conventional treatment alone group at 7-day follow-up (210 participants; RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.23; I² = 0%). None of the three RCTs reported adverse outcomes. Among the included RCTs, four participants, two from the acupuncture plus conventional treatments group and two from the conventional treatments alone group, withdrew due to exacerbation of symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture with or without conventional treatments may provide short-term benefits for treating acute hordeolum when compared with conventional treatments alone. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low mainly due to small sample sizes, inadequate allocation concealment, lack of masking of the outcome assessors, inadequate or unclear randomization method, and a high or unreported number of dropouts. All RCTs were conducted in China, which may limit their generalizability to non-Chinese populations. Because no RCTs included a valid sham acupuncture control, we cannot rule out a potential expectation/placebo effect associated with acupuncture. As resolution is based on clinical observation, the outcome could be influenced by the observer's knowledge of the assigned treatment. Adverse effects of acupuncture were reported sparsely in the included RCTs, and, when reported, were rare. RCTs with better methodology, longer follow-up, and which are conducted among other populations are warranted to provide more general evidence regarding the benefit of acupuncture to treat acute hordeolum.

### Treatment set ts335657 [^115uTTTQ]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Systemic reactions may range from mild exaggeration of the patient's allergic symptoms to anaphylactic reactions. Very sensitive patients may show a rapid response. In some instances a severe systemic reaction with blood pressure fall and/or shock may occur. Quantitation of patient's sensitivity combined with careful early observation is essential for safe skin testing and treatment.

Other reactions include, but are not necessarily limited to urticaria, itching, edema of the extremities, respiratory wheezing or asthma, dyspnea, cyanosis, tachycardia, lacrimation, marked perspiration, flushing of the face, neck or upper chest, mild persistent clearing of the throat, hacking cough, or persistent sneezing.

1) 	Local Reactions

Small amounts of erythema and swelling at the site of injection are common, the extent varying with the patient. Such reactions should not be considered significant unless they persist for at least 24 hours or exceed 50 mm. in diameter.

Larger local reactions are not only uncomfortable, but also indicate the possibility of a systemic reaction if dosage is increased. In such cases the dosage should be reduced to the last level not causing the reaction and maintained at this level for two or three treatments before cautiously increasing again.

Large, persistent local reactions or minor exacerbations of the patient's allergic symptoms may be treated by local cold applications and/or the use of oral antihistamines, but they should be considered a warning of possible severe systemic reactions and the need for temporarily reduced dosages.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^111qQ7jV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 9, outcomes assessment — clinicians should assess patients at the conclusion of in-office treatment of cerumen impaction and document the resolution of impaction; if the impaction is not resolved, the clinician should use additional treatment; if full or partial symptoms persist despite resolution of impaction, the clinician should evaluate the patient for alternative diagnoses. Recommendation is based on RCTs with limitations and with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C with a high level of confidence; benefits include detecting complications, encouraging proper diagnosis, and ensuring effective therapy; risks and costs relate to additional treatment or evaluation. Quality improvement focuses on ensuring effectiveness of treatment and accurate diagnosis, and value judgments emphasize clinician assessment after treatment to avoid misdiagnosis.

3.4 Safety

During the double‐blind randomized treatment phase, 21 patients (52.5%) in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group and 11 patients (50%) in the placebo group reported TEAE. Overall, eight (20.0%) patients reported drug‐related TEAE in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group, with no such events reported in the placebo group. The most commonly reported TEAE were hordeolum (10.0%, four patients) and tinea pedis (7.5%, three patients) in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group, and URTI (9.1%, two patients) and headache (9.1%, two patients) in the placebo group. In an analysis of pooled TEAE for the entire study period of 64 weeks, 45 patients (76.3%) reported TEAE and 25 patients (42.4%) reported drug‐related TEAE. The most commonly reported TEAE were nasopharyngitis (16.9%, 10 patients), URTI (16.9%, 10 patients), tinea pedis (10.2%, six patients), and urticaria (10.2%, six patients). The most commonly reported drug‐related TEAE were hordeolum, tinea pedis, and urticaria (6.8%, four patients each) and nasopharyngitis (5.1%, three patients). Only one patient in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group, up to week 64, was diagnosed with candidiasis. The most commonly reported TEAE reported throughout the study are shown in Table S2.

### Minimal excision and primary suture is a cost-efficient definitive treatment for pilonidal disease with low morbidity: a population-based interventional and a cross-sectional cohort study [^115z6pRg]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aetiology of pilonidal disease is not completely understood. A foreign body reaction to subcutaneous accumulation of hairs with recurrent abscesses and eventually the development of chronic discharging tract is usually involved, but hairs are not always found. The origin or entrance for these hairs may be a barely visible pit or larger epithelial lined sinus openings in the midline. Intermittent or continuous discharge is common from the midline sinuses or from the tract that drains the abscess, often located proximal and lateral to the midline sinuses. See fact box for further information on definitions.

Several surgical methods are described, and the optimal method is controversial. Many studies are flawed because of defects in study design, unclear patient selection and exclusions not stated, short or incomplete follow-up, and failure to assess treatment costs and patient inconvenience. Traditional treatment involves a large excision under general anaesthesia, often with an overnight stay in hospital. The wound is left open for secondary healing or closed with or without surgical flaps. Wound complications, needing frequent dressings and sick leave, are common. Studies have shown 20% unhealed wounds at 3 months and up to 22% recurrence rate after 5-year follow-up.

### Interventions for acute internal hordeolum [^115keSsj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Hordeolum is a common, painful, inflammation of the eyelid margin that is usually caused by bacterial infection. The infection affects oil glands of the eyelid and can be internal or external. In many cases, the lesion drains spontaneously and resolves untreated; however, the inflammation can spread to other ocular glands or tissues and recurrences are common. If unresolved, acute internal hordeolum can become chronic or develop into a chalazion. External hordeola, also known as styes, were not included in the scope of this review.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of non-surgical treatments for acute internal hordeolum compared to observation or placebo.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 6), MEDLINE (January 1950 to June 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2010), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to June 2010), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 21 June 2010.

Selection Criteria

The selection criteria for this review included randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials of patients diagnosed with acute internal hordeolum. Studies of patients with external hordeolum (stye), chronic hordeolum or chalazion were excluded. Non-surgical interventions of interest included the use of hot or warm compresses, lid scrubs, antibiotics, or steroids compared to observation, placebo, or other active interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the references identified by the electronic searches for inclusion in this review. No relevant studies were found. The reasons for exclusion were documented.

Main Results

There were no trials identified for inclusion in this review. The majority of the references identified from our search reported on external hordeola or chronic internal hordeola. The few references specific to acute internal hordeolum reported mostly recommendations for treatment or were reports of interventional case series, case studies, or other types of observational study designs and were published over 20 years ago.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find any evidence for or against the effectiveness of non-surgical interventions for the treatment of hordeolum. Controlled clinical trials would be useful in determining which interventions are effective for the treatment of acute internal hordeolum.

### Eyelid nodule with persistent growth [^114cua2B]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

History

A 47-year-old, otherwise healthy man was referred for an indolent nodule on his left lower eyelid with a 6-month history of continuous growth. Initially diagnosed as a hordeolum, treatments with antibiotics and corticosteroids (administered locally and systemically) remained ineffective. The lesion was shiny, orange-colored, and lacked ulceration or scaling (Fig 1). No systemic symptoms were noted, and laboratory tests were normal. Travel history was unremarkable. Full skin examination revealed no additional pathologies. Histopathologic examination revealed a skin biopsy showed a dermal infiltrate of predominantly lymphocytes and macrophages with intracytoplasmic basophilic structures (Fig 2). PAS and Grocott stains were negative.

### Foot care in epidermolysis bullosa: evidence-based guideline [^11686TX1]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Special considerations

Heloma (corn): the common corn is heloma durum. Heloma miliare (seed corns) are frequently seen in EB due to toe and foot deformity. Heloma neurovascular are encountered but to a lesser degree (Quality evidence level 4: expert opinion).
Neurovascular hyperkeratosis. This is a form of callus in which nerve endings and blood vessels become prominent in the epidermis in response to trauma and treatment. This condition can present in patients with EB (estimated < 1%). The area is sensitive, painful and difficult to treat, as normal debridement causes pain and bleeding. Although rare, it is very debilitating in the small number of patients with EB affected. It probably results from long‐standing gross hyperkeratosis and usually affects skin overlying the calcaneum and hallux (Quality evidence level 4: expert opinion). Debridement of these lesions by a podiatrist is also recommended and can provide similar relief, but the patient should be advised that due to the nature of the lesion, treatment can often be more uncomfortable than is experienced with standard hyperkeratosis.

Footwear

We recommend suitable footwear and appropriate insoles or orthotics for management of the EB foot by podiatrists, patients, carers and healthcare professionals (Strength of recommendation grade: C).

Evidence that advice on footwear is beneficial has been reported in all subtypes of EB: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 EBS, 4, 5, 8 JEB, 4, 8 DDEB 8, 21 and RDEB. 7, 8

EB footwear advice suggests that wherever appropriate, footwear should be supportive. Its primary focus should be aimed at minimizing blistering by reducing friction (Quality evidence level ranging from 3 to 2−). 3, 5, 7 Once blisters have formed, dressings and topical antiseptics or antibiotics may be used to prevent secondary infection until the wound heals (Quality evidence level ranging from 4 3 to existing guideline⇒ 9). Therefore, suitable shoes or footwear are essential to accommodate dressings and not lead to further trauma to the damaged area. Footwear that is adjustable may be beneficial in these circumstances.

### Delayed treatment of endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma initially diagnosed as a chalazion [^1114ePGE]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endocrine mucin–producing sweat gland carcinoma (EMPSGC) is a slow-growing, rare variant of mucinous carcinoma most commonly presenting on the eyelid. Its rarity, inflammatory characteristics, and slow-growing nature all increase the risk of misdiagnosis. We present a case of a EMPSGC initially diagnosed as a chalazion. Conservative treatment was attempted on multiple occasions and over an extended period, despite a lack of clinical response. This treatment caused a delay in diagnosis and appropriate treatment for this rare malignant lesion. Our case illustrates EMPSGC as a lesion that can masquerade as a chalazion or hordeolum.

### Lymphoedema management in podoconiosis-authors reply [^1179Nqvf]. The Lancet: Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Authors reply

We thank Jill Brooks and colleagues for their comments on how their trial was referred to in our article.

We used the adjective "small" to provide context for readers of The Lancet Global Health. Given that the average number of individuals in the nine non-stepped-wedge trials reported so far in this journal in 2018 was over 3600, both the Brooks trialand GoLBeTare small by comparison. Small trials can be highly efficient, and the term is not used pejoratively.

The point we were trying to make in the introduction was around the type of question GoLBeT was designed to answer, and how this differed from earlier studies. One earlier study was uncontrolled, while the Brooks and colleaguestrial compared different approaches to foot hygiene, rather than foot hygiene versus no foot hygiene. Brooks and colleaguesshowed less transepidermal water loss and greater stratum corneum hydration with glycerol than with water alone, whereas GoLBeT tested a composite package versus no package. The question GoLBeT was designed to answer came from a public health perspective within the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health, who asked for evidence of the effectiveness of the most basic package of treatment, compared with none, under pragmatic field circumstances. This research aimed to assist decisions on the value, or absence of value, of scale-up of provision of lymphoedema care through the state health system of Ethiopia.

Lastly, we recognise that Brooks and colleagues investigated days of work lost to acute adenolymphangitis, a secondary outcome of GoLBeT, which differs from acute dermatolymphangioadenitis incidence. We applaud the Brooks team for measuring transepidermal water loss and stratum corneum hydration, which we agree are important in the pathogenesis of podoconiosis and its sequelae. Our primary outcome was selected from a public health perspective, following consultation with patients, carers, and service providers who identified acute dermatolymphangioadenitis incidence as the most debilitating consequence of the disease.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^1171wni7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), where individuals or groups are randomised, were included. Trials that did not state that they were randomised, along with trials that were explicitly quasi‐randomised or non‐randomised designs, were excluded. The first phase of cross‐over trials (due to the risk of carry‐over effects to subsequent periods), cluster‐randomised trials and within‐participant trials were included. Trials where participants might be equally likely to receive alternative treatments, so that the transitivity assumption is not violated, were also included.

Types of participants

Trials of participants with a clinical diagnosis of eczema (i.e. atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis; Johanssen 2004) established using diagnostic criteria for eczema (or a modified version of such criteria) or diagnosis by a healthcare professional were included. Participants with clinically infected eczema were not included. There were no restrictions on age, sex, ethnicity, or disease severity.

Specific forms of eczema that were not atopic eczema, such as irritant contact eczema, allergic contact eczema, hand eczema, discoid eczema, asteatotic eczema, frictional eczema, stasis eczema, photosensitive eczema, and seborrhoeic eczema were excluded. Where trials included both eligible and non‐eligible participants (e.g. where some participants have eczema, but others have irritant contact eczema), only trials where data on eligible participants with eczema were available separately were included.

### Safety and efficacy of broadBand intense pulsed light therapy for dry eye disease with meibomian gland dysfunction [^112rDKbw]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

BroadBand light intense pulsed light (BBL-IPL) therapy has shown to reduce hordeolum and blepharitis frequency. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BBL-IPL therapy in patients with dry eye disease (DED) from meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD).

Methods

This is a retrospective, consecutive case series of 48 patients with DED from MGD who underwent BBL-IPL therapy from October 2016 to January 2019 at a single, outpatient clinic in Ontario, Canada. Clinical outcomes included first and average non-invasive keratograph tear break-up times (NIKBUT), bulbar redness (BR) scores, tear meniscus heights (TMH), visual acuity (VA) and meibograph grades. Patient-reported outcomes included the Canadian dry eye assessment (CDEA) questionnaire and patient subjective assessment (PSA) scores. Outcomes were measured at baseline and after completion of 4 monthly BBL-IPL sessions.

Results

The mean severity of dry eye symptoms as measured by the CDEA and PSA decreased significantly from 19.78 ± 9.62 to 12.08 ± 7.40 (p < 0.001) and from 7.65 ± 1.74 to 4.77 ± 2.03 (p < 0.001), respectively. Twenty-five percent of patients reported no dry eye symptoms after treatment. The meibograph grade improved significantly in both eyes (p < 0.001). Approximately 71.0% and 80.1% of patients had an improved meibograph grade in the right and left eye, respectively. Near-significant improvements were observed for BR scores and VA. There was also a trend towards improved first/average NIKBUT and TMH scores. No adverse events were noted.

Conclusion

BBL-IPL appears to be an effective and safe treatment modality in improving dry eye symptoms and meibomian gland function in patients with DED from MGD.

### Pediatric eyelid cutaneous horns: a case series and literature review [^111GCuD9]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe the clinical and histopathologic features of pediatric eyelid cutaneous horns.

Design

Retrospective observational case series and review of literature.

Subjects

Five pediatric patients with eyelid cutaneous horns.

Methods

Five cases with eyelid cutaneous horns were retrospectively identified using departmental databases. Patients' records were analyzed for demographic data, clinical appearance, histologic findings, and clinical course. An excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed in 3 patients. The remaining 2 patients were managed conservatively.

Main Outcome Measures

Clinical outcome and histopathologic evaluation with emphasis on excluding malignancy.

Results

All 5 cutaneous horn lesions resolved surgically or conservatively. The average age at presentation was 6.6 years (range 5–11 years). Clinically, 4 lesions were preceded by a hordeolum or chalazion and all excised lesions had benign features on histologic examination. Mitotic figures or atypia were not observed. None of the patients developed recurrence during the follow-up period ranging from 1 to 96 months. Five previous reports of five cases were found on review of the literature. Our case series doubles this number to support the benign nature of these lesions in children.

Conclusions

Pediatric eyelid cutaneous horns are closely related to eyelid margin inflammatory disease and appear to follow a benign course. This contrasts with the adult population where cutaneous horns are frequently associated with neoplasia.

Diagnoses including blepharitis, BKC, chalazion, corneal ulcer, and marginal keratitis were not associated with worse initial or final BCVA (Table 2). Corneal stromal scarring, was associated with worse initial BCVA (OR 7.3 with 95% CI [2.1, 27.2]), but not final BCVA (OR 3.7 with 95% CI[0.8, 16.0]). In contrast, superficial keratitis was associated with worse final BCVA (OR 15.8 with 95% CI[2.1, 123.9), but not initial BCVA (OR 3.3 with 95% CI[0.4, 18.3). There was no association between erythromycin ointment or topical steroids with initial or final BCVA. Oral antibiotics were associated with worse initial BCVA (OR 3.6 with 95% CI [1.3, 11.10], but not final BCVA (OR 2.7 with 95% CI [0.8, 9.4]). The number of chalazion/hordeolum surgeries was not associated with initial or final BCVA (p = 0.87, p = 0.91).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Strongyloidiasis

The recommended dosage of STROMECTOL for the treatment of strongyloidiasis is a single oral dose designed to provide approximately 200 mcg of ivermectin per kg of body weight. See Table 1 for dosage guidelines. Patients should take tablets on an empty stomach with water. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics .) In general, additional doses are not necessary. However, follow-up stool examinations should be performed to verify eradication of infection. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies .)

Onchocerciasis

The recommended dosage of STROMECTOL for the treatment of onchocerciasis is a single oral dose designed to provide approximately 150 mcg of ivermectin per kg of body weight. See Table 2 for dosage guidelines. Patients should take tablets on an empty stomach with water. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics .) In mass distribution campaigns in international treatment programs, the most commonly used dose interval is 12 months. For the treatment of individual patients, retreatment may be considered at intervals as short as 3 months.

### Efficacy and safety of the disposable eyelid warming masks in the treatment of dry eye disease due to meibomian gland dysfunction [^112kMTiR]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Key exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) had active ocular allergies; (2) ocular infection/inflammation; (3) conjunctivochalasis; (4) entropion and trichiasis; (5) history of chalazion or hordeolum within the past 3 months; (6) worn contact lens within the past 3 months; (7) had ocular surgery within the past 3 months; (8) meibomian gland loss area ≥ 33% of the total area in each eyelid; (9) use of vectored thermal pulsation system (Lipiflow®) or intense pulsed light (IPL) or isotretinoin (accutane) within the past 6 months; (10) had autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment; (11) was unwilling or unable to discontinue the following medications during the study or during a 14-day washout period before the start of the study: systemic or ocular antibiotics, systemic or ocular steroids, anticholinergics, systemic or ocular antihistamines, ocular nonsteroidal antiinflammatory preparations, ocular vasoconstrictors, and investigational drugs; (12) patients participating in the clinical trial within 3 months; (13) was pregnant or lactating women.

Intervention

The basic treatment of both groups included lid hygiene twice a day and 0.1% sodium hyaluronate eye drops (5 mL:5 mg, Zhuhai Federal Pharmaceutical Limited by Share Ltd, Zhuhai, China) 4 to 6 times a day for 12 weeks. The treatment and control groups were separately treated by the disposable heating eye masks and the folded hot towel twice daily for 12 min each time.

In clinical practice, no matter how severe the consequences, there is no assurance that all patients will follow professional medical advice. Warm compresses were time-consuming and labour intensive and might lead to subjective compliance problems in some patients. Considering that inadequate compliance might be a significant contributor to the poor therapeutic effect for MGD patients. To enhance the patient compliance, a text alert three times a week and a telephone interview once a week were conducted in both groups, and the measurement records of the thermometer in the control group were checked in time. It should be emphasized that the compliances of warm compresses were calculated in both groups through the record forms filled out by patients.

### Multiple eyelid signs are suggestive ofInfestation [^111pMSLz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Demodex infestation can cause both anterior and posterior blepharitis, dry eye, rosacea, and hordeolum and can even mimic sebaceous gland carcinoma. Its varying manifestations and multifactorial nature may mislead ophthalmologists and delay diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In patients with anterior blepharitis, the eyelid margin and the eyelashes often appear to harbor debris. One specific type of debris that appears as a collar wrapping around the base of an eyelash, namely, cylindrical dandruff (CD) or collarettes, has been found to be a highly specific indicator of ocular demodicosis.

The prevalence of ocular demodicosis varies greatly among different studies, ranging from 4% to 47%. All ethnicity and age groups can be affected, with increased susceptibility in those with advanced age. Since the discovery of these mites, many studies have shown a correlation between infestation and ocular pathology. Signs and symptoms can be alleviated with treatment. However, no direct cause–effect relationship has yet been successfully demonstrated. Since Demodex spp. cannot survive long separated from their human hosts and in vitro culture has not been achieved, their life cycle and pathophysiology are not fully understood. Its presence on individuals with healthy eyes also has raised questions regarding the possibility of a nonpathogenic role in the microenvironment around the ocular surface. Some researchers have proposed that mites may be normal ocular surface fauna (commensalism with humans) that can turn pathogenic under overpopulation conditions related to an altered microenvironment.,

In Thailand, only one investigation focusing on the prevalence of Demodex has been performed. The study, which was performed in a tertiary care hospital, reported a prevalence of 42%. Having data from two tertiary hospitals and smaller hospitals (in this study) will help health professionals understand the magnitude of this condition. This study aimed to determine the signs associated with Demodex infestation in blepharitis patients and determine the rates of eyelash Demodex colonization among blepharitic patients and healthy individuals in Thailand.

### Safety of topical ophthalmic antibiotics in pregnant women with hordeola, chalazia, blepharitis, or bacterial conjunctivitis: propensity score analyses [^112VUrDj]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association between exposure to topical ophthalmic antibiotics during pregnancy and adverse neonatal outcomes.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we identified pregnant women with hordeola, chalazia, blepharitis, or bacterial conjunctivitis from 2005 to 2018 using the Japanese Medical Data Centre Claims Database. From the eligible women, we extracted women who were dispensed no topical antibiotics during the first trimester (non-antibiotic group), women who were dispensed topical fluoroquinolones alone at least once (fluoroquinolone alone group), and women who were dispensed any single type of antibiotic (single-antibiotic group). We compared the frequency of congenital anomalies (CA), preterm birth (PB), low birth weight (LBW), and the composite outcome of these three between the fluoroquinolone and non-antibiotic groups and between the single-antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups, using propensity score adjustment.

Results

A total of 891 eligible women were identified. In the fluoroquinolone (n = 409) and non-antibiotic (n = 309) groups, CA occurred in 6.8% and 6.8%, PB in 2.4% and 3.2%, LBW in 2.9% and 3.2%, and the composite outcome in 10.5% and 11.3%, respectively. Analysis using propensity score adjustment showed no significant difference between the groups in the frequency of CA (adjusted odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–2.18), PB (0.80; 0.30–2.17), LBW (1.08; 0.45–2.63), or the composite outcome (1.12; 0.67–1.87). Comparison of the single-antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups showed similar results.

Conclusions

Topical ophthalmic antibiotics for hordeola, chalazia, blepharitis, or bacterial conjunctivitis during the first trimester were not associated with increased adverse neonatal outcomes.

Question 3: How do you treat congenital distichiasis?
A. Intense Pulsed Light (IPL)
B. Warm Compress
C. Electrolysis
D. Topical Cyclosporine
E. Monitor

Answers:
A. IPL – Incorrect. IPL is used to treat Meibomian gland dysfunction which can lead to acquired distichiasis. IPL is thought to increase the skin temperature of the eyelid making the meibum less viscous, unclogging the gland. It also helps to reduce inflammation and reduce risk of infection.
B. Warm Compress – Incorrect. A warm compress can be used to treat blepharitis which can lead to acquired distichiasis. It increases circulation and helps to increase secretion production from the meibomian glands, however it would not treat the distichiasis itself.
C. Electrolysis – Correct. While distichiasis is congenital in LDS, several other variants of distichiasis can be acquired. Distichiasis in both congenital and acquired forms are treated in similar fashions, with both surgical and nonsurgical approaches to treatment, which is often aimed at removal of the second row of eyelashes, as they can cause chronic trauma and inflammation to the conjunctiva. Surgical options include partial tarsal plate excision, wedge resection, and palpebral conjunctival resection. Nonsurgical options include electrolysis, epilation, and cryotherapy.
D. Topical Cyclosporine – Incorrect. Topical cyclosporine is used in individuals with blepharitis who have not responded to standard treatments. It increases meibomian gland expressibility and tear break up time.
E. Monitor – Incorrect. While not a definitive treatment for congenital distichiasis, monitoring an asymptomatic patient for eye irritation is acceptable management.

### Differential diagnosis of the swollen red eyelid [^113gZopS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of eyelid erythema and edema is broad, ranging from benign, self-limiting dermatoses to malignant tumors and vision-threatening infections. A definitive diagnosis usually can be made on physical examination of the eyelid and a careful evaluation of symptoms and exposures. The finding of a swollen red eyelid often signals cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis is a severe infection presenting with proptosis and ophthalmoplegia; it requires hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics to prevent vision loss. Less serious conditions, such as contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and blepharitis, are more common causes of eyelid erythema and edema. These less serious conditions can often be managed with topical corticosteroids and proper eyelid hygiene. They are differentiated on the basis of such clinical clues as time course, presence or absence of irritative symptoms, scaling, and other skin findings. Discrete lid lesions are also important diagnostic indicators. The finding of vesicles, erosions, or crusting may signal a herpes infection. Benign, self-limited eyelid nodules such as hordeola and chalazia often respond to warm compresses, whereas malignancies require surgical excision.

### Differences in characteristics, aetiologies, isolated pathogens, and the efficacy of antibiotics in adult patients with preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis between 2000–2009 and 2010–2019 [^115CqUCM]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background/Aims

To understand whether the epidemiology, aetiologies, common pathogens and the antibiotic efficacy against the identified bacteria of periorbital cellulitis in adults have changed recently (2010–2019) compared with the past decade (2000–2009).

Methods

Adult patients (n = 224) diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis admitted to Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital during 2000–2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and clinical characteristics, isolated pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility tests against the commonly cultured bacteria were analysed.

Results

Preseptal cellulitis showed a tendency of female predominance. Patients in their 60s showed an incidence peak; more cases were observed during winter. The most common predisposing factor was dacryocystitis (15.5%-30.5%), followed by hordeolum (15.5%-24.8%). Aetiology of sinusitis (p = 0.001) decreased and that of conjunctivitis (p = 0.007) increased significantly with time. Culture results of nasopharyngeal swabs and local abscess showed higher positivity rate than conjunctival swab. The most common isolates were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiotics including fluoroquinolones and vancomycin were effective; in contrast, ampicillin/sulbactam and oxacillin showed decreasing efficacy against gram-positive bacteria. For antibiotic treatment against P. aeruginosa, fluoroquinolones, ceftazidime, piperacillin and imipenem were ideal choices.

Conclusion

In isolated pathogens, the increasing trend of methicillin-resistant S. aureus detection was compatible with reducing oxacillin efficacy against periorbital infection. In our study, the report of antibiotic efficacy against the most common identified bacteria offered empirical choices for hospitalised patients with periorbital infection before obtaining culture results.

### Abscess on the nasal tip of a young woman [^112j5bxh]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin
B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture
C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses
D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination
E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage

Answers:
A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin – Correct. Abscesses caused by GBS often require incision and drainage, as antibiotics alone may not suffice. Additionally, the patient's partner is an asymptomatic carrier likely reinfecting the patient, so penicillin treatment is appropriate.
B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture – Incorrect. Although fungal infections can present as refractory nodules, the culture results showing beta-hemolytic, Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen-positive gram-positive cocci strongly indicate a bacterial, not fungal, etiology. Oral terbinafine is not warranted here.
C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses – Incorrect. While topical antibiotics can be effective for superficial bacterial infections, this patient's chronic and refractory nodule suggests a deeper infection requiring more invasive management, such as incision and drainage and systemic antibiotic therapy.
D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination – Incorrect. A biopsy could be considered if there was suspicion of an atypical lesion (eg, malignancy or granulomatous infection). However, in this case, the diagnosis is clear based on the culture and clinical features, making biopsy unnecessary as the first-line step.
E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage – Incorrect. Although clindamycin provides effective gram-positive coverage, incision and drainage is critical in managing abscesses. Treating the partner is also essential to prevent reinfection, which clindamycin alone does not address.
