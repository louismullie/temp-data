## Question

Are ACE inhibitors viable in a patient with a single kidney?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ACE inhibitors are viable in a patient with a single kidney. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context of a solitary kidney and the key risk scenarios, especially renovascular disease. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about ACE inhibitors in CKD, including advanced CKD, and how they handle solitary-kidney physiology. Next, I will examine the specific renovascular risk with bilateral RAS or RAS in a solitary kidney and the monitoring thresholds. After that, I should review the evidence base, including STOP-ACEi and meta-analyses, to see if benefits persist in low eGFR. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with dosing, monitoring, and when to avoid or stop therapy, making sure I double-check any exceptions like dual RAS blockade and pregnancy before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: a solitary kidney can reflect congenital absence, surgical removal, or transplant, and the central concern is that ACE inhibitors reduce efferent arteriolar tone and intraglomerular pressure, which can precipitate hemodynamic AKI if renal perfusion depends on angiotensin II–mediated efferent constriction, as in renal artery stenosis or severe volume depletion. I need to ensure I distinguish this from the general CKD population where ACE inhibitors are beneficial when albuminuria is present or hypertension is uncontrolled [^fb6579af] [^f146dee3].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. KDIGO recommends ACE inhibitors or ARBs as foundational therapy in CKD with albuminuria, and explicitly advises continuing ACEi/ARB even when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², with close monitoring of creatinine and potassium. Importantly, dual ACEi+ARB is discouraged due to harm without added benefit, and a creatinine rise up to 30% after initiation or uptitration is acceptable if asymptomatic and not accompanied by hyperkalemia or volume overload, prompting further evaluation rather than automatic discontinuation [^d2ae4f43] [^8433887f] [^47b6db76] [^cd703a3e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about solitary kidneys. I initially thought KDIGO might have a blanket prohibition in solitary kidneys, but wait, let me verify the exact language. KDIGO does not issue a categorical ban on ACE inhibitors in solitary kidneys; instead, the caution is strongest when there is hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral RAS, where ACE inhibition can precipitate a fall in GFR. In that scenario, guidelines and regulatory labeling advise careful initiation with close monitoring and consideration of revascularization if there is a rapid decline in kidney function or refractory hypertension, rather than a universal contraindication [^497a8db0] [^63b4e6f3] [^ed60ce5e].

> I will now examine the renovascular evidence. The ERBP/ESH practice document advises that ACE inhibitors and ARBs are first-line for atherosclerotic renovascular disease in general, but should generally be avoided in bilateral RAS or RAS in a solitary kidney unless used with great caution and a low threshold to evaluate for revascularization if eGFR declines by more than 30%. This aligns with FDA labeling that highlights creatinine/BUN rises in solitary-kidney RAS and the need for early monitoring, reinforcing that viability depends on vigilant surveillance rather than avoidance of ACE inhibitors outright [^497a8db0] [^63b4e6f3] [^ed60ce5e].

> Next, I should review the advanced CKD data to see if benefits persist when eGFR is low. The STOP-ACEi randomized trial in stage 4–5 CKD showed no kidney or cardiovascular benefit from discontinuing ACEi/ARB when BP was controlled with other agents, supporting continuation in most patients unless there is intolerance. A 2024 meta-analysis of 18 RCTs in eGFR < 30 found ACEi/ARB initiation reduced kidney failure requiring dialysis by about 34% without mortality benefit, and subgroup analyses suggested benefit across eGFR strata, which supports viability even in advanced CKD when appropriately monitored [^5f5baa97] [^b4a59aac].

> Let me consider the mechanism and monitoring thresholds to ensure I'm precise. ACE inhibitors lower intraglomerular pressure and can cause a modest, early creatinine rise, often up to 30%, which is typically hemodynamic and reversible. Beyond 30% or with hyperkalemia or symptomatic hypotension, I should reassess for volume status, drug interactions, and renovascular disease, and consider dose reduction or temporary holding rather than reflexively stopping therapy, especially if there is albuminuria where renoprotection is greatest [^fb6579af] [^cdf09edd] [^d2ae4f43].

> But wait, what if the patient has no albuminuria and a solitary kidney from donation or congenital absence without RAS? I should double-check that scenario. In CKD without albuminuria, guidelines allow ACEi/ARB for hypertension control, though the renal outcome benefits are less certain; in solitary kidneys without stenosis, many patients tolerate ACE inhibitors well with standard monitoring, so viability is reasonable if blood pressure or proteinuria indications exist and we avoid overdiuresis or NSAIDs that amplify hemodynamic stress [^c148b07a] [^0b0fadba] [^d2ae4f43].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and combinations. Dual ACEi+ARB is not recommended in CKD due to increased AKI and hyperkalemia without outcome benefit, and this is especially pertinent in patients with limited renal reserve. In pregnancy or those planning pregnancy, ACE inhibitors are contraindicated. In kidney transplant recipients, evidence for hard outcomes is mixed and ACEi/ARB may increase hyperkalemia and anemia, so decisions should be individualized and coordinated with transplant teams [^47b6db76] [^c7676050] [^5d3982c0] [^c4ec791a].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, screen for renovascular disease risk factors and, if present, proceed cautiously with low starting doses, avoid over-diuresis, and check creatinine and potassium within 1–2 weeks. Second, if eGFR drops by more than 30% or hyperkalemia is unmanageable, reassess for RAS and consider revascularization in appropriate anatomical and clinical contexts. Third, in the absence of RAS, treat hypertension and albuminuria per CKD guidance, titrating to the highest tolerated dose with ongoing monitoring. Fourth, avoid dual RAS blockade and counsel on pregnancy precautions. This risk-stratified strategy makes ACE inhibitors viable in many solitary-kidney patients when used thoughtfully [^d2ae4f43] [^497a8db0] [^63b4e6f3].

> Final answer: Yes, ACE inhibitors are viable in patients with a single kidney, but they require careful selection and close monitoring. They should be avoided or used only with extreme caution in the presence of hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral RAS, whereas in solitary-kidney CKD without RAS, ACE inhibitors are appropriate first-line therapy for hypertension and albuminuria with guideline-directed lab surveillance and a plan to evaluate for revascularization if kidney function acutely worsens by more than 30% [^497a8db0] [^d2ae4f43] [^f146dee3].

ACE inhibitors are **generally safe and effective** in patients with a single kidney, including those with CKD or after nephrectomy, and are recommended to slow CKD progression and reduce proteinuria [^f146dee3] [^48231465]. They can cause a modest, reversible rise in creatinine (≤ 30%) and hyperkalemia, so **monitor renal function and potassium within 1–2 weeks** of initiation or dose changes, and adjust therapy if creatinine rises > 30% or hyperkalemia persists [^d2ae4f43] [^cdf09edd]. Avoid ACE inhibitors in bilateral renal artery stenosis or a solitary kidney with stenosis, and use caution with NSAIDs or diuretics. Overall, benefits outweigh risks when monitored appropriately [^497a8db0] [^9a32eac3].

## Clinical evidence supporting ACE inhibitor use in single kidney patients

Multiple studies and guidelines support ACE inhibitor use in patients with a single kidney:

- **CKD progression**: ACE inhibitors reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression in patients with a single kidney, including those with CKD or after nephrectomy [^f146dee3] [^48231465].

- **Advanced CKD**: Even in advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), ACE inhibitors reduce kidney failure risk without increasing mortality, supporting their continuation when tolerated [^b4a59aac] [^8433887f].

- **Post-nephrectomy**: ACE inhibitors are beneficial after nephrectomy, reducing proteinuria and preserving renal function [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

While ACE inhibitors are generally safe, certain risks require caution in single-kidney patients:

- **Renal function decline**: ACE inhibitors can cause a modest, reversible rise in serum creatinine (≤ 30%) due to reduced intraglomerular pressure; monitor renal function closely [^fb6579af] [^cdf09edd].

- **Hyperkalemia**: ACE inhibitors can cause hyperkalemia, especially in patients with reduced GFR or on potassium-sparing drugs; monitor potassium and adjust therapy as needed [^4e287b4c] [^d6c55ec7].

- **Bilateral renal artery stenosis**: ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in bilateral renal artery stenosis or a solitary kidney with renal artery stenosis due to risk of acute renal failure [^497a8db0] [^63b4e6f3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide clear recommendations for ACE inhibitor use in single-kidney patients:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| KDIGO 2024 | - Initiate or continue ACE inhibitors in CKD patients, including those with a single kidney, unless contraindicated <br/> - Monitor renal function and potassium within 2–4 weeks of initiation or dose changes [^d2ae4f43] [^f5d6df1c] |
| VA/DoD 2025 | - Continue ACE inhibitors in advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) unless adverse effects occur <br/> - Monitor for hyperkalemia and renal function changes [^39b7b6db] [^bcc9981e] |
| JNC 8 | - ACE inhibitors are first-line for CKD with hypertension, including single-kidney patients, to improve kidney outcomes [^f146dee3] |

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

To minimize risks, the following monitoring and management strategies are recommended:

- **Baseline assessment**: Evaluate renal function (serum creatinine/eGFR) and potassium before starting therapy [^d2ae4f43].

- **Initial monitoring**: Recheck renal function and potassium within 1–2 weeks of initiation or dose escalation [^d2ae4f43].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Monitor renal function and potassium periodically, especially after dose changes or addition of interacting drugs [^d2ae4f43].

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or discontinue if creatinine rises > 30% from baseline or if hyperkalemia persists despite corrective measures [^cdf09edd] [^3315a525].

- **Patient education**: Counsel on adherence, dietary potassium restriction, and avoidance of NSAIDs or other nephrotoxic drugs [^d2083299].

---

## Special considerations

Certain scenarios require additional caution or alternative therapies:

- **Renal artery stenosis**: Avoid ACE inhibitors in bilateral renal artery stenosis or a solitary kidney with renal artery stenosis; consider revascularization if indicated [^497a8db0] [^63b4e6f3].

- **Hyperkalemia**: Manage with dietary changes, diuretics, or potassium binders; consider dose reduction or discontinuation if uncontrolled [^d6c55ec7] [^3315a525].

- **Pregnancy**: ACE inhibitors are contraindicated due to teratogenic risk; use alternatives if pregnancy is planned or suspected [^c7676050].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

ACE inhibitors are **viable and beneficial** in patients with a single kidney, including those with CKD or after nephrectomy, with appropriate monitoring and risk mitigation. They reduce proteinuria, slow CKD progression, and improve renal outcomes. Clinicians should monitor renal function and potassium closely, adjust therapy as needed, and avoid use in contraindicated scenarios such as bilateral renal artery stenosis.

Medical therapy

Medical management of ARVD should aim to reduce CV risk and protect kidney function. Hypertension control is a prominent goal. Since no clinical studies examining different BP targets have been performed in patients with RAS, the general recommendations should be followed. With regards to antihypertensive classes, ACEIs and ARBs are considered first-line options, as observational studies suggest that these agents can reduce mortality risk in patients with ARVD. However, these agents should be initiated with particular care, and an estimated GFR (eGFR) decline of > 30% should prompt further evaluation of the patient for revascularization, as discussed below. In cases of bilateral RAS or RAS in solitary kidneys, ACEIs and ARBs should generally be avoided and the patient evaluated directly for revascularization, as they may significantly compromise renal function and there is no relevant evidence in support of their use. Most often, several antihypertensive agents are needed to achieve the BP targets, selection of which should follow the general guidelines and include dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), diuretics of appropriate class and dose, β-blockers and second-line agents. Lipid-lowering agents are needed to achieve cholesterol targets depending on total CV risk. The role of antiplatelet therapy in mitigating adverse CV outcomes in patients with ARVD has not been tested in clinical trials, but its role is established in patients with atherosclerotic coronary or peripheral artery disease, and observational studies have shown that the use of low-dose aspirin is associated with reduced mortality risk in patients with ARVD. Additional measures to help BP control and CV risk reduction include smoking cessation, weight loss, regular physical exercise and reduced sodium consumption; for all these measures, no hard evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with ARVD is available.

### The salutary blood pressure of a solitary kidney [^004b6f34]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical utility of aortic stiffness measurements is impeded by the need for dedicated expensive instruments and the time required per analysis (about 20 min), which restricts this method to the research setting. Also, in lieu of therapeutic options, these measurements are largely prognostic factors which are not to be acted upon. This is unlike blood pressure measurements. Although improved after transplantation, hypertension is common in kidney recipients. Blood pressure increases in kidney donors long term, and becomes more common with time since donation. For patients with end-stage kidney failure and their clinicians, the attention should be on optimizing antihypertensive treatment, ensuring timely access to transplantation, and providing life-long follow-up of both donors and recipients.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease — implementation and safety considerations for ACEi/ARB therapy in children and adolescents. The page states that "ACEi or ARB can cause hypotension, hyperkalemia, and an increased Scr level, in addition to other established side effects. Therefore, a reasonable approach is to periodically monitor BP, electrolytes, and kidney function in young people receiving these medications". It cautions that "The risk of an acute decrease in eGFR is of particular concern among people with a solitary functioning kidney or eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2". Reported tolerability includes that "ACEi-induced cough can affect up to 10% of people taking these medications". Regarding pregnancy, the text states that "ACEi and ARBs are contraindicated" and that "Parents and/or guardians and female patients (as developmentally appropriate) should be counseled regarding this risk". Access considerations are noted: "Generic formulations of ACEi and ARBs are available throughout the world. Some ACEi and ARBs are available commercially in liquid form to facilitate oral uptake in children, or have standardized procedures to compound them in liquid form". The guideline adds that "These medications should be prescribed by prescribers who have experience in their use".

Drugs/drug classes examples

Decreased effective arterial blood volume from systemic vasodilatory use or over diuresis with furosemide or mannitol resulting in hypovolemia may elicit a decrease in kidney perfusion and the resultant increase in SCr. Treatment with vasoactive agents such as norepinephrine and vasopressin may lead to excessive systemic vasoconstriction, which may similarly decrease kidney perfusion and result in an increase in SCr. This condition should be considered separately from certain clinical contexts (e.g. fluid-resuscitated, hyperdynamic sepsis) when vasoactive drugs can preserve renal blood flow and GFR. Reasons why diuresis or excessive systematic vasoconstriction occur include the interpatient variability in response to treatment, the dynamic nature of the patient's condition, or unintentional medication errors. Achieving the desired fluid balance and optimizing hemodynamics in a critically ill patients require a fine balance with continuous monitoring to achieve a targeted, personalized response.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) preferentially dilate the efferent arteriole, leading to reduced intraglomerular pressure, rather than an overall decrease in renal blood flow. In the absence of severe bilateral renal artery stenosis (unilateral in solitary kidney patients) or volume depletion, exposure to ACEIs/ARBs can lead to an increase in SCr up to 30% from baseline values (with a corresponding decline in eGFR) within the first and second week of treatment. These are generally considered acceptable hemodynamic changes and usually reversible upon stopping ACEIs/ARBs. A similar pattern of increasing SCr is observed during the early phase of treatment with sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). For ACEIs/ARBs and SGLT2is, this phenomenon has been labeled as either "permissive AKI" or "permissive hypercreatinemia". In other words, long-term nephron/cardio protection with ACEIs/ARBs and SGLT2is (e.g. reducing proteinuria and delaying chronic kidney disease [CKD] progression) mostly outweighs mild decreases in GFR during the early phase of treatment.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: do the latest trials challenge existing evidence? [^1c3c0973]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

High-risk patients with CKD / Proteinuria

ACE inhibitors and ARBs are widely acknowledged to confer additional renoprotective benefits beyond the effects of BP control alone (Table 1). Inhibition of the RAS slows the progression of renal disease in patients with diabetes, hypertension and albuminuria, but also decreases the risk of CV events. Few trials have specifically evaluated the effects of dual RAS inhibition on mortality in patients with CKD. Instead, most studies have considered surrogate endpoints.

In the ONTARGET ® trial, dual RAS inhibition was associated with a greater risk for the composite outcome of dialysis, doubling of serum creatinine and death (compared with ramipril monotherapy), even though the increase in urine albumin to creatinine ratio (relative to baseline) was less (p < 0.001). Similarly, a post-hoc analysis of the ONTARGET ® and TRANSCEND ® trials that stratified patients by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria did not support dual RAS inhibition over single RAS inhibition in high vascular risk patients with low GFR or albuminuria. A meta-analysis / metaregression of trials in patients with primary glomerulonephritis showed that the antiproteinuric response to ACE inhibitor plus ARB therapy versus either monotherapy is consistently greater and strictly related to baseline proteinuria, associated with only moderate increase in serum potassium levels and not peculiar to immunoglobulin A nephropathy. In a retrospective analysis of 6-month data from 16 patients with a single kidney and proteinuria, dual RAS blockade with several different ACE inhibitors and ARBs at the maximal dose tolerated by the patient did not affect plasma creatinine levels or creatinine clearance, but also did not reduce proteinuria, suggesting lack of benefit in these patients. In a meta-analysis of 49 randomized trials, which excluded the combination treatment of angiotensin-II receptor blocker and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor in non-diabetic renal disease (COOPERATE) trial (which was retracted due to serious concerns about the study data), monotherapy with ARBs and ACE inhibitors was reported to delay progression of proteinuria over both the short (1–4 months) and longer (5–12 months) term. Although the data were limited, the combination of the two drugs was considered to reduce proteinuria more than either drug alone.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^120eb3bc]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease — renal artery stenosis evaluation and management state that care should be used in determining the appropriate diagnostic tests because administration of radiographic contrast, with or without angiography, may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others. Refractory hypertension and/or a significant reduction in kidney function after renin-angiotensin system blockade should prompt consideration of renal artery stenosis, and patients with diabetes and CKD in whom refractory hypertension is suspected should be evaluated, preferably without radiocontrast, to assess whether arterial stenosis is present. Current non-invasive modalities that avoid radiocontrast include magnetic resonance angiography and duplex Doppler ultrasonography, whereas captopril nuclear renal scans are not recommended because sensitivity is low in patients with decreased GFR or bilateral renal artery stenosis; further evaluation may be undertaken with carbon dioxide or gadolinium angiography. Hypertension with unilateral renal artery stenosis may be treated with medicine (preferably an ACE inhibitor or ARB) with the option of revascularization, usually by percutaneous angioplasty and stent placement, and treatment of bilateral disease or unilateral disease in a single functioning kidney may require revascularization to both control hypertension and prevent loss of kidney function, although whether revascularization adds benefit to optimal medical management is uncertain.

RESEARCH QUESTION

Does a strategy of discontinuing ACEi, ARBs or their combination in patients with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive CKD lead to stabilization or improvement in renal function over a 3-year follow-up period, provided that good BP control is maintained with other agents, compared with a strategy of continuing ACEi and/or ARB?

PRECAUTIONS

General

Impaired Renal Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium tablets, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death.

In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required.

Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

KDIGO 2021 kidney transplant antihypertensive therapy — evidence synthesis reports that, compared to placebo or no treatment, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) had no significant effect on mortality, graft loss, or cardiovascular (CV) events. ACEi reduced BP and proteinuria but had no significant effect on all-cause mortality or graft loss and were associated with increased adverse events including angioedema, cough, hyperkalemia, and anemia. Evidence for ARB or CCB versus placebo/no treatment was downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision, with very few graft failure events; for example, there were only a total of 25 graft failure outcomes among the 786 participants over a mean of 37 months of follow-up in the ARB trials.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) indications for revascularization vary by clinical context: for asymptomatic stenosis, percutaneous revascularization may be considered for an asymptomatic bilateral or solitary viable kidney with a hemodynamically significant RAS, while the usefulness for asymptomatic unilateral hemodynamically significant RAS in a viable kidney is not well established and is presently clinically unproven; for hypertension, percutaneous revascularization is reasonable for hemodynamically significant RAS with accelerated, resistant, or malignant hypertension, an unexplained unilateral small kidney, or intolerance to medication; for preservation of renal function, percutaneous revascularization is reasonable for RAS with progressive chronic kidney disease with bilateral RAS or a RAS to a solitary functioning kidney, and may be considered for RAS with chronic renal insufficiency with unilateral RAS; for heart failure or ischemia syndromes, percutaneous revascularization is indicated for hemodynamically significant RAS with recurrent, unexplained congestive heart failure or sudden, unexplained pulmonary edema and is reasonable for hemodynamically significant RAS with unstable angina.

### Do ACE-is and ARBs benefit patients with advanced CKD?… [^81364263]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Jennifer Middleton, MD, MPH Posted on June 21, 2021 Many prescribers discontinue patients' angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotension receptor blockers as their estimated glomerular filtration rate worsens due to concerns about hyperkalemia, hypotension, and/or worsening chronic kidney disease. Slightly less than half of all persons with CKD stage 4 or 5 in the United States are not currently prescribed an ACE-I or ARB. Two recent studies, however, demonstrate potential benefits of ACE-I and ARB use in patients with advanced CKD. The first study reviewed the medical records in a large US health system of nearly 4, 000 patients with CKD who were prescribed an ACE inhibitor or an ARB and whose CKD eventually worsened to an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1. 73m2. Cohorts were divided into patients whose ACE-Is or ARBs were discontinued when their eGFR dropped below 30 mL/min/1.

73m2 and those patients whose ACE-Is or ARBs were continued despite this lower eGFR. There was no difference in the rate of CKD progression to end-stage kidney disease between groups. The second study reviewed the medical records of nearly 5000 patients in Sweden with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1. 73m2 who received a new prescription for either an ACE-I/ARB or a calcium channel blocker. After a median of 4. 1 years, persons who received an ACE-I/ARB had a lower risk of needing to initiate dialysis compared to the persons who received a CCB. These two studies examined different nuances of patients with advancing CKD: the first, persons whose previous ACE-I/ARB was continued despite worsening eGFR, the second, persons receiving new prescriptions for ACE-I/ARB at a lower eGFR.

These differences may explain the studies' differing findings regarding mortality benefit of these medication classes, adverse cardiac events benefit, and lowered risk of advancement to ESKD.

### Vini vidi stenti [^81193fbd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

To underscore this point, CORAL enrolled 364 patients with stenoses > 80%, and there was no difference in clinical outcome between medical therapy alone and medical therapy with stent revascularization. Similarly, although systolic blood pressure was predictive of clinical outcomes, stent treatment did not modify the effect, including in those with systolic blood pressures > 180 mm Hg at study entry. Similarly, the presence of global renal ischemia, defined as bilateral stenosis or a stenosis in a solitary functioning kidney, which was documented in 140 CORAL patients, was not associated with a difference in clinical outcomes. Of note, these subgroups are larger than many of the observational studies including the current Reinhard cohort.

Stenting to improve blood pressure has a limited role when clinicians are committed to assuring that their patients receive optimal medical therapy. Effective medical therapy is critically important since renal artery stenosis occurs in the setting of systemic risk factors and systemic atherosclerosis, which is oftentimes widespread. Optimal medical therapy includes aggressive medical therapy to define blood pressure thresholds using long‐acting renin‐angiotensin blockade and calcium antagonists with excellent trough‐to‐peak blood pressure ratios, intensive lipid lowering, smoking cessation, and antiplatelet therapy. In CORAL, stent treatment did lead to statistically significantly better blood pressures than medical therapy alone; however, the difference was modest (2 mm Hg better) and was not associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular or renal events.

There are some people who will experience an increase in serum creatinine with effective blood pressure control (with or without renin‐angiotensin inhibition); however, this should not be mistaken for "kidney failure" and most often does not necessitate cessation of treatment. Reinhard reported that 41% of people enrolled had renin‐angiotensin inhibition treatment discontinued because of a ≥ 30% increase in plasma creatinine. People treated with medical therapy alone who have an acute rise in creatinine often improve renal function absent any intervention, and importantly, their clinical outcomes are not impacted. This phenomenon is so common that many studies of progression of chronic kidney disease exclude changes observed in the first few months of therapy and calculate the real effect of therapy on glomerular filtration rate beginning at ≥ 3 months after blood pressure is controlled. Consequently, if a patient's creatinine rises from 1.0 to 1.3 mg/dL, or from 2.0 to 2.6 mg/dL with effective blood pressure control, the majority will do quite well without changing medical treatment and will improve or stabilize kidney function without revascularization.

### Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: the ultimate treatment for renal protection? [^689833c2]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic renal diseases is increasing worldwide. There is a great need to identify therapies that arrest disease progression to end-stage renal failure. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system both by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists is probably the best therapeutic option available. Several large, multicenter studies have indeed shown a significant reduction in the risk for doubling baseline serum creatinine or progression toward end-stage renal failure in patients who do and do not have diabetes and have chronic nephropathies that are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. However, the number of patients who reach end-stage renal failure is still considerably high. Significant reduction of the incidence of ESRD is likely to be achieved in the near future for chronic nephropathies, provided that the degree of renoprotection can be improved. This goal may be attainable with a more complex strategy than with a single or dual pharmacologic intervention on the renin-angiotensin system. Strict control of BP and protein excretion rate, lowering of blood lipids, tight glucose control for individuals with diabetes, and lifestyle changes form part of the future multimodal protocol for treatment of patients with chronic nephropathies.

General

Impaired Renal Function

As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium tablets, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death.

In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required.

Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Hyperkalemia

In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (2 patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

### Renoprotection: one or many therapies? [^1b177bdd]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Renal disease that progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) imposes a great burden on the affected individual and on society, which mainly bears the cost of ESRD (currently more than $10 billion to treat about 333,000 patients annually in the U.S.). Thus, there is a great need to identify therapies that arrest the progression mechanisms common to all forms of renal disease. Progress is being made. Perhaps the most visible advance is the randomized controlled trials (RCT) demonstrating the renoprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. There are also numerous other promising renoprotective therapies. Unfortunately, testing each therapy in RCT is not feasible. Thus the nephrologist has two choices: restrict renoprotective therapy to those shown to be effective in RCT, or expand the use of renoprotective therapies to include those that, although unproven, are plausibly effective and prudent to use. The goal of this work is to provide the documentation needed for the nephrologist to choose between these strategies.

Methods

This work first describes the mechanisms believed to be involved in the progression of renal disease. Based largely on this information, 18 separate interventions that slow the progression are described. Each intervention is assigned a level of recommendation (Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 the lowest) according to the strength of evidence supporting its renoprotective efficacy.

Results

The number of interventions at each level of recommendation are: Level 1, N = 4; Level 2, N = 4; Level 3, N = 10. Our own experience with the multiple-risk-factor intervention is that most patients can achieve the majority of the Level 1 and 2 interventions, and many of the Level 3 interventions. We recommend the expanded renoprotection strategy.

Conclusion

This work advances the hypothesis that, until better information becomes available, a broad-based, multiple-risk-factor intervention intended to slow the progression of renal disease can be justified in those with progressive nephropathies. This work is intended primarily for clinical nephrologists and thus each recommended intervention is described in substantial practical detail.

### Renin-angiotensin system blockade and kidney transplantation: a longitudinal cohort study [^408515dd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) in kidney transplant recipients on modern immunosuppression is not yet well established. Our objective was to investigate the impact of the use of ACEI/ARB on patient and graft survival in a cohort of kidney transplant recipients.

Methods

A total of 990 patients, who received a single deceased donor kidney at our institution between 1996 and 2005, were included in this longitudinal cohort study. All-cause mortality and death-censored graft loss were the primary outcomes. We used traditional time-dependent Cox model (unweighted) and inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting of marginal structural models (weighted Cox model), controlling for time-dependent confounding by indication.

Results

A total of 414 patients (42%) received ACEI/ARB through the study period (median duration 14 months, interquartile range 6–40 months). ACEI/ARB use was associated with reduction of risk for mortality in the crude [hazard ratio (HR) 0.627, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.412–0.953] and adjusted Cox analysis (HR 0.626, 95% CI 0.407–0.963). Similar results were observed after adjusting for confounding by indication (HR 0.629, 95% CI 0.407–0.973). By contrast, ACEI/ARB use was not associated with significant improvement of graft survival after kidney transplantation.

Conclusion

ACEI/ARB prescription may be suggested as beneficial among multiple medications for reducing mortality in kidney transplant recipients, but its use was not associated with longer graft survival.

### ACE inhibition versus angiotensin receptor blockade: which is better for renal and cardiovascular protection? [^8d51f944]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic renal disease is characterized by a gradual loss of renal function and an increased cardiovascular risk. Renin-angiotensin system blockade by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade has distinct renoprotective and cardiovascular protective effects, but which of the two drug classes confers more protection is still a matter of debate. This review highlights and compares the effects of the two drug-classes in nondiabetic renal disease and in overt or incipient nephropathy of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Both renal and cardiovascular outcomes are considered. Regardless of their relative efficacy, both drug classes have a dose-response relationship for intermediate renal and cardiovascular parameters. Moreover, combined treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade seems to provide better long-term renoprotection than monotherapy. Actually, in most patients, achieving maximal renal and cardiovascular protection requires a multidrug regimen, usually including several antihypertensives. Within this approach, full dose titration of either RAS blocker followed by add-on with the second drug is more important than the choice of the initial drug.

### Rationale for combination angiotensin receptor blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment and end-organ protection in patients with chronic kidney disease [^669e602f]. American Journal of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem that has received increasing attention because of the high rate of associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Mounting evidence indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) safely slow down progression of CKD. There is also growing evidence supporting combination treatment of nephropathies with an ACE inhibitor plus an ARB to more completely block the RAAS and provide greater renoprotection than either an ACE inhibitor-based or ARB-based regimen. The National Kidney Foundation suggests that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be used in combination to reduce proteinuria in patients with kidney disease; however, larger outcomes trials are needed.

### Brief early life angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition offers renoprotection in sheep with a solitary functioning kidney at 8 months of age [^43dd9873]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Children born with a solitary functioning kidney (SFK) are predisposed to develop hypertension and kidney injury. Glomerular hyperfiltration and hypertrophy contribute to the pathophysiology of kidney injury. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) can mitigate hyperfiltration and may be therapeutically beneficial in reducing progression of kidney injury in those with an SFK.

Methods

SFK was induced in male sheep fetuses at 100 days gestation (term = 150 days). Between 4 and 8 weeks of age, SFK lambs received enalapril (SFK+ACEi; 0.5mg/kg per day, once daily, orally) or vehicle (SFK). At 8 months, we examined BP, basal kidney function, renal functional reserve (RFR; GFR response to combined amino acid and dopamine infusion), GFR response to nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition, and basal nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability (basal urinary total nitrate and nitrite [NOx]).

Results

SFK+ACEi prevented albuminuria and resulted in lower basal GFR (16%), higher renal blood flow (approximately 22%), and lower filtration fraction (approximately 35%), but similar BP, compared with vehicle-treated SFK sheep. Together with greater recruitment of RFR (approximately 14%) in SFK+ACEi than SFK animals, this indicates a reduction in glomerular hyperfiltration-mediated kidney dysfunction. During NOS inhibition, the decrease in GFR (approximately 14%) was greater among SFK+ACEi than among SFK animals. Increased (approximately 85%) basal urinary total NOx in SFK+ACEi compared with SFK animals indicates elevated NO bioavailability likely contributed to improvements in kidney function and prevention of albuminuria.

Conclusions

Brief and early ACEi in SFK is associated with reduced glomerular hyperfiltration-mediated kidney disease up to 8 months of age in a sheep model.

RENOVASCULAR DISEASE

The 2023 ESH Guidelines also discuss the prevalence, prognosis and management of the two main causes of renovascular hypertension, atherosclerotic renal vascular disease (ARVD) and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Revascularization with balloon angioplasty without stenting is emphasized as the treatment of choice for patients with FMD and critical renal artery stenosis, while for ARVD, the recommendation is to offer revascularization on top of medical therapy in patients with documented secondary hypertension due to ARVD or those with high-risk clinical presentations (flash pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension or rapid loss of kidney function) with documented high-grade stenosis (≥ 70%). Medical therapy alone could be used for individuals with asymptomatic ARVD with stenosis < 70%, patients with mild or moderate hypertension that is easily controlled with antihypertensive drugs and low-grade stenosis, or patients with non-viable kidney parenchyma, where revascularization has little to offer. In all the latter cases, if treatment initiation with an ACEi or an ARB results in eGFR reduction of ≥ 30%, careful re-evaluation is warranted. Current strategies in the management of ARVD are detailed in a recent clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice and the Working Group 'Hypertension and the Kidney' of ESH.

### Representation of patients with CKD in trials of cardiovascular disease medications… [^884c8eba]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Lack of information about the effectiveness of CVRM medications in patients with CKD undermines effective CVRM. The proportion of RCTs in which dose adjustment based on kidney function was required or medication was contraindicated based on kidney function remained consistent across different periods. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers were also evaluated for patients receiving dialysis and thiazides for patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2. Other antihypertensives were not evaluated in these populations. None of the antihypertensives were evaluated for recipients of a kidney transplant. The effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering drugs for preventing MACE in patients with CKD was evaluated almost exclusively for statins.

Statins were evaluated for patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 as monotherapy or in combination with ezetimibe. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, niacin, and icosapent ethyl were also evaluated for this population. For patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2, only the combination of statins and ezetimibe was evaluated. For patients receiving dialysis, statins were evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with ezetimibe. For kidney transplant recipients, only statin monotherapy was evaluated. For these patients, the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and insulin was evaluated. For patients receiving dialysis, DPP-4 inhibitors and sulphonylureas were compared. None of the glucose-lowering drugs were assessed in recipients of a kidney transplant.

Furthermore, the lack of RCTs evaluating the association of CVRM medications with individual cardiovascular end points and kidney end points in patients with CKD means that the effectiveness of these drugs for these individual end points remains unknown.

### Renin angiotensin system blockade in kidney transplantation: a systematic review of the evidence [^60dcc728]. American Journal of Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) slow the progression of renal disease in non-transplant patients. A systematic review of randomized trials (n = 21 trials with 1549 patients) was conducted to determine the effect of ACE-inhibitor or ARB use following kidney transplantation. With a median follow-up of 27 months, ACE-inhibitor or ARB use was associated with a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate (-5.8 mL/min; 95% CI -10.6 to -0.99). ACE-inhibitor or ARB use resulted in a lower hematocrit (-3.5%; 95% CI -6.1 to -0.95), reduction in proteinuria (-0.47 gm/d; 95% CI -0.86 to -0.08) but no change in the serum potassium (0.18 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.40). ACE-inhibitor or ARB use results in clinically important reductions in proteinuria, hematocrit and glomerular filtration rate in renal transplant recipients, but there are insufficient data to determine the effect on patient or graft survival. Randomized trials of sufficient power and duration that examine these hard outcomes should be conducted. Until such trials are completed, this study provides quantitative estimates of the risks and benefits of ACE-inhibitor or ARB use that can be used by clinicians considering prescribing these medications to kidney transplant recipients or to researchers designing future trials.

Renal artery stenosis — treatment thresholds and modality selection: The CORAL trial evidence cited recommends best medical therapy as the initial treatment for a newly diagnosed patient, and optimal medical therapy is defined as 3 antihypertensive medications, 1 of which should be a diuretic. In patients intolerant of the 3-antihypertensive medication regimen who have hemodynamically significant RAS, renal artery stenting may be considered. Because invasive angiography cannot distinguish hemodynamic significance among moderate renal artery stenoses (50% to 69% diameter stenoses), the severity of moderate RAS lesions should be confirmed by measuring translesional pressure gradients with nonobstructive catheters. With an accelerating decline in renal function and bilateral or solitary significant RAS — severe RAS [≥ 70% diameter stenosis] or moderate RAS (50% to 69% diameter stenosis) with translesional gradients that exceed threshold measurements — the rating panel finds renal stenting to be Appropriate; with stable renal function and unilateral significant RAS, optimizing and intensifying medical therapy is deemed Appropriate and renal stenting is deemed May Be Appropriate in some patients. In small (< 7 cm pole to pole) nonviable kidneys, revascularization is found to be Rarely Appropriate. For hypertension with significant RAS, the threshold for renal artery stenting is failure of ≥ 3 maximally tolerated antihypertensive medications, 1 of which is a diuretic, to control hypertension, and newly diagnosed RAS patients should initially be treated with optimal medical therapy, not renal stenting; patients with well-controlled hypertension and RAS and those with poorly controlled hypertension on < 3 antihypertensive medications are rarely candidates for renal stenting.

### Association of ACEI or ARB use with outcomes after acute kidney injury… [^43ad3761]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use may improve postdischarge outcomes in patients with acute kidney injury, but cautious monitoring for renal-specific complications may be warranted. Importance Patients with acute kidney injury are at an increased long-term risk of death. Effective strategies that improve long-term outcomes in patients with AKI are unknown. After adjustment for comorbidities, ACEI or ARB use before admission, demographics, baseline kidney function, other factors related to index hospitalization, and prior health care services, ACEI or ARB use was associated with lower mortality in patients with AKI after 2 years. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are effective for reducing cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with CKD.

16, 17 We sought to evaluate whether the use of an ACEI or ARB was associated with better outcomes after hospitalization in patients with AKI. During a follow-up period of at least 2 years after discharge, patients with AKI dispensed an ACEI or ARB after the index hospitalization had a lower risk of death compared with those with no ACEI or ARB use. However, ACEI or ARB use was also associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for a renal cause, mainly acute renal failure and hyperkalemia; no difference was found for ESRD. It is possible that the advantage of nephrologist follow-up seen in another study15 was attributable to increased surveillance of renal complications of ACEI or ARB medications. A previous study17 found that ACEI or ARB use slows progression of CKD and reduces risk of ESRD, particularly in those with proteinuria.

Our results did not indicate any improvement in the risk of ESRD; however, the low event rate and short follow-up period may have been insufficient to detect an association with this outcome. We found that the use of an ACEI or ARB in patients with AKI after hospital discharge was associated with lower mortality but a higher rate of hospitalization for a renal cause. This observation requires further evaluation in prospective studies evaluating postdischarge care strategies for patients with AKI. In particular, our results suggest a need for a trial to evaluate treatment with an ACEI or ARB in patients with AKI to determine whether this intervention improves long-term outcomes in high-risk patients.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) assumptions define baseline therapy, selection for stenting, lesion criteria, and surveillance. Patients should be taking 3 appropriate blood pressure medications, which should include a diuretic, and patients with newly discovered atherosclerotic RAS will be managed according to randomized CORAL trial data, which endorses the best medical therapy, with candidates for renal intervention including those with poorly controlled hypertension on 3 blood pressure medicines at maximally tolerated doses (1 of which is a diuretic). Full-dose medication may not be achievable in some patients; therefore, renal stenting may be considered for uncontrolled hypertension with intolerance of 3 antihypertensive medications given at maximal doses, and intravascular ultrasound will be used as needed to optimize stent deployment. Post-procedure renal duplex (≤ 30 days, 6 ± 1 months, and ≤ 12 ± 1 months and annually) is recommended, and primary renal stent placement is indicated for atherosclerotic RAS lesions. Both clinical and anatomic lesion criteria must be met: clinical criteria include accelerated hypertension, resistant hypertension, malignant hypertension, hypertension with an unexplained unilateral small kidney, and hypertension with intolerance to medication; progressive chronic kidney disease with bilateral RAS, RAS to a solitary functioning kidney, or unilateral RAS; or recurrent, unexplained congestive heart failure or sudden, unexplained pulmonary edema or recurrent unstable angina. Lesion criteria include 50% to 69% diameter stenosis by visual estimation with hemodynamic confirmation (resting systolic translesional gradient ≥ 20 mm Hg or resting mean gradient ≥ 10 mm Hg, hyperemic systolic gradient ≥ 20 mm Hg or hyperemic mean gradient ≥ 10 mm Hg, or fractional flow reserve < 0.8), or any stenosis ≥ 70% diameter or any stenosis ≥ 70% diameter by intravascular ultrasound measurement.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use in CKD — benefits, risks, and recommendation strength are summarized as follows: The benefits of using either an ACEI or ARB to slow the progression of CKD outweighed the potential harm of cough, angioedema, or hyperkalemia. ACEI and ARB should not be combined due to an increased risk of AKI and hyperkalemia, and clinicians should counsel patients about the possible teratogenic effects of ACEI and ARB. Therefore, it is categorized as Reviewed, Amended, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was High, and thus the Work Group decided upon a Strong for recommendation.

### Chronic total occlusion of renal artery in symptomatic young patient with resistant hypertension: is a revascularization necessary or redundant? [^b2b0d1e5]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In the screening diagnosis of RAS, Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) is of primary importance. The performance and interpretation of the result requires a great deal of experience, and the difficulties in the examination are encountered in overweight patients. It is worth remembering that DUS may overestimate the degree of stenosis in relation to the reference test, which is digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with pressure measurements. The latter one is performed especially in situations of inconclusive noninvasive findings or when revascularization is being considered. The significance of stenosis is confirmed by a systolic pressure gradient more than 20 mmHg or a ratio of pressure behind the lesion to pressure before the lesion of less than 0.9. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) also play an important role in the diagnosis.

The mere finding of RAS does not imply the need for treatment, especially endovascular one. The basis is the elimination of cardiovascular risk factors, treatment with a statin and acetylsalicylic acid in atherosclerotic cause. The occurrence of hypertension requires taking steps in accordance with the relevant guidelines, with ACEIs, or ARBs as first-line pharmacotherapy, because they improve the prognosis in this group of patients, including mortality reduction. The exception is when the stenosis is bilateral or involves a single kidney, in which case these medicines may lead to a significant reduction in glomerular filtration. Therapy with ACEi and ARBs in this subgroup of patients can be used exceptionally, but it should only be performed under strict monitoring. In addition, diuretics, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are effective.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^f146dee3]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

JNC 8 — Recommendation 8 (chronic kidney disease with hypertension) states that in adults aged 18 years or older with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, initial (or add-on) antihypertensive treatment should include an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to improve kidney outcomes, and this applies to all CKD patients with hypertension regardless of race or diabetes status; Moderate Recommendation – Grade B. The recommendation is based primarily on kidney outcomes, and neither ACEIs nor ARBs improved cardiovascular outcomes for CKD patients compared with a β-blocker or calcium channel blocker (CCB); direct renin inhibitors are not included in this recommendation because there were no studies demonstrating their benefits on kidney or cardiovascular outcomes. Use of an ACEI or an ARB will commonly increase serum creatinine and may produce other metabolic effects such as hyperkalemia, and although an increase in creatinine or potassium level does not always require adjusting medication, use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in the CKD population require monitoring of electrolyte and serum creatinine levels, and in some cases, may require reduction in dose or discontinuation for safety reasons. In black patients with CKD and proteinuria, an ACEI or ARB is recommended as initial therapy, whereas in black patients with CKD but without proteinuria the choice for initial therapy is less clear and includes a thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, ACEI, or ARB; if an ACEI or ARB is not used as the initial drug, an ACEI or ARB can be added as a second-line drug if necessary to achieve goal blood pressure (BP), and because the majority of patients with CKD and hypertension will require more than 1 drug to achieve goal BP, an ACEI or ARB will be used either as initial therapy or as second-line therapy in addition to a diuretic or CCB in black patients with CKD.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers for advanced chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and retrospective individual participant-level meta-analysis of clinical trials [^b4a59aac]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the effects of initiating treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) on the risk for kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT) and death remain unclear.

Purpose

To examine the association of ACEi or ARB treatment initiation, relative to a non-ACEi or ARB comparator, with rates of KFRT and death.

Data Sources

Ovid Medline and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration Clinical Trials Consortium from 1946 through 31 December 2023.

Study Selection

Completed randomized controlled trials testing either an ACEi or an ARB versus a comparator (placebo or antihypertensive drugs other than ACEi or ARB) that included patients with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Data Extraction

The primary outcome was KFRT, and the secondary outcome was death before KFRT. Analyses were done using Cox proportional hazards models according to the intention-to-treat principle. Prespecified subgroup analyses were done according to baseline age (< 65 vs. ≥ 65 years), eGFR (< 20 vs. ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2), albuminuria (urine albumin-creatinine ratio < 300 vs. ≥ 300 mg/g), and history of diabetes.

Data Synthesis

A total of 1739 participants from 18 trials were included, with a mean age of 54.9 years and mean eGFR of 22.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2, of whom 624 (35.9%) developed KFRT and 133 (7.6%) died during a median follow-up of 34 months (IQR, 19 to 40 months). Overall, ACEi or ARB treatment initiation led to lower risk for KFRT (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.55 to 0.79]) but not death (hazard ratio, 0.86 [CI, 0.58 to 1.28]). There was no statistically significant interaction between ACEi or ARB treatment and age, eGFR, albuminuria, or diabetes (P for interaction > 0.05 for all).

Limitation

Individual participant-level data for hyperkalemia or acute kidney injury were not available.

Conclusion

Initiation of ACEi or ARB therapy protects against KFRT, but not death, in people with advanced CKD.

### Strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat kidney disease related to systemic arterial hypertension: a narrative review from the Mexican group of experts on arterial hypertension [^82a48edf]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

ACEIs and ARBs

ACEIs and ARBs are indispensable for treating systemic arterial hypertension in patients living with CKD. Their use is also well-established in treating albuminuria, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and acute myocardial infarction. In Table 1, we present the results of two primary meta-analyses comparing different pharmacological groups of RAAS inhibitors and their clinical use for adverse outcomes. Both studies found that using ACEIs and ARBs in patients living with CKD reduces the risk of renal failure and CVD events. Additionally, ACEIs have been shown to decrease all-cause mortality and may be superior to ARBs in reducing CVD death. This suggests that ACEIs could be the first therapeutic option for this population. However, some authors, such as Strippoli et al. concluded in a Cochrane systematic review that there are no significant differences in overall mortality when comparing ACEIs versus ARBs. The debate continues, but the main strategy emphasize using the maximum tolerable dose of ACEIs to optimize and manage CKD-related outcomes.

In addition to the above, several reports of individual cases and cohorts showed that patients with high-risk presentations of AVRD (flash pulmonary oedema, refractory hypertension or rapid loss of kidney function) were those that benefit the most from revascularization. These patients often have nearly occluded renal arteries or bilateral RAS or single RAS with a solitary kidney, and revascularization had immediate beneficial effects with substantial decreases in BP and significant improvement in kidney function. Following the publications of relevant RCTs that almost entirely excluded patients with ARVD and high-risk clinical presentations, as discussed in detail below, several observational cohort studies examined whether PTRA with stenting might be beneficial for these individuals.

A previous prospective cohort study evaluated 467 individuals with RAS > 50% who received either medical treatment or medical treatment plus PTRA with stenting in UK, and examined future CV events and mortality depending on the clinical presentation, as well as the relevant treatment. Among patients receiving only medical treatment, those who presented with flash pulmonary oedema had a markedly increased risk of death [HR 2.2 (95% CI 1.4–3.5)] and CV events [HR 3.1 (95% CI 1.7–5.5)] compared with patients with low-risk phenotypes (i.e. those without flash pulmonary oedema, refractory hypertension or rapid loss of kidney function). In the same study, PTRA with stenting compared with medical treatment was associated with large reductions in the risk of death [HR 0.15 (95% CI 0.02–0.9)] and CV events [HR 0.23 (95% CI 0.1–0.6)] in patients with high-risk presentations (Fig. 1), but no apparent benefit was observed in patients without the above high-risk presentations [HR 0.8 (95% CI 0.7–1.2) and 1.0 (95% CI 0.8–1.2), respectively]. A recent prospective cohort study investigating the effects of PTRA with stenting on ambulatory BP levels, eGFR and HF recurrence in a group of well-defined patients with severe ARVD (defined as RAS > 70% in CTA or MRA and at least one of the following: resistant hypertension confirmed by 24-hour ABPM, reduction in eGFR > 5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year or hospitalization for acute decompensated HF with no obvious explanation) demonstrated that PTRA was associated with better ambulatory BP levels [24-hour SBP change from baseline: −25.7 mmHg (95% CI −30.8 to −20.6)] and BP control [change in the number of antihypertensive drugs: −0.9 (95% CI −1.3 to −0.5)], improved kidney function [eGFR change: +7.2 ml/min (95% CI 3.2–11.2)] at the 24-month evaluation and reduced hospital admissions for HF/flash pulmonary oedema (of 17 patients with a history of hypertensive HF, 14 patients had no new episodes after PTRA with stenting).

### Using ACE inhibitors and ARBs in advanced chronic… [^fe93c28e]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, does the continued use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors have a worsening effect on renal function. Bottom Line Although some experts have recommended the discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in patients with advanced CKD, the study supports their continuation with no evidence of harm and a possible reduction in the need for renal replacement therapy. Synopsis Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors include angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although their use in mild to moderate CKD slows progression of the disease, their use in patients with advanced CKD is not known. The U. K. investigators identified adults with stage IV or V CKD and a decrease in GFR of 2 mL per minute per 1.

73 m. The patients were randomized to continue or discontinue their ACE inhibitor or ARB. In both groups, other classes of antihypertensives could be used to control blood pressure at the discretion of the treating physician. Analysis was by intention to treat, and the groups were balanced at baseline. After a median follow-up of three years, the estimated GFR was higher in the group that continued to use renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, but this difference was not statistically significant. Patients in the continuation group had a strong trend toward a lower rate of requiring renal replacement therapy. This is an example of a clinically significant difference that was not statistically significant, likely because of inadequate sample size and/or duration of follow-up. Hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, and deaths were similar between groups.

Adherence to the assigned treatment was very good and there was no difference between groups in serious adverse events. Editor's Note: Dr. Ebell is deputy editor for evidence-based medicine for AFP and cofounder and editor-in-chief of Essential Evidence Plus, published by Wiley-Blackwell.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease: an endorsement with some caveats for real-life application [^d2083299]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Developing guidelines on a subject as broad as hypertension is difficult, especially when the guidance relates to hypertension in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Guideline Development Group has applied a rigorous methodology in reviewing all available evidence, and their recommendations are consistent with the evidence-based approach. As a result, the European Renal Best Practice endorses most of its recommendations. However, the Work Group feels that some additional advice could help clinicians in daily practice: (i) individualization of treatment should be taken into account, especially (cardiovascular) co-morbidities, age, gender and race; (ii) side-effects, such as postural dizziness should be monitored closely, particularly in elderly, diabetics and patients with arterial stiffness; (iii) the importance of salt restriction should not be neglected; (iv) although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs) remain a cornerstone in the management of hypertension, and especially cardiovascular protection, in some particular situations such as in advanced CKD and in patients without proteinuria, their role is less well defined; (v) as most CKD patients need more than one antihypertensive drug to achieve blood pressure control, the specific (renal) (dis)advantages of other classes than ACE-I or ARB should be taken into account.

### Aliskiren: a novel renoprotective agent or simply an alternative to ACE inhibitors? [^c1fddaec]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition that is increasing in prevalence in developed nations. The economic and psychosocial costs of CKD are considerable, and are associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Specific treatments do not exist for many causes of CKD. Therefore, treatment is reliant on the introduction of therapies that retard progression of structural renal damage and renal impairment. At present, aside from judicious use of antihypertensive agents to lower blood pressure, and possibly low-protein diets and statin therapy, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are the only widely available treatments. Although these measures attenuate the inexorable progression to renal failure, they do not halt it. One limiting factor may be feedback effects of ACEis and ARBs, such as increased plasma renin activity. Aliskiren is a newer agent that inhibits renin, the rate-limiting step in the RAAS. There are several theoretical reasons to suggest that aliskiren may have renoprotective actions superior to those of ACEis and ARBs. In this paper the available evidence regarding renoprotective effects of aliskiren is reviewed, with an emphasis on comparison with ACEis and ARBs.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^f476a9cf]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Glomerular disease — ACEi/ARB therapy and blood pressure targets: Use an ACEi or ARB to maximally tolerated or allowed dose as first-line therapy in treating patients with both hypertension and proteinuria. Do not stop ACEi or ARB with modest and stable increase in serum creatinine (up to 30%). Stop ACEi or ARB if kidney function continues to worsen, and/or refractory hyperkalemia. Combinations of ACEi and ARB may be used in young adults without diabetes or cardiovascular disease, but benefits and safety are uncertain. Caveat: do not start ACEI/ARB in patients who present with abrupt onset of NS. These drugs can cause AKI especially in patients with MCD. Target systolic blood pressure in most adult patients is < 120 mm Hg using standardized office BP measurement. Target 24 h mean arterial pressure in children is ≤ 50th percentile for age, sex, and height by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Formally speaking, SBP < 120 mm Hg has not been validated in GN. In practicality, we are able to achieve an SBP of 120–130 mm Hg in most patients with glomerular disease. Avoid use of an ACEi or ARB if kidney function is rapidly changing.

Some cases of renal injury result in significant devascularization of the organ which results in a significant renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade response. These patients may complain of flank pain and have unrelenting persistent hypertension not responsive to anti-hypertensives. In these rare instances, and when a contralateral kidney is functional, nephrectomy may be the only option if all other management strategies fail.

Angiography and angioembolization
Angiography with eventual super-selective angioembolization is a safe and effective procedure; it may be indicated in hemodynamically stable or stabilized patients with arterial contrast extravasation, pseudoaneurysms, arteriovenous fistula, and non-self-limiting gross hematuria. (GoR 1C)
Angioembolization should be performed as selectively as possible. (GoR 1C)
Blind-angioembolization is not indicated in hemodynamically stable or stabilized patients with both kidneys when angiography is negative for active bleeding, regardless of arterial contrast extravasation on CT-scan. (GoR 1C)
In hemodynamically stable or stabilized patients with severe renal trauma with main renal artery injury, dissection or occlusion, angioembolization and/or percutaneous revascularization with stent or stentgraft is indicated in specialized centers and in patients with limited warm ischemia time (< 240 min) (GoR 2C)
Endovascular selective balloon occlusion of the renal artery could be utilized as a bridge to definitive hemostasis. This procedure requires direct visualization by fluoroscopy where the balloon is advanced over a selectively placed guidewire. (GoR 2B)
In severe injury with main renal vein injury without self-limiting bleeding, angioembolization is not indicated. Patients should undergo surgical intervention. (GoR 1C)
In hemodynamically stable or stabilized patients with solitary kidney and moderate (AAST III) or severe (AAST IV–V) renal trauma with arterial contrast extravasation on CT-scan, angiography with eventual super-selective angioembolization should be considered as the first choice. (GoR 1C)
In hemodynamically stable or stabilized patients with active kidney bleeding at angiography and without other indications for surgical intervention, in case of failure of the initial angioembolization, a repeat angioembolization should be considered. (GoR 1C)
In adults, only in selected setting (immediate availability of operating room, surgeon, adequate resuscitation, immediate access to blood and blood products and to high dependency / intensive care environment) and without other reasons for surgical exploration, angioembolization might be considered in selected hemodynamically transient responder patients. (GoR 2C)
In children, angiography and eventual super-selective angioembolization should be the first choice even with active bleeding and labile hemodynamics, if there is immediate availability of angiographic suite, immediate access to surgery and to blood and blood products, and to high dependency / intensive care environment. (GoR 2C)

Recommendation 3.2.2 — renin–angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi) initiation in high blood pressure (BP) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) without diabetes: We suggest starting RASi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) for people with high BP, CKD, and moderately increased albuminuria (G1–G4, A2) without diabetes (2C), noting this recommendation is weak according to GRADE and based on limited evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of sufficient duration to evaluate kidney protection; the Work Group judged that most well-informed patients would value the cardio- and renoprotective benefits of RASi over potential harms from acute kidney injury (AKI) or hyperkalemia, that the cardiovascular (CV) benefits appear to outweigh potential adverse effects so many well-informed patients with CKD on no dialysis with moderately increased albuminuria but without diabetes will opt for treatment with RASi, and that while patients may accept potential harms including hyperkalemia and AKI, these side effects may lead to higher healthcare costs from additional clinic visits and laboratory testing.

Renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) in chronic kidney disease — RASi "should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated", and "changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2–4 weeks" after initiation or dose increase. Hyperkalemia with RASi "can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi". "Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose". "Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB" for symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure with "eGFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2". "Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or ARB) for specific indications", and "Continue ACEi or ARB in people with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2".

### No improvement of patient or graft survival in transplant recipients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers: a collaborative transplant study report [^0a6b4654]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

It was reported recently that treatment of kidney transplant recipients with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) is associated with strikingly improved long-term graft and patient survival. This finding has important implications for future posttransplantation therapy recommendations. In an analysis of 17,209 kidney and 1744 heart transplant recipients, an association of treatment with ACEI/ARB with improved transplant outcome could not be confirmed. It is concluded that recommendations for a widespread use of ACEI/ARB treatment in transplant recipients are unwarranted.

### Combination ACEI and ARB therapy: additional benefit in renoprotection? [^329d3f85]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The fact that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers antagonize the renin-angiotensin system at different levels suggests that these agents, already each of confirmed clinical benefit in retarding the progression of chronic renal disease, may have additive effects that result in even greater renoprotection when used in combination. In the light of the persisting need for treatments that afford more effective renoprotection, this Special Commentary examines available experimental and clinical evidence in support of this hypothesis.

Recent Findings

Experimental studies to date have failed to distinguish clearly between the additive antihypertensive effects of combination therapy and additive intrinsic renoprotective effects. Clinical studies, albeit with relatively small patient numbers and short follow-up periods, have shown that combination therapy results in greater antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects than monotherapy in diabetic nephropathy and non-diabetic forms of chronic renal disease.

Summary

At present we recommend the addition of angiotensin receptor blocker therapy in patients with continued hypertension or proteinuria despite angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Further long-term studies are required to evaluate more fully the renoprotective potential of this combination.

### Initiating renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in chronic kidney disease [^c1369a8e]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by abnormalities in kidney structure or function, present for at least 3 months. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are established treatments in the management of CKD, reducing the risk of adverse kidney and cardiovascular events. Despite an extensive evidence base and decades of clinical experience, they remain underused, underdosed and frequently discontinued due to concerns about changes in kidney function and hyperkalaemia. In this article, we provide an overview of initiating RAS inhibitors in adults with CKD, highlight current guideline recommendations and offer a practical approach to dealing with the challenges associated with their use.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^5d3982c0]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

KDIGO kidney transplant recipients — hypertension management approach: Randomized controlled trials in KTRs have not had sufficient statistical power to determine whether ACE-I or ARB therapy improves patient or graft survival, and ACE-Is and ARBs may be associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia and anemia in KTRs. Hypertensive KTRs with ischemic heart disease and/or CHF may benefit from ACE-Is, ARBs and/or beta-blockers, and diuretics may be effective in treating hypertension in KTRs since hypertension in CNI-treated KTRs may be sodium dependent. Many patients will require combination therapy to control blood pressure, and most combinations should include a thiazide diuretic, unless it is contraindicated; recent studies suggest that thiazides may be more effective than previously thought in patients with reduced kidney function. When hypertension is difficult to control, especially when associated with otherwise unexplained kidney dysfunction, screening for allograft vascular compromise within or proximal to the allograft artery should be considered, usually requiring imaging of the allograft vasculature using either an angiogram, computerized tomographic angiography or magnetic resonance imaging. When hypertension is difficult to control and there are no reversible causes, bilateral native kidney nephrectomies may be considered, especially in a KTR < 40 years old.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition that occurs as a result of damage to the kidneys. Early recognition of CKD is becoming increasingly common due to widespread laboratory estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, raised clinical awareness, and international adoption of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications. Early recognition and management of CKD affords the opportunity to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending kidney replacement therapy and for intervention to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on kidney outcomes and survival in people with a wide range of severity of kidney impairment have been reported; however, their effectiveness in the subgroup of people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain. This is an update of a review that was last published in 2011.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB or both in the management of people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus (DM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 6 July 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the effect of ACEi or ARB in people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who did not have DM were selected for inclusion. Only studies of at least four weeks duration were selected. Authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out by two authors independently, using a standard data extraction form. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another. When more than one study reported similar outcomes, data were pooled using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was analysed using a Chi² test and the I² test. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach MAIN RESULTS: Six studies randomising 9379 participants with CKD stages 1 to 3 (without DM) met our inclusion criteria. Participants were adults with hypertension; 79% were male from China, Europe, Japan, and the USA. Treatment periods ranged from 12 weeks to three years. Overall, studies were judged to be at unclear or high risk of bias across all domains, and the quality of the evidence was poor, with GRADE rated as low or very low certainty. In low certainty evidence, ACEi (benazepril 10 mg or trandolapril 2 mg) compared to placebo may make little or no difference to death (any cause) (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.26 to 15.37; I² = 76%), total cardiovascular events (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05; I² = 0%), cardiovascular-related death (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.26 to 11.66; I² = 54%), stroke (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.03; I² = 0%), myocardial infarction (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20; I² = 0%), and adverse events (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.41; I² = 0%). It is uncertain whether ACEi (benazepril 10 mg or trandolapril 2 mg) compared to placebo reduces congestive heart failure (1 study, 8290 participants): RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95) or transient ischaemic attack (1 study, 583 participants): RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.01; I² = 0%) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether ARB (losartan 50 mg) compared to placebo (1 study, 226 participants) reduces: death (any-cause) (no events), adverse events (RR 19.34, 95% CI 1.14 to 328.30), eGFR rate of decline (MD 5.00 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 95% CI 3.03 to 6.97), presence of proteinuria (MD -0.65 g/24 hours, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.52), systolic blood pressure (MD -0.80 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.89 to 2.29), or diastolic blood pressure (MD -1.10 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.29 to 1.09) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether ACEi (enalapril 20 mg, perindopril 2 mg or trandolapril 1 mg) compared to ARB (olmesartan 20 mg, losartan 25 mg or candesartan 4 mg) (1 study, 26 participants) reduces: proteinuria (MD -0.40, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.20), systolic blood pressure (MD -3.00 mm Hg, 95% CI -6.08 to 0.08) or diastolic blood pressure (MD -1.00 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.31 to 1.31) because the certainty of the evidence is very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of ACEi or ARB in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD who do not have DM. The available evidence is overall of very low certainty and high risk of bias. We have identified an area of large uncertainty for a group of patients who account for most of those diagnosed as having CKD.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^7789fc49]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition and combination therapy evidence in diabetic kidney disease is summarized as follows: a recent meta-analysis concluded that RAS inhibition with either ACE inhibitors or ARBs is no more effective at preventing GFR loss or such clinical outcomes as doubling of serum creatinine level or CKD stage 5 than other antihypertensive agents in hypertensive patients with diabetes; however, studies for the active comparator portion included heterogeneous groups that did not consistently have hypertension (present in 86%) or macroalbuminuria (mean albumin, 520 mg/g; range, 7 to 3,000 mg/g), and the Work Group concurs that blood pressure control is a predominant mechanism for kidney protection, but that the meta-analysis does not negate evidence for benefits of RAS inhibition in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and macroalbuminuria; additionally, no trials with clinical outcomes have evaluated combinations of ACE inhibitors with ARBs for treatment of DKD, and whether such combinations would be useful or tolerated in early-stage DKD, including normotensive patients, is unknown.

### Renin-angiotensin system blockade in patients with chronic kidney disease: benefits, problems in everyday clinical use, and open questions for advanced renal dysfunction [^59d767c4]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of hypertension and albuminuria are considered among the primary goals of treatment to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the main drugs to achieve these goals. Seminal studies have showed that RAS blockers present significant renoprotective effects in CKD patients with very high albuminuria. In post hoc analyses of such trials, these renoprotective effects appeared more robust in patients with more advanced CKD. However, randomized trials specifically addressing whether RAS blockers should be initiated or maintained in patients with advanced CKD are scarce and do not include subjects with normoalbuminuria, thus, many clinicians are unconvinced for the beneficial effects of RAS blockade in these patients. Further, the fear of hyperkalemia or acute renal decline is another factor due to which RAS blockers are usually underprescribed and are easily discontinued in patients with more advanced CKD; i.e., those in Stages 4 and 5. This review summarizes evidence from the literature regarding the use of RAS blockers in patients with advanced CKD.
