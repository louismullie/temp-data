## Question

Syncope without any cardiac issues while laughing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage syncope that occurs exclusively during vigorous laughter, with no evidence of cardiac disease on initial workup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis of true syncope and excluding mimics. Then, I should classify the mechanism, especially whether this fits situational reflex syncope. Next, I will risk-stratify to determine the need for further cardiac testing. After that, I should outline a targeted diagnostic workup and when to escalate. Finally, I will propose a management plan emphasizing trigger avoidance and injury prevention, and close with counseling and follow-up, making sure I verify each step against guideline-based features and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis of true syncope and not a mimic. Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness due to cerebral hypoperfusion with rapid, complete recovery, and I should confirm there was loss of postural tone, brief duration, and no prolonged confusion or focal deficits afterward, which would argue against seizure or psychogenic pseudosyncope, the latter often lasting 5–20 minutes with closed eyes and preserved vitals, so I need to check for those red flags carefully [^114t2V3j].

> Wait, let me verify the trigger specificity. Syncope occurring only during or immediately after a distinct, memorable trigger such as laughing strongly supports situational reflex syncope, which guidelines explicitly recognize alongside cough, micturition, defecation, and swallowing triggers, and this pattern alone shifts pretest probability toward a benign, reflex-mediated mechanism rather than cardiac disease [^114Bw9gn] [^111AwD7n] [^116Q3We8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should still risk-stratify for cardiac etiologies using guideline features that increase or decrease that risk. Features favoring noncardiac causes here include younger age, no known heart disease, a clear situational trigger, frequent recurrences with similar features, and absence of worrisome elements like exertional syncope, supine syncope, or abnormal cardiac exam, whereas older age, structural heart disease, exertional or supine syncope, abnormal ECG, or family history of premature sudden death push toward cardiac causes, so I need to ensure none of those high-risk features are present before concluding this is benign [^1125zDB3] [^111vexxh] [^114JufPV].

> I should double-check the initial evaluation elements. All patients with syncope warrant a detailed history, physical examination including orthostatic vitals, and a 12-lead ECG to screen for conduction disease, ischemia, or repolarization abnormalities, and in a patient with isolated laugh-triggered events and no red flags, routine echocardiography or advanced imaging is not indicated unless the history, exam, or ECG suggests structural disease, so I need to ensure the ECG is normal and there are no murmurs or exam abnormalities before deferring imaging [^1146a5i6] [^1141w9cd] [^117RZSz7].

> Next, I should review when to escalate testing. If there are atypical features, an abnormal ECG, exertional or supine events, concerning family history, or if episodes are very frequent or injurious, then ambulatory ECG monitoring, echocardiography, or exercise testing may be reasonable, but in a classic situational laugh syncope with a normal ECG and exam, the yield of these tests is low and they can often be avoided, so I need to weigh the pretest probability carefully before ordering them [^1146a5i6] [^1141w9cd].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to ensure the mechanism is coherent. Vigorous laughter increases intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure, which can acutely reduce venous return and trigger a vasovagal reflex with vasodilation and/or bradycardia, producing transient cerebral hypoperfusion and syncope, and although evidence is largely observational, case literature and physiologic plausibility support this reflex model for laugh syncope [^112nA1zj] [^115skoxN] [^1114goz5].

> I will now examine management. Because evidence is limited to case reports and small series, the cornerstone is trigger avoidance and mitigation, with education about prodromal recognition when present, liberalizing fluids and salt if not contraindicated, reviewing and minimizing hypotensive medications, and employing physical counter-pressure maneuvers if a prodrome allows, and I should confirm that these align with guideline recommendations for situational and vasovagal syncope before proposing them [^114Bw9gn] [^111AwD7n] [^113X2zhA].

> But wait, what if there is no prodrome? Injury prevention becomes paramount, so I need to counsel on environmental modifications such as avoiding standing during hearty laughter when possible, sitting with support, and avoiding hard surfaces or sharp objects, and I should document prior injuries and risk factors for trauma because absence of prodrome correlates with higher injury severity in vasovagal phenotypes, which helps frame the urgency of mitigation strategies [^116gJfiP].

> I should confirm the prognosis and counseling. Reflex syncope is generally benign with frequent remissions, and patient education about the diagnosis and its favorable outlook is recommended, while also explaining that recurrences can cluster and that mechanism-specific strategies reduce events, so I need to set expectations realistically and provide written safety advice [^112ZRBfE] [^1152XvUp] [^113sa8Xi].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up needs. If the history is classic, the exam and ECG are normal, and there are no red flags, urgent cardiology referral is not required, but a primary care follow-up in 4–6 weeks to reassess frequency, triggers, adherence to mitigation, and any new red flags is reasonable, with a low threshold to revisit the diagnosis if the phenotype changes or new concerning features emerge [^117CxCGN].

> In summary, I need to ensure that this presentation truly represents situational reflex syncope triggered by laughter, exclude cardiac red flags with history, exam, and ECG, avoid low-yield testing when the story is classic, and prioritize trigger avoidance, hydration/salt strategies, medication review, counter-pressure maneuvers if applicable, and injury prevention counseling, aligning each step with guideline features and the limited but consistent evidence base for laugh-induced syncope [^114Bw9gn] [^1125zDB3] [^112nA1zj].

Laugh syncope without cardiac disease is a benign, reflex-mediated form of **situational syncope** [^114Bw9gn] triggered by vigorous laughter, causing transient cerebral hypoperfusion via vagal activation and intrathoracic pressure changes [^112nA1zj]. It is diagnosed by a clear laughter trigger, brief loss of consciousness with rapid recovery, and exclusion of cardiac or neurologic causes [^1125zDB3]; evaluation should include history, exam, **ECG**, and selective testing if indicated [^117CxCGN]. Management is conservative — avoid triggers, increase fluids/salt, and use **counter-pressure maneuvers** [^111AwD7n] — and prognosis is excellent with low recurrence when triggers are avoided [^115KMo9m].

---

## Pathophysiology

Laugh syncope is a reflex-mediated syncope [^1114goz5] driven by vagal activation and hemodynamic changes during vigorous laughter:

- **Vagal stimulation**: Laughter activates the vagus nerve, causing bradycardia and vasodilation, reducing cerebral perfusion [^115D3ppH].

- **Intrathoracic pressure**: Laughing raises intrathoracic pressure, impeding venous return and lowering cardiac output, contributing to hypotension and syncope [^112nA1zj].

- **Autonomic imbalance**: A transient shift toward parasympathetic dominance during laughter precipitates hypotension/bradycardia and syncope [^115D3ppH].

---

## Clinical features

Typical features of laugh syncope include:

- **Trigger**: Syncope occurs only during or immediately after vigorous laughter [^115skoxN].

- **Prodrome**: Often absent or minimal; episodes are sudden [^115skoxN].

- **Duration**: Brief loss of consciousness with rapid, complete recovery [^111kTmjw].

- **Posture**: May occur seated or standing; less commonly supine [^notfound].

- **Frequency**: Episodes are infrequent and typically benign [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is clinical, supported by targeted testing to exclude cardiac or neurologic causes:

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed history, including triggers, prodrome, posture, and recovery; focused cardiac and neurologic exams [^1125zDB3].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Essential to exclude arrhythmias or conduction disease [^113xNEBE].

- **Echocardiography**: Consider if structural heart disease is suspected [^1141w9cd].

- **Ambulatory ECG monitoring**: Use if intermittent arrhythmia is suspected [^113iy3LK].

- **Tilt-table testing**: Not routinely indicated; consider if diagnosis is unclear or to differentiate from other reflex syncopes [^116WsaQC].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Laugh syncope must be differentiated from other causes of transient loss of consciousness:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Cardiac syncope | - Arrhythmias <br/> - Structural heart disease <br/> - Valvular disease [^1163giU6] |
| Orthostatic hypotension | - Volume depletion <br/> - Autonomic failure <br/> - Medication-induced [^1163giU6] |
| Other reflex syncopes | - Vasovagal <br/> - Carotid sinus hypersensitivity <br/> - Situational (cough, micturition, defecation) [^1114goz5] |
| Neurologic causes | - Seizures <br/> - Transient ischemic attacks <br/> - Vertebrobasilar insufficiency [^111kTmjw] |
| Psychogenic pseudosyncope | Functional or psychiatric causes of apparent loss of consciousness [^114t2V3j] |

---

## Management strategies

Management is conservative and focused on trigger avoidance and injury prevention:

- **Patient education**: Explain the benign nature, triggers, and warning signs [^115KMo9m].

- **Trigger avoidance**: Minimize vigorous laughter or anticipate episodes [^111AwD7n].

- **Hydration and salt intake**: Increase fluids and dietary salt to expand plasma volume [^111AwD7n].

- **Counter-pressure maneuvers**: Use leg crossing, lower-body muscle tensing, or hand gripping during prodrome [^113X2zhA].

- **Medications**: Rarely needed; consider midodrine or fludrocortisone only if lifestyle measures fail and episodes are frequent/severe [^111eKhmZ].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is excellent; laugh syncope is benign with a low recurrence when triggers are avoided [^notfound]. Most patients have infrequent episodes and no long-term sequelae, though rare injuries can occur if falls happen during laughter [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Education and counseling are essential to reduce recurrence and injury risk:

- **Explain benign nature**: Reassure patients about the non-cardiac, benign nature of laugh syncope [^115D3ppH].

- **Identify triggers**: Help patients recognize and avoid vigorous laughter or anticipate episodes [^111AwD7n].

- **Prevent injuries**: Advise sitting or lying down if laughter-induced syncope is anticipated [^notfound].

- **Encourage hydration**: Emphasize adequate fluid and salt intake [^111AwD7n].

- **Provide resources**: Offer written materials or support groups for coping and prevention [^notfound].

---

Laugh syncope without cardiac disease is a benign, reflex-mediated syncope triggered by laughter; with education, trigger avoidance, and conservative measures, recurrence and injury risk are low and prognosis is excellent.

Detailed history taking is of paramount importance to establish a reliable diagnosis in patients with transient loss of consciousness. In this article the clinical symptoms and signs of the successive phases of a syncopal episode are reviewed. A failure of the systemic circulation to perfuse the brain sufficiently results in a stereotyped progression of neurological symptoms and signs culminating in loss of consciousness; when transient, this is syncope. Prior to loss of consciousness the affected individual tends to exhibit unclear thinking, followed by fixation of the eyes in the midline and a 'frozen' appearance. Narrowing of the field of vision with loss of colour vision ('greying' out) and finally a complete loss of vision (hence 'blacking' out) occurs. Hearing loss may occur following loss of vision. This process may take as little as approximately 7 s in cases of sudden complete circulatory arrest (e.g. abrupt asystole), but in other circumstances it may take longer depending on the rate and depth of cerebral hypoperfusion. Complete loss of consciousness occurs with the 'turning up' of the eyeballs. Profound cerebral hypoperfusion may be accompanied by myoclonic jerks.

Syncope and the trauma team

Syncope is common; 42% of the population experience syncope by the age of 70, accounting for up to 6% of hospital admissions. A reduction in cerebral perfusion leads to a transient loss of consciousness (TLoC) and loss of muscular tone and, if upright, will precipitate a fall. Injuries associated with trauma are governed by impact energy and patient condition, where frailty factors such as age, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis influence the morbidity and mortality associated with trauma. Increased frailty in the elderly population can cause their falls from a standing height to incur significant trauma, including but not limited to fragility fractures, soft tissue injury, joint dislocation, and head injury. However, with falls increasingly dominating trauma presentations in an aging population, the burden of syncope care will continue to span across a breadth of specialities from general and emergency medicine practitioners to surgeons and medical physicians.

Syncope is under-reported, and the harm inflicted by failure of recognition and diagnosis can be significant. The Framingham Heart and Offspring studies followed up 7814 participants during an average of 17 years, identifying that those who suffered cardiac syncope had a 2.01 increased risk (HR, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.73) of death from any cause when compared with those who did not experience syncope. This highlights a valuable opportunity for trauma teams to identify syncope as a cause of unexplained falls and to prevent significant future harm through the correct diagnosis and treatment of serious underlying disease.

### Life and death diagnosis [^116qPuBB]. Practical Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of episodes of transient loss of consciousness can be straightforward but can also present some of the greatest diagnostic difficulties. In most circumstances, when there is uncertainty, usually when there have been only one or a few poorly observed events, it may be reasonable to admit to that uncertainty and await any further events to clarify the diagnosis. We have reason to know from bitter experience that this is not always the case and that more rigorous consideration of investigation may be justified rather than allowing the passage of time to clarify the diagnosis.

### New concepts in the assessment of syncope [^115Fuzs3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Significant progress has been made in the past 3 decades in our understanding of the various causes of loss of consciousness thanks to the publication of several important studies and guidelines. In particular, the recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide a reference standard for optimal quality service delivery. This paper gives the reader brief guidance on how to manage a patient with syncope, with reference to the above guidelines. Despite the progress made, the management of patients with syncope remains largely unsatisfactory because of the presence of a significant gap between knowledge and its application. Two new concepts aimed at filling that gap are currently under evaluation: syncope facilities with specialist backup and interactive decision-making software. Preliminary data have shown that a standardized syncope assessment, especially when coupled with interactive decision-making software, decreases admission rate and unnecessary testing and improves diagnostic yield, thus reducing cost per diagnosis. The long-term effects of such a new health care model on the rate of diagnosis and survival await future studies.

Cardiovascular — Adult and Pediatric Syncope and Near Syncope — patient safety and transport considerations: Patients suffering from syncope due to arrhythmia may experience recurrent arrhythmias and should therefore be placed on a cardiac monitor. Geriatric patients suffering falls from standing may sustain significant injury and should be diligently screened for trauma. For patients where a lower risk etiology is suspected, e.g., vasovagal syncope, decisions regarding delayed or non-transport should be made in consultation with medical direction. By being most proximate to the scene and to the patient's presentation, EMS clinicians are commonly in a unique position to identify the cause of syncope, and consideration of potential causes, ongoing monitoring of vitals and cardiac rhythm and detailed exam and history are essential pieces of information to pass on to hospital clinicians.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Situational syncope — situational syncope is defined as syncope occurring only in certain distinct and usually memorable circumstances, including micturition syncope, defecation syncope, cough syncope, laugh syncope, and swallow syncope; appropriate investigations should be undertaken to determine an underlying etiology, including causes that may be reversible; evidence for treatment is limited mainly to case reports, small case series, and small observational studies; treatment of most types of situational syncope relies heavily on avoidance or elimination of a triggering event; and increased fluid and salt consumption and reduction or removal of hypotensive drugs and diuretics are encouraged where appropriate and safe.

### Trauma and syncope: looking beyond the injury [^114oLqf3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

The cardiac causes of syncope must be identified as priority as they carry the greatest risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), defined as death from a cardiac cause within 1 hour from the onset of symptoms. Cardiac causes of syncope include arrhythmia, structural heart disease and conditions affecting the cardiopulmonary and great vessels. In general, these relate to the obstruction of cardiac output limiting blood supply to the brain. OH describes a drop in systolic blood pressure of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 10 mm Hg on assuming the upright position and can be associated with intravascular volume depletion, medication side effects, and primary and secondary autonomic failures.

Reflex and other etiologies of syncope — definitions and key features — are outlined as: Reflex (neurally mediated) syncope is "syncope due to a reflex that causes vasodilation, bradycardia, or both"; vasovagal syncope (VVS) is "the most common form of reflex syncope" and "may occur with upright posture… or with exposure to emotional stress, pain, or medical settings", is "characterized by diaphoresis, warmth, nausea, and pallor", is "associated with vasodepressor hypotension and/or inappropriate bradycardia", and is "often followed by fatigue", with diagnosis primarily by history, exam, and eyewitness observation; carotid sinus syndrome is "reflex syncope associated with carotid sinus hypersensitivity", with hypersensitivity present when "a pause ≥ 3 s and/or a decrease of systolic pressure ≥ 50 mm Hg occurs upon stimulation of the carotid sinus"; situational syncope is "reflex syncope associated with a specific action, such as coughing, laughing, swallowing, micturition, or defecation"; cardiac (cardiovascular) syncope is "caused by bradycardia, tachycardia, or hypotension due to low cardiac index, blood flow obstruction, vasodilation, or acute vascular dissection"; noncardiac syncope is "due to noncardiac causes, which include reflex syncope, OH, volume depletion, dehydration, and blood loss".

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^112asAtg]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Treatment of syncope — general principles: The principal goals of treatment for patients with syncope are to prolong survival, limit physical injuries, and prevent recurrences. The importance and priority of these different goals are dependent on the cause of syncope; for example, in patients with VT causing syncope, the mortality risk is clearly predominant, while in patients with reflex syncope the prevention of recurrences and/or limitation of injuries. Knowledge of the cause of syncope has a key role in selection of treatment, and once the cause has been ascertained, the second goal is to assess the mechanism leading to syncope.

Syncope can be a dramatic and frightening experience for the patient and onlookers. It can also be a confusing area for doctors, with a lack of diagnostic certainty and a differential that ranges from the completely benign to the life-threatening. This is a tricky area for clinicians, who can find it difficult to reassure their patients and their families. The aim of this article is to present a clear scheme for appropriate investigation and referral of paediatric patients with syncope. The aim of investigations in such cases should be to confirm or exclude serious, life-threatening causes of syncope.

### Key challenges in the current management of syncope [^1125sY5T]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Patients commonly present with syncope at emergency departments and other facilities for urgent care. Syncope is understood by physicians to be a transient, self-terminating period of cerebral hypoperfusion that usually results from systemic hypotension, and clinical guidelines for the care of patients with presumed syncope are available. However, the diagnosis and management of such patients continue to pose important diagnostic, therapeutic, and economic challenges, which are the focus of this Review. First, we discuss how to improve symptom characterization to distinguish syncope from other forms of transient loss of consciousness and syncope mimics. Second, we compare methods of risk stratification in patients with suspected syncope, and recommend the introduction of syncope clinics with enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration to optimize patient care at reduced expense. Third, we highlight the importance of the appropriate selection of diagnostic tools and treatment strategies in these syncope clinics. Finally, we address the difficulties associated with therapy for the most-common form of syncope — vasovagal or reflex syncope.

Syncope definitions (Table 2) — vasovagal syncope (VVS), carotid sinus syndrome, situational syncope, and postural (orthostatic) tachycardia syndrome (POTS): VVS is the most common form of reflex syncope mediated by the vasovagal reflex. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is present when a pause ≥ 3 s and/or a decrease of systolic pressure ≥ 50 mm Hg occurs upon stimulation of the carotid sinus. POTS is characterized by an increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm during a positional change from supine to standing or ≥ 40 bpm in those 12–19 y of age, with the absence of OH (≥ 20 mmHg reduction in systolic BP), and the standing heart rate is often ≥ 120 bpm. Situational syncope is associated with a specific action, such as coughing, laughing, swallowing, micturition, or defecation.

Syncope in the elderly — causes and assessment: The most common causes of syncope in the elderly are orthostatic hypotension (OH), reflex syncope, especially carotid sinus syndrome (CSS), and cardiac arrhythmias, and different forms may co-exist in one patient, complicating diagnosis. Polypharmacy is frequent and relevant to evaluation: "One-third of individuals over 65 years are taking three or more prescribed medications, which may cause or contribute to syncope", and "Medication history should include the time relationship with onset of syncope". Cognitive issues and witness availability affect history quality: "Cognitive impairment is present in 5% of 65 year olds and 20% of 80 year olds", and "it is important to pursue a witness account of episodes, although this is not available in up to 60% of cases". Examination priorities are specified: "Evaluation of neurological and locomotor systems, including observation of gait and balance, is useful. If cognitive impairment is suspected, the Mini–Mental State Examination should be performed". Etiologic frequencies include: "Cardioinhibitory CSS is the recognized cause of symptoms in up to 20% of elderly patients with syncope. CSH of predominantly vasodepressor form is equally prevalent, but its potential role in syncope is much less clear".

### Syncope in the athletic patient [^112BK4Ms]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common but concerning event in athletic patients. As such, efforts must be made to distinguish presyncope from syncope with a critical distinction of syncope during exercise and postexercise syncope. Syncope most often occurs just after exercise and is usually benign; however, syncope during exercise may be a sign of pathologic structural or electrical cardiac issues. Solving this diagnostic puzzle mandates a detailed history and examination frequently augmented with diagnostic testing and imaging studies. Recommendations for treatment and potential restriction from activity also present challenging decisions to the health care provider.

Syncope is a common reason for ED attendance and it presents a major management challenge with regard to the appropriate workup and disposition. Nearly 50% of patients are admitted, and for many this is unnecessary; clinical decision rules have not proven to decrease unnecessary admissions. The European Society of Cardiology has recently developed guidance for managing syncope in the ED. This article highlights the key steps in evaluating syncope in the ED, factors involved in determining risk of a cardiac cause, and considerations for admission, observation or discharge.

### Syncope management unit: evolution of the concept and practice implementation [^112g5p4N]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Syncope, a clinical syndrome, has many potential causes. The prognosis of a patient experiencing syncope varies from benign outcome to increased risk of mortality or sudden death, determined by the etiology of syncope and the presence of underlying disease. Because a definitive diagnosis often cannot be established immediately, hospital admission is frequently recommended as the "default" approach to ensure patient's safety and an expedited evaluation. Hospital care is costly while no studies have shown that clinical outcomes are improved by the in-patient practice approach. The syncope unit is an evolving practice model based on the hypothesis that a multidisciplinary team of physicians and allied staff with expertise in syncope management, working together and equipped with standard clinical tools could improve clinical outcomes. Preliminary data have demonstrated that a specialized syncope unit can improve diagnosis in a timely manner, reduce hospital admission and decrease the use of unnecessary diagnostic tests. In this review, models of syncope units in the emergency department, hospital and outpatient clinics from different practices in different countries are discussed. Similarities and differences of these syncope units are compared. Outcomes and endpoints from these studies are summarized. Developing a syncope unit with a standardized protocol applicable to most practice settings would be an ultimate goal for clinicians and investigators who have interest, expertise, and commitment to improve care for this large patient population.

### Syncope: therapeutic approaches [^114eYxmc]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common clinical problem characterized by transient, spontaneously self-terminating loss of consciousness with complete and prompt recovery; the cause is insufficiency of cerebral oxygen/nutrient supply most often due to a transient fall of systemic arterial pressure to levels below those tolerated by cerebrovascular autoregulation. Careful and thorough evaluation of the cause of syncope is warranted in all patients. Determining that certain individuals are at "low mortality risk" is inadequate; syncope, although often benign from a mortality perspective, tends to recur, is associated with risk of physical injury, diminishes quality-of-life, and might lead to restriction from employment or avocation. However, the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of syncope is challenging for many reasons. First, syncope is only 1 of many causes of transient loss of consciousness. Second, the patient's symptoms are fleeting, and the patient is generally fully recovered when seen in the clinic; only infrequently are there helpful physical findings. Third, spontaneous events are often unwitnessed by medical professionals; consequently, the medical history of symptom events is usually a "second-hand" or "third-hand" story. Finally, there is often an excessive sense of diagnostic "urgency" that tends to result in a rush to undertake multiple poorly considered "diagnostic" testing procedures; a deliberate approach based on initial risk stratification is more likely to reap the dual rewards of a correct diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment in a cost-effective manner.

### The evaluation and management of pediatric syncope [^115eGfnH]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common problem in children and adolescents. It is typically caused by benign neurally mediated hypotension, but other, more concerning, etiologies of syncope must be considered. In most instances, the underlying cause of syncope in the pediatric patient can be determined by obtaining a thorough history and physical examination. Attention to the cardiac, neurological, and psychological history and examination can rule out more rare causes of loss of consciousness. Most individuals with neurally mediated hypotension can be treated with lifestyle measures including aggressive hydration, dietary salt, and an exercise program. In instances where lifestyle modification fails, medications may offer symptomatic improvement.

From the AFP Editors Although the incidence of syncope, which has multiple causes and presentations, varies by population, a prevalence as high as 41% has been reported. The American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and Heart Rhythm Society have released guidelines to assist physicians in evaluating and treating syncope. Historically, factors associated with a cardiac cause of syncope include age older than 60 years, male sex, ischemic heart disease, structural heart disease, previous arrhythmias, reduced ventricular function, brief prodrome, sudden loss of consciousness, syncope while supine or during exertion, experiencing only one or two syncope episodes, abnormal findings on cardiac examination, family history of inheritable conditions or sudden cardiac death before 50 years of age, and congenital heart disease.

Factors associated with a noncardiac cause include younger age, absence of cardiac disease, syncope episodes only while standing, positional change, prodrome, triggers, and recurrence or prolonged history of syncope. Orthostatic blood pressure should be measured and heart changes should be evaluated when the patient is lying, sitting, immediately standing, and upright. Murmurs, gallops, and rubs should be identified; heart rate and rhythm should be assessed; and a neurologic examination should be performed. Factors to look for on physical examination or laboratory testing include bleeding, persistent abnormal vital signs, abnormal findings on ECG, and positive results on a troponin test.

Risk factors for long-term morbidity and mortality include male sex, older age, absence of nausea or vomiting, ventricular arrhythmia, cancer, structural heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and a high CHADS. Examples of other serious cardiac and noncardiac conditions associated with syncope that may warrant treatment in a hospital setting include cardiac ischemia, aortic stenosis, acute heart failure, pulmonary embolism, severe anemia, major trauma, and persistent abnormal vital signs. Stress Testing Exercise stress testing may be beneficial in determining a cause of syncope related to exertion, according to lower-quality studies; however, caution should be taken when performing stress testing, and proper advanced life support must be available.

### Vascular causes of syncope: an emergency medicine review [^114o5W3c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Syncope is a common emergency department (ED) complaint, accounting for 2% of visits annually. A wide variety of etiologies can result in syncope, and vascular causes may be deadly.

Objective

This review evaluates vascular causes of syncope and their evaluation and management in the ED.

Discussion

Syncope is defined by a brief loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone and complete, spontaneous recovery without medical intervention. Causes include cardiac, vasovagal, orthostatic, neurologic, medication-related, and idiopathic, and most cases of syncope will not receive a specific diagnosis pertaining to the cause. Emergency physicians are most concerned with life-threatening causes such as dysrhythmia and obstruction, and electrocardiogram is a primary means of evaluation. However, vascular etiologies can result in patient morbidity and mortality. These conditions include pulmonary embolism, subclavian steal, aortic dissection, cerebrovascular disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, carotid/vertebral dissection, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. A focused history and physical examination can assist emergency physicians in determining the need for further testing and management.

Conclusions

Syncope is common and may be the result of a deadly condition. The emergency physician, through history and physical examination, can determine the need for further evaluation and resuscitation of these patients, with consideration of vascular etiologies of syncope.

Other reflex conditions (situational syncope) — "Situational syncope is defined as syncope occurring only in certain distinct and usually memorable circumstances, including micturition syncope, defecation syncope, cough syncope, laugh syncope, and swallow syncope". The document states, "Appropriate investigations should be undertaken to determine an underlying etiology, including causes that may be reversible". It notes, "Evidence for treatment is limited mainly to case reports, small case series, and small observational studies". Management emphasizes triggers: "Treatment of most types of situational syncope relies heavily on avoidance or elimination of a triggering event", and when that is not possible, "increased fluid and salt consumption and reduction or removal of hypotensive drugs and diuretics are encouraged where appropriate and safe".

### Syncope as a sign of occult cancers: a population-based cohort study [^11433j8m]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Syncope is defined as a sudden loss of consciousness of short duration, with an inability to maintain postural tone, and spontaneous complete recovery. Episodes occur frequently, accounting for ~1% of all referrals to emergency departments. The lifetime cumulative risk of syncope is approximately 35%. Clinically, the condition is categorised on the basis of underlying pathophysiology, i.e. reflex-mediated, orthostatic hypotension or cardiac syncope. Whether syncope may be the presenting sign of an occult cancer is largely unknown. Only a few case reports are available. – Thus, firm epidemiological evidence on the association between syncope and cancer is lacking.

Syncope can occur due to stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system or carotid sinus by direct neoplastic infiltration.– Syncope also can be the first sign of intracranial tumours due to involvement of autonomic cardiovascular control areas.– Additionally, a recent multicentre study showed that pulmonary embolism was identified in nearly one of every six patients hospitalised for a first episode of syncope, and pulmonary embolism, in turn, is established as a marker for occult cancer. Therefore, it is possible that syncope may be associated with an underlying undiagnosed cancer. Electrolyte imbalance and paraneoplastic phenomena also may induce syncope, as observed in patients with pheochromocytoma, mastocytosis, and carcinoid syndrome.

To study these issues in detail, we examined overall risk of cancer and risk of site-specific cancers in a large cohort of syncope patients, and we compared their cancer risk with that of the general population.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmia classification by clinical presentation — definitions used include: Asymptomatic defined as "The absence of symptoms that could result from an arrhythmia". Minimal symptoms/palpitations are patient-reported palpitations in the chest, throat, or neck with sensations such as "Heartbeat sensations that feel like pounding or racing", "An unpleasant awareness of heartbeat", or "Feeling skipped beats or a pause". Presyncope is reported with symptoms including dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or "Graying out". Syncope is "Sudden loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone, not related to anesthesia, with spontaneous recovery as reported by the patient or observer", and patients "may experience syncope when supine". Sudden cardiac death is "Death from an unexpected circulatory arrest, usually due to a cardiac arrhythmia occurring within an hour of the onset of symptoms", whereas sudden cardiac arrest is the same presentation "in whom medical intervention (e.g., defibrillation) reverses the event".

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^114tk66j]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope — structural cardiovascular disease mechanisms — Structural cardiovascular diseases can cause syncope when circulatory demands exceed the heart's ability to increase output, and syncope is of great concern when fixed or dynamic obstruction to left ventricular outflow is present. The faint may result from inadequate blood flow due to mechanical obstruction, but in several cases is not solely due to restricted cardiac output and may involve an inappropriate reflex, orthostatic hypotension, or arrhythmia (particularly atrial fibrillation), making mechanisms multifactorial. Recognizing the heart as the cause is justified to allow correction of the underlying structural disease when possible.

### New insights in diagnostics and therapies in syncope: a novel approach to non-cardiac syncope [^111eKhmZ]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

This article aims to give advice on how to identify and manage patients with syncope who are at risk of severe outcomes, that is, at risk of trauma, potentially life-threatening episodes or frequent recurrences reducing quality of life. The first step of syncope diagnostic assessment is to identify patients with cardiac syncope, and once established, these patients must receive the adequate mechanism-specific treatment. If cardiac syncope is unlikely, reflex (neurally mediated) syncope and orthostatic hypotension are the most frequent causes of transient loss of consciousness. For these presentations, efficacy of therapy is largely determined by the mechanism of syncope rather than its aetiology or clinical features. The identified mechanism of syncope should be carefully assessed and assigned either to hypotensive or bradycardic phenotype, which will determine the choice of therapy (counteracting hypotension or counteracting bradycardia). The results of recent trials indicate that 'mechanism-specific therapy' is highly effective in preventing recurrences. Established mechanism-specific treatment strategies include withdrawal of hypotensive drugs, applying fludrocortisone and midodrine for the hypotensive phenotype and cardiac pacing in the bradycardic phenotype.

Other reflex conditions — situational syncope is defined and managed primarily by trigger avoidance, with supportive measures when avoidance is not possible. Situational syncope is defined as syncope occurring only in certain distinct and usually memorable circumstances, including micturition syncope, defecation syncope, cough syncope, laugh syncope, and swallow syncope. Appropriate investigations should be undertaken to determine an underlying etiology, including causes that may be reversible, but evidence for treatment is limited mainly to case reports, small case series, and small observational studies.

Syncope is a common presentation to the emergency room. Unlike in the adult population, most pediatric syncope has non-life-threatening causes, and minimal evaluation in the emergency department is appropriate with parental reassurance. Despite this benign prognosis, care must be made to find uncommon and potentially fatal causes. The primary purpose of evaluation of the patient with syncope is to determine whether the patient is at increased risk for death and needs either admission to the hospital or an expedited outpatient evaluation. This article reviews some of the most dangerous causes of syncope in the pediatric patient.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® syncope [^117RZSz7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Syncope and presyncope lead to well over one million emergency room visits in the United States each year. Elucidating the cause of syncope or presyncope, which are grouped together given similar etiologies and outcomes, can be exceedingly difficult given the diverse etiologies. This becomes more challenging as some causes, such as vasovagal syncope, are relatively innocuous while others, such as cardiac-related syncope, carry a significant increased risk of death. While the mainstay of syncope and presyncope assessment is a detailed history and physical examination, imaging can play a role in certain situations. In patients where a cardiovascular etiology is suspected based on the appropriate history, physical examination, and ECG findings, resting transthoracic echocardiography is usually considered appropriate for the initial imaging. While no imaging studies are considered usually appropriate when there is a low probability of cardiac or neurologic pathology, chest radiography may be appropriate in certain clinical situations. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Harms

Psychological harms

Humour weakens resolve and promotes brand preference, so the prudent response to the drug rep's spiel would be "Don't make me laugh".

Cardiovascular harms

Hearty laughter can cause syncope, perhaps by a neural reflex response to the increase in intrathoracic pressure that accompanies intense laughter. Syncope after laughing has accompanied bilateral carotid stenosis in Takayasu arteritis. Laughing can cause conduction anomaliesand arrhythmias. A woman with long QT syndrome and a history of torsade de pointes took ziprasidone, collapsed, and died after intense sustained laughter. Laughter in Angelman's ("happy puppet") syndrome can cause asystolic arrest, apparently of vagal origin. Laughing fit to burst can cause cardiac rupture.

Respiratory harms

The quick intake of breath that accompanies laugher can provoke inhalation of foreign bodies.

In patients with asthma, laughter sometimes triggers an attack, but cough after laughing is commoner than a good wheeze. Asthma was once perceived as a psychological disorder, but Gillespie noted that laughter probably had a physical rather than a psychological effect, and that even hollow (non-Duchenne) laughter could trigger an asthma attack.

Laughter can cause pneumothorax. Pilgaard-Dahl syndrome, named after two Danish revue actors, is pneumothorax in middle aged smokers induced by laughter. If the YouTube video we have watchedis representative, non-Danish speakers are not at risk.

Interlobular emphysema can reportedly result from "efforts of parturition and of defaecation, by the lifting of heavy weights, during coitus, by paroxysms of rage, excessive laughter, and hysterical convulsions".

Exhaled airflow — from sneezing, whistling, and laughing, for instance — potentially disseminates infection. Paper tissues may reduce spread. So, we suspect, might laughing up your sleeve.

### Do symptoms predict cardiac arrhythmias and mortality in patients with syncope? [^1164eXDE]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Results History and physical examination led to the cause of syncope in 222 of 497 patients enrolled. In the remaining 275 patients, the absence of nausea and vomiting before syncope and electrocardiographic abnormalities were predictors of arrhythmic syncope. Underlying cardiac disease was the only predictor of 1-year mortality. No symptom remained as independent predictor for 1-year mortality or syncope recurrence. Unsustained ventricular tachycardia or sinus pauses of 2 to 2. 9 seconds were classified in the "possible" category in the absence of another cause by clinical or laboratory testing. Diagnostic Interview Schedule modules for major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, somatization disorder, and alcohol and substance abuse were used for assessment of psychiatric comorbidity as has been previously reported. 11–13.

The most frequent symptoms immediately before the LOC were dizziness, diaphoreses, nausea and/or vomiting, and generalized weakness. The most common symptoms during or after the LOC were generalized weakness, confusion, diaphoreses, and nausea and/or vomiting. Most patients were standing or sitting before the event, and the LOC was of short duration. Trauma occurred in 88 patients during the index syncopal episode, but only 14 patients had major trauma. The symptoms of dyspnea and flushing before syncope were found to be significant univariate predictors of time to death.

In Cox proportional hazards model that included age, number of previous syncopal episodes, heart disease classification cardiac comorbid conditions, presence of trauma, duration of index syncopal episode, and initial ECG, only the heart disease classification class remained a significant predictor of mortality. The heart disease classification was also the only independent predictor of 1-year mortality when cardiac death was used as the outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate the usefulness of these symptoms and characteristics in identifying high-risk patients. Our study shows that many symptoms associated with the LOC were not useful in predicting arrhythmic syncope. Only absence of nausea and vomiting was an independent predictor in identifying those patients at higher risk for arrhythmic syncope after controlling for known predictors of cardiac arrhythmias.

Psychogenic pseudosyncope — definition, features, and evaluation describes a syndrome of apparent loss of consciousness occurring in the absence of impaired cerebral perfusion or function that is an involuntary response and should not be confused with malingering or Munchausen syndrome. Patients are often young females with a higher prevalence of preexisting vasovagal syncope (VVS) or a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, with apparent duration of loss of consciousness often long (5 to 20 minutes) and episodes frequent, and common characteristics include closed eyes, lack of pallor and diaphoresis, and usually little physical harm. A normal pulse, blood pressure, or electroencephalogram (EEG) during a psychogenic pseudosyncope episode can be documented, and although many patients can be diagnosed with a careful history, tilt-table testing with or without transcranial Doppler and monitoring of an EEG is helpful.

### Loss of consciousness in the young child [^11239rSK]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the very young child (less than eight years of age), transient loss of consciousness represents a diagnostic and management dilemma for clinicians. While most commonly benign, syncope may be due to cardiac dysfunction which can be life-threatening. It can be secondary to an underlying ion channelopathy, cardiac inflammation, cardiac ischemia, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, or pulmonary hypertension. Patients with genetic disorders require careful evaluation for a cardiac cause of syncope. Among the noncardiac causes, vasovagal syncope is the most common etiology. Breath-holding spells are commonly seen in this age group. Other causes of transient loss of consciousness include seizures, neurovascular pathology, head trauma, psychogenic pseudosyncope, and factitious disorder imposed on another and other forms of child abuse. A detailed social, present, past medical, and family medical history is important when evaluating loss of consciousness in the very young. Concerning characteristics of syncope include lack of prodromal symptoms, no preceding postural changes or occurring in a supine position, after exertion or a loud noise. A family history of sudden unexplained death, ion channelopathy, cardiomyopathy, or congenital deafness merits further evaluation. Due to inherent challenges in diagnosis at this age, often there is a lower threshold for referral to a specialist.

Diagnosis "is based upon a carefully taken medical history and the context of the event", and "Most of these typical common faint can be diagnosed by the patient's general practitioner and need only reassurance". "An active search for alarming symptoms is recommended", namely "syncope during exertion, syncope in the lying position, absence of external factors, family history of SCD, or slow recovery from syncope (Tables 9 and 10)". If uncertainty and risk persist, "the patient should be referred to cardiologist, internist, neurologist, psychologist/psychiatrist as appropriate or to a specialized syncope facility if available".

Case Presentation

A 40-year-old woman presented with recurrent syncope. She reported multiple (> 20) episodes of non-prodromal loss of consciousness, periodically provoked by physical exertion. One episode resulted in a nasal fracture due to the abrupt nature of her syncope. The characterization of each episode was inconsistent with a neurogenic seizure. Other causes of syncope (vasovagal, situational, carotid hypersensitivity, and orthostasis) were also deemed unlikely. On physical examination, a low-pitched, brief adventitious sound was appreciated after each S2 sound in the right lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Initial workup, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, cardiac enzymes, and ECG yielded normal results. The chest radiograph did not show any gross cardiac or pulmonary parenchymal pathologic condition (Fig 1). Telemetry did not demonstrate any malignant arrhythmias, and video-guided EEG did not document any seizure activity.

Syncope: the challenge

Syncope, a form of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) followed by rapid, complete recovery, remains a consequential medical problem. Current guidelines, stress the importance of distinguishing syncope from other forms of TLOC and altered states of consciousness including head trauma, seizures, drug overdoses, and psychogenic or metabolic causes (Figure 1). Once syncope is suspected, identifying the mechanism and cause are crucial for further management. However, reliance on history, physical examination, and clinical acumen may not be enough. The history from patient recollection and observations from witnesses, if present, may be difficult to interpret.

Figure 1
Syncope in the Context of Transient Loss of Consciousness

Adapted from the 2018 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Syncope.TIA = transient ischemic attack; TLOC = transient loss of consciousness.

A spectrum of causal and associated conditions, ranging from benign vasovagal faints to life-threatening arrhythmias and other cardiopulmonary conditions, further complicate assessment. Up to 10% of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with syncope will have serious outcomes over the short-term; identifying that high-risk population remains a primary focus. Age is a nonspecific discriminator. Older individuals may simply be at risk from concomitant, unrelated, and life-threatening conditions even if syncope itself is benign. Occasional younger individuals are at a continued risk of life-threatening collapse.ED physicians, therefore, face substantial dilemmas in risk stratification and triage, particularly for those at "intermediate risk".,

Syncope risk scores were developed to help provide a uniform methodology to help risk stratify patients with syncope. The syncope risk calculators that have been developed (Supplemental Appendix) are not clearly better than good clinical assessment. These tools have not definitively improved guidance in predicting short- and intermediate-term risk (Figure 2) of serious outcomes. Further, these risk scores are not designed to determine diagnosis, risk of recurrence, or benefit of hospitalization. Indeed, these decision rules predict outcomes based on comorbidities rather than syncope itself. American and European guidelines give Class IIb recommendations for these tools.

METHODS

Reporting of this SR is consistent with recommendations from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses as applicable to diagnostic accuracy reviews. We developed a protocol for the SR with input from methodologists with expertise in systematic reviews (A.W. R.S.) and a content expert (V.T.). We registered the protocol in PROSPERO, an international prospective registry of systematic reviews (registration ID: CRD42023428455).

Population–intervention–comparator–outcome question

The proposed PICO question is as follows: In patients 16 years of age or older who present to the ED with syncope for whom no underlying serious or life‐threatening condition is found during the index ED visit (population), are risk stratification tools (intervention), better than unstructured clinical judgment (i.e. usual care; comparison), for providing accurate prognosis and aiding disposition decision for outcomes within 30 days (outcome)?

Expert reference librarians designed and conducted a comprehensive literature search with input from one of the authors (R.S.). The search strategy incorporated medical subject headings and text words related to CDRs (clinical prediction guides, decision support techniques, algorithms, multivariate analyses, logistic models, risk assessment) and syncope (fainting, loss of consciousness, drop attack, near syncope). We searched the following databases: PubMed (1946 to June 2023), EMBASE (1946 to June 2023), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL; 1937 to June 2023), Wiley Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Wiley Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Wiley Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and.

For the gray literature search, we conducted bibliographic searches of abstracts presented at scientific meetings published in Academic Emergency Medicine, Annals of Emergency Medicine, Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine, Emergency Medicine Journal, European Journal of Emergency Medicine, Emergency Medicine Australasia, and African Journal of Emergency Medicine in English. We consulted syncope and CDR development experts for additional published or unpublished reports. Lastly, we reviewed the bibliographies of all retrieved articles to identify potentially relevant articles not identified in the electronic search strategy.

We uploaded citations into an SR software program (DistillerSR, Ottawa, ON, Canada), followed by full‐text screening. The PubMed (Ovid interface) search strategy is displayed in Appendix 1.

### Evaluation of syncope [^1146a5i6]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Syncope is a transient and abrupt loss of consciousness with complete return to preexisting neurologic function. It is classified as neurally mediated (i.e., carotid sinus hypersensitivity, situational, or vasovagal), cardiac, orthostatic, or neurogenic. Older adults are more likely to have orthostatic, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, or cardiac syncope, whereas younger adults are more likely to have vasovagal syncope. Common nonsyncopal syndromes with similar presentations include seizures, metabolic and psychogenic disorders, and acute intoxication. Patients presenting with syncope (other than neurally mediated and orthostatic syncope) are at increased risk of death from any cause. Useful clinical rules to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for immediate hospitalization include the San Francisco Syncope Rule and the Risk Stratification of Syncope in the Emergency Department rule. Guidelines suggest an algorithmic approach to the evaluation of syncope that begins with the history and physical examination. All patients presenting with syncope require electrocardiography, orthostatic vital signs, and QT interval monitoring. Patients with cardiovascular disease, abnormal electrocardiography, or family history of sudden death, and those presenting with unexplained syncope should be hospitalized for further diagnostic evaluation. Patients with neurally mediated or orthostatic syncope usually require no additional testing. In cases of unexplained syncope, further testing such as echocardiography, grade exercise testing, electrocardiographic monitoring, and electrophysiologic studies may be required. Although a subset of patients will have unexplained syncope despite undergoing a comprehensive evaluation, those with multiple episodes compared with an isolated event are more likely to have a serious underlying disorder.

LIMITATIONS

The current SRMA identifies several limitations to the topic's current evidence base. Firstly, the ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Patients With Syncope defines syncope as "A symptom that presents with an abrupt, transient, complete loss of consciousness, associated with the inability to maintain postural tone, with rapid and spontaneous recovery". It also emphasized that "There should not be clinical features of other non‐syncope causes of loss of consciousness, such as seizure, antecedent head trauma, or apparent loss of consciousness (i.e. pseudosyncope)". However, distinguishing between syncope and other causes of transient loss of consciousness can be complex. Consequently, it is plausible that some participants in the included CDR studies categorized as syncope patients did not have syncope. This misclassification can potentially impact a CDR's operating characteristics. Unfortunately, until more objective definitions for syncope emerge, this limitation will likely persist and hinder the broader utility of the relevant CDRs. In the meantime, using the real‐world syncope definition used in the studies included in the current SMRA enhances its findings' generalizability and clinical relevance.

### Clinical associations of injuries caused by vasovagal syncope: a cohort study from a tertiary syncope unit [^116gJfiP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Syncope‐related injury is an important outcome in patients with VVS with a considerably high incidence. Prior history of syncope‐related trauma, overweight and obesity, and female sex are patient characteristics indicative of injury risk. Moreover, experiencing VVS in the morning, at home, while standing, or in the absence of prodromal symptoms are associated with higher injury rates, and the absence of prodromes is associated with moderate‐to‐severe injury. Patients and physicians should attempt to minimize the risk of both syncope and injury in these situations and take precautionary measures in high‐risk environments and for high‐risk individuals. Future prospective studies can further elaborate the predictors of VVS‐associated injury.

### A guide to disorders causing transient loss of consciousness: focus on syncope [^111kTmjw]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Episodes of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) events pose diagnostic difficulties, as the causes are diverse, carry vastly different risks, and span various specialties. An inconsistent terminology contributes to the confusion. Here, we present a classification scheme for TLOC, based on ongoing multidisciplinary efforts including those of the Task Force on Syncope of the European Society of Cardiology. We also discuss the pathophysiology of TLOC and the key clinical features that aid diagnosis. TLOC is defined as an apparent loss of consciousness with an abrupt onset, a short duration, and a spontaneous and complete recovery. Syncope is defined as TLOC due to cerebral hypoperfusion, and is divided into reflex syncope (synonymous with neurally mediated syncope), syncope due to orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac syncope (arrhythmic or associated with structural cardiac disease). The other major groups of TLOC are generalized epileptic seizures, functional TLOC (psychogenic TLOC mimicking either epilepsy or syncope), and a further group of miscellaneous disorders. The management of patients who experience TLOC requires the recognition of the defining features of each of the major groups, and cooperation between different clinical specialties.

### Syncope in older adults: challenges, approach and treatment [^114u9F4K]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Syncope can have devastating consequences, resulting in injuries, accidents or even death. In our ageing society, the subsequent healthcare usage, such as emergency room presentations, surgeries and hospital admissions, forms a significant and growing socioeconomic burden. Causes of syncope in the older adult include orthostatic hypotension, carotid sinus syndrome, vasovagal syncope, structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities. As stated in the recently published World Falls Guidelines, syncope in older adults often presents as falls, which is either due to amnesia for loss of consciousness, or pre-syncope leading to a fall, especially in those prone to falls with several other risk-factors for falls present. This difference in presentation can hinder the recognition of syncope. In patients with unexplained falls, or in whom the history comprises red flags for potential syncope, special attention to (pre)syncope is therefore warranted. When syncope is mistaken for other causes of a transient loss of consciousness, such as epileptic seizures, or when syncope presents as falls, patients are often referred to multiple specialists, which may in turn lead to excessive and unnecessary diagnostic testing and costs. Specialist services that are able to provide a comprehensive assessment can improve diagnostic yield and minimise diagnostic testing, thus improving patient satisfaction. Comprehensive assessment also leads to reduced length of hospital stay. Increasingly, geriatricians are involved in the assessment of syncope in the older patient, especially given the overlap with falls. Therefore, awareness of causes of syncope, as well as state-of-the-art assessment and treatment, is of great importance.

Pediatric patients with episodes of VVS may exhibit convulsive movements during loss of consciousness that mimic epileptic seizures. In children with syncope and convulsions on tilt-table testing, 64% exhibited cardiac asystole with pauses > 3 seconds. A combined cardiology and neurology evaluation may be warranted in this group of patients with syncope and seizure-like activity.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) — clinical features and treatment context: VVS is the most common cause of syncope and a frequent reason for ED visits, with underlying pathophysiology resulting from a reflex causing hypotension and bradycardia that is triggered by prolonged standing or exposure to emotional stress, pain, or medical procedures; given the benign nature of VVS and its frequent remissions, medical treatment is usually not required unless conservative measures are unsatisfactory, although in some patients effective treatment is needed as syncopal events may result in injury and an impaired quality of life (QoL).

Other attacks that may mimic or relate to syncope — key clinical clues: Cataplexy concerns paresis or paralysis triggered by emotions, usually laughter; patients are conscious so there is no amnesia, and together with daytime sleepiness this ensures a diagnosis of narcolepsy. Falls may be due to syncope; elderly subjects may not be aware of having lost consciousness, and disorders of posture, gait, and equilibrium may mimic falls in syncope. The term 'drop attacks' is variably used for Ménière's disease, atonic epileptic seizures, and unexplained falls; it most clearly refers to middle-aged women (rarely men) who suddenly fall, remember hitting the floor, and such unexplained falls deserve medical attention.

### Syncope risk assessment in the emergency department and clinic [^1112FkU1]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The initial assessment of patients who present with presumed syncope is challenging. Syncope has many possible causes ranging from relatively benign to potentially life-threatening, and sorting through the possibilities may not be feasible given time limitations in an urgent care setting. Therefore, the physician almost always must determine whether the affected individual needs in-hospital evaluation or can be safely referred to an outpatient syncope evaluation clinic. In instances when the etiology of syncope has been diagnosed with confidence at the initial clinical evaluation, the hospitalization question is readily addressed and the appropriateness of hospitalization versus timely outpatient evaluation (preferably in a dedicated syncope management clinic) is clear. In those cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain, risk stratification schemes such as those summarized in this communication become more essential. However, at present no single risk assessment protocol appears to be satisfactory for universal application. The development of a consensus recommendation is an essential next step.

### Prospective validation of the San Francisco syncope rule to predict patients with serious outcomes [^115zAzmw]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "San Francisco Syncope Rule" for syncope and sick sinus syndrome.

The San Francisco Syncope Rule (SFSR) is a clinical prediction rule used to evaluate patients who present with syncope, or sudden temporary loss of consciousness. This rule is specifically designed for patients in the emergency department setting. The SFSR helps clinicians identify patients who are at risk of serious outcomes within 7 days of a syncope episode, such as death, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, significant hemorrhage, or any condition causing a return to the emergency department and hospitalization for related events.

The rule uses five criteria, represented by the acronym CHESS: Congestive heart failure, Hematocrit less than 30%, abnormal Electrocardiogram (ECG), Shortness of breath, and systolic blood Pressure less than 90 mmHg. If any of these criteria are present, the patient is considered at high risk.

The SFSR should not be used in patients with obvious trauma, seizure, or a clear non-cardiac cause of syncope, as well as in patients with persistent altered mental status or who are not back to their neurological baseline.

The San Francisco Syncope Rule is designed to assess the likelihood of a serious outcome following a syncope event, based on the presence of certain clinical factors. This rule utilizes a decision-making process based on five specific inputs related to the patient's condition.

The inputs include:

1. History of congestive heart failure
2. Hematocrit < 30%
3. New changes on ECG or any non-sinus rhythm
4. Shortness of breath
5. Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at triage

For each input, a binary condition is checked: if any one of these conditions is true (i.e., the patient meets any one of these criteria), then the result will indicate a likelihood of a serious outcome. Conversely, if none of these conditions are met, the result would indicate that a serious outcome is unlikely.

The computation process is as follows:

1. Check if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure.
2. Determine if the patient's hematocrit level is less than 30%.
3. Identify any new changes on the ECG or non-sinus rhythm.
4. Check for the presence of shortness of breath.
5. Verify if the patient's systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mmHg at triage.

If any of these conditions is true, the result returned is "Serious outcome is likely". If none of these conditions are true, the result is "Serious outcome is unlikely".

### Early and late-onset syncope: insight into mechanisms [^115j3Zkb]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Syncope is a common clinical problem, with ∼40% of the population experiencing at least one episode in their lifetime. The most common cause is vasovagal syncope (VVS), followed by orthostatic hypotension (OH) and cardiac syncope. The head-up tilt (HUT) test is used in clinical practice for diagnosing hypotensive susceptibility to vasovagal reflex and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction as syncope aetiology.

Epidemiological studies indicate that syncope has a bimodal incidence through life with peaks at 15–20 and > 70 years. The incidence of syncope rises steeply after 70 years. Syncope aetiology differs with age. In the young, most cases are due to VVS, while cardiac syncope, OH, and effects of medications become more common in old age. Syncope in older patients is a diagnostic challenge as they tend to have short or absent prodromes and may present with falls where amnesia for the event conceals loss of consciousness. Data point to increased mortality and cardiovascular morbidity following unexplained syncope.

To establish effective diagnostic approaches for syncope, the causes in different age groups and factors associated with the final diagnosis need elucidation. One such factor is the age at which patients experience syncope for the first time. Only a few studies, focused on young adults or patients with an established VVS diagnosis, report the age at first syncope. It is unclear whether the age at first syncope impacts the results of syncope investigation.

The aim of the present study was to ascertain if the bimodal epidemiological pattern pertains to a large sample of unexplained syncope patients investigated in a specialized syncope unit and to study the influence of early-onset vs. late-onset syncope on clinical characteristics and final HUT diagnosis in this population.

### Selecting appropriate diagnostic tools for evaluating the patient with syncope / collapse [^113iy3LK]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The investigation of syncope is challenging and physicians have an ever-increasing array of diagnostic tools at their disposal. There are two essential goals that drive investigation: risk stratification and identification of etiology. In this review, we outline our approach while providing a synopsis of the available supportive evidence. The key to syncope is in the story as told by the patient and a bystander, since this drives both risk assessment and diagnostic testing. All patients should initially be evaluated with a systematic history and physical examination as well as an ECG. The initial evaluation provides an estimation of risk and directs whether inpatient or outpatient evaluation is appropriate. In a substantial proportion of patients, the etiology will be evident after initial evaluation and no further investigation is required. In the remaining, targeted use of additional investigations in the form of cardiac imaging, provocative testing and/or ambulatory ECG monitoring should be performed. A thoughtful and systematic approach to the investigation of syncope optimizes the diagnostic yield but also ensures efficient usage of limited health care resources.

### Do serial troponins predict the need for cardiac evaluation in trauma patients after ground-level fall? [^116iAPkt]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Falls are the most common mechanism of injury in US trauma centers, with an estimated annual cost of US$50 billion in 2015. The majority of patients who present after ground-level fall are not injured. However, a subset of patients have life-threatening injuries that must be rapidly identified, and in some, the fall is a symptom of an underlying illness that must be identified to prevent further complications. Given the increasing prevalence of falls in our aging population, modest improvements in the evaluation have the potential to improve both patient care and reduce healthcare costs.

The initial goals in the evaluation of a patient after ground-level fall are twofold, to rapidly identify and treat injuries, and to determine the cause of the fall. Falls are classically divided into mechanical (eg, tripping over a rug in the dark) and syncopal in etiology (a loss of consciousness leading to fall). For syncopal or pre-syncopal falls, 10% are estimated to be from a cardiac etiology. It is critically important to identify this group as they have the greatest association with subsequent sudden cardiac death. Thus, many institutions have developed a 'syncopal workup' protocol which is applied liberally in patients with any suspicion of syncope.

At our urban level 1 trauma center, all patients with suspected syncope after fall undergo a full history and physical examination, ECG, chest X-ray, and basic laboratory testing including troponin level testing using a highly sensitive assay. Some of these patients also undergo transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Patients with an initial serum troponin T level above the laboratory-defined normal value (19 ng/L) have repeat levels drawn every 4–6 hours until the troponin level peaks. This practice for the troponin levels was adapted from the approach to patients with concern for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. However, although elevated troponins have been shown to be associated with increased adverse events after syncope, the optimum use of serum troponin levels in patients after ground-level fall is not well defined. Therefore, the aims of our study were (1) to understand the relationship between initial troponin level and need for further cardiac workup or adverse cardiac outcomes, (2) to understand the impact of serial troponin values on the same outcomes, and (3) to clarify the relative association of higher cut-off troponin values with the outcomes of interest.

### Trauma and syncope: looking beyond the injury [^117XJ4hd]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Causes of syncope

There are several different causes of TLoC as shown in figure 1. Some are benign and others, such as cardiac syncope, are associated with a greater mortality. It is therefore important to recognize the potential cause of the fall for risk stratification and management. The role of the trauma team is to stabilize and refer onward or safely discharge the patient with suspected syncope. After stabilization, the question trauma teams must answer is: was this fall due to a TLoC and what was the cause?

Figure 1
Classifications of TLoC and syncope. TLoC can be broadly categorized into a traumatic and non-traumatic loss of consciousness, with non-traumatic further subdivided into four groups: syncope, psychogenic pseudo-syncope, epileptic seizures, and rare miscellaneous causes. Syncope is categorized into four types: reflex, cardiac, orthostatic hypotension, and unexplained syncope. Their relative mean frequencies are stated.TLoC, transient loss of consciousness.

Syncope is probable where TLoC occurs with features present that are indicative of reflex syncope, cardiac syncope, or orthostatic hypotension (OH)-induced syncope (table 1), without any features suggestive of non-syncopal causes (table 2). A review of major research publications describing syncope in 5248 patients identified the mechanism as 59.3% reflex syncope, 10.4% cardiac syncope, 9.1% syncope due to OH, and 11.3% remained unexplained syncope.

Table 1
Causes of syncope

Table 2
Non-syncopal conditions presenting with collapse

Reflex syncope occurs when a neural trigger causes vasodilation and/or bradycardia when activated inducing cerebral hypoperfusion. Vasovagal syncope, or fainting in common parlance, is the most common form of reflex syncope and is associated with diaphoresis, nausea, pallor, and warmth after upright posture or emotional triggers. Reflex syncope also includes situational syncope, which is a faint triggered in a specific situation including micturition, coughing, sneezing, defecation, laughing, swallowing, or stretching. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity can induce carotid sinus syndrome and is rare under the age of 40. This is a condition where the blood pressure sensing system in the carotid arteries becomes oversensitive and induces a significant and inappropriate bradycardia and/or hypotension with carotid pressure. Major trauma is more frequently associated with carotid sinus syndrome (24.3%) than other syncope types (2.2–7.9%) presenting to the emergency department (ED).

### Evaluation of syncope [^112mjCmW]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Though relatively common, syncope is a complex presenting symptom defined by a transient loss of consciousness, usually accompanied by falling, and with spontaneous recovery. Syncope must be carefully differentiated from other conditions that may cause a loss of consciousness or falling. Syncope can be classified into four categories: reflex mediated, cardiac, orthostatic, and cerebrovascular. A cardiac cause of syncope is associated with significantly higher rates of morbidity and mortality than other causes. The evaluation of syncope begins with a careful history, physical examination, and electrocardiography. Additional testing should be based on the initial clinical evaluation. Older patients and those with underlying organic heart disease or abnormal electrocardiograms generally will need additional cardiac evaluation, which may include prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring, echocardiography, and exercise stress testing. When structural heart disease is excluded, tests for neurogenic reflex-mediated syncope, such as head-up tilt-table testing and carotid sinus massage, should be performed. The use of tests such as head computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, carotid and transcranial ultrasonography, and electroencephalography to detect cerebrovascular causes of syncope should be reserved for those few patients with syncope whose history suggests a neurologic event or who have focal neurologic signs or symptoms.

Vasovagal syncope — epidemiology and outcomes — emergency department cohorts generally feature older patients with mean ages around 60–65 years, and approximately 35% of patients with syncope remain undiagnosed. Approximately 30%–50% of patients with syncope are diagnosed with an autonomically mediated form, most of which are vasovagal. The overall 1-year recurrence rate is approximately 25%–35%, and this rate can be predicted by the number of syncopes in the year prior to assessment. Most patients stop fainting after assessment and in the absence of specific therapy.

### Synopsis of the national institute for health and clinical excellence guideline for management of transient loss of consciousness [^117CxCGN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Description

Transient loss of consciousness (TLoC) is common and often leads to incorrect diagnosis, unnecessary investigation, or inappropriate choice of specialist referral. In August 2010, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published a guideline that addressed the initial assessment of and most appropriate specialist referral for persons who have experienced TLoC. The guideline focused on correct diagnosis and relevant specialist referral and did not make treatment recommendations. This synopsis describes the principal recommendations concerning assessment and referral of a patient with TLoC.

Methods

The National Clinical Guideline Centre developed the guidelines by using the standard methodology of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. A multidisciplinary guideline panel generated review questions, discussed evidence, and formulated recommendations. The panel included a technical team from the National Clinical Guideline Centre, who reviewed and graded all relevant evidence identified from literature searches published in English up to November 2009 and performed health-economic modeling. Both guideline development and final modifications were informed by comments from stakeholders and the public.

Recommendations

The panel made clear recommendations regarding the assessment of a person after TLoC, which emphasized the importance of clinical reasoning in diagnosis. Persons with uncomplicated faint, situational syncope, or orthostatic hypotension should receive electrocardiography but do not otherwise require immediate further investigation or specialist referral. Persons with features that suggest epilepsy should be referred for specialist neurologic assessment; brief seizure-like activity was recognized as a common occurrence during syncope that should not be regarded as indicating epilepsy. Persons with a suspected cardiac cause for TLoC or in whom TLoC is unexplained after initial assessment should receive specialist cardiovascular assessment. Guidance was provided on the appropriate choices of cardiovascular investigation, according to the presenting clinical circumstances.

### Therapeutic options for neurocardiogenic syncope: a meta-analysis of randomised trials with and without blinding [^114RRBnG]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurocardiogenic syncope is common with a lifetime incidence of > 35% with one-third of these individuals suffering significant psychological and physical injury.

Syncope typically results from a vasodepressor response (hypotension), a cardioinhibitory response (bradycardia) or a combination of both mechanisms. Despite the great variety of proposed therapies, including medications, cardiac pacemaker devices and physical training programmes, it is not clear which therapies are effective beyond placebo.

Syncope could be considered an objective endpoint because loss of consciousness can be thought of as binary, and it might be argued that blinding therefore is unnecessary. Furthermore, blinding and placebo control introduce additional cost and complexity in trial. However, it has been repeatedly found within cardiology that even with endpoints thought to be objective, for example, blood pressure, blinding is essential for reliable results. The merits and need for blinded, placebo-controlled trials have not been tested when evaluating syncope management approaches.

We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of therapies to prevent recurrent syncope. We specifically test whether blinding makes an important difference.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^113DrTaK]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — scope, populations, and goals: The guideline states it provides guidance on the management of adult and pediatric patients with suspected syncope, is not a review of mechanisms, and, due to the plausible association of syncope and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in selected populations, discusses risk stratification and SCD prevention when appropriate. The document explains that the terms "selected populations" and "selected patients" are used to direct clinicians to exercise judgment, and when recommending referral to specialists the writing committee agreed to make Class IIa recommendations because of the paucity of outcome data. Within this guideline, older adults are defined using age > 75 years unless otherwise specified. The goals include to define syncope as a symptom across populations and circumstances, to provide guidance and recommendations on evaluation and management across settings and causes, and to identify knowledge gaps to foster future research. A systematic review on "Pacing as a Treatment for Reflex-Mediated (Vasovagal, Situational, or Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity) Syncope" was published in conjunction with this guideline.

### Laughter-induced syncope [^115skoxN]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

This case report describes a 58-year-old man who is otherwise healthy but has periodic episodes of syncope which only happen when he laughs vigorously. This occurs suddenly with no prodrome, so the patient has no time to react and is unable to brace himself when he falls. The case is one of the very few described in the medical literature, most of which have similar presentations and findings on subsequent investigation. Recognition of the typical presentation, in the absence of more serious causes of syncope, may avoid extensive and expensive evaluation.

### Pediatric syncope: a systematic review [^111iN37K]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

As with any systematic review, there are limitations to this study. For example, many of the studies chosen did not provide information regarding patient follow-up. This could have not only been helpful but could have also potentially led to a difference in the number of cases attributed to unknown origin. In addition, this review chose studies that defined syncope as a "transient loss of consciousness (and postural tone)" or whose definitions were very similar to that. However, it is difficult to get a sense of what each study would have considered "transient", as many of the studies did not give an exact time constraint. Therefore, future studies should aim to provide a more robust follow-up of patients who have experienced syncope, especially when the cause is unknown, to determine whether the patient has repeat episodes, which could help clinicians determine the etiology. In addition, a more precise definition of syncope, giving an expected range of time, would be helpful in ensuring uniformity of future studies.

### Multicenter emergency department validation of the Canadian syncope risk score [^113qeeZ8]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Canadian syncope risk score" for syncope and sick sinus syndrome.

The Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS) is a clinical calculator used in the assessment of adult patients who present with syncope, a temporary loss of consciousness usually related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. The CSRS is designed to predict the short-term risk of serious adverse events, such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or death, within 30 days of a syncope episode. This tool aids clinicians in making decisions about hospital admission, further diagnostic testing, and patient management. The CSRS should not be used in patients with obvious causes of loss of consciousness such as seizure or stroke, or in patients with a known diagnosis that readily explains the syncope.

The Canadian Syncope Risk Score calculator is designed to assess the likelihood of serious adverse events following an episode of syncope, based on information derived from three areas: clinical evaluation, investigations, and diagnosis in the emergency department.

For the clinical evaluation, the factors contributing to the score include:

- A predisposition to vasovagal symptoms, such as those triggered by a warm crowded place, prolonged standing, or emotional responses, adds 1 point.
- A history of heart disease, including coronary or valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, or non-sinus rhythm, also adds 1 point.
- Any systolic blood pressure reading below 90 mmHg or above 180 mmHg contributes 2 points.

Regarding investigations:

- An elevated troponin level, exceeding the 99th percentile of the normal population, adds 2 points.
- An abnormal QRS axis (less than -30 degrees or more than 100 degrees) contributes 1 point.
- A QRS duration greater than 130 milliseconds adds 1 point.
- A corrected QT interval extending beyond 480 milliseconds adds 2 points.

Lastly, for the diagnosis made in the emergency department:

- Both vasovagal syncope and cardiac syncope contribute 2 points each to the total score.

Once these individual scores are tabulated, they are summed to arrive at a total score. Based on this score, the calculator offers a risk interpretation, ranging from low to very high:

| **Score** | **Interpretation** | **Estimated risk of serious adverse events** |
|-|-|-|
| -3 | Very low risk | 0.4% |
| -2 | Very low risk | 0.7% |
| -1 | Low risk | 1.2% |
| 0 | Low risk | 1.9% |
| 1 | Medium risk | 3.1% |
| 2 | Medium risk | 5.1% |
| 3 | Medium risk | 8.1% |
| 4 | High risk | 12.9% |
| 5 | High risk | 19.7% |
| 6 | Very high risk | 28.9% |
| 7 | Very high risk | 40.3% |
| 8 | Very high risk | 52.8% |
| 9 | Very high risk | 65.0% |
| 10 | Very high risk | 75.5% |
| 11 | Very high risk | 83.6% |

This interpretation helps gauge the patient's risk level for serious adverse events post-syncope, guiding clinical decision-making and potential management strategies.

Reflex (neurally mediated) syncope subtypes — vasovagal, carotid sinus, and situational: Reflex (neurally mediated) syncope is syncope due to a reflex that causes vasodilation, bradycardia, or both; vasovagal syncope (VVS) is the most common form, may occur with upright posture (standing or seated) or with exposure to emotional stress, pain, or medical settings, and is often preceded by identifiable triggers and/or by a characteristic prodrome; carotid sinus syndrome is reflex syncope associated with carotid sinus hypersensitivity, which is present when a pause ≥ 3 s and/or a decrease of systolic pressure ≥ 50 mm Hg occurs upon carotid sinus stimulation, and carotid sinus syndrome is defined when syncope occurs with carotid sinus hypersensitivity; situational syncope is reflex syncope associated with a specific action, such as coughing, laughing, swallowing, micturition, or defecation.

### Trauma and syncope: looking beyond the injury [^116T9qr5]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Syncope is a common cause of trauma. There is insufficient published guidance and few validated tools for trauma teams to use in standardizing the investigation and management of syncope in the trauma setting. This review article seeks to provide a clear summary of the current syncope guidance relating to the trauma patient by exploring the harmful causes of syncopal falls that may be overlooked and discussing the optimal evaluation and safe management of these cases.

Falls are currently the leading mechanism of injury to major trauma patients, accounting for 39% of the major trauma in the UK with an estimated annual cost burden of £2.3 billion. Despite 29% to 36% of hospital attendees with syncope suffering concomitant physical injury, syncope is a neglected cause of trauma. Among elderly patients, 42% to 95% have no recollection of their loss of consciousness and can mistakenly attribute their syncope to an accidental or 'mechanical fall'. These incorrectly labeled mechanical falls can be mistakenly characterized as benign. This inappropriately obviates further investigation into potentially serious underlying health conditions. As such, there is growing evidence that all falls and near syncope should be investigated as for syncope.

### Syncope: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113xNEBE]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Syncope is an abrupt and transient loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. It accounts for 1% to 1.5% of emergency department visits, resulting in high hospital admission rates and significant medical costs. Syncope is classified as neurally mediated, cardiac, and orthostatic hypotension. Neurally mediated syncope is the most common type and has a benign course, whereas cardiac syncope is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with presyncope have similar prognoses to those with syncope and should undergo a similar evaluation. A standardized approach to syncope evaluation reduces hospital admissions and medical costs, and increases diagnostic accuracy. The initial assessment for all patients presenting with syncope includes a detailed history, physical examination, and electrocardiography. The initial evaluation may diagnose up to 50% of patients and allows immediate short-term risk stratification. Laboratory testing and neuroimaging have a low diagnostic yield and should be ordered only if clinically indicated. Several comparable clinical decision rules can be used to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for hospital admission. Low-risk patients with a single episode of syncope can often be reassured with no further investigation. High-risk patients with cardiovascular or structural heart disease, history concerning for arrhythmia, abnormal electrocardiographic findings, or severe comorbidities should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. In cases of unexplained syncope, provocative testing and prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring strategies can be diagnostic. The treatment of neurally mediated and orthostatic hypotension syncope is largely supportive, although severe cases may require pharmacotherapy. Cardiac syncope may require cardiac device placement or ablation.

### Geriatric syncope and cardiovascular risk in the emergency department [^111aHbx6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness that is caused by a brief loss in generalized cerebral blood flow.

Objective

This article reviews the background, epidemiology, etiologies, evaluation, and disposition considerations of geriatric patients with syncope, with a focus on cardiovascular risk.

Discussion

Although syncope is one of the most common symptoms in elderly patients presenting to the emergency department, syncope causes in geriatric patients can present differently than in younger populations, and the underlying etiology is often challenging to discern. History, physical examination, and electrocardiography (ECG) have the greatest utility in evaluating syncope. Additional testing should be guided by history and physical examination. There are multiple scoring tools developed to aid in management and these are reviewed in the article. Common predictors that would indicate a need for further work-up include a history of cardiac or valvular disease (i.e., ventricular dysrhythmia, congestive heart failure), abnormal ECG, anemia or severe volume depletion (i.e., from a gastrointestinal bleed), syncope while supine or with effort, report of palpitations or chest pain, persistent abnormal vital signs, or family history of sudden death. With advancing age, cardiovascular morbidity plays a more frequent and important role in the etiology of syncope.

Conclusions

The syncope work-up should be tailored to the patient's presentation. Disposition should be based on the results of the initial evaluation and risk factors for adverse outcomes.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope — historical characteristics linked to etiology: Cardiac causes are more often associated with older age (> 60 y), syncope during exertion, syncope in the supine position, abnormal cardiac examination, and family history of inheritable conditions or premature SCD (< 50 y of age). Noncardiac causes are more often associated with younger age, no known cardiac disease, syncope only in the standing position, positional change from supine or sitting to standing, presence of prodrome (nausea, vomiting, feeling warmth), and situational triggers (cough, laugh, micturition, defecation, deglutition).
