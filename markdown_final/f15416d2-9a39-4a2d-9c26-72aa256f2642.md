## Question

Anisocytosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anisocytosis — specifically, they want to understand its definition and how RDW quantifies it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining anisocytosis and how RDW quantifies it. Then, I should verify normal ranges and analytic variants of RDW. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology that drives anisocytosis. After that, I need to review etiologies across nutritional, hemolytic, marrow failure, and clonal disorders. Then, I should appraise the prognostic implications across diseases. Finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic approach, special contexts, and limitations, and close with a concise synthesis that ties mechanism to clinical utility.

> Let me first confirm the definition and measurement. Anisocytosis refers to heterogeneity in red blood cell size, and RDW (red cell distribution width) is the automated CBC parameter that quantifies this variability, reported either as a coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) or as a standard deviation (RDW-SD), with RDW-SD being less influenced by MCV and potentially more informative in some prognostic contexts [^114ea4z9].

> Wait, let me verify the normal ranges and analytic nuances. Typical RDW-CV reference intervals are about 11.5–14.5%, though instrument-specific cutoffs vary. RDW-SD is instrument-dependent and expressed in femtoliters, and some studies suggest RDW-SD may outperform RDW-CV for prognostication in certain populations, so I should be cautious to interpret values within the laboratory's reference frame and method [^112MnVcV] [^114ea4z9].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology. Anisocytosis arises from three broad mechanisms: ineffective erythropoiesis with premature release of variably sized reticulocytes, increased RBC destruction creating a mix of mature and fragmented cells, and transfusion-related mixing of donor and recipient RBC populations; inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired iron handling can amplify these processes by blunting erythropoietin responsiveness and altering marrow output, so I need to ensure I consider these upstream drivers when interpreting RDW [^114FmyUA] [^116Qaeoq] [^115wV5ca].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiologies before categorizing them. Nutritional deficiencies (iron, B12, folate) commonly elevate RDW, often before MCV changes in iron deficiency; hemolytic processes and hemoglobinopathies create size heterogeneity; bone marrow failure syndromes, including MDS and CDAs, show dysplastic erythropoiesis with anisopoikilocytosis; and clonal hematopoiesis or MPNs can produce anisocytosis via intrinsic erythroid dysfunction, so I should align the RDW pattern with MCV, reticulocyte count, and smear to narrow the differential [^113BLgw2] [^114EUrzm] [^1157iZsd] [^116KhV7j].

> Let me consider the prognostic implications next, and I should double-check consistency across diseases. Elevated RDW independently predicts mortality in heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, COPD, community-acquired pneumonia, and COVID-19; in oncology and hematology, higher RDW correlates with worse outcomes in AML and MDS; in pediatrics, RDW predicts coronary artery lesions in Kawasaki disease; and in general populations, RDW tracks with cardiovascular disease and mortality even outside anemia, suggesting it integrates inflammation, oxidative stress, nutrition, and marrow stress signals [^114FmyUA] [^116KhV7j] [^114XRyub] [^114usJdE] [^11323gjQ] [^111Trxto] [^112a7PzD] [^114ea4z9] [^111DJaRc].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought RDW > 14.5% universally defined "high", but I should correct that. While a meta-analysis of COVID-19 cohorts used > 14.5% as a threshold associated with higher mortality, this cut point is context-specific and should not be overgeneralized to all populations or analyzers, so I need to interpret RDW relative to the lab's reference interval and the clinical scenario [^111Trxto].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach. Let me first confirm that I start with CBC indices, reticulocyte count, and a careful peripheral smear to characterize anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. Then I should layer iron studies, B12/folate, hemolysis labs, and, when indicated, hemoglobin electrophoresis, renal and liver function, and inflammatory markers. If cytopenias or dysplasia are present, I need to check for MDS with marrow evaluation. In microcytic differentials, RDW helps distinguish iron deficiency (high RDW) from thalassemia trait (often normal RDW), though I should verify with iron indices and, when needed, molecular testing [^113HMPXu] [^115gs2r8] [^117WuFCr] [^114EUrzm] [^117NHQFZ] [^112mTQNj].

> But wait, what if the anemia is macrocytic or the smear shows teardrops and nucleated RBCs? I should confirm that macrocytosis with elevated RDW pushes me to consider B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, hypothyroidism, or MDS; teardrops and a leukoerythroblastic picture raise concern for marrow infiltration or fibrosis, prompting marrow examination; and if I see a reticulocytosis out of proportion to hemolysis, I need to consider pseudoreticulocytosis from MDS with delayed reticulocyte maturation, which can confound the reticulocyte index [^111bDP7o] [^111v29Sg] [^1159zCyT].

> I should also consider special contexts. In older adults, RDW rises with age and may mediate adverse outcomes via inflammation and oxidative stress. Metabolomic studies implicate SDMA, ADMA, and 1-methylhistidine as potential mediators linking aging to anisocytosis, though causality remains under investigation. In pediatrics, RDW can aid early detection of iron deficiency and has prognostic roles in diseases like Kawasaki disease. And in critical illness, RDW at presentation and discharge predicts post-discharge mortality, likely reflecting persistent inflammation and marrow stress [^1128mHEp] [^113BLgw2] [^114ea4z9] [^115wV5ca].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and confounders. RDW is a nonspecific marker influenced by transfusion, recent blood loss, nutritional status, renal and hepatic function, and inflammation. It should not be used in isolation for diagnosis or prognosis, and serial trends within the same laboratory context are more informative than single values. Emerging tools like computer vision quantitation of RBC morphology may complement RDW by providing granular morphologic profiling, but they are not yet standard of care [^115wV5ca] [^1133a1Y4].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. Anisocytosis, as captured by RDW, is a window into erythropoietic stress, integrating ineffective production, hemolysis, transfusion effects, and systemic drivers such as inflammation and nutrition. Its prognostic value across cardiovascular, infectious, inflammatory, and malignant conditions stems from these intertwined pathways, making RDW a high-yield, low-cost biomarker that should be interpreted alongside MCV, reticulocytes, iron studies, and smear morphology to refine diagnosis and risk stratification [^114FmyUA] [^113HMPXu].

Anisocytosis is the presence of **red blood cells of unequal size**, quantified by RDW on the CBC [^117NHQFZ]. It is not a diagnosis but a marker of underlying disease, most commonly iron deficiency, B12/folate deficiency, hemolysis, or myelodysplastic syndromes [^111jjGLk] [^114EUrzm]. Elevated RDW is a **strong, independent predictor of adverse outcomes** in cardiovascular disease, heart failure, sepsis, and COVID-19 [^114FmyUA] [^111Trxto] [^112vRJzQ]. Evaluation should include CBC, reticulocyte count, iron studies, B12/folate, hemolysis labs, and a peripheral smear [^113HMPXu]; management targets the underlying cause, with transfusion reserved for severe anemia.

---

## Definition and measurement

Anisocytosis is defined as **variation in RBC size** [^111jjGLk]; RDW-CV (normal 11.5–14.5%) [^112MnVcV] and RDW-SD (normal 39–46 fL) quantify this heterogeneity. RDW-SD is less affected by MCV and may better reflect true size dispersion [^111jjGLk] [^1136YHHB].

## Causes of anisocytosis

Anisocytosis reflects **diverse pathologies**:

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Nutritional deficiencies | Iron, vitamin B12, folate | Impaired erythropoiesis [^111sFJG3] [^114FmyUA] |
| Hemolytic anemia | Sickle cell, hereditary spherocytosis, autoimmune hemolysis | RBC destruction and reticulocytosis [^114EUrzm] |
| Myelodysplastic syndromes | MDS, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia | Ineffective erythropoiesis and dysplasia [^114EUrzm] [^1157iZsd] |
| Chronic diseases | CKD, liver disease, inflammation | Anemia of chronic disease and oxidative stress [^116Qaeoq] [^114FmyUA] |
| Transfusion | Recent RBC transfusion | Mixture of donor and recipient RBCs [^115wV5ca] |

---

## Clinical significance and prognostic implications

Elevated RDW is a robust, independent predictor of **mortality and complications** across multiple conditions:

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Higher RDW predicts mortality in heart failure, coronary artery disease, and peripheral artery disease [^111QnBi9] [^114XRyub] [^116h4wa4].
- **Sepsis and critical illness**: Elevated RDW correlates with severity and mortality in sepsis and critical care settings [^112MnVcV] [^11323gjQ].
- **COVID-19**: Higher RDW associates with mortality and severe disease [^111Trxto].
- **General population**: RDW predicts all-cause mortality and chronic disease risk [^112vRJzQ] [^111DJaRc].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach is essential: obtain a **CBC with RDW**, reticulocyte count, iron studies, vitamin B12/folate, and hemolysis labs (LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin, DAT) [^115gs2r8] [^114kG2YY]; review a peripheral smear for morphology and dysplasia [^114EUrzm]; and add hemoglobin electrophoresis, bone marrow biopsy, or genetic testing if indicated [^114kG2YY].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Iron, B12, or folate replacement [^114pjQww].
- **Hemolytic anemia**: Treat cause, consider immunosuppression or splenectomy [^notfound].
- **Myelodysplastic syndromes**: Supportive care, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, hypomethylating agents, or transplant [^notfound].
- **Transfusion**: For severe symptomatic anemia or acute blood loss [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

RDW is **nonspecific** and influenced by age, sex, smoking, and comorbidities; interpret in clinical context and with other indices [^1128mHEp]. Standardization of RDW measurement and reporting varies, which may affect comparability [^111jjGLk].

---

Anisocytosis reflects **RBC size heterogeneity** and signals underlying disease; elevated RDW is a powerful, independent prognostic marker across cardiovascular, infectious, and chronic diseases. A focused diagnostic workup and cause-directed therapy are key to management.

### Role of red blood cell distribution width, as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Trxto]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW), an indicator of anisocytosis has emerged as a potential tool for risk stratification of critically ill patients with sepsis. Prognostic predictors are of paramount interest for prompt intervention and optimal utilization of the healthcare system in this ongoing context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the utility of RDW in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive screening of electronic databases was performed up to 30th April 2021 after enrolling in PROSPERO (CRD42020206685). Observational studies or interventional studies, evaluating the impact of RDW in COVID-19 outcomes (mortality and severity) are included in this meta-analysis. Our search retrieved 25 studies, with a total of 18,392 and 3,446 COVID-19 patients for mortality and disease severity outcomes. Deceased and critically ill patients had higher RDW levels on admission in comparison to survivors and non-severe patients (SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.31–0.71; I² = 88% and SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.26–0.67; I² = 60%, respectively). In a sub-group analysis of 2,980 patients, RDW > 14.5 has been associated with increased risk of mortality (OR = 2.73; 95%CI 1.96–3.82; I² = 56%). However, the evidences is of low quality. A higher level of RDW on admission in COVID-19 patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, further studies regarding the cut-off value of RDW are the need of the hour.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116Qaeoq]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Oxidative stress and inflammation suppress erythropoiesis and shorten RBC survival, resulting in heterogeneity in the size of circulating erythrocytes (also called anisocytosis). Human erythrocyte damage starts during the initial stages of oxidative stress. A low level of serum selenium, an essential trace element involved in the antioxidant system, was an independent predictor of higher RDW in community-dwelling adults. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine, was positively correlated with RDW in adult patients with heart failure and congenital heart disease. IL-6 stimulates hepatic hepcidin expression, which inhibits duodenal iron absorption and induces ferritin transcription, thus increasing iron storage within macrophages. Inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, and interleukin-10 might compromise iron metabolism, impair erythroid progenitor cell proliferation, and blunt erythropoietin response to anemia. We supposed that elevated RDW could reflect oxidative and inflammatory stress, which is correlated with the risk of CV events and mortality. In a small randomized trial of patients undergoing hemodialysis, the use of a vitamin E-bonded cellulose membrane dialyzer, which was supposed to provide an antioxidant effect, reduced RDW levels and improved atherosclerosis. This hypothesis must be investigated further in the future.

Recent studies have demonstrated that elevated RDW was associated with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, autonomic regulation, malnutrition, and endothelial dysfunction. Erythropoiesis has been proven to be associated with chronic activation of the RAAS and could be influenced by catecholamine. Vashistha et al. reported that for every 1 g/dL increase in the albumin level, RDW decreased by 0.7%. Solak et al. revealed that a higher RDW level was independently associated with impaired endothelial function and increased carotid intima media thickness in patients with CKD. In addition, RDW was associated with an abnormal pattern of circadian BP variation. RDW was higher in patients designated as nondippers compared with those designated as dippers. These characters are well-described risk factors for CV events and might be possible pathways underlying the association between RDW and CV outcomes. Additional studies are warranted to verify these potential mechanisms.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^111jjkFJ]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The red cell distribution width (RDW) reflecting MCV heterogeneity (quantitative index of anisocytosis, i.e. the percentage coefficient of MCV variation) can be considered another parameter of ID. Increased RDW is, however, typical not only for anaemia due to ID, but also anaemia resulting from deficiencies in vitamin B 12 and folic acid, of chronic diseases and sideroblastic anaemia. In HF patients, there are associations between high RDW, and reduced haemoglobin, low MCV, reduced Tsat, increased mortality and hospitalization rates. –

Owing to pathophysiological links and overlaps in regulatory mechanisms of erythropoietin and iron metabolism, – subjects with ID frequently have increased circulating erythropoietin levels, which can be considered another index of iron-restricted erythropoiesis in HF patients, being related to poor outcomes.

Increased soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is another sensitive indicator of ID. Soluble transferrin receptor is the truncated form of transmembrane protein, a receptor for iron–transferrin complex and the major system responsible for the intracellular iron import. It is present on virtually all cells, but a vast majority is localized on erythroid precursors. When iron delivery to target tissues is insufficient for metabolic requirements, the expression of the transferrin receptor increases in order to facilitate intracellular iron influx. Consequently, circulating sTfR (originating from all cells metabolizing iron) quantitatively reflects both the tissue iron demand (tissue iron balance) and the erythroid proliferation rate (total erythroblast mass), but not body iron stores. No study has used this biomarker to indicate and/or guide therapy, and so it should be regarded as a research tool.

Because serum ferritin is a surrogate of iron stores and serum sTfR reflects the tissue iron demand, there is evidence that the combination of these two parameters may describe the iron status more accurately.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^115QWr96]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytic anemia is also a characteristic finding in inherited and acquired bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) affecting one or more lineages, such as Diamond‐Blackfan anemia, Schwachman‐Diamond syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDA), which are caused by pathogenic variants in a variety of genes directly or indirectly affecting cell division and leading to ineffective erythropoiesis, typically present as macrocytic anemia with suboptimal reticulocytosis. It is likely that the macrocytosis in BMFS as well as in CDAs is caused by a decreased average number of cell divisions during terminal erythropoiesis, producing fewer but larger erythrocytes.

PIII‐A had a normal absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) at 52 × 10⁹/L, suboptimal for her level of anemia. Peripheral blood smear revealed mild to moderate anisopoikilocytosis, normochromic macrocytes with occasional hypochromic red cells and notable ovalocytes (Figure S1), with no increase in polychromasia, suggesting inadequate RBC production rather than a purely hemolytic anemia (Figure 1). Vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine levels in serum, RBC folate level, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, copper, and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were normal. OGE was also normal (Figure S1), ruling out HX and OHSt. Similar CBC findings were noted 2 months later, so a bone marrow evaluation was performed. This showed normal marrow cellularity for age, erythroid hyperplasia with a myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratio 2:1 (rather than the normal 3:1 ratio) with a mild left shift, that is, increased early erythroid precursors, and signs of dyserythropoiesis including binucleated erythroblasts, occasional cytoplasmic bridges, and karyorrhexis (Figure 1). Ring sideroblasts were not noted. Cytogenetic testing and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry did not show evidence of malignancy or MDS. Based on these findings along with the relatively high ferritin, suboptimal reticulocytosis, and family history of macrocytic anemia with iron overload, a possible diagnosis of CDA was considered, leading to next‐generation sequencing (NGS) on a panel of genes associated with HHA/CDA (Table S1), which demonstrated a novel heterozygous variant of unknown significance (VUS) in exon 8 of ALAS2 (c.1066G > A, p. Val356Met) (Figure 2).

### NT-pro BNP in AECOPD-PH: old biomarker, new insights-based on a large retrospective case-controlled study [^111J6tnc]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

For many years, RDW was almost exclusively used for the differential diagnosis of anemia. Recently it was increasingly investigated as a negative prognostic factor in variety of acute and chronic medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, community-acquired pneumonia. Several studies showed that increased RDW is associated with disease severity and long-term mortality in COPD patients. Ozgul et al. showed increased RDW values in COPD patients compared to controls as well as in smokers compared to nonsmokers. In our study, unadjusted data and PSM models (calipers value = 0.05) all showed RDW indeed had a significant difference in AECOPD-PH group (P < 0.05). However, in logistic regression analysis, elevated RDW had no statistic difference compared with low/moderately elevated RDW value (P > 0.05). The results supported elevated RDW might not be associated with AECOPD-PH. It is rather unquestionable that biological and metabolic abnormalities associated with human disorders may also exert a considerable influence on RDW. Such as, short or critically short telomeres (i.e. the DNA–protein structures located at the ends of chromosomes) lead to cell senescence of hematopoietic progenitors, especially those of the erythroid lineage, thus leading to increased replicative stress and impaired maturation of the erythroid lineage; Oxidative stress has a profound influence on erythrocyte homeostasis and survival. Oxidative stress may be another underlying biological mechanism that may lead to increased RDW possibly through increased red cell turnover, thus contributing to the association between anisocytosis and human pathology; And inflammation is commonplace in most human disorders and since several proinflammatory cytokines inhibit synthesis or activity of erythropoietin, inflammation might, in fact, promote anisocytosis through impairment of iron metabolism and disruption of response erythropoietin, thus impairing erythrocyte maturation and causing immature erythrocytes to enter the blood flow. Inflammation can also lower erythrocyte survival, thus leading to a more mixed population of RBC volumes in the circulation. Those might be the underlying pathogenesis between RDW and COPD.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^111ecQpE]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as: (i) defects of intestinal iron absorption (ii) disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle that impair erythroblast iron uptake (iii) defects of mitochondrial iron utilization for haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis and (iv) defects of iron recycling. A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow distinction of the different types, a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

### Monocyte anisocytosis changes in patients after major burn injuries [^1117xFLq]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The recovery of patients after severe burns is a long and complex process. Genomic analysis of white blood cells from burn and trauma patients revealed excessive and prolonged innate immune activation in patients with complicated outcomes. However, translating this knowledge into practical biomarkers has not been possible yet. Although several biomarkers for monitoring burn patients have been proposed, their ability to accurately distinguish between inflammation stemming from initial tissue destruction, infections, and organ failure complications is limited. Here, we focused on monocytes, critical innate immune cells in the response to burn injured tissues. We measured the monocyte anisocytosis (quantified as monocyte distribution width (MDW), a recently emerged marker of sepsis) throughout the recovery of patients from the time of burn injury until the end of the hospital stay. We observed that MDW increases in patients during the first week after major burns. Among the patients with major burns who survive, MDW starts decreasing in the second week and normalizes by the end of the hospital stay. The duration of hospital stay appears to be proportional to how fast MDW decreases during the second week after the injury. We also found that MDW decreases significantly in most patients after excision and debridement surgeries but not after allo- and auto-graft surgeries. Moreover, high MDW values correlated with a higher rate of positive microbiology blood culture samples and respiratory infections. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring MDW as a potential biomarker for the risk of complications during burn patient recovery.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Metabolomic markers mediate erythrocyte anisocytosis in older adults: results from three independent aging cohorts [^1128mHEp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Anisocytosis reflects unequal-sized red blood cells and is quantified using red blood cell distribution width (RDW). RDW increases with age and has been consistently associated with adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease and mortality. Why RDW increases with age is not understood. We aimed to identify plasma metabolomic markers mediating anisocytosis with aging.

Methods

We performed mediation analyses of plasma metabolomics on the association between age and RDW using resampling techniques after covariate adjustment. We analyzed data from adults aged 70 or older from the main discovery cohort of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA, n = 477, 46% women) and validation cohorts of the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study (Health ABC, n = 620, 52% women) and Invecchiare in Chianti, Aging in the Chianti Area (InCHIANTI) study (n = 735, 57% women). Plasma metabolomics was assayed using the Biocrates MxP Quant 500 kit in BLSA and Health ABC and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry in InCHIANTI.

Results

In all three cohorts, symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) significantly mediated the association between age and RDW. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and 1-methylhistidine were also significant mediators in the discovery cohort and one validation cohort. In the discovery cohort, we also found choline, homoarginine, and several long-chain triglycerides significantly mediated the association between age and RDW.

Conclusions and Relevance

This metabolomics study of three independent aging cohorts identified a specific set of metabolites mediating anisocytosis with aging. Whether SDMA, ADMA, and 1-methylhistidine are released by the damaged erythrocytes with high RDW or they affect the physiology of erythrocytes causing high RDW should be further investigated.

### Cardiovascular disease in myeloproliferative neoplasms: state-of-the-art review [^113aUszp]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

A recent study in mice bearing the Jak2 V617F mutation in bone marrow megakaryocytes and platelets showed that the mutated platelets had a significantly reduced number of dense granules, which could explain an observed diminished second wave of activation. Compared with matched controls, the mutated mice formed small thrombi upon vascular injury (potentially occlusive of small veins) and prolonged bleeding time, observations that may help understand the mechanisms of the hemorrhagic events associated with MPN. In accordance, studies involving human MPN cohorts identified dense granule storage defects. In one study of 9 patients with myeloproliferative disorders of myelofibrosis, platelets were found to have significant storage pool depletion (measured by adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate ratio and 14 C-serotonin platelet disappearance patterns). Another study reported a defect in mepacrine uptake in platelet-dense granules in 71% of the subjects with polycythemia vera and in 48% of those with essential thrombocythemia, suggesting deficiency in platelet-dense granules.

In addition to leukocytes and platelets, alterations in erythrocyte form and function may also contribute to increased atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Patients with CHIP, and particularly those with JAK2 mutations, have increased erythrocyte anisocytosis. Studies involving small cohorts revealed an association between increased erythrocyte anisocytosis and thrombosis in patients with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera and increased death in primary myelofibrosis. In patients without CHIP or MPNs, anisocytosis was also associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Additionally, erythrocytosis by itself may increase cardiovascular disease risk, independent of erythrocyte function. In patients with polycythemia vera, hematocrits of > 45% was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events and death. Tradition ascribed this risk to hyperviscosity, but erythrocytosis may serve as a biomarker of the complex of biological abnormalities associated with MPN. One study demonstrated that erythrocyte-derived microvesicles can facilitate arterial vasospasm by disturbing the endothelial nitric oxide pathway in a Jak2 -mutated mouse model. Erythrocytosis also heightens risk in cardiovascular disease in patients without MPNs. Additionally, either anemia or erythrocytosis can worsen outcomes after acute ischemic strokes.

### Usefulness of red cell width distribution (RDW) in the assessment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^114sG8qq]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

RDW is one of the parameters in complete blood count (CBC) that measures variation in red blood cell size or volume (anisocytosis). The most common cause of an elevated RDW is anemia [evaluated in association with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in differential diagnosis]. Regardless of that higher than normal RDW has also been described as a risk factor for unfavourable clinical course in various diseases in children. RDW is known to be a prognostic marker in adult with pulmonary hypertension. The value of this test in the PAH pediatric population was not yet established. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of RDW in children with PAH and utility of this parameter in management.

### A novel clinical prediction model of severity based on red cell distribution width, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and intra-abdominal pressure in acute pancreatitis in pregnancy [^116g3PYh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is still difficult to early diagnose of SAP in the clinical treatment with AP patients. For APIP, early prediction of its severity is more difficult due to the complexity and specificity of pregnancy. At present, the measurement of hematuria amylase and enhanced CT scan are main techniques for AP diagnosis, but as every pancreatologist knows that the level of hematuria amylase is not in direct proportion to the severity of the disease. In addition, CT examination, especially enhanced CT scan, should be prudently selected for pregnant women, and uterine enlargement during pregnancy can lead to some changes in the anatomical position of abdominal organs, moreover, there are few specific predictive models for APIP, so it is relatively difficult to evaluate the severity of APIP. What's more, APIP is a dangerous disease because of its rapid progression, once it escalates into SAP, it will be very harmful to both mother and fetus. In a word, it is very useful to construct a new multi-factor clinical model to predict the severity of APIP, which will be helpful to deal with risk stratification and management of APIP.

RDW is a commonly used bio-marker to detect the severity of erythrocyte anisocytosis. The higher RDW indicates much more anisocytosis. In addition, there are also many other studies showing that the abnormal elevation of RDW can predict the poor prognosis of patients with septic shock, acute myocardial infarction, and general trauma patients. The predictive role of RDW in AP has received continuous attention. RDW has several advantages as a predictive marker. Firstly, RDW is a part of the blood routine test which is fairly inexpensive and is a routine test. Additionally, it can be accessed easily and its results can be obtained quickly. Some studies have proved that RDW is an independent risk factor related to the severity of AP. However, the predictive role of severity by RDW in APIP remains unclear. In our study, the higher level of RDW in SAPIP patients indicated that RDW maybe a potential predictor of SAPIP. After univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found RDW is an independent predictive factor of severity in APIP.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^11323gjQ]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Elevated RDW on admission is a recently described risk factor for adverse outcome in cardiac problems.

- This study demonstrates that elevated RDW in young patients hospitalized with CAP is a significant risk factor for complicated hospitalization and in-hospital mortality.

- Conceivably, measuring RDW in the emergency department might offer the clinician a simple yet powerful tool in the process of decision making whether to admit patients with CAP.

### The hematological effects of nitrous oxide anesthesia in pediatric patients [^111KmGDf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonged administration of nitrous oxide causes an increase in plasma homocysteine in children via vitamin B12 inactivation. However, it is unclear whether nitrous oxide doses used in clinical practice cause adverse hematological effects in pediatric patients.

Methods

This retrospective study included 54 pediatric patients undergoing elective spinal surgery: 41 received nitrous oxide throughout anesthesia (maintenance group), 9 received nitrous oxide for induction and/or emergence (induction/emergence group), and 4 did not receive nitrous oxide (nitrous oxide-free group). Complete blood counts obtained before and up to 4 days after surgery were assessed for anemia, macrocytosis/microcytosis, anisocytosis, hyperchromatosis/hypochromatosis, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The change (Δ) from preoperative to the highest postoperative value was calculated for mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and red cell distribution width (RDW).

Results

No pancytopenia was present in any patient after surgery. All patients had postoperative anemia, and none had macrocytosis. Postoperative MCV (mean [99% confidence interval]) peaked at 86 fL (85–88 fL), 85 fL (81–89 fL), and 88 fL (80–96 fL) and postoperative RDW at 13.2% (12.8–13.5%), 13.3% (12.7–13.8%), and 13.0% (11.4–14.6%) for the maintenance group, the induction/emergence group, and the nitrous oxide-free group. Two patients in the maintenance group (5%) developed anisocytosis (RDW > 14.6%), but none in the induction/emergence group or in the nitrous oxide-free group (P = 0.43). Both ΔMCV (P = 0.52) and ΔRDW (P = 0.16) were similar across all groups.

Conclusions

Nitrous oxide exposure for up to 8 hours is not associated with megaloblastic anemia in pediatric patients undergoing major spinal surgery.

### Consistent up-regulation of stat3 independently of JAK2 mutations in a new murine model of essential thrombocythemia [^115Vo6DK]. Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) mutations are common in myeloproliferative disorders; however, although they are detected in virtually all polycythemia vera patients, they are found in approximately 50% of essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients, suggesting that converging pathways/abnormalities underlie the onset of ET. Recently, the chromosomal translocation 3;21, leading to the fusion gene AML1/MDS1/EVI1 (AME), was observed in an ET patient. After we forced the expression of AME in the bone marrow (BM) of C57BL/6J mice, all the reconstituted mice died of a disease with symptoms similar to ET with a latency of 8 to 16 months. Peripheral blood smears consistently showed an elevated number of dysplastic platelets with anisocytosis, degranulation, and giant size. Although the AME-positive mice did not harbor Jak2 mutations, the BM of most of them had significantly higher levels of activated Stat3 than the controls. With combined biochemical and biological assays we found that AME binds to the Stat3 promoter leading to its up-regulation. Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) analysis of a small group of ET patients shows that in about half of the patients, there is STAT3 hyperactivation independently of JAK2 mutations, suggesting that the hyperactivation of STAT3 by JAK2 mutations or promoter activation may be a critical step in development of ET.

Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical abdominal emergency. Immidiate diagnosis of this disease is crucial, because this condition can lead to appendiceal perforation, potential peritonitis, and even death. We read with great interest the article 'The role of red cell distribution width (RDW) in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study' by Narci et al. and wanted to discuss whether RDW alone provide certain information about the inflammatory status of the patient with acute appendicitis.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^113UYAze]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### Rac GTPases regulate the morphology and deformability of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton [^113Waefh]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Actin oligomers are a significant structural component of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton. Rac1 and Rac2 GTPases regulate actin structures and have multiple overlapping as well as distinct roles in hematopoietic cells; therefore, we studied their role in red blood cells (RBCs). Conditional gene targeting with a loxP-flanked Rac1 gene allowed Crerecombinase-induced deletion of Rac1 on a Rac2 null genetic background. The Rac1(-/-); Rac2(-/-) mice developed microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin drop of about 20% and significant anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. Reticulocytes increased more than 2-fold. Rac1(-/-); Rac2(-/-) RBCs stained with rhodamine-phalloidin demonstrated F-actin meshwork gaps and aggregates under confocal microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy of the cytoskeleton demonstrated junctional aggregates and pronounced irregularity of the hexagonal spectrin scaffold. Ektacytometry confirmed that these cytoskeletal changes in Rac1(-/-); Rac2(-/-) erythrocytes were associated with significantly decreased cellular deformability. The composition of the cytoskeletal proteins was altered with an increased actin-to-spectrin ratio and increased phosphorylation (Ser724) of adducin, an F-actin capping protein. Actin and phosphorylated adducin of Rac1(-/-); Rac2(-/-) erythrocytes were more easily extractable by Triton X-100, indicating weaker association to the cytoskeleton. Thus, deficiency of Rac1 and Rac2 GTPases in mice alters actin assembly in RBCs and causes microcytic anemia with reticulocytosis, implicating Rac GTPases as dynamic regulators of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton organization.

Cells have variably indistinct cell borders, scant amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei vesicular or with finely stippled chromatin; there is also marked anisocytosis and anisokaryosis, and mitotic figures (white arrowhead), on average 1–2 per one 40 × high-power field (HPF). In contrast, TETg7_MO xenotransplants are composed of polygonal cells arranged in haphazard islands separated by variably thick bands of fibrous connective tissue, and with a prominent basal lamina (black arrowhead). Cells show only moderate anisocytosis and anisokaryosis, with smaller nuclei, more abundant and clear cytoplasm, and mitotic figures are less frequent, averaging 1–2 per five 40 × HPF

### Preoperative anemia in cardiac operation: does hemoglobin tell the whole story? [^113W2jPV]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative anemia, defined by hemoglobin level, is associated with elevated risk after cardiac operation. Better understanding of anemia requires characterization beyond this. This investigation focuses on red cell size and its association with patient characteristics and outcomes after cardiac operation.

Methods

From January 2010 to January 2014, 10,589 patients underwent elective cardiac operations at Cleveland Clinic. Anemia was characterized as normocytic, microcytic, or macrocytic based on mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Models for hospital complications were developed using multivariable logistic regression. Other outcomes were postoperative transfusion and intensive care unit (ICU) and postoperative hospital lengths of stay.

Results

A total of 2,715 patients (26%) were anemic. Of these, 2,365 (87%) had normocytic, 219 (8.1%) microcytic, and 131 (4.8%) macrocytic anemia. Non-anemic patients (n = 2,041, 26%) received transfusions compared with 1,553 (66%) normocytic, 148 (68%) microcytic, and 97 (74%) macrocytic anemia patients. Patients with normocytic or macrocytic anemia had more renal failure (normocytic: odds ratio (OR) 1.9, macrocytic: OR 3.5), other complications (normocytic: OR 1.3, macrocytic: OR 2.2) and death (normocytic: OR 2.0, macrocytic: OR 6.2) than non-anemic patients; patients with microcytic anemia had fewer reoperations (OR 0.35) and less postoperative atrial fibrillation (OR 0.50). Anemic patients experienced longer ICU (27 versus 48 hours, p < 0.001) and postoperative hospital (6.1 versus 7.4 days, p < 0.001) length of stay than non-anemic patients.

Conclusions

Cardiac surgical patients are often anemic. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes are dissimilar according to red cell size. Patients with microcytic anemia had the lowest hemoglobin levels, yet the best clinical outcomes among anemic patients. MCV from the standard complete blood count adds additional information beyond hemoglobin for targeted intervention.

### Lessons learned from mistakes and deferrals in the frozen section diagnosis of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and well-differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma: an evidence-based pathology approach [^114UFsTi]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The frozen section diagnosis of lung nodules is difficult because inflammatory atypia and histologic artifacts can simulate a malignancy. From a total of 2,405 frozen sections examined, 143 cases were misdiagnosed or deferred, including 65 with reactive atypia (RA) and 35 bronchioloalveolar carcinomas or well-differentiated adenocarcinomas (BAC-AC), resulting in deferral and error rates of 4.36% and 1.58%, respectively. The presence of 25 pathologic features was evaluated by using an evidence-based pathology (EBP) approach. Of the pathologic features, 11 were significant at a P value of less than .05 but exhibited variable incidence in AC and RA. Positive likelihood ratios allowed for identification of the 5 most useful pathologic features for the diagnosis of AC: multiple growth patterns, anisocytosis, atypia more than 75%, macronucleoli, and atypical mitoses. Granulomas favored the diagnosis of RA. An EBP approach is helpful to stratify pathologic features according to their clinical applicability.

### Novel CAD gene mutations in a boy with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 50 with dramatic response to uridine therapy: a case report and a review of the literature [^112Xu2oQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on this case and literature review, the epileptic phenotypes associated with CAD mutations occur before the age of 2 years in most cases. The predominant presentation picture is focal seizures. One of the reviewed cases from the literature had a history of temporal lobectomy. Preoperative evaluation should take carefully in order to avoid surgical treatment on the patients with treatable metabolic diseases. Drug-resistant epilepsy was prevalent in patients with CAD mutation-related epilepsy, with nearly half of the patients suffering from persistent SE and four having heat-induced or exacerbated seizures. Moreover, heat-sensitive epilepsy may also be an early warning sign of this disease. As reported in the results section, anisocytosis was present in only one-third of the anaemia cases. Anisocytosis with or without anaemia in patients with refractory epilepsy may also be an essential clue to suspect CAD defects. The pathophysiology behind the hematopoietic dysfunction seen in such patients may be explained by the lack of pyrimidine-dependent nucleotide-lipid cofactors required for erythrocyte membrane synthesis. Mild anaemia can be corrected by nutrition supplementation, while anisocytosis can only be corrected by oral uridine treatment.

The CAD gene is located on chromosome 2p23.3 and contains 44 exons, encoding a highly conserved multifunctional enzyme complex containing 2,225 amino acids. The CAD enzyme complex is essential in the de novo synthesis pathway of pyrimidines where it plays a role as a key enzyme in the first three steps of the pathway that results in uridine-5-monophosphate (UMP) synthesis. UMP is the substrate for all cellular pyrimidines and is therefore essential for RNA and DNA synthesis. Therefore, CAD mutations are expected to lead to impaired pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis. This is reflected in a wide range of molecular/cellular dysfunctions in organismal nucleic acids, protein glycosylation, lipid metabolism, polysaccharide biosynthesis, and signal transduction and proliferation. Pyrimidine metabolism disorders may also interfere with the neuronal differentiation process, which can impair axon and dendrite formation and lead to neuronal migration disorders. In this case, mutations were predicted to result in altered tertiary protein configuration or deteriorated protein function. CAD expression is the highest in the cerebrum, cerebellum, kidney, and peripheral nervous system. In literature review, the patients were mainly involved in the central system. The involvement of other systems except the blood system was relatively rare, and peripheral nerve involvement was not reported.

### A retrospective cohort study on red blood cell morphology changes in pre-school age children under nitrous oxide anesthesia [^113DwJn4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Megaloblastic anemia or bone marrow changes could occur after prolonged nitrous oxide inhalation via vitamin B 12 inactivation related DNA synthesis impairment. Previous researches have studied hematological changes with nitrous oxide exposure, but only in adults or adolescents. Pre-school age children with active hematopoietic red bone marrow are more vulnerable to potential side effects of nitrous oxide and might experience growth impairment. The purpose of our study was to analyze red blood cell morphology changes under nitrous oxide anesthesia in pre-school age children.

Methods

One hundred thirty-six children under 5years old scheduled for hemivertebra resection were analyzed. According to fresh gas type in anesthesia records, 71 children who received nitrous oxide in oxygen during anesthesia maintenance were categorized into the nitrous oxide group and the other 65 who received air in oxygen were the air group. Complete blood counts in perioperative period were assessed for anemia, macrocytosis, microcytosis, anisocytosis, hyperchromatosis and hypochromatosis. The peak value and change percentage were calculated for mean corpuscular volume and red cell distribution width.

Results

Forty-two children in the air group (64.6%) and 30 in the nitrous oxide group (42.3%) developed anemia (P = 0.009). None developed macrocytosis in both groups. Postoperative mean corpuscular volume peaked (mean [95% confidence interval]) at 83.7(82.9–84.4) fL, and 83.2(82.4–83.9) fL and postoperative red cell distribution width at 13.8% (13.4–14.2%), and 13.9% (13.6–14.2%) for the air group and the nitrous oxide group. Both the relative change of mean corpuscular volume (P = 0.810) and red cell distribution width (P = 0.456) were similar between the two groups.

Conclusions

No megaloblastic red blood cell changes were observed with nitrous oxide exposure for 4h in pre-school age children undergoing hemivertebra resection.

### Usefulness and reproducibility of cytomorphologic evaluations to differentiate myeloma from monoclonal gammopathies of unknown significance [^111sHEZK]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We attempted to differentiate monoclonal gammopathies of unknown significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM) on morphologic grounds and to determine interobserver reproducibility of the differentiation. Cytologists blindly evaluated bone marrow smears from 154 patients with bone marrow plasmacytosis for the proportion of plasma cells with predefined cellular atypias. The single morphologic characteristic that most strongly differentiated MM from MGUS was the presence of nucleoli. The percentage of plasma cells, cytoplasmic contour irregularities, and anisocytosis also predicted a diagnosis of myeloma in multivariate analysis. Six cytologists independently evaluated 68 consecutive cases to determine sensitivity and specificity of these cytomorphologic features. The interobserver coefficient of variation for the plasma cell count was 33%. On consideration of the diagnosis, 36 of 41 MGUS cases and all 24 cases of myeloma were classified correctly. The use of a predesigned score system did not present such a bias, although it did not improve overall efficiency. The plasma cell count is the most predictive characteristic of myeloma from a cytologic viewpoint, but the interobserver variability is high. Interobserver variability is also high in the assessment of morphologic atypia, and atypical traits are not uncommon in plasma cells in MGUS.

### Red blood cell distribution width as a predictive marker for coronary artery lesions in patients with Kawasaki disease [^114waes6]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

RDW values are typically elevated under conditions of ineffective RBC production, increased RBC destruction, and blood transfusion. Nevertheless, the pathophysiological path of increased RDW in patients with KD with CALs remains unknown. Although the precise mechanism by which elevated RDW is associated with CALs in patients with KD is beyond the scope of this study, several explanations are possible. One of the possible mechanisms is inflammation, which plays an important role in the process of KD. In the acute phase of KD, the levels of various inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, and IL-6, are relatively high and contribute to CAL formation. Demir et al. found that patients with KD and CALs have more severe inflammation compared with patients without CALs; thus, markers such as neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein, differed significantly in this population. Inflammatory states are strongly related to ineffective erythropoiesis, and the release of inflammatory cytokines may increase anisocytosis by suppressing erythropoietin activity and inhibiting erythrocyte maturation. Neurohormonal activation may also contribute to an increase in RDW in patients with KD and CALs. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), which is an important index of the neurohormonal pathway, is a valuable biomarker for predicting CALs in patients with KD. In our study, we did not measure NT-proBNP; however, Fukuta et al. found that even after adjusting for numerous potential confounders, elevated BNP levels were independently associated with a higher RDW in patients with coronary artery disease.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^114TeR5A]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency among Indian preschool children contributing to increased burden of morbidity and mortality and the most significant negative consequence of iron deficiency is iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Recent NFHS–III surveys (2005–06) have shown that 70–85% (approx. 79.2%) of Indian young children have anemia. IDA is attributed to inadequate iron intake, poor bioavailability of iron or high nutritional needs during childhood which is further exacerbated by chronic intestinal blood losses due to helminth infections and in many areas due to severe malarial infections. Studies have shown that iron deficiency causes delay in cognitive development and poor motor and sensory system functioning and that iron supplementation in early years may prevent these complications among children. Conversely, there is an evidence suggesting that routine iron treatment in non-iron deficient children may have adverse consequences for morbidity and infections. Therefore, it is very important to detect iron deficiency (ID) at its earliest stage in children especially in a low resource setting and replenish the iron stores by proper supplementation, thereby preventing many of the adverse developmental and behavioral effects caused by IDA. Currently, the detection of IDA is largely dependent upon quantification of biochemical markers like serum ferritin (SFr), serum transferrin (STr) and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) which are not routinely available and affordable in developing countries due to high costs. Moreover, these tests are altered by inflammation, which limits their applicability for clinical interpretation, especially in areas with high infection rates. Another limitation of the commonly used hematological tests is their poor sensitivity or specificity as they can be modified by conditions other than iron deficiency. Studies have shown that RDW in addition to other hematological markers like mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and hemoglobin can be used as a differential diagnostic tool for identification of iron deficiency anemia. Various studies also show that the onset of iron deficiency anemia can be predicted using automated blood analyzers, as a low haemoglobin level along with a high level of anisocytosis detectable by red cell distribution width prove to be good indicators of changes in blood due to depleted iron stores. It seems that the earliest hematological manifestation of iron deficiency is marked by an elevated level of RDW and reports have shown that it is a cost-effective screening tool for early diagnosis of IDA in comparison to SFr and ZnPP. The red blood cell (RBC) distribution width, a measure of variations in the width of circulating RBCs, reported as a part of complete blood count has been known to be of value in the discrimination of iron deficiency anemia from other causes of microcytic anemia, but studies in pediatric populations are lacking. Thus, in the present study we evaluated the discriminative ability of RDW diagnostic test for detecting iron deficiency anemia among children aged 1–3 yrs in a low socio-economic setting using receiver's operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses.

### Images from the haematologica atlas of hematologic cytology: dysgranulopoiesis [^1139PkYf]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

In myelodysplastic syndrome without excess blasts, the precise recognition and quantification of dysplasia is critical for the diagnosis. The morphological abnormalities of the granulocytic series to be taken into account are illustrated in the Figure, showing bone marrow smears. Cytoplasmic hypogranularity or agranularity is considered a highly specific dysplastic feature (Figure A-E), whereas the most frequent nuclear abnormality is hyposegmentation (pseudo-Pelger- Huët anomaly), which is almost pathognomonic of myelodysplasia (Figure C and E). Other features of dysgranulopoiesis include anisocytosis of neutrophils (Figure A and C), giant nuclear segments or bizarre nuclear shapes (Figure A-C), macropolycytes (Figure D), and abnormal chromatin clumping (Figure E). Nuclear and cytoplasmic anomalies are often associated. Hypogranularity or agranularity of neutrophils can be better assessed with Sudan black staining (Figure F) or through the peroxidase reaction.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Red blood cell distribution width / platelet ratio on admission as a predictor for in-hospital mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction: a retrospective analysis from MIMIC-IV database [^1165B3K3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With the increasing incidence and prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis, over 200,000 hospital visits each year are associated with myocardial infarction. The acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is characterized by the evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischemia. Although the diagnostic criteria and major treatment strategies for AMI are well defined, the mortality rates for such patients remains high. Therefore, how to define high-risk patients is extremely important for the survival of patients with AMI.

Inflammation is one of the main factors contributing to coronary heart disease which leads to plaque instability and rupture. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with heterogeneous cell population, which can be used as a reliable indicator for anisocytosis. Recent studies had suggested that inflammation, neurohormone and adrenergic system activation may affect erythrocyte maturation by interfering with erythrocyte membrane, resulting in elevated RDW. RDW has been found to be an extremely effective prognostic predictor in patients with AMI.

Platelets play a key role in the pathophysiology of AMI, associated with endothelial cell activation and, together with fibrin, form thrombus within coronary arteries. Platelets not only participate in the formation of blood clots, but also release mediators that form and maintain local inflammatory responses. Several previous studies had shown that a decreased platelet count was associated with the severity of MI, death and reinfarction. However, the relationship between platelet counts and the prognosis of MI was controversial.

The RDW-to-platelets ratio (RPR), a combination of two independent parameters, has been established as a new index to reflect the severity of inflammation. RPR had been proved as a prognostic marker in breast cancer, cardiovascular diseases, acute pancreatitis and chronic hepatic. While RPR is related to the clinical prognosis of patients with cardiovascular diseases, the predictive power of RPR in mortality for AMI patients remains uncertain. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between RPR on admission and short-term mortality within 180 days in patients with AMI.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^117NHQFZ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

First-line haematology methods

All haematological testingshould be carried out on blood samples that are as fresh as possible. The complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count (FBC), haemoglobin pattern analysis and haemoglobin component quantification requires whole blood drawn into anticoagulant (EDTA). If necessary, bloods can be transported and stored at 4 o C.

Complete blood count

Electronic measurement is recommended, especially for MCV (mean cell volume), for which the measurements should be direct. All red cell indices (and other parameters) are important in evaluation, including Hb (haemoglobin), RBC (red blood cell count), MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin content), MCV and some labs use RDW (red cell distribution width), which is the standard deviation of the red cell size measurements expressed either as a percentage of the mean or a coefficient of variation.

RDW can potentially discriminate between thalassaemia carriers and iron deficiency and sometimes between thalassaemia carriers and a thalassaemia disorder or other rare causes of microcytosis, as indicated by decreased MCV (see notes below). It is a measure of the degree of anisocytosis and is simpler and faster than performing red cell morphology analysis (see Supplementary Information), although not as comprehensive. RDW alone is not a diagnostic parameter for β -thalassaemia trait.

The RBC count is also a parameter that can potentially distinguish between iron deficiency and thalassaemia. High RBC (erythrocytosis) results from a mechanism that compensates for the chronic low MCH present in thalassaemia carriers. This compensating mechanism needs folic acid levels to be maintained and may restore the Hb level of a markedly microcytic thalassaemia carrier to near normal values, raising RBC to 6–7 (10¹²/l) or higher, without exceeding the normal packed cell volume (PCV) level. On the other hand, RBC compensation might be less evident in case of folic acid deficiency, a vitamin with limited body reserves, which is essential for cell division and thus for erythropoiesis. In case of folic acid deficiency carriers may become more anaemic, and microcytosis may become less evident, even disappearing in cases with coexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, RBC compensation is less evident in cases when MCH is only moderately reduced.

### Mimicry of inherited red cell disorders: the result of somatic mutations in a clonal myeloid disease [^116KhV7j]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

The hematopathologist and hematological oncologist should consider acquired syndromes described here when alterations of the genes and/or chromosome loci noted in Table 1 occur in association with a chronic myeloid neoplasm or when the red cell morphology has features that are unusual, such as a heightened frequency or dominance of ovalocytes or spherocytes.

Table 1.
Somatic mutations in chronic myeloid neoplasms leading to acquired red cell syndromes simulating germline mutations.

A clonal myeloid disease, especially a myelodysplastic syndrome, may also result in a profound disorder of erythropoiesis that leads to "red cell anarchy". The latter is defined by an exaggerated combination of anisocytosis, anisochromia and poikilocytosis. Red cell anisocytosis (elevated red cell distribution width) predicts for a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemiaand in myelodysplastic syndrome. Elevated red cell distribution width is also a risk factor for progression of age-related clonal hematopoiesis in otherwise healthy persons to acute myelogenous leukemia.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^111bDP7o]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

The remaining showed further changes, as if some fragmentation had occurred. There was a pronounced anisocytosis. A few red cells verged on stomatocytes (→). Erythroblasts were present (17%). F indicates father. Presence of many spherocytes without anisocytosis. M indicates mother. Presence of many spherocytes without anisocytosis. (B) In both parents (M and F), there was an increased osmotic fragility, a reduced maximum deformability index, and a decreased dehydration, a situation typical of HS. These features were dramatically enhanced in the proband (P). C indicates control. The maximum deformability index (DI max; normal values, 0.41–0.53 AU) is the maximum value of the deformability index. The "hypo-osmotic point" (O min; normal values, 143–163 mOsm/L) is the osmolality at which the deformability index reaches a minimum in the hypotonic region; it is the same as the osmolality at which 50% of the erythrocytes hemolyze in a standard osmotic resistance test. This index thus provides a measure of the average surface area–to-volume ratio of erythrocytes. The "hyper-osmotic point" (O′; normal values, 325–375 mOsm/L) is the osmolality in the hypertonic region (right leg of the curve) at which the deformability index reaches half its maximum value. It provides information on the erythrocyte hydration.

### Red cell distribution width predicts out of hospital outcomes in critically ill emergency general surgery patients [^112MnVcV]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

EGS has been shown to confer significant morbidity and mortality, not only during the patient's hospital stay but also after discharge. Therefore, the discovery of predictive factors to stratify EGS patients to better identify those who would benefit from closer follow-up may help prevent adverse outcomes.

There is no current gold standard predictor for mortality after discharge in EGS patients. Our group has identified that patients who are malnourished at the time of ICU admission after EGS have increased 90-day mortality. Although this is a helpful metric that could potentially change management both when in the hospital and in outpatient care, this requires an in-depth evaluation and often the expertise of a dietician. Although increasing age and uninsured status have been found to be correlated with worse outcomes after EGS, these are less specific metrics to use for stratification of patients postdischarge for more intensive follow-up. Therefore, we investigated the potential of RDW as a more specific, one-time laboratory value for use as a prognostic marker for postdischarge mortality.

RDW is a laboratory value that is commonly obtained in postsurgical patients that has prognostic value in multiple disease states. RDW is a precise quantitation of RBC heterogeneity available on virtually all automated hematology analyzers and included in the complete blood count. RDW is a reflection of subtle changes in the red cell volume (mean corpuscular volume (MCV)) and size (anisocytosis). RDW is calculated as the variation in the distribution of RBC volumes divided by the MCV. Specifically, the RDW-CV is calculated from the width of the RBC histogram at 1 SD from the mean divided by MCV×100 and reported as a percentage. The normal RDW-CV is 11.5% to 14.5%. Variation in size of RBCs (anisocytosis) with a normal MCV occurs in subclinical deficiency of iron, folate or B12, as well as Sickle cell disease, and myelodysplastic syndrome.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^113tTawW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell distribution width is a parameter measured automatically in every complete blood count that actually reflects the degree of anisocytosis of the red blood cell population. It is a cost-effective tool used in everyday clinical practice along with other parameters to define and narrow the cause of anemia. In a series of pathologic entities, such as cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, malignancy, chronic renal diseases and chronic respiratory diseases, where inflammation and oxidative stress comprise the major pathophysiologic insults, red cell distribution width behaves as a significant and competent marker able to predict and assess disease activity and severity. A number of clinical studies based on these observations have aimed to evaluate its potential utility as an index of activity in inflammatory bowel disease. In this narrative review we present data from the international literature regarding its ability to express disease activity and we look into its relation with clinical, laboratory and endoscopic indices used to identify active disease. According to the results of published clinical trials, red cell distribution width is considerably correlated with disease activity and might serve as an index to differentiate Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis.

### Reticulocyte analysis by flow cytometry and other techniques [^111vvDNh]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Enumeration of peripheral blood reticulocytes is an essential part of the diagnosis and management of anemic patients, since the number of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood reflects the erythrocytic activity of the bone marrow. Reticulocyte enumeration using flow cytometric methodology is rapidly replacing the inaccurate, imprecise manual counting technique used in the past. This article explores the pathophysiology of the reticulocyte, the various means of counting reticulocytes, and the diverse clinical applications of reticulocyte data.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113HMPXu]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion of case 1

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (eg, antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review (Figure 1). The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, MDS, and leukemia disorders.

### Ankyrin-1 gene exhibits allelic heterogeneity in conferring protection against malaria [^114AvLpk]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

We predicted that the mutant RBCs have a shorter half-life, which is also one of the symptoms of HS. Therefore, RBC half-life was determined by biotinylating mouse RBCs in situ and tracking the proportion of biotinylated RBCs in circulation over time. As shown in Figure 1D, erythrocytes from Ank-1 (MRI95845/MRI95845) have a significantly shorter half-life of ∼9.5 d as opposed to the 16 d of wild-type erythrocytes (P = 0.008), but no significant difference was observed for erythrocytes from heterozygous mice [P = 0.09 for Ank-1 (MRI96570/+) mice and P = 0.08 for Ank-1 (MRI95845/+) mice]. The morphology of these RBCs were examined under light and SEM (Figure S2 in). Ank-1 (MRI96570/+) and Ank-1 (MRI95845/+) mice exhibited a slight reduction in RBC size, while Ank-1 (MRI95845/MRI95845) mice had smaller acanthocytic RBCs and displayed anisocytosis. On the other hand, blood smears obtained from jaundiced Ank-1 (MRI96570/MRI96570) pups showed reticulocytosis, fragmented RBCs, and severe anisocytosis.

### The diagnostic red blood cell distribution width as a prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia [^112a7PzD]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a marker that describes the degree of heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume. Because it is part of the routine automated output of blood cell counters, the RDW is included in the diagnostic work-up of most hematologic diseases and is easily and inexpensively assessed. Red blood cells (RBCs) typically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, which is why a delayed clearance of older erythrocytes leads to higher RDW levels. Subsequently, a higher RDW mirrors a dysregulated erythrocyte homeostasis with either impaired erythropoiesis (including reticulocytosis and macrocytosis; eg, due to toxic effects) or abnormal (prolonged) RBC survival. Although, historically, the clinical meaning of the RDW was limited to the differential diagnosis of anemia, a wider applicability recently became evident. Increased RDW levels are associated with a higher mortality in healthy people, which has been linked to oxidative stress, poor nutritional status, and older age. Data also suggest that a high RDW defines a proinflammatory state, leading to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiac mortality, as well as a greater likelihood of developing a variety of malignancies.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^111jjGLk]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical utility of RDW

RDW, a parameter measured automatically in every complete blood count (CBC), is an actual reflection of RBC size variability and heterogeneity. RDW is considered as a reliable index of the anisocytosis of the RBC population circulating in peripheral blood. There are 2 different ways to express RDW statistically: as a coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and/or a standard deviation (RDW-SD). RDW-SD (expressed in fL) is an actual evaluation of the width of the RBC size distribution histogram and is quantified after determination of the width (in fL) at the 20% height level of that histogram. This index is therefore not influenced by the average size of the RBC population, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

On the other hand, RDW-CV (expressed in %) is derived from a mathematical formula that includes SD and MCV:

RDW-CV (%) = 1 standard deviation of RBC volume / MCV × 100% and it is affected by variations in RBC size. Anemias were traditionally classified, according to their MCV value, as microcytic (MCV below the reference range), normocytic (MCV within the reference range) and macrocytic (MCV above the reference range). In the early 80s a different approach was proposed for anemia classification using both RDW and MCV.

Based on this classification, 2 distinct entities of anemias were described: one with a homogeneous erythrocyte population and normal RDW, and a second with a heterogeneous erythrocyte population and a greater RDW. The main conditions that influence and elevate RDW value include anemias due to nutritional deficiencies (iron, B12 and folate), hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemias, and sickle-cell anemia (Table 1).

Cresyl violet staining and FCM analysis on CIC

CIC specimens from rabbit eyes instilled with PBS showed a homogeneous cell sheet (fig 3A, table 2): the epithelial cells were flat and regular, with a nucleo:cytoplasmic ratio from 1:2 to 1:3. Goblet cells were clearly visible among or beside the epithelial cells. PF-tafluprost (fig 3B) instillation induced slight anisocytosis in the epithelium with normal nuclei. Slight infiltration of inflammatory cells could also be observed. The goblet cell number and morphology remained normal. Significant inflammatory infiltration was observed after the instillation of latanoprost (fig 3C) and BAK (fig 3D). In latanoprost-receiving eyes, a few conjunctival epithelial cells could still be observed, adjacent to inflammatory patches, with important anisocytosis and anisonucleocytosis. In BAK-receiving eyes, patches of inflammatory cell-containing secretions without any epithelial cells were observed. The abundant inflammatory cell infiltrates consisted mainly of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear cells) (arrows), lymphocytes (arrowheads) and rare eosinophils (star) (fig 3D 1, D2). No goblet cells could be seen in these conditions.

### Usefulness of red cell distribution width to predict mortality in patients with peripheral artery disease [^114XRyub]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Increased red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a marker of anisocytosis, has been associated with adverse outcomes in multiple settings. Whether RDW is predictive of mortality in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) is unknown. We studied 13,039 consecutive outpatients (69.5 ± 12.0 years of age, 60.9% men, 97.6% white) with PAD identified by noninvasive lower-extremity arterial testing at the Mayo Clinic from January 1997 through December 2007, with follow-up through September 2009. We defined PAD as a low (≤ 0.9) or high (≥ 1.4) ankle-brachial index (ABI). Cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidities were ascertained using electronic medical record-based algorithms. RDW was obtained from the complete blood cell count drawn around the time of arterial evaluation. Mortality was ascertained using the Mayo electronic medical record and Accurint databases. Association of RDW with all-cause mortality was analyzed by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. During a median follow-up of 5.5 years, 4,039 (31.0%) deaths occurred (28.7% in low and 38.9% in high ABI subsets). After adjustment for age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors, and co-morbidities, patients in the highest quartile of RDW (> 14.5%) had a 66% greater risk of mortality compared to the lowest quartile (< 12.8%, p < 0.0001); a 1% increment in RDW was associated with a 10% greater risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.12, p < 0.0001). The adjusted hazard ratio was similar in the low (1.10, 1.08 to 1.12) and high (1.09, 1.06 to 1.12) ABI subsets. In conclusion, RDW, a routinely available measurement, is an independent prognostic marker in patients with PAD.

### A retrospective cohort study on red blood cell morphology changes in pre-school age children under nitrous oxide anesthesia [^1165TQxV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Measurements

Demographic, surgical and anesthesia data such as age, sex, height, weight, anesthesia time and operation time were collected through electronic medical record system and there were no missing data. CBCs before and up to 7 days after surgery were also retrieved. The baseline CBC was taken as the latest report before surgery. If there were more than one CBC report within 24 h, the average was calculated and recorded for that day. Since most of the reference intervals of parameters in CBC were similar between children aging 2 to 5 years old and adults, and the patients included were within this age range, the diagnostic criteria used in our hospital was thought to be appropriate in our study. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin < 110 g/L. Macrocytosis and microcytosis were defined as mean corpuscular volume (MCV) < 82 fL or > 97 fL. Anisocytosis was defined as red cell distribution width (RDW) > 15%. Hypochromatosis and hyperchromatosis were defined as mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) < 320 g/L or > 360 g/L. The concentration and maintenance time of N 2 O were recorded. The cumulative exposure dose was calculated as the result of multiplying the concentration by the exposure time of N 2 O. The differences between the highest index during 7 days after surgery and the index before surgery were taken as the peak change of MCV and RDW (△MCV, △RDW). And the differences divided by preoperative values were recorded as the relative changes of △MCV and △RDW (r△MCV, r△RDW). Moreover, data were collected on intraoperative blood loss, fluid infusion and perioperative red blood cell transfusion. Different types of blood transfusion concluding autologous or allogeneic or mixed red cell transfusion were recorded and analyzed separately.

### Biallelic hypomorphic variants in CAD cause uridine-responsive macrocytic anaemia with elevated haemoglobin-A2 [^1123m2rB]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Biallelic pathogenic variants in CAD, that encode the multienzymatic protein required for de-novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-50. This rare disease, characterized by developmental delay, intractable seizures and anaemia, is amenable to treatment with uridine. We present a patient with macrocytic anaemia, elevated haemoglobin-A2 levels, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis and target cells in the blood smear, and mild developmental delay. A next-generation sequencing panel revealed biallelic variants in CAD. Functional studies did not support complete abrogation of protein function; however, the patient responded to uridine supplement. We conclude that biallelic hypomorphic CAD variants may cause a primarily haematological phenotype.

### Red cell distribution width predicts out of hospital outcomes in critically ill emergency general surgery patients [^115wV5ca]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

An elevated RDW after RBC transfusion reflects the heterogeneity in size of the transfused donor and the recipient RBC populations. Packed RBCs have MCV values in the normal range even during 42 days of storage. After the first 24 hours after transfusion, RBCs commonly survive 90 days. Patients with RBC transfusions can have increases in the RDW if the MCV of the donor and recipient cells are different. Patients with a normal MCV and no anisocytosis should not have an increase in RDW after RBC transfusion as the MCV of transfused cells is normal.

An elevated RDW is indicative of impaired erythropoesis. Therefore, it is a secondary marker of inflammation, malnutrition, or impaired renal function, as inadequate production of erythropoietin can lead to elevated RDW. As such, this marker has generated interest as a biomarker for cardiovascular conditions including coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. Furthermore, elevated RDW at the onset of critical care has been linked to an increased risk of 30-day mortality, and elevated RDW at discharge after critical illness has been shown to be correlated with increased mortality 30 days after discharge. Therefore, as EGS often involves a combination of critical illness, malnutrition, and inflammation, RDW is a logical potential biomarker to help predict postdischarge mortality in this cohort.

Our study demonstrates that those patients in the two highest quintiles of RDW values had a significantly increased odds of 90-day mortality, 6.9-fold and 7.9-fold of those in the lowest quintile. This remained a significant predictor of mortality after adjustment for age, race, gender, Deyo-Charlson Index, sepsis and number of organs with acute failure. Moreover, those patients in the top two quintiles of RDW had a significantly increased risk of 30-day readmission as compared with those in the lowest quartile. This shows a clear correlation between elevated RDW in the EGS patient cohort and increased postdischarge morbidity and mortality. Although it is unclear as to the direct mechanism of this correlation, it is likely that RDW is a bellwether for ongoing inflammation and malnutrition in these patients that leads to worse outcomes. The benefit of using this particular metric is that it requires a single lab draw at discharge that is likely being performed for other reasons in these patients. Therefore, it is a quick and easily interpretable value that can change the patient's postdischarge follow-up to flag complications early and prevent increased mortality.

### Red cell distribution width in heart failure: prediction of clinical events and relationship with markers of ineffective erythropoiesis, inflammation, renal function, and nutritional state [^111QnBi9]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to independently validate the recent observations on the predictive role of red cell distribution width (RDW) for outcomes in chronic heart failure and to provide epidemiologic data on the biological correlates of RDW in heart failure (HF). Understanding the mechanism underlying this observation is unclear, largely hampered by the lack of epidemiologic studies demonstrating factors that are associated with anisocytosis in cardiovascular diseases.

Methods

One hundred ninety-five patients (145 men, 50 women) with systolic HF were enrolled and followed up for a median of 14.5 months. Primary end points were all-cause mortality and hospital readmission due to worsening HF symptoms. A total of 19 clinical chemistry, hematology, and biochemical variables were considered for analysis together with clinical parameters in Cox proportional hazards and multiple regression models.

Results

Red cell distribution width was found to be an N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide independent predictor of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.61 per 1 SD increase) in our study. Multiple correlations between biomarkers of ineffective erythropoiesis (serum iron, ferritin, and soluble transferrin receptor levels), inflammation and acute-phase reaction (interleukin-6, soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor I and soluble TNF receptor II, C-reactive protein, and prealbumin concentrations), undernutrition (total cholesterol and albumin levels), and renal function were observed. In the multiple regression model, the strongest relationship for RDW was obtained with soluble transferrin receptor, soluble TNF receptor I, soluble TNF receptor II, and total cholesterol.

Conclusions

Here we validate the strong, independent prediction of morbidity and mortality in HF by RDW. The described correlations between RDW and inflammation, ineffective erythropoiesis, undernutrition, and impaired renal function may facilitate the understanding why this marker is associated with adverse outcomes in HF.

### Inherited bone marrow failure in the pediatric patient [^1157iZsd]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias

Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by anemia, ineffective erythropoiesis, and morphological evidence of dyserythropoeisis. The first description of CDAs was published in 1966 by Crookston and colleagues. In 1968, Heimpel and Wendtclassified CDAs into 3 types (I-III). Over the years, additional subtypes (IV-VII) have been added, often based on case reports.

Most patients with CDAI present with splenomegaly and anemia. In some patients, nonhematological features (eg, skeletal abnormalities) have been observed (Table 2). Ineffective erythropoiesis is evidenced by peripheral (anisocytosis) and BM (megaloblastic erythroid precursors, internuclear chromatin bridging, and binocularity affecting 3% to 7% of the erythroblasts) abnormalities and increased hemolysis markers. The defining feature is a "Swiss cheese" heterochromatin appearance in erythroblasts on electron microscopy. The first disease gene (CDAN1) was identified in 2002(Table 7). Subsequently, CDIN1 (CDAN1 interacting nuclease 1) was found to be responsible for some CDAI cases.

Table 7.
CDA genetic subtypes

CDAII is the most common CDA subtype and was described as hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity with a positive acidified serum lysis test (HEMPAS) in 1969. It is inherited as an AR trait. The anemia is variable (80–110 g/L), and ∼10% of cases require regular blood transfusions. Clinical presentations include a variable degree of jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and liver cirrhosis. Peripheral blood morphology shows anisocytosis, and BM features include normoblastic erythroid hyperplasia with usually more than 10% binucleate erythroblasts. On electron microscopy, erythroid cells have a characteristic endoplasmic reticulum arrangement that gives them a double-membrane appearance. Red cells are hemolyzed by acidified sera, but not by the patient's own serum. In 2009, the gene encoding the secretory coat protein complex II component SEC23B has been shown to be responsible for CDAII.

### Clinical and hematological profile of patients with pancytopenia at a tertiary medical center in Ethiopia [^114UWXtN]. Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancytopenia is an important hematological problem encountered in routine clinical practice associated with a multitude of disease states. The possible causes of pancytopenia can be influenced by geography, socioeconomic conditions, and endemic illnesses. Information regarding the underlying clinical conditions and morphologic features of blood cells of pancytopenia is limited and varied across different regions. Thus, this study was designed to assess the peripheral morphologic features of blood cells and the underlying clinical causes of pancytopenia.

Methods

A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the Jimma Medical Center hematology laboratory from June 13 to November 13, 2022. A total of 3 mL of whole blood was collected from each subject for complete blood count analysis and peripheral blood morphology examination. Data on sociodemographic and clinical conditions were collected from medical records using a checklist. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 26.

Results

A total of 163 patients with pancytopenia were identified within the 5 months. Hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly was the most prevalent cause (29.4%), followed by megaloblastic anemia (20.2%), chronic liver disease (10.4%), and acute leukemia (8.6%). Anisocytosis was the predominant peripheral blood morphology finding (82.2%), along with microcytosis (49.7%), ovalocytosis (31.3%), and macrocytosis (30.7%). Severe anemia was observed in 57% of cases, whereas the majority (92%) exhibited moderate leukopenia. A significant proportion (42.3%) had a platelet count below 50,000/μL.

Conclusion

Unlike previous studies conducted in other parts of the world, this study showed that hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly was the leading cause of pancytopenia. This emphasizes the necessity of considering this condition as a possible cause for pancytopenia, particularly in malaria-endemic areas. The findings of the hematological profiles and peripheral blood morphology strongly suggest that early identification and prompt management of patients with pancytopenia require collaboration between clinical and laboratory investigations.

### Identification of the integrin β 3 L718P mutation in a pedigree with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia with anisocytosis [^1123iuYk]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

αIIbβ3 integrin mutations that result in the complete loss of expression of this molecule on the platelet surface cause Glanzmann thrombasthenia. This is usually autosomal recessive, while other mutations are known to cause dominantly inherited macrothrombocytopenia (although such cases are rare). Here, we report a 4-generation pedigree including 10 individuals affected by dominantly inherited thrombocytopenia with anisocytosis. Six individuals, whose detailed clinical and laboratory data were available, carried a non-synonymous ITGB3 gene alteration resulting in mutated integrin β3 (ITGB3)-L718P. This mutation causes partial activation of the αIIbβ3 complex, which promotes the generation of abnormal pro-platelet-like protrusions through downregulating RhoA (RHOA) activity in transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. These findings suggest a model whereby the integrin β3-L718P mutation contributes to thrombocytopenia through gain-of-function mechanisms.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^113BLgw2]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The high incidence of IDA in children emphasizes the need for the cost effective and reliable tool in diagnosing IDA. A number of different indicators, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythropoietin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum iron, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration have been used to evaluate IDA. But the drawbacks of these tests are that many of them are expensive and require sophisticated laboratories, while others have been found to have a low specificity. It has been seen that anisocytosis occurs, where the erythrocytes produced are of smaller than average size and having a large size variation, due to inadequate iron supply. The morphology and function of erythrocytes at molecular level has been known to be disturbed due to iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, an increase in RDW values may occur in IDA allowing an early detection of ID before reduction in MCV occurs. RDW has been reported to have a high predictive value for IDA and can differentiate beta-thalassemia from other causes of anemia in populations. Our results corroborate the view that RDW evaluated in a large sample performed very well as a screening diagnostic test for identifying iron deficiency anemia. These findings are similar to the findings of earlier studies conducted in other settings and support the usage of RDW as a screening tool for identifying iron deficiency anemia.

### Mature erythrocyte membrane homeostasis is compromised by loss of the GATA1-FOG1 interaction [^1138J5am]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

GATA1 plays essential roles in erythroid gene expression. The N-terminal finger of GATA1 (GATA1-Nf) is important for association with FOG1. Substitution mutations in GATA1-Nf, such as GATA1(V205M) that diminish the GATA1-FOG1 association, have been identified in human thrombocytopenia and anemia cases. A mouse model of human thrombocytopenia has been established using a transgenic complementation rescue approach; GATA1-deficient mice were successfully rescued from embryonic lethality by excess expression of GATA1(V205G), but rescued adult mice suffered from severe thrombocytopenia. In this study, we examined GATA1-deficient mice rescued with GATA1(V205G) at a comparable level to endogenous GATA1. Mice rescued with this level of GATA1(V205G) rarely survive to adulthood. Rescued newborns suffered from severe anemia and jaundice accompanied with anisocytosis and spherocytosis. Expression of Slc4a1, Spna1, and Aqp1 genes (encoding the membrane proteins band-3, α-spectrin, and aquaporin-1, respectively) were strikingly diminished, whereas expression of other canonical GATA1-target genes, such as Alas2, were little affected. Lack of these membrane proteins provoked perturbation of membrane skeleton. Importantly, the red cells exhibited increased reactive oxygen species accumulation. These results thus demonstrate that the loss of the GATA1-FOG1 interaction causes a unique combination of membrane protein deficiency and disturbs the function of GATA1 in maintaining erythroid homeostasis.

### Detailed association between red blood cell distribution width and heart failure [^116h4wa4]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liang et al.demonstrated that red blood cell distribution width (RDW) independently predicted mortality in patients with heart failure in combination with N‐terminal pro‐B‐terminal natriuretic peptide (NT‐pro BNP) levels. Several concerns have been raised to improve their findings.

Anisocytosis, which is indicated by higher RDW values, might cause the progression of heart failure and incremental mortality due to erythrocyte deformability and impaired oxygen‐carrying capacity. Recently, hypoxia‐inducible factor‐prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors and sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to improve renal anemia. These medications might affect clinical outcomes including RDW levels in the heart failure cohorts. Were these medications administered to some of the participants?

Heart failure itself also has a considerable impact on the increase in RDW levels. Heart failure‐related chronic inflammation impairs iron metabolism and bone marrow function, both of which would increase RDW levels. Thus, heart failure and RDW levels have a deep association. Could the authors explain the reason why plasma NT‐pro BNP levels and RDW were "independently" associated with clinical outcomes despite their deep association? A baseline comparison between those with high RDW and those with low RDW among those with elevated plasma NT‐pro BNP might approach the mechanism. Such a comparison might clarify some therapeutic targets to improve RDW levels and clinical outcomes.

### Red blood cell distribution width predicts long term cardiovascular event after on-pump beating coronary artery bypass grafting [^1123qX1C]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we showed for the first time that baseline RDW levels were independently associated with mid and long-term, but not short-term, MACCE following CABG especially in a non-anemic population. The strengths of our analysis include elimination of common factors affecting RDW levels, the use of a single hematology analyzer for all assays and also the use of a standard surgical technique.

Despite, the traditional usage of RDW has been restricted to differential diagnosis of anemia, elevated RDW levels were found to be strongly correlated with cardiovascular event following PCI or acute MI and also in patients with heart failures or in the general population. Furthermore, situations which have prognostic importance in cardiovascular disease such as decreased kidney function, SYTAX score, carotid stenosis were found to be closely associated with increased RDW levels. RDW reflects the anisocytosis which is caused by both impaired erythropoiesis and abnormal red blood cell survival due to a variety of underlying metabolic abnormalities such as oxidative stress, inflammation, poor nutritional status, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, erythrocyte fragmentation and alteration of erythropoietin function. Therefore, the mechanism underlying increased RDW level, especially in non-anemic population seems to be closely related with cardiovascular risk factors.

Although the prognostic value of RDW in cardiovascular events following PCI are well known, the effect of RDW on MACCE in the CABG patients has not been adequately evaluated. We revealed that the increased RDW level is associated factors affecting severity and complexity of atherosclerosis such as, increased age, higher mean number of vessel disease, higher asymptomatic carotid stenosis and lower circle, similar to previous studies. Moreover, hypertension, age, three vessel disease, asymptomatic carotid stenosis were found to be predictors of MACCE following CABG in univariate analysis. Benedetto U et al. showed that higher RDW levels are associated with increased CRP level as an inflammatory marker in CABG patients. However, in contrast to previous studies we have not shown any correlation with RDW and CRP level. This finding might be related to the exclusion of patients with active infection and leukocytosis, unlike previous studies. This suggests that inflammation is not the major mechanism for the increased incidence of MACCE in the present study.

### Association between RDW-SD and prognosis across glycemic status in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [^1136YHHB]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is marked by the enlargement of the left ventricle or both ventricles, along with systolic dysfunction not attributable to abnormal loading conditions such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, or coronary artery disease (CAD).DCM stands as the primary contributor to non-ischemic heart failure (HF), carrying a high mortality rate and often necessitating heart transplantation. Despite advancements in medical interventions, the response to treatment can vary significantly, emphasizing the importance of precise risk assessment and tailored approaches to enhance patient outcomes.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a key parameter of the complete blood count, traditionally used in categorizing various types of anemia. It is defined as either the SD of erythrocyte volumes (RDW-SD), calculated by measuring the width at the 20% height level of the red blood cell (RBC) size distribution histogram, or as the coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) of erythrocyte volumes, indicating the variability in the size of circulating erythrocytes (anisocytosis). Lately, RDW and its related metrics, like the RDW to albumin ratio (RAR), have surfaced as possible prognostic indicators among patients with CAD, atrial fibrillation, and HF. Our earlier research established an inflammatory risk score incorporating RDW-SD, demonstrating a substantial enhancement in prognostic prediction for individuals with non-ischemic HF. Nevertheless, the prognostic significance of RDW-SD in individuals with non-ischemic DCM remains unexplored.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is linked to cardiac remodeling abnormalities and a heightened risk of HF, contributing to poor outcomes in both ischemic and non-ischemic HF.DM and HF share common pathophysiological mechanisms such as inflammation, oxidative stress, anisocytosis and RBC dysfunction, potentially linked to elevated RDW-SD levels. However, limited reports address the impact of varying glycemic states on the correlation between RDW-SD and prognosis. Pre-diabetes (pre-DM) represents an intermediary metabolic phase between normoglycemia (NG) and diabetes, encompassing individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose. Patients with HF have been reported to exhibit a high prevalence of pre-DM, associated with worse outcomes compared with those with NG. However, there is limited understanding regarding this subgroup within the patients with DCM. Therefore, this retrospective study aimed to evaluate the association between RDW-SD and the risk of death or heart transplantation among patients with DCM with NG, pre-DM and DM.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, iron supplementation, RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a trial of oral iron supplementation as first-line therapy in patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. Obtain further testing if there is no demonstrable rise in hemoglobin at 2 weeks and compliance has been assured.

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: the classic and the novel [^114EUrzm]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis, and is defined as a hemoglobin two SDs below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.
- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (IBD, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (CKD).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5–18.0%., while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.
- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia, and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased QoL, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### Case report: COVID associated pancytopenia unmasking previously undiagnosed pernicious anemia [^112Ygq5d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

CASE PRESENTATION

A 24-year-old active duty African American male presented to emergency room 18 days post COVID pneumonia infection, complaining of persistent fatigue, weakness, and subjective weight loss. He stated that his initial symptoms of dysgeusia, anosmia, headache, and fever had previously resolved since his initial COVID-positive test. He had no family history of blood disorders and had no significant past medical and surgical history. He was on no medications or supplements at the time of admission. Initial investigation with a complete blood count revealed a hemoglobin (HGB) of 4.1 g/dL, white blood cells (WBC) of 4.1 g/dL, and platelets (PLTs) of 64 × 10⁹/L. His anemia was normocytic (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] 95.3) and normochromic (mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH] 32.0). His leukopenia was lymphocytes predominant (55% lymphocytes, 33% granulocytes, and 6% monocytes). A peripheral smear was done which showed moderate oval macrocytes, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, schistocytes, and atypical lymphocytes most consistent with a hypocellular sample with dilution. The patient was admitted to the medicine ward for blood transfusion, volume resuscitation, and further workup.

Diagnostic evaluation for hypo-proliferation, hemolysis, and malnutrition was initiated. There was concern for a hemolytic process so a bilirubin level was obtained, which was elevated at 3.4 mg/dL with indirect bilirubin predominance at 1.8mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase was elevated suggesting a hemolytic anemia. However, his reticulocyte index was 0.13, consistent with hypo-proliferation. Direct antithrombin test was also negative. He was transfused 2 units of pack red blood cells and had an appropriate rise in hemoglobin to > 7 g/dL. We continued to work the patient up with multiple viral panels, Leptospirosis, cold agglutinins, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) to rule out other causes of his presentation. Flow cytometry cytogenetic analysis revealed no evidence of an acquired clonal abnormality.

### Δ β-thalassemia trait: how can we discriminate it from β-thalassemia trait and iron deficiency anemia? [^117VDeU8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To analyze the differences not only in classic hematologic parameters but also in RBC subpopulations among δβ-thalassemia trait (δβ-TT), β-thalassemia trait (β-TT), and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and to evaluate the role of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in elevated RBC distribution width (RDW).

Methods

Samples from 553 patients with microcytosis (74 δβ-TT, 272 β-TT, and 207 IDA) were run on an Advia 2120i analyzer (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY). Classic hematologic parameters and RBC subpopulations were assessed. The correlation between HbF and RDW in patients with thalassemia (both β and δβ) was evaluated. An independent sample t test was used to compare classic hematologic parameters and RBC subpopulations among β-TT, IDA, and δβ-TT and receiver operating characteristic curves performed in the significant comparisons.

Results

RDW was significantly higher in δβ-TT compared with β-TT (18.79% vs 16.04%, P < .001), as was mean corpuscular volume (66.39 vs 64.82 fL, P < .001), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (20.73 vs 20.04 pg, P < .001), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (31.16 vs 30.66 g/dL, P = 0.03). Pearson coefficient showed a good correlation between HbF and RDW. The values obtained for all the parameters were significantly different (P < .001) between patients with thalassemia (β and δβ) and IDA.

Conclusions

RDW is the best parameter to discriminate δβ-TT from β-TT. The degree of anisocytosis in patients with β-TT and δβ-TT is strongly correlated with HbF.

### Idiopathic myelofibrosis associated with primary biliary cirrhosis [^111v29Sg]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2002). Low credibility.

A patient with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) who developed idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) is reported. The initial diagnosis of PBC was established by liver biopsy, performed after a 2-month history of constitutional symptoms associated with abnormalities of the serum liver enzymes, with typical serum immunological markers being found. Although a favorable response of PBC to prednisone was observed, one and a half year later the patient developed anemia with anisocytosis and poikilocytosis, tear-drop cells, and leukoerythroblastic picture, and IM was diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy. A few months later, a rapid worsening of the patient's clinical condition was noted, with an increase in the constitutional symptoms and need for frequent packed RBC transfusions, and she finally died from an infectious complication. This case represents a new association of IM with an autoimmune disease, supporting the hypothesis of a possible immune basis of IM in some cases.

### Evaluation of anemia [^115u8PZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### Red cell distribution width and dementia among rural-dwelling older adults: the MIND-China study [^111DJaRc]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dementia affects over 50 million people worldwide, and nearly 60%of all dementia patients live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Notably, the number of people with dementia is projected to increase faster in LMICs than in high-income countries in the coming decades. Since the 1990s the prevalence of dementia in China has increased steadily in all age groups from 60 years of age. The total annual expenditure for dementia in China was estimated at US$168 billion. The prevalence of dementia was notably higher in the rural than urban communities. Given that there is currently no curative therapy available for dementia, identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for preventive and therapeutic interventions to delay the onset of dementia and slow cognitive decline.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a simple parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of circulating erythrocyte volume. It is routinely calculated by the overwhelming majority of hematologic analyzers according to red blood cell (RBC) volume and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). A normal RDW suggests homogeneous RBC size, whereas an elevated RDW indicates heterogeneous RBC size, known as anisocytosis. RDW in combination with MCV can used for differential diagnosis of anemia. An elevated RDW is often related to anemia due to nutrient deficiency (e.g. iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid) and sideroblastic anemia, and a normal RDW is often related to anemia from chronic disease, thalassemia heterozygosity, and aplastic anemia. Studies have shown that an increased RDW is associated with mortality, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions. The association of RDW with adverse health outcomes may depend on anemia or hemoglobin levels. Of note, the cross-sectional data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project found that elevated RDW was associated with dementia, especially among non-anemic participants. In addition, evidence has been accumulating over the last decade that anemia or low hemoglobin is related to cognitive impairment and dementia among older adults. However, most population-based studies of anemia and dementia have been conducted among high-income countries. In particular, the relationship of abnormal RDW with dementia and cognitive function as well as the interplay of increased RDW and anemia in cognitive aging has yet to be explored among LMICs.

Therefore, in this population-based cross-sectional study of older adults living in the rural communities in China, we sought 1) to evaluate the associations of RDW and anemia with dementia and global cognitive function; and 2) to explore whether their association varied by anemia status.

### Pseudoreticulocytosis in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome [^114wa1vp]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

A 52‐year‐old woman diagnosed in 2017 with low‐risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with multilineage dysplasia (R‐IPSS score 1.5) is evaluated for persistent reticulocytosis since 4 years, without evidence of bleeding or hemolysis.

Her laboratory results indicate the following: red blood count 3.56 × 10¹²/L (reference range: 3.8–5.2 × 10¹²/L); hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL (11.7–15.7 g/dL); hematocrit 0.32 L/L (0.35–0.47 L/L); MCV 93 fl (81–99 fl); MCHC 313 g/L (310–360 g/L); red cell distribution width 16.7% (11%–15%); reticulocytes 929 × 10⁹/L (20–120 × 10⁹/L), 26.1% (0.5%–1.5%); platelets 146 × 10⁹/L (150–350 × 10⁹/L); and leukocytes 2.2 × 10⁹/L (4.0–10 × 10⁹/L). Of note, MCV, expected to be increased in case of reticulocytosis is normal. Hemolytic parameters (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin) and creatinine are normal. The direct antiglobulin test is negative. Scattergram (Image 1A, white circle) shows small‐size reticulocytes with dim fluorescence (low RNA content), corresponding to a population of old reticulocytes. Peripheral blood smear (Image 1B) shows marked anisopoikilocytosis, polychromasia, and anisochromia. Presence of reticulocytes is confirmed on cresyl blue stain (Image 1C, arrows).

### Anemia in children [^114pjQww]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia in children is commonly encountered by the family physician. Multiple causes exist, but with a thorough history, a physical examination and limited laboratory evaluation a specific diagnosis can usually be established. The use of the mean corpuscular volume to classify the anemia as microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic is a standard diagnostic approach. The most common form of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency caused by reduced dietary intake. It is easily treatable with supplemental iron and early intervention may prevent later loss of cognitive function. Less common causes of microcytosis are thalassemia and lead poisoning. Normocytic anemia has many causes, making the diagnosis more difficult. The reticulocyte count will help narrow the differential diagnosis; however, additional testing may be necessary to rule out hemolysis, hemoglobinopathies, membrane defects and enzymopathies. Macrocytic anemia may be caused by a deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and liver disease. This form of anemia is uncommon in children.

(C), Peripheral blood smear with arrows showing reticulocytes with dim fluorescence (low RNA content) on cresyl blue stain (original magnification ×1000)

The phenomenon of increased reticulocytes without hemolysis or bleeding among patients with MDS has been described in few publications. It is a consequence of abnormal erythropoiesis with underlying delayed reticulocyte maturation, which may arise because of altered ribonucleic acid metabolism or a deficiency of ribonuclease. This process results in an increased number of circulating older reticulocytes with smaller size and low RNA content. Under normal conditions, reticulocytes have a half‐life of 24–48 h in the peripheral circulation, before losing their RNA and becoming erythrocytes. Due to delayed maturation, reticulocytes retain their RNA for a longer time, resulting in a prolonged half‐life in peripheral blood and thus in "pseudoreticulocytosis".

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

### HbA2 levels in children with β-thalassemia trait associated with iron deficiency: a perspective for pediatricians [^113iy2f6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

In our study, cases with HbA2 levels below 3.5% presented a diagnostic challenge because they could represent classic β-thalassemia trait with decreased HbA2 levels due to iron deficiency, HbA2-normal β-thalassemia trait, or δβ-thalassemia trait, regardless of iron status. Because the potential impact of iron treatment is unknown and the variation analysis was not available at the time of evaluation, a systematic approach was proposed to aid in differentiation. Patients with accompanying iron deficiency and low HbA2 levels lacked distinction among these conditions because all 3 scenarios could occur concurrently. In patients without accompanying iron deficiency, however, the possibilities narrowed to either HbA2-normal β-thalassemia trait or δβ-thalassemia trait. The primary clinical focus remained on identifying β-thalassemia trait rather than on defining its subgroups. Nonetheless, discrimination between these conditions was facilitated by assessing RDW on CBC analysis and HbF levels in HPLC. Elevated RDW coupled with high HbF levels favored deltaβ-thalassemia trait, indicating a potential role for these parameters in distinguishing between HbA2-normal β-thalassemia trait and δβ-thalassemia trait. Notably, RDW emerged as the most effective parameter for discriminating between δβ-thalassemia trait and β-thalassemia trait, with the degree of anisocytosis correlating strongly with HbF levels. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of RDW and HbF levels, without undertaking additional tests, contributed significantly to the distinction between these thalassemia subtypes.

### Review of the cytologic features of noninvasive ductal carcinomas of the pancreas: differences from invasive ductal carcinoma [^112sxZZA]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Invasive ductal adenocarcinoma (IDA) of the pancreas (IDAP) originating from the ductal gland has a poor prognosis. Noninvasive carcinomas are principally intraductal papillary mucinous carcinomas (IPMCs) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms 3 (PanIN-3). Small papillary-cohesive clusters, individually well-enveloped nuclei in well-preserved cytoplasm, centrally located nuclei, small nuclei (about 10 mum), euchromatin, clearly defined cell borders, small cytoplasm without prominent anisocytosis and no cytoplasm more than 21 mum in shortest diameter, a mixture of goblet cells, and a pleomorphic aspect are common in IPMC and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), whereas malignancy in nuclei are observed only in IPMC. PanIN-3 cells have small papillary-cohesive and compact clusters, a monomorphic aspect, and small dense cytoplasm and are highly suggestive of malignancy. IDA cells have loose sheet and solid clusters, poorly preserved cytoplasm, nuclei that tend to adhere to each other, large nuclei, a combination of large nuclei (short diameter < 15 mum) with hyperchromatin, a monomorphic aspect, and abundant cytoplasm more than 21 mum in the shortest diameter. To preoperatively differentiate noninvasive IPMC and PanIN-3 from IDAP, these features would be clinically very useful.

### Prognostic value of RDW alone and in combination with NT-proBNP in patients with heart failure [^114FmyUA]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The mechanism by which increased RDW predicts prognosis in CHF has not been elucidated. As a measure of variability in circulating erythrocyte size (anisocytosis), RDW is elevated with ineffective RBC production (e.g. iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, B12 or folate deficiency, and hemoglobinopathies), increased RBC destruction (e.g. hemolysis), or after blood transfusion. On one hand, anisocytosis may cause progression of HF and increased mortality. With high anisocytosis, erythrocyte deformability and oxygen‐carrying capacity decrease. This may reduce peripheral and myocardial tissue oxygenation, and contribute to HF. On the other hand, HF itself may impact RDW. HF involves activation of inflammatory pathways. Inflammatory markers including tumor necrosis factor‐α and interleukin‐6 are increased and may negatively impact prognosis. Also, inflammation may impair bone marrow function resulting in release of premature erythrocytes into circulation and increased RDW. Impaired iron metabolism, which elevates RDW, is also common in HF and contributes to increased hospitalizations. Vitamin D influences RDW by increasing iron availability and down‐regulating proinflammatory cytokines and hepcidin. Predictably, vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of HF. Finally, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a regulatory role in bone marrow proliferation. ANS dysregulation, a contributor to HF progression, may also lead to increased RDW. It is apparent that increased RDW may reflect multiple pathological processes that culminate in HF progression. Summarily, RDW serves as a widely available and cheap way to integrate complex interactions into a single, well validated prognostic biomarker.

Further studies are needed to establish whether RDW or a combination of biomarkers can inform treatment decisions and follow‐up in a cost‐effective manner. At present, even the most established HF biomarkers, the natriuretic peptides, remain controversial for serial follow‐up. Additionally, the mechanisms behind the prognostic significance of RDW in HF patients merits investigation.

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: what is it? Why is it important? [^117UxPoQ]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count, as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count. For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections; the reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism or heme synthesis [^112HYMu9]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

During recent years, our understanding of the pathogenesis of inherited microcytic anemias has gained from the identification of several genes and proteins involved in systemic and cellular iron metabolism and heme syntheses. Numerous case reports illustrate that the implementation of these novel molecular discoveries in clinical practice has increased our understanding of the presentation, diagnosis, and management of these diseases. Integration of these insights into daily clinical practice will reduce delays in establishing a proper diagnosis, invasive and/or costly diagnostic tests, and unnecessary or even detrimental treatments. To assist the clinician, we developed evidence-based multidisciplinary guidelines on the management of rare microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism and heme synthesis. These genetic disorders may present at all ages, and therefore these guidelines are relevant for pediatricians as well as clinicians who treat adults. This article summarizes these clinical practice guidelines and includes background on pathogenesis, conclusions, and recommendations and a diagnostic flowchart to facilitate using these guidelines in the clinical setting.

### ACTN1 mutations cause congenital macrothrombocytopenia [^117JZBrT]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Congenital macrothrombocytopenia (CMTP) is a heterogeneous group of rare platelet disorders characterized by a congenital reduction of platelet counts and abnormally large platelets, for which CMTP-causing mutations are only found in approximately half the cases. We herein performed whole-exome sequencing and targeted Sanger sequencing to identify mutations that cause CMTP, in which a dominant mode of transmission had been suspected but for which no known responsible mutations have been documented. In 13 Japanese CMTP-affected pedigrees, we identified six (46%) affected by ACTN1 variants cosegregating with CMTP. In the entire cohort, ACNT1 variants accounted for 5.5% of the dominant forms of CMTP cases and represented the fourth most common cause in Japanese individuals. Individuals with ACTN1 variants presented with moderate macrothrombocytopenia with anisocytosis but were either asymptomatic or had only a modest bleeding tendency. ACTN1 encodes α-actinin-1, a member of the actin-crosslinking protein superfamily that participates in the organization of the cytoskeleton. In vitro transfection experiments in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated that altered α-actinin-1 disrupted the normal actin-based cytoskeletal structure. Moreover, transduction of mouse fetal liver-derived megakaryocytes with disease-associated ACTN1 variants caused a disorganized actin-based cytoskeleton in megakaryocytes, resulting in the production of abnormally large proplatelet tips, which were reduced in number. Our findings provide an insight into the pathogenesis of CMTP.

### Inherited microcytic anemias [^112mTQNj]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Inherited microcytic anemias can be broadly classified into 3 subgroups: (1) defects in globin chains (hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias), (2) defects in heme synthesis, and (3) defects in iron availability or iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These conditions are characterized by a decreased availability of hemoglobin (Hb) components (globins, iron, and heme) that in turn causes a reduced Hb content in red cell precursors with subsequent delayed erythroid differentiation. Iron metabolism alterations remain central to the diagnosis of microcytic anemia, and, in general, the iron status has to be evaluated in cases of microcytosis. Besides the very common microcytic anemia due to acquired iron deficiency, a range of hereditary abnormalities that result in actual or functional iron deficiency are now being recognized. Atransferrinemia, DMT1 deficiency, ferroportin disease, and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia are hereditary disorders due to iron metabolism abnormalities, some of which are associated with iron overload. Because causes of microcytosis other than iron deficiency should be considered, it is important to evaluate several other red blood cell and iron parameters in patients with a reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), including mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, serum iron and serum ferritin levels, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and sometimes reticulocyte count. From the epidemiological perspective, hemoglobinopathies/thalassemias are the most common forms of hereditary microcytic anemia, ranging from inconsequential changes in MCV to severe anemia syndromes.

### Computer vision quantitation of erythrocyte shape abnormalities provides diagnostic, prognostic, and mechanistic insight [^113G8pHq]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 4 shows that RBC-diff counts may in some scenarios be predictive of patient outcomes or track with patient prognosis. The surprising associations with mortality in Figure 4 B persisted after adjusting for multiple factors, including morphology grading flags, comorbidities, and RDW, suggesting the presence of valuable and underutilized clinical information in blood smears. We note that the population of patients with blood smears at MGH is not representative of the general patient population, and further study of this signal in healthy cohorts is required.

RBC-diff can also help provide single-cell insights into the influence of morphology on CBC indices (Figure 5) via the estimation of single-cell volumes. Estimation of blood count parameters from imaging data has previously been shown to be promising, with prototype approaches showing similar accuracy to flow-cytometry approaches. By connecting estimated CBC indices to morphology, RBC-diff can generate morphology-corrected CBC indices that may provide improved discrimination of pathologic states or response to treatment. It has been shown that hemoglobin levels can be estimated from blood smear images, suggesting that RBC-diff could potentially be extended to other blood count measures such as hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin.

This study focuses primarily on the quantitation of schistocytes because they are commonly elevated in important acute care settings, and existing automated systems show limited specificity of detection. Schistocyte counts can be approximated via the fragmented red cell count (FRC), which can be calculated via flow-cytometry. FRC counts are sensitively but nonspecifically associated with imaging-derived schistocyte countsand may have diagnostic value for TMAs. However, FRC counts do not provide information on other RBC morphologic classes, a key feature for differential diagnosis in our study (Figure 3) and a part of the current recommendations for TMA diagnosis. Although FRC is a valuable correlate of schistocyte levels, it is typically used to highlight the need for manual smear review, and thus may provide value in tandem with the RBC-diff. A robust comparison of the RBC-diff schistocyte counts and FRC was not possible in this study because the primary clinical hematology analyzers at the MGH and BWH do not routinely record FRC values.

### Impact of inflammation on anemia in children: a cross-sectional study [^1157JwUj]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The high prevalence of iron deficiency found in this study, associated with elevated Alpha-1 Acid Glycoprotein, demonstrates the importance of using acute phase proteins that act as markers of inflammation. Alpha-1 Acid Glycoprotein is considered the most reliable indicator of chronic inflammation and may take several days to reach peak levels after the onset of inflammation. Therefore, because it produces a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of inflammation, it should be assessed whenever possible. The high prevalence of inflammation can be explained by the fact that data collection occurred shortly after the period of social isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to an increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods among children.

It has already been well reported in the literature that ferritin correlates directly with inflammatory markers, as we have seen, being, on the one hand, a promoter and, on the other, a regulator of inflammation. The positive link between IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-y, TNF-α, hs-CRP and ferritin shows that inflammatory markers can induce their expression. It has been demonstrated that TNF-α and IL-1β work in synergy with IL-6, raising ferritin concentration. This cascade of events promotes iron retention in the liver and macrophages, resulting in anemia. In 2020, a WHO publication proposed that iron deficiency based on ferritin concentrations should be assessed in conjunction with evaluating positive acute phase reactant proteins, such as hsCRP and Alpha-1 Acid Glycoprotein.

Anemia and iron deficiency can compromise children's growth and neuropsychomotor development. Low hemoglobin levels can be associated with changes in Growth Hormone (GH) secretion, caused by inhibition of its protein synthesis, and thus its low sensitivity to the production of IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor type 1), which can interact negatively with the GH/IGF-1 axis and compromise nutritional status.

As pointed out in this study, in addition to hs-CRP, RDW was significantly associated with anemia, reflecting the involvement of iron. The assessment of changes in erythrocyte biology, provided by the degree of anisocytosis of RDW, shows the morpho structural changes resulting from nutritional deficiencies and the inflammatory process. In addition, high RDW values represent an important prognostic biomarker for short- and long-term diseases resulting from dysregulation of erythrocyte homeostasis, triggering metabolic imbalances such as increased oxidative stress and Inflammation.

### Predictive role of red blood cell distribution width and hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio for mortality in patients with COPD: evidence from NHANES 1999–2018 [^114usJdE]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

At present, the specific mechanism underlying the association between RDW, HRR, and mortality remains unclear. As far as we know, the underlying mechanism mainly includes the following aspects: Firstly, research showed that high RDW levels are associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory status. Oxidative stress exerts a significant impact on erythrocyte homeostasis and survival. Consequently, it is plausible that oxidative stress serves as an additional underlying biological mechanism contributing to the elevation of RDW, possibly by accelerating red cell turnover. This, in turn, contributes to the association between anisocytosis and pathological conditions in humans. Inflammation has the potential to influence iron metabolism and bone marrow function, thereby impeding the maturation of erythrocytes induced by erythropoietin. As a result, immature red blood cells are released into circulation, disrupting the clearance process and leading to an increase in RDW. Secondly, elevated RDW is associated with various comorbidities in patients with COPD, such as right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and CVD. The presence of these comorbidities also contributes to an increased risk of mortality in patients with COPD. Other mechanisms that may contribute to increased mortality include hypoxemia, poor nutritional status, and association with exacerbations of COPD. Furthermore, studies have confirmed that hemoglobin levels are associated with the prognosis of patients with COPD, and anemia is associated with adverse outcomes in these patients. Low hemoglobin levels serve as crucial indicators of inflammation processes. HRR is a combined index calculated from hemoglobin and RDW. Therefore, HRR can also reflect the association between these two indicators and COPD. Naturally, additional studies will be required to validate these findings in the future.

### Red blood cell distribution width as a predictive marker for coronary artery lesions in patients with Kawasaki disease [^114ea4z9]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW), which is a marker of variation in the size of circulating erythrocytes (anisocytosis), is routinely measured in clinical practice as part of the complete blood count (CBC). Traditionally, RDW is used in the differential diagnosis of anemia. In 2007, Felker et al. first discovered that an increase in RDW is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. Growing interest has been expressed in the clinical value of RDW. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that a higher RDW is a prognostic factor for various cardiovascular system diseases, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery ectasia, and congenital heart disease. However, studies on the relationship between RDW and CALs in patients with KD are limited, and these studies mainly focus on the RDW coefficient of variation (RDW-CV). RDW-CV is calculated by dividing the standard deviation (SD) of red blood cell (RBC) volume by mean erythrocyte volume and multiplying by 100% to express the result as a percentage. Because information might be lost by expressing RDW relative to MCV, Hoffmann et al. proposed that future studies on the prognostic value of RDW should focus on RDW-SD. Tonelli et al. suggested that RDW-SD may be more useful as a prognostic marker than RDW-CV in the general population. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between RDW, including RDW-CV and RDW-SD, and CALs in patients with KD.

### Clinical factors contributing to age-related gait dysfunction in older adults [^111uSggr]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

In nursing care prevention, it is important to analyze the factors that contribute to the transition from independent to assisted walking during the loss of mobility in older adults. However, the risk factors for age-related loss of independent ambulation are not well defined. We reported a relationship between anisocytosis, a condition where red blood cells are of different size, and the walking prognosis in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture as a clinical indicator associated with aging. Anisocytosis is evaluated as the red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW), which increases with age as it reflects inflammation, and we considered the existence of senescence-associated chronic inflammation as a pathological condition that links hematological aging, which has no direct relationship with walking function, to physical function. Although the relationship between anisocytosis and sarcopenia is not known, RDW has also been reported to be associated with fallsand lower limb physical function, and we considered it an important factor in the analysis of factors that determine assisted walking in older adults. The center of gravity balance associated with abnormal posture is also important for walking function. Recently, the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), which is the distance from the C7 plumb line from the center of C7 to the posterior edge of the upper sacral endplate, has been used as a parameter for evaluating standing sagittal plane balance in the field of spinal surgery, and its association with the risk of falls in older adults has also been reported. To our knowledge, no studies have analyzed geriatric walking dysfunction, including endogenous aging, skeletal muscles, and postural abnormalities, from a bird's eye view.

To reduce the risk of falls in older adults, it is important to prevent dependence on walking aids by maintaining muscle strength, and knowledge of the risk factors can help formulate preventative measures and is valuable in geriatric research on the musculoskeletal system.

In this study, we analyzed the clinically relevant factors for ambulatory device aid from the perspectives of nutrition, body composition, and postural abnormalities between independent older adults and those requiring assisted walking, based on their ambulatory status, to help prevent long-term frailty.

### Breast implants as a preventive factor [^116uvwFW]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

After a large number of patients with silicone breast implants worldwide had been evaluated [2, 9], it was concluded that such implants were not carcinogenic. This allowed for experimentation with rats to determine the benefits and potential risks associated with implants. By means of a high-precision monitor, temperature measurements were obtained from 100 silicone-implanted rats. These measurements then were divided into various groups to compare the reaction of their implanted and nonimplanted mammary glands at different hormone levels. The temperature measurements were analyzed and compared. Dysthermia was detected in the skin area immediately overlying the implant. The results also demonstrated that at high hormone levels, implants act as neutralizing agents. By contrast, glandular alterations with severe signs of anisocytosis and anisokoryosis were observed in nonimplanted glands.

### Association of lymphopenia with risk of mortality among adults in the US general population [^112vRJzQ]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Multiple-Parameter Immune Status

In those participants without established inflammatory comorbidities, the use of CRP level as a marker for inflammatory risk in the general population is now well established and is associated with adverse outcomes and response to therapy independently of clinical factors. Other parameters of immune activation, including interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin 1β, are also associated with disease risk, but the extent to which these markers represent separate vs overlapping upstream mechanisms is incompletely understood. Multiple groups, including our own, have identified relatively strong associations between RDW and clinical outcomes in a variety of populations. An elevated RDW may reflect chronic inflammation, ultimately leading to altered iron homeostasis and erythropoietin resistence. Associations between RDW and interleukin 6 have been demonstrated in heart failureand in participants with human immunodeficiency virus infection, and RDW was associated with tumor necrosis factor in those with sepsis.

This is, to our knowledge, the first description of the complex associations among ALC, RDW, CRP level, and survival in the general population. We found that the risks associated with these abnormal IH parameters are not only independent of, but possibly synergistic with, each other. This observation could be consistent with a conceptual model in which an adverse inflammatory status, when severe and/or protracted, leads to end-organ effects, such as anisocytosis and/or lymphopenia, before disease incidence. Thus, the elevated risk associated with multiple IH abnormalities may reflect a more severe immune phenotype, and if so, our data suggest these high-risk participants can be identified before the clinical onset of disease by closer examination of routine blood indices. Alternatively, the mechanisms driving these IH abnormalities may be multiple hits affecting immune, neuroendocrine, and/or hematologic function, which together impair resilience against disease. Additional studies are therefore needed to ultimately determine the drivers of IH dysfunction and its role in survival among the general public.

### The cytologic features of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma and olfactory neuroblastoma [^117DspGZ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rare, aggressive malignancy of the sinonasal tract. Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is an uncommon neuroectodermal tumor of the superior nasal cavity. Upon examining these lesions, a broad differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated round cell tumors must be considered. The cytologic features of SNUC and ONB have been rarely reported. We searched our cytology files for cases of SNUC and ONB and assessed the following: cellularity, architecture, cytoplasm, cell size, nuclear contours, nucleoli, chromatin, anisonucleosis/anisocytosis, mitotic activity, background, and nuclear crush. Seven cases of SNUC produced hypercellular smears with a single-cell-predominant pattern. Cells were intermediate-sized with irregular nuclear contours and small nucleoli. Nuclear crush and mitotic figures were noted. The background exhibited naked nuclei and karyorrhectic debris. Of 7 cases, 6 (86%) exhibited vacuoles or extracellular lumina. The 10 cases of ONB exhibited cellularity, cellular arrangement, and chromatin similar to SNUC. In contrast, ONBs demonstrated fibrillary cytoplasm and smooth nuclear contours; mitotic figures were generally absent. Homer Wright rosettes were encountered in 9 cases (90%). We believe that in the appropriate clinical context, a specific cytologic diagnosis should be possible.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^115gs2r8]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD, evaluation, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^114FcXEi]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.
