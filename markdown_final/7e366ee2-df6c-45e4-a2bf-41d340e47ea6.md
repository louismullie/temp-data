Lab work for post menopausal women, hormones

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about laboratory evaluation of reproductive hormones in postmenopausal women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and when hormone testing is actually indicated. Then, I should verify which hormones to order and why, including FSH, estradiol, and when to add androgens. Next, I will examine assay selection and pre-analytical factors that can distort results. After that, I need to interpret expected postmenopausal ranges and common pitfalls. Finally, I will integrate special scenarios like osteoporosis, androgen excess, and menopausal hormone therapy monitoring, and close with a practical algorithm and key takeaways anchored to guidelines and high-quality data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indications for testing, because I should not jump to ordering hormones reflexively in postmenopausal women. Diagnosis of menopause is primarily clinical, based on 12 months of amenorrhea in the appropriate age range, and laboratory confirmation is reserved for uncertain cases such as after hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy, atypical presentations, or when symptoms are discordant with expected status, so I need to ensure I am not over-ordering tests that won't change management [^117YKLfm] [^111fQFew] [^115z9tT1]. Hold on, I should verify that FSH alone is insufficient; indeed, FSH has substantial overlap across menopausal stages and should be interpreted with estradiol and clinical context, and a single value can be misleading, so repeating measurements is often prudent when the diagnosis is uncertain [^116psjq3] [^117GPcpR].

> Next, I will now examine which hormones to order and why. FSH and estradiol are the core tests when menopausal status is uncertain, with FSH typically elevated and estradiol low in postmenopause, but I need to remember that estradiol becomes very low and often undetectable, so assay performance at low concentrations matters greatly for interpretation [^117YKLfm] [^117ED91R]. Wait, let me verify the role of LH; while LH also rises, it adds limited incremental diagnostic value beyond FSH and estradiol in this context, so I should avoid reflexively ordering LH unless there is a specific endocrine differential in mind [^117YKLfm]. I should also confirm that AMH is not useful for diagnosing menopause; although AMH declines with ovarian reserve, it is not validated to diagnose menopause and should not be ordered for that purpose in routine care [^1171gWdY].

> I need to check assay selection and pre-analytical factors next, because poor methodology can easily misclassify patients. For estradiol, I should prefer high-sensitivity LC-MS/MS assays when available, given their superior specificity and performance at very low postmenopausal concentrations, and I should avoid relying on older immunoassays that cross-react and over- or under-estimate low values; the CDC HoSt program underscores the need for standardized, traceable methods in this range [^117ED91R] [^111rzcTG]. For testosterone, I should double-check that routine immunoassays are unreliable in women; LC-MS/MS is the reference method, and I should avoid salivary testosterone given poor standardization and correlation issues, even though it might seem convenient [^112bNA7k] [^112atGtM]. Hold on, I should verify timing; although diurnal variation is less pronounced for testosterone in women than men, morning sampling and, when relevant, follicular-phase timing for pre-menopausal comparisons remain good practice to reduce noise, and fasting samples are reasonable when assessing metabolic comorbidity concurrently [^113ZrDBB].

> Let me think about expected postmenopausal ranges and how to interpret them. I initially recalled a commonly cited estradiol reference of ≤ 20–30 pg/mL for untreated postmenopausal women, but wait, I should verify whether more sensitive assays revise that downward; contemporary LC-MS/MS data suggest a mean around 3.9 pg/mL with a 95% CI up to about 10.7 pg/mL, so values in the teens or higher should prompt me to reconsider assay validity, concurrent estrogen exposure, or analytic interference [^111rzcTG]. I should confirm that estrone predominates after menopause due to peripheral aromatization, and that estradiol is largely intracrine at very low circulating levels, which helps explain why modest immunoassay error can be clinically misleading in this range [^111V7SX2] [^1136jwzZ]. For FSH, I need to ensure I interpret values in the context of age and assay; while levels above about 25–40 IU/L are commonly seen in the late menopausal transition, there is overlap and no single cutoff cleanly separates stages, so repeating FSH with estradiol improves diagnostic confidence [^116xD4wk] [^116psjq3].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with androgen excess features such as new-onset hirsutism, acne, or virilization after menopause; I should not dismiss these as "normal aging". In that scenario, I need to order total testosterone with LC-MS/MS when possible, plus DHEA-S, androstenedione, SHBG, prolactin, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, because postmenopausal androgen excess has a different differential that includes adrenal and ovarian tumors, and testosterone values above about 5 nmol/L warrant imaging and specialist referral [^112bNA7k] [^114LepQc] [^111jUCQF]. Hold on, I should verify that gonadotropins can be suppressed in severe androgen excess from non-PCOS pathology, which can help distinguish tumor-related etiologies from PCOS-like phenotypes in this age group [^114LepQc].

> Next, I should review osteoporosis and skeletal health, because many postmenopausal women warrant evaluation beyond sex steroids. I need to ensure baseline labs include CBC, CMP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH, phosphate, and a 24-hour urine calcium after vitamin D repletion and on a stable calcium intake, with additional secondary-cause testing guided by history and initial results; bone turnover markers can be considered in select cases but are not routinely required [^113cwAjQ] [^113V4CKK]. Let me verify vitamin D targets; maintaining 25-hydroxyvitamin D at or above 30 ng/mL is recommended in patients with osteoporosis, acknowledging inter-assay variability and the need for standardization when interpreting results [^1141FgRx] [^112NrruM]. I should also confirm indications for DXA; BMD testing is indicated for women aged 65 and older and for younger postmenopausal women with risk factors, with repeat testing intervals individualized to risk and treatment status [^111yY78C] [^112yHZ4U].

> I will now examine menopausal hormone therapy scenarios, because testing indications shift when exogenous hormones are involved. Before initiating systemic MHT, I should confirm menopausal status clinically and, if uncertain, use FSH and estradiol to support the diagnosis, recognizing that a single set of labs can be misleading and that repeating measurements improves accuracy [^117YKLfm] [^117GPcpR]. Hold on, I should verify that thrombophilia testing is not recommended to guide MHT decisions in the general population; indeed, major guidelines advise against routine thrombophilia testing for MHT decision-making except in select high-risk family contexts, so I should avoid ordering such panels reflexively [^11675YNj] [^113zPaJW]. For local vaginal estrogen, I need to check whether systemic absorption meaningfully raises estradiol; contemporary data suggest that low-dose vaginal estradiol generally results in post-treatment serum estradiol in the single digits to low teens pg/mL, though assay choice and individual factors like BMI influence results, so I should interpret any modest rise with caution and in clinical context [^114xCsSw] [^111rzcTG].

> Let me consider special populations and edge cases so I don't miss important exceptions. In women with prior hysterectomy or endometrial ablation, I should wait at least three months after surgery before interpreting endocrine markers, and I must rely on FSH and estradiol rather than bleeding patterns to infer menopausal status, often requiring repeat sampling to avoid misclassification [^117GPcpR]. In breast cancer survivors or those being considered for adjuvant endocrine therapy, I should confirm menopausal status serially with estradiol and gonadotropins when relevant, because chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea does not guarantee ovarian quiescence and AIs can stimulate ovarian function if not truly postmenopausal [^113PGLfS] [^113aydzK]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said AMH helps here; I should correct that — AMH is not validated to define menopause and should not be used for this purpose in clinical decision-making [^1171gWdY].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidelines. First, confirm clinical menopause from menstrual history and age; if uncertain, obtain FSH and estradiol using high-quality assays, repeating if results are equivocal or discordant with symptoms, and interpret in the context of age and assay method rather than relying on a single cutoff [^117YKLfm] [^117ED91R]. Second, if androgen excess is suspected, add total testosterone by LC-MS/MS, DHEA-S, androstenedione, SHBG, prolactin, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, with a low threshold to image when testosterone exceeds about 5 nmol/L or when virilization is present [^112bNA7k] [^114LepQc]. Third, if evaluating for osteoporosis or high fracture risk, obtain the recommended skeletal health labs and arrange DXA as indicated, integrating secondary-cause testing based on clinical clues [^113cwAjQ] [^111yY78C]. Finally, if considering MHT, confirm menopausal status clinically, avoid routine thrombophilia testing, and counsel on risks, benefits, and the need for periodic reassessment of ongoing therapy [^11675YNj] [^1169oVcS].

> Key takeaway, and let me double-check that I am not overstating anything: hormone testing in postmenopausal women is context-specific; FSH and estradiol are most useful when menopausal status is uncertain, and results must be interpreted with attention to assay methodology and repeated when ambiguous, while testosterone and related androgens are reserved for suspected androgen excess and should be measured with LC-MS/MS when possible to avoid misclassification [^117YKLfm] [^117ED91R] [^112bNA7k]. I need to ensure I avoid low-value tests such as routine AMH for menopause diagnosis, salivary steroid measurements, and thrombophilia panels for MHT decisions in the general population, and I should integrate skeletal health evaluation and individualized MHT risk–benefit discussions into comprehensive care plans [^112atGtM] [^113cwAjQ] [^11675YNj].

For postmenopausal women, **FSH and estradiol are the primary labs** to confirm menopause and guide therapy [^117YKLfm]; FSH rises (> 25–30 IU/L) and estradiol falls (< 20–30 pg/mL) as ovarian function ceases [^116xD4wk] [^111rzcTG]. Testosterone and DHEA-S are measured only if **androgen excess** is suspected (hirsutism, virilization) [^112bNA7k] [^1144gQ9Y]. Routine LH, progesterone, or AMH is not recommended for menopause diagnosis or routine monitoring [^117YKLfm]. Use **LC-MS/MS assays** for low-level estradiol/testosterone when results will alter management, and interpret all results in clinical context [^117ED91R] [^112bNA7k].

## Primary hormones measured

Key characteristics of primary reproductive hormones:

| **Aspect** | **Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)** | **Estradiol (E2)** | **Luteinizing hormone (LH)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Physiological role | FSH drives follicular development; postmenopause, loss of ovarian feedback elevates FSH [^114zEhmh] | Estradiol is the principal premenopausal estrogen; postmenopause, ovarian E2 production ceases and circulating levels drop sharply [^111V7SX2] | LH triggers ovulation; postmenopause, LH rises with FSH due to loss of ovarian feedback [^116wPWdP] |
| Typical postmenopausal levels | FSH > 25–30 IU/L; levels vary by assay and individual factors [^116xD4wk] | Generally < 20–30 pg/mL; many women have undetectable to ~10 pg/mL with sensitive assays [^111rzcTG] | Elevated, often similar to FSH, but less specific for diagnosis |
| Clinical utility | Elevated FSH with low estradiol supports the diagnosis of menopause; repeat testing improves accuracy [^117YKLfm] [^117GPcpR] | Low E2 with elevated FSH confirms menopause; helps assess estrogen deficiency and guide therapy [^notfound] | Not routinely measured; may be used to clarify atypical cases or suspected pituitary disease [^113PGLfS] |

## Additional hormones measured selectively

### Testosterone

- **Physiological role**: Testosterone declines gradually with age in women; postmenopause, levels are lower but not zero [^113xW3KT].
- **Typical postmenopausal levels**: Total testosterone ~15–70 ng/dL (0.5–2.4 nmol/L); free testosterone ~1–8 pg/mL (0.03–0.28 pmol/L).
- **Clinical utility**: Measure only if androgen excess is suspected (hirsutism, virilization); use LC-MS/MS for accuracy [^112bNA7k] [^113ZrDBB].

---

### Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S)

DHEA-S reflects adrenal androgen production and **declines with age**; measure when androgen excess is suspected, particularly with elevated testosterone or clinical signs [^111jUCQF].

---

### Progesterone

Progesterone is low or undetectable postmenopause due to absent ovulation; **routine measurement is not indicated** and should be reserved for suspected residual ovarian activity or ovarian tumors [^113WVzrX].

---

### Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)

AMH reflects ovarian reserve and declines to undetectable levels postmenopause; **not recommended for menopause diagnosis** or routine monitoring [^113Xzijd] [^115PhA7R].

---

## Clinical indications for hormone testing

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended hormones** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Confirm menopause | FSH, estradiol | Elevated FSH and low estradiol confirm ovarian failure [^111rzcTG] |
| Suspected androgen excess | Testosterone, DHEA-S | Identify hyperandrogenism and guide evaluation for tumors or PCOS [^112bNA7k] |
| Evaluate estrogen deficiency | Estradiol | Assess severity and guide hormone therapy decisions [^notfound] |
| Monitor hormone therapy | Estradiol (± FSH) | Ensure therapeutic levels and compliance [^111LvVj1] |

---

## Assay methods and interpretation

- **Assay selection**: Use LC-MS/MS for low-level estradiol/testosterone when results will change management; immunoassays can be inaccurate at low concentrations [^114xCsSw] [^112bNA7k].
- **Interpretation**: Always interpret results in clinical context; single values may be misleading, and repeat testing improves accuracy [^117YKLfm] [^117GPcpR].

## Summary of key recommendations

- **FSH and estradiol**: Primary tests to confirm menopause and assess estrogen deficiency [^notfound].
- **Testosterone and DHEA-S**: Measure only if androgen excess is suspected [^notfound].
- **LH, progesterone, AMH**: Not routinely recommended for menopause diagnosis or monitoring [^notfound].
- **Assay selection**: Prefer LC-MS/MS for low-level estradiol/testosterone when results will alter management [^112bNA7k].

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^111rzcTG]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Textbooks report peak normal levels of serum estradiol as ≤ 20 to 30 pg/mL in postmenopausal women; however, these values were established in older studies with less specific assays, such as RIAs, and should be revised with values from studies using more specific and sensitive assays with less cross-reactivities. Here we reviewed the systemic estradiol levels that we believe would best represent those of normal, untreated, postmenopausal women. Mean estradiol levels from those studies were used to calculate a mean basal level (3.9 pg/mL), with the range of basal estradiol levels for the normal, untreated postmenopausal woman found to be undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL using the 95% CI from the highest published SD (± 3.4). Thus, we propose a more current, sensitive mean level of circulating estradiol in normal, untreated women to range from undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL, which we believe to be more accurate than the well-accepted earlier level of ≤ 20 to 30 pg/mL; yet it is still only an estimate.

An important principle is that assay methods for serum estradiol assessment need to be standardized to be able to accurately, systematically, and consistently measure the low levels of estradiol in postmenopausal women. A single estradiol standard that can be traceable for each biological fluid in which estradiol is measured is needed, although some of the larger commercial laboratories have made strides to overcoming this obstacle. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Laboratory/Manufacturer Hormone Standardization (HoSt) Program, endorsed by 14 medical societies, was initiated in 2014 to help provide more accurate and precise hormone measurements used in patient care and research. The program assesses laboratory methodology and performance by comparing laboratory's specimen measurements with those of their reference LC/MS/MS method. Progress towards developing accurate, sensitive, and specific assays to measure the very low levels of estradiol in postmenopausal women continues.

### The role of testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women: position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1129onmS]. Menopause (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To create an evidence-based position statement regarding the role of exogenous testosterone in postmenopausal women.

Design

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) enlisted a panel of clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of testosterone therapy to review the evidence obtained from the medical literature, compile supporting statements and conclusions, and reach consensus on recommendations. The document was reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Endogenous testosterone levels have not been clearly linked to sexual function in postmenopausal women. Published evidence from randomized controlled trials, although limited, indicates that exogenous testosterone, both oral and nonoral formulations, has a positive effect on sexual function, primarily desire, arousal, and orgasmic response, in women after spontaneous or surgically induced menopause. Data are inadequate to support recommending testosterone use for any other indication, including preserving or increasing bone mineral density, reducing hot flashes, increasing lean body mass, or improving well-being. Hirsutism and acne have been associated with testosterone therapy, but the actual risks are not well defined. It is not known whether testosterone therapy increases the risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, or thromboembolic events. There are few data regarding the safety and efficacy of testosterone therapy in women not using concomitant estrogen therapy or for the use of testosterone therapy for longer than 6 months. Clinically available laboratory assays do not accurately detect testosterone concentrations at the values typically found in women, and no testosterone level has been clearly linked to a clinical syndrome of hypoandrogenism or testosterone insufficiency.

Conclusions

Postmenopausal women with decreased sexual desire associated with personal distress and with no other identifiable cause may be candidates for testosterone therapy. Testosterone treatment without concomitant estrogen therapy cannot be recommended because of a lack of evidence. When evaluating a woman for testosterone therapy, recommendations are to rule out causes not related to testosterone levels (eg, physical and psychosocial factors, medications) and to ensure that there is a physiologic cause for reduced testosterone levels (eg, bilateral oophorectomy). Laboratory testing of testosterone levels should be used only to monitor for supraphysiologic levels before and during therapy, not to diagnose testosterone insufficiency. Monitoring should also include subjective assessments of sexual response, desire, and satisfaction as well as evaluation for potential adverse effects. Transdermal patches and topical gels or creams are preferred over oral products because of first-pass hepatic effects documented with oral formulations. Custom-compounded products should be used with caution because the dosing may be more inconsistent than it is with government-approved products. Testosterone products formulated specifically for men have a risk of excessive dosing, although some clinicians use lower doses of these products in women. Testosterone therapy is contraindicated in women with breast or uterine cancer or in those with cardiovascular or liver disease. It should be administered at the lowest dose for the shortest time that meets treatment goals. Counseling regarding the potential risks and benefits should be provided before initiating therapy.

6.7 Gonadotropins

Measurement of serum gonadotrophins may be useful in the evaluation of androgen excess particularly if menstrual cycle is affected but have greater diagnostic utility in severe androgen excess as a useful adjunct in the interpretation of severe biochemical disturbances. As there is both positive and negative feedback of gonadotropins by oestradiol, gonadotropin values should be assessed in the context of oestradiol concentrations. Suppression of gonadotropins is typically seen in both pre‐ and postmenopausal women with severe androgen excess due to CAH or ACC and strongly suggests non‐PCOS pathology. In women with OHT, gonadotropins are typically not suppressed and even in VOTs levels are often observed in the postmenopausal range.

6.8 17‐hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP)

Although not androgenic itself, 17OHP is an important intermediate in the adrenal synthesis of glucocorticoids and androgens. Its measurement can therefore be useful alongside other steroid hormones in the differential diagnosis of androgen excess. Elevated 17OHP concentrations in combination with elevated androgens and low cortisol is a typical finding in CAH due to 21OHD, the latter being important to exclude in the work‐up of PCOS. Conversely, elevated 17OHP, androgen and cortisol concentrations may be suggestive of uncontrolled adrenal overproduction as observed in ACC. Most UK laboratories measure 17OHP using LC‐MS/MS (UK NEQAS, Table S5), with most users typically exhibiting good agreement (UK NEQAS, Figure S6). However, some laboratories still use immunoassay which can display both negative and positive bias relative to LC‐MS/MS ([UK NEQAS, Table S5]). Importantly, 17OHP concentrations are subject to diurnal variation and are higher in the luteal phase of the cycle, therefore they should ideally be measured in the early follicular phase and in the morning.

Recommendations:

Measure 17OHP in the biochemical work up of all patients being investigated for androgen excess, using an LC‐MS/MS assay where possible.
All results should be interpreted against evidence‐based reference ranges. These should be categorised into follicular‐ and luteal‐phases specific for pre‐menopausal patients.
For results > ULN of the follicular phase but < ULN of the luteal phase, we recommend collecting a second sample after 6 weeks to confirm the result. If the result remains elevated, the patient should be referred to Endocrinology for consideration of 17OHP testing after ACTH stimulation.

A summary of assay performance for several androgenic steroids and other associated parameters is shown in UK NEQAS Figure S7.

### How should postmenopausal androgen excess be evaluated? [^115Q1bxv]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Evidence of clinical and/or biochemical androgen excess connotes a unique differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women. Providers need to be able to discriminate between changes of the normal ageing process compared to potential pathology in older women. The evaluation and treatment of postmenopausal hirsutism and hyperandrogenism is reviewed. Androgen excess may have long-term negative health consequences and as such should be detected and treated.

### Workshop on normal reference ranges for estradiol in postmenopausal women, September 2019, Chicago, Illinois [^117ED91R]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) organized the Workshop on Normal Ranges for Estradiol in Postmenopausal Women from September 23 to 24, 2019, in Chicago, Illinois. The aim of the workshop was to review existing analytical methodologies for measuring estradiol in postmenopausal women and to assess existing data and study cohorts of postmenopausal women for their suitability to establish normal postmenopausal ranges. The anticipated outcome of the workshop was to develop recommendations for establishing normal ranges generated with a standardized and certified assay that could be adopted by clinical and research communities. The attendees determined that the term reference range was a better descriptor than normal range for estradiol measurements in postmenopausal women. Twenty-eight speakers presented during the workshop.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^113cwAjQ]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Secondary osteoporosis evaluation — postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: An appropriate medical evaluation is indicated in all women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and at high fracture risk, and because causes are common even in apparently healthy women, laboratory testing should be considered for all women with osteoporosis; simple tests provided useful information in 40 to 85% of women without clinical evidence of secondary osteoporosis. Baseline laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), phosphate, and a 24-hour urine collection for calcium, sodium, and creatinine; the 24-hour urine calcium collection must occur after vitamin D repletion and while on a reasonable calcium intake (1,000 to 1,200 mg/d) for at least 2 weeks. If medical history, exam, or initial labs suggest causes of secondary osteoporosis, additional laboratory evaluation is warranted and may include, but is not limited to, tests listed in Table 13; if the patient is receiving thyroid hormone or there is a suspicion for hyperthyroidism, thyroid-stimulating hormone should also be obtained, and celiac antibodies or serum/urine protein electrophoresis could also be obtained.

6 Laboratory Work Up of Suspected Androgen Excess

6.1 Patient Preparation

A review of historic laboratory values may show a rise in haemoglobin and haematocrit, with the development of erythrocytosis in severe cases of androgen excess. Steroid hormone concentrations are subject to diurnal variation and may fluctuate during the menstrual cycle. Concentrations typically peak in the morning at 8:00–10:00 h before falling in the afternoon and evening. Most evidence‐based reference ranges are derived from fasted, early morning follicular phase samples. Contrary to previous dogma, serum testosterone levels do not appear to fluctuate significantly during the menstrual cycle when measured by LC‐MS/MS methods. Conversely, luteal phase A4 levels appear to be significantly higher than those measured in the follicular phase. Although many patients with androgen excess have amenorrhoea or irregular cycles, where possible specimens should be collected during the follicular phase at 8:00–10:00 h following an overnight fast (Table 3).

Patients taking the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) will typically have reduced concentrations of circulating sex steroids due to a reduction in gonadotropin stimulation and increased SHBG concentrations. If undertaking biochemical investigations, the COCP should ideally be stopped for at least 3 months before sampling. Most testosterone immunoassay methods are also prone to cross‐reactivity with progestogenic components of the combined pill (e.g. norethisterone) that could over‐estimate testosterone concentrations.

Recommendations
Samples for the investigation of androgen excess should be collected in the morning (at 8:00–10:00 h) following an overnight fast. Where possible, samples should be collected in the early follicular phase, although this may not be feasible when the cycle is disrupted or absent.
Where appropriate, evidence based, age‐specific reference ranges should be adopted.
It is recommended that the COCP is stopped for a period of 3 months before undertaking biochemical investigations.

6.2 Testosterone

Validated, highly accurate tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) assays are recommended to measure serum total testosterone in women. However, across the UK, immunoassays remain the most accessible analytical technique (UK NEQAS, Table S1). Most T immunoassays display a bias relative to LC‐MS/MS in female samples, which may be either positive or negative depending on the manufacturer and can also be concentration‐dependent. Further data on the performance of several commercially available immunoassays in the United Kingdom compared to gold standard LC‐MS/MS are provided in the UK NEQAS, Figure S1. This bias has been attributed to poor standardisation, poor sensitivity and nonspecific cross‐reactivity. Bias may also exhibit temporal variation thereby reflecting reagent and calibrator reformulation (UK NEQAS, Figure S1). Conversely, LC‐MS/MS assays rely on purification and chromatography to minimise matrix effects, improve sensitivity and reduce analytical interference. The mass spectrometer adds additional specificity as detection is based on mass‐to‐charge ratio rather than antibody‐antigen reactions. Nevertheless, LC‐MS/MS has limitations and variation between methods has been attributed to differences in sample preparation and calibration. Thus, although measurement by LC‐MS/MS remains the reference standard, this may not be viable for many UK hospital laboratories.

Recommendations
Exclude the use of exogenous testosterone, for example, in postmenopausal women.
All results should be interpreted against evidence‐based reference ranges. These should be categorised as either age‐specific and/or pre‐ and post‐menopausal.
A diagnosis of biochemical hyperandrogenism should be evaluated with an index of free testosterone, particularly if total testosterone is normal in a patient with clinical androgen excess (see below).
Testosterone concentrations > 5 nmol/L 1 warrant further investigation including validation with LC‐MS/MS and follow‐up with ovarian and/or adrenal imaging as appropriate.
Testosterone concentrations that do not otherwise align with the clinical picture should be validated with LC‐MS/MS.

### Association of circulating progesterone with breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women [^113WVzrX]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Although it is well accepted that pharmacologic and physiologic concentrations of estradiol are associated with increased mitogenic activity of breast epithelial cells, the possible association with progesterone and breast cancer risk continues to be debated. Studies reporting increased breast cancer risk with menopausal hormone therapy use have primarily evaluated exogenous synthetic progestogen (progestin) use, rather than endogenous progesterone. In addition to possible progestational effects, the progestins used in these menopausal hormone therapy formulations can have antiandrogenic, proandrogenic, glucocorticoid concentration, and antimineralocorticoid effects, and are unlikely to provide direct evidence as to the potential association between endogenous progesterone and breast cancer risk. Mechanistic studies using cell culture, tissue culture, and preclinical models have associated progesterone with the development of breast cancer. To our knowledge, epidemiologic data are limited to 1 study reporting a null association between circulating progesterone levels and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women. This study was limited by assay technology, with almost 30% of samples having undetectable levels of progesterone. Thus, the association of the presence of endogenous progesterone with breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women has been infrequently studied primarily owing to low levels of circulating progesterone, inadequate sensitivity of available assays, and/or large sample volumes required for clinical assays.

It has been hypothesizedand laboratory studies have confirmed, that breast cancer promotion may be associated with relative concentrations of progesterone metabolites, in particular the cancer-inhibiting 4-pregnenes (eg, 3α-dihydroprogesterone [3αHP]) and cancer-promoting 5α-pregnanes (eg, 5α-dihydroprogesterone [5αP]) (Figure 1). While the adrenal glands are the primary source of progesterone in postmenopausal women, smaller amounts are produced in adipose tissue, and local production of 3αHP and 5αP metabolites may occur in the breast. To our knowledge, no epidemiologic studies have evaluated the role of circulating progesterone metabolites and breast cancer risk. To address this data gap, we evaluated prediagnostic serum pregnenolone, progesterone, and their major metabolites in association with postmenopausal breast cancer risk in a large, established case-cohort study within the Breast and Bone Follow-up to the Fracture Intervention Trial (B ~ FIT). Existing data on circulating estrogensenabled evaluation of the relative concentration of progesterone to estradiol with breast cancer risk, given that, along with estrogen, progesterone is generally regarded as a proliferative agent in the healthy breast.

Conclusions

Circulating sex hormone concentrations in postmenopausal women are strongly associated with several established or suspected risk factors for breast cancer, and may mediate the effects of these factors on breast cancer risk.

### Serum sex hormones and the risk of fracture across the menopausal transition: study of women's health across the nation [^114E5aSL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Sex steroid hormones have been linked to fractures in older women.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that hormones measured over the menopausal transition predict fractures.

Setting

Seven US clinical centers.

Subjects and Measurements

Two thousand nine hundred sixty women (average age, 46.4 ± 2.7 years) who had at least two repeat hormone measures and prospective information on fractures. Fasting serum was collected annually for hormone assays. Estradiol (E2) was measured with a modified direct immunoassay. FSH and SHBG were measured with two-site chemiluminescence immunoassays. Hormones were lagged (visit year -1) and transformed using log base 2. Incident fractures were ascertained at each annual visit. All medications including hormone therapy were time varying covariates. Discrete survival methods were used.

Results

Five hundred eight (17.2%) women experienced an incident fracture over an average follow up of 8.8 ± 4.4 years. Women who experienced an incident fracture were more likely to be white, report high alcohol intake and diabetes, and less likely to report premenopausal status at baseline. A woman whose log E2 was twice that of another had a 10% lower risk of fracture independent of covariates, relative risk (95% CI) = 0.90 (0.82, 0.98). Neither FSH nor SHBG were associated with fractures.

Conclusions

Serum E2 levels may help to identify women at higher risk of fractures over the menopausal transition. However, hormone assays must be standardized across laboratories for clinical implementation and further work is needed to define E2 thresholds.

### Executive summary of the stages of reproductive aging workshop + 10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging [^116xD4wk]. Menopause (2012). Medium credibility.

Late menopausal transition (Stage −1) — amenorrhea of 60 days or longer marks this stage, and quantitative criteria include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels greater than 25 IU/L in a random blood draw, approximating more than 40 IU/L in previously used urine-based standards. Based on menstrual calendar and hormonal changes, this stage is estimated to last, on average, 1 to 3 years, and symptoms, most notably vasomotor symptoms, are likely to occur. Researchers and clinicians should carefully evaluate the appropriate FSH value depending on the assay used.

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^114tzP6v]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Premenopausal HR+ invasive breast cancer — tamoxifen use, duration, and menopause assessment: Tamoxifen is the only option for premenopausal women in the absence of ovarian function suppression (OFS). Most premenopausal patients who take adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years are likely to benefit from extended therapy with additional tamoxifen or a transition to an AI depending on menopause status, and genomic testing can be used to help guide this decision. Premenopausal women may have cessation of menses with chemotherapy and should be treated with tamoxifen until it is clear that they will not resume ovarian function; although menopause may be assessed with laboratory studies, tamoxifen may affect FSH and these hormones fluctuate throughout perimenopause, and a single set of labs is therefore inadequate for confirming menopausal status.

### Can follicle-stimulating hormone be used to define menopausal status? [^116psjq3]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the ability of the level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to distinguish among premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women.

Methods

We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the second phase of the Massachusetts Women's Health Study (1986 to 1995), a population-based cohort of 427 premenopausal and perimenopausal women identified from the first phase of the Massachusetts Women's Health Study (1981 to 1986).

Results

Boxplots of FSH levels throughout the menopausal transition displayed considerable overlap. Logistic regressions and their resulting receiver operating characteristic curves further demonstrated that, although FSH is a statistically significant predictor of menopausal status, no single value of FSH is expedient for distinguishing premenopausal from perimenopausal or perimenopausal from postmenopausal women.

Conclusion

FSH alone is not an effective predictor of transition into the perimenopausal or postmenopausal period. Specifically, the frequently recommended FSH cutoff of 40 IU/L is inappropriate by itself for clinical determination of postmenopausal status.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112atGtM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Androgen testing — physiology, assay selection, and recommendations are summarized as follows: Testosterone is the key androgen to measure because it is the major circulating androgen, and levels are highest in the early morning and vary by ~25% around the mean; in ovulatory women, levels reach a midcycle zenith. Considerable evidence supports that the bioactive portion of serum testosterone is the free testosterone, and the serum free (or bioavailable) testosterone level is more often elevated in hirsute women than the total testosterone level and is more sensitive than total testosterone in detecting excess androgen production; the reason for this greater diagnostic sensitivity is that hirsute women commonly have a relatively low level of sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG). The automated immunometric assays available in most hospital laboratories are generally not suitable to accurately measure testosterone in women, although some direct radioimmunoassays and chemiluminescence assays in specialty laboratories provide results comparable to the new generation of liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry methods. Salivary testosterone correlates with serum-free testosterone but values diverge widely between laboratories, so we recommend against this methodology, and we also do not recommend measurements of urinary testosterone (testosterone glucuronide). There is no uniform laboratory standard for free or bioavailable testosterone levels, assay-specific results differ widely, and direct assay of serum-free testosterone is unreliable.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^116G3h9W]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Secondary amenorrhea — laboratory testing and hormone interpretation: Pregnancy as a mechanism for secondary amenorrhea must be the first consideration, and false negative urinary pregnancy tests are plausible; checking blood levels of human chorionic gonadotropin may be preferred in appropriate clinical settings. In normo-ovulatory women, serum E2 levels fluctuate from early follicular phase values often in the range of 30–50 pg/mL to peak preovulatory levels in the range of 150–300 pg/mL, whereas in FHA circulating E2 is more in the menopausal range (< 30 pg/mL) with gonadotropins in the normal to low normal range; LH is often disproportionately lower than FSH in FHA, while disproportionately elevated LH relative to FSH is not uncommonly encountered in PCOS. For ovarian reserve markers, disproportionately elevated AMH is commonly encountered in PCOS, whereas undetectable AMH is consistent with decreased ovarian reserve and is observed in POI; such markers may be useful but are frequently not necessary and should be interpreted with caution. Hyperprolactinemia is a recognized mechanism, and checking prolactin levels must be included in the initial workup of not just of secondary amenorrhea.

### Does place of birth influence endogenous hormone levels in Asian-American women? [^115Lhw1j]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In an effort to explain the international differences in breast cancer incidence rates, a number of investigators have compared hormone levels in healthy Asian and Caucasian women, with most focusing on differences in oestrogen levels and a few examining androgens or androgen precursors. However, these studies could not distinguish the role of genetic differences from the effects of an Asian lifestyle on endogenous hormone levels. By limiting this study to women of Asian descent in the US, we sought to isolate the influence of lifestyle alone. Our main finding was that androgens, particularly DHEA, were lower in Western-born Asian women; this was true in both pre- and postmenopausal women. Moreover, in postmenopausal women, the androgens tended to be highest among the least westernised women and declined as the degree of westernisation increased. For the oestrogens, levels between Asian- and Western-born women were not significantly different in pre- or postmenopausal women, and no clear patterns according to degree of westernisation were observed. In premenopausal women however, oestrogens were lowest in the least westernised women. To the extent that hormone levels among women in our extreme categories of westernisation reflect those of the Asian and Caucasian women that have historically been studied, the small number – 15 and 26 women in the least and most westernised groups, respectively – provided limited power to explore possible differences between them.

The extensive literature on ethnic differences in endogenous oestrogens is mixed. A number of factors may have contributed to this inconsistency, the most important being the dramatic improvement in assay methodology over the time these studies were conducted. Before the 1990s, little attention had been paid to the performance of steroid hormone assays within the normal range, and problems with assay precision and accuracy could have obscured small but consequential differences. Since then, a number of studies have assessed laboratory assay reproducibility. Most demonstrate that variability is not negligible from one batch to the next even in the same laboratory, and rigorous quality control efforts must be implemented to ensure the reliability of results. Other reasons for inconsistencies across studies may relate to specimen collection, with samples ranging from a single urine or blood draw to multiple collections over a 24 h period. Finally, comparisons across studies are complicated by study designs in which women were not representative of the target populations.

### Estrone is a strong predictor of circulating estradiol in women age 70 years and older [^1136jwzZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Importance

After menopause, estradiol (E2) is predominately an intracrine hormone circulating in very low serum concentrations.

Objective

The objective of this work is to examine determinants of E2 concentrations in women beyond age 70 years.

Design and Setting

A cross-sectional, community-based study was conducted.

Participants

A total of 5325 women participated, with a mean age of 75.1 years (± 4.2 years) and not using any sex steroid, antiandrogen/estrogen, glucocorticoid, or antiglycemic therapy.

Main Outcome Measures

Sex steroids were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Values below the limit of detection (LOD; E2 11 pmol/L [3 pg/mL] were assigned a value of LOD/√2 to estimate total E2.

Results

E2 and estrone (E1) were below the LOD in 66.1% and 0.9% of women, respectively. The median (interdecile ranges) for E1 and detectable E2 were 181.2 pmol/L (range, 88.7–347.6 pmol/L) and 22.0 pmol/L (range, 11.0–58.7 pmol/L). Women with undetectable E2 vs detectable E2 were older (median age 74.1 years vs 73.8, P = 0.02), leaner (median body mass index [BMI] 26.8 kg/m2 vs 28.5, P < .001), and had lower E1, testosterone and DHEA concentrations (P < .001). A linear regression model, including age, BMI, E1, and testosterone, explained 20.9% of the variation in total E2, but explained only an additional 1.2% of variation over E1 alone. E1 and testosterone made significant contributions (r2 = 0.162, P < .001) in a model for the subset of women with detectable E2.

Conclusions

Our findings support E1 as a principal circulating estrogen and demonstrate a robust association between E1 and E2 concentrations in postmenopausal women. Taken together with prior evidence for associations between E1 and health outcomes, E1 should be included in studies examining associations between estrogen levels and health outcomes in postmenopausal women.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^1144gQ9Y]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction and Methodology

Androgen excess is defined as clinical or biochemical evidence of increased production of androgenic steroids in women. It is observed in up to 10% of women of reproductive age and less commonly in postmenopausal women. Androgen excess typically manifests clinically as hirsutism or acne, but more severe and prolonged exposure can lead to overt virilisation, including clitoromegaly, deepening of the voice, female pattern hair‐loss (FPHL) or erythrocytosis. Most adolescents and women of reproductive age who present to secondary or tertiary care with androgen excess will have underlying polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, other primary underlying pathologies must be excluded in a subset of patients harbouring red flag clinical features. These include severe biochemical disturbances, rapidly progressive symptoms or signs or presentation in the postmenopausal phase of life. This cohort of patients have increased likelihood of underlying neoplastic ovarian, adrenal or pituitary disease, or occasionally monogenic disorders of insulin signalling or androgen metabolism, compared to those with milder disturbances in the PCOS range. A detailed clinical history, targeted physical examination and careful interrogation of the pattern and severity of biochemical disturbances are critical to rationalise the requirement and strategy for further biochemical, radiological and, where appropriate, genetic investigations. Although androgen excess in women with PCOS is closely correlated with adverse metabolic health outcomes throughout their life course, severe biochemical disturbances or overt virilisation are rarely observed in PCOS. Therefore, a systematic diagnostic approach is required to investigate patients with typical red flag signs and symptoms.

### Is this woman perimenopausal? [^115z9tT1]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Perimenopause is a time of transition for women at midlife. Women want to know whether they are starting this change and physicians need to know the accuracy of a clinical examination in identifying perimenopausal women. These women should be counseled about alleviating climacteric symptoms, using contraception, and preventing diseases such as osteoporosis.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of self-assessment, symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests in diagnosing women in perimenopause.

Data Sources

English-language articles that presented data relevant to diagnosis of perimenopause were identified in a MEDLINE search from 1966 to 2001. References of these articles and other publications also were reviewed.

Study Selection

Cross-sectional or longitudinal studies of women aged 40 years or older that used the definition of perimenopause as 3 to 11 months of amenorrhea or irregular periods, included a premenopausal control group, and reported a clinical examination finding. Of 1246 articles identified, 16 studies were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed articles for quality (L. A.B. and C.M.S.). Discrepancies were resolved by a third author (K.N.).

Data Synthesis

The prior probability of perimenopause is directly related to a woman's age. After considering age, the following yielded the greatest positive likelihood ratios (LRs+): self assessment of going through the transition (LR+ range, 1.53–2.13), symptoms of hot flashes (LR+ range, 2.15–4.06), night sweats (LR+ 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.63–2.21), vaginal dryness (LR+ range, 1.48–3.79), high follicle-stimulating hormone levels (LR+ 3.06; 95% CI, 2.06–4.54), and low inhibin B levels (LR+ 2.05; 95% CI, 0.96–4.39). Self-assessment of perimenopausal status had the smallest negative LR (range, 0.18–0.36).

Conclusions

No one symptom or test is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out perimenopause. Clinicians should diagnose perimenopause based on menstrual history and age without relying on laboratory test results.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: update on assessing ovarian function [^115PhA7R]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The improved sensitivity and automation of AMH assays has strengthened the role of serum AMH levels as a marker for the FOR. Assessment of serum AMH levels in the prediction of ovarian response to COH and age of menopause, being either natural or iatrogenic, may be useful. However, limitations have also surfaced. For proper interpretation of AMH levels, more knowledge is needed on endogenous and exogenous factors that regulate AMH expression. Studies further suggest that heterogeneity exists in AMH trajectories, which may hamper application in personalized patient counseling. Over the last years, the number of assays for AMH measurement has increased. However, differences exist between assays. An international standard for AMH is therefore urgently needed to establish assay-independent cutoff values.

### Selection of appropriate biomarkers to monitor effectiveness of ovarian function suppression in pre-menopausal patients with ER + breast cancer [^111LvVj1]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Estradiol

Estradiol (E₂) levels ≥ 40 pg/mL are commonly used to establish pre-menopausal status in the absence of regular menstrual cycles for GnRH agonist trial eligibility. Measurements of E₂ are also useful as a marker for endocrine sensitivity, as well as to monitor compliance/adherence and refine treatment regimens. Finding E₂ levels within the pre-menopausal range in women receiving GnRH agonist treatment is indicative of incomplete ovarian function suppression per the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines. Typically, an E₂ level ≤ 10 pg/mL is consistent with menopausal status with ovarian function suppression, and an appropriate level at which an AI can be utilized. Inadequate ovarian function suppression may reduce the impact of AI.

It should be noted that E₂ monitoring guidelines are not currently available, so the optimal degree of ovarian suppression is undetermined. Although individual clinical laboratories that assay E₂ levels have established acceptable reference ranges, these may differ between laboratories and may not be consistent between assay methods. The gold standard gas chromatography/mass spectrometry measurement of extracted E₂ is more sensitive and specific, but is more expensive and tedious to perform than the immunoassay which may cross-react with other steroids since estradiol is not extracted nor purified. Accuracy and reliability of E₂ assays are known to falter particularly at the low concentration ranges. Timing of blood sampling may also affect the results of E₂ assays, since E₂ exhibits a diurnal cycle such that early morning peaks may differ from a random sample during the day. Although there are no standards regarding timing for estradiol assessment in the real-world setting, the SOFT Estrogen Substudy measured E₂ at 3, 6, and 12 months.

### Impact of menopause and diabetes on atherogenic lipid profile: is it worth to analyse lipoprotein subfractions to assess cardiovascular risk in women? [^116Ym58h]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly coronary artery disease (CAD), is a major cause of death in women, who develop it about 10 years later then men. Traditional risk factors are present at a high frequency in individuals with CAD but are lacking in a not negligible proportion. Risk calculators usually underestimate the real CVD risk in women and their CAD episodes are frequently fatal.

Hypercholesterolemia is the major driven cause for CVD in both sexes and its treatment has been associated with significant reductions in morbidity and mortality. Postmenopausal women tend to deteriorate lipid profile that becomes more atherogenic than their premenopausal counterpart. After menopause, total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) usually increase, and these changes are accompanied by a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and an increase in triglycerides (TG). In addition to these major lipid abnormalities, also modifications in size and density of these lipoprotein particles are expected to happen after the loss of ovarian hormonal production. This partially explains the increased cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women, particularly among those with an earlier onset of menopause.

Hyperglycemia contributes to the elevation of cardiovascular risk of populations. Increasing prevalence rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) have been attributed to aging, modern lifestyle and obesity epidemic, which predisposes to several metabolic disturbances linked by the insulin resistance. In men and women with DM a typical dyslipidemia was described, characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of HDL-c and increased proportion of small-dense LDL particles, known to be more prone to oxidation. Elevated glucose levels have also been associated with dysfunctional lipoprotein subfractions, contributing to a more atherogenic lipid profile in both sexes. Despite sharing these lipid abnormalities with the male sex, the diabetic woman has a more aggressive form of CAD and is more susceptible to death from CVD, mainly coronary events, suggesting that her lipid profile should be even more deleterious. These observations indicate the need of additional quantitative and/or qualitative laboratory procedures — such as determinations of lipoproteins subfractions — to clarify some sex-related differences.

Diagnosis in perimenopause and menopause

1.3 Although there are currently no diagnostic criteria for PCOS in perimenopausal and menopausal women, we suggest that a presumptive diagnosis of PCOS can be based upon a well-documented long-term history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years. The presence of PCO morphology on ultrasound would provide additional supportive evidence, although this is less likely in a menopausal woman (2|⊕⊕○○).

1.3 Evidence

The natural history of PCOS through perimenopause into menopause is poorly studied, but many aspects of the syndrome appear to improve. Ovarian size, follicle count, and anti-Mullerian hormone levels (a marker of antral follicle count) decrease with normal aging in women with and without PCOS. However, the decline in ovarian volume and follicle count may be less in women with PCOS than in normal women. Similarly, androgen levels decline with age in women with and without PCOS (serum T declines ∼50% between the ages of 20 and 40 y), with reports of improved menstrual frequency in PCOS, although there is little evidence to support a decline in serum T associated with the menopause transition per se.

The diagnosis of PCOS in postmenopausal women is more problematic than in adolescents. There are no age-related T cutoffs for the diagnosis. Furthermore, T assays used to diagnose hyperandrogenemia in women are imprecise, even for assays utilizing tandem mass spectrometry technology. Nevertheless, supporting studies have shown that peri- and postmenopausal mothers of women with PCOS with a history of irregular menses tended to have features of PCOS as well as metabolic abnormalities, implying that aspects of the PCOS phenotype may persist with age. Very high T levels and/or virilization may suggest an androgen-producing tumor in postmenopausal women.

1.3 Values and preferences

We recognize that the diagnosis of PCOS in postmenopausal women is problematic but feel that it is unlikely that a woman can develop PCOS in the perimenopause or menopause if she has not had symptoms earlier. We recognize that there are few prospective studies to document the natural history of ovarian function with age in women with PCOS.

2.0 Associated morbidity and evaluation

Cutaneous manifestations

2.1 We recommend that a physical examination should document cutaneous manifestations of PCOS: terminal hair growth (see hirsutism guidelines, Ref.), acne, alopecia, acanthosis nigricans, and skin tags (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^112yHZ4U]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Key points — postmenopausal osteoporosis assessment and monitoring state that bone mineral density (BMD) testing is indicated for all postmenopausal women with risk factors for low BMD or fracture, with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the preferred technique. For untreated postmenopausal women at low fracture risk, repeat DXA testing is not useful until at least 5 years have passed unless rapid bone loss is anticipated. Fracture risk is especially high in the first 2 years after an incident fracture, and the routine use of biochemical markers of bone turnover in the evaluation of patients with osteoporosis is not recommended.

Hysterectomy and endometrial ablation — women who have undergone these procedures cannot be staged by menstrual bleeding criteria and can only be assessed using supportive criteria (endocrine markers of ovarian aging). It is recommended that clinicians and researchers wait at least 3 months after surgery to assess endocrine status, as pelvic surgeries may transiently raise FSH levels; in most cases staging will be limited to classifying premenopausal or postmenopausal status. A single sample for FSH and estradiol may be ambiguous or misleading, and at least one repeated measurement is often required.

### Follicle-stimulating hormone: more than a marker for menopause: FSH as a frontier for women's mental health [^1147GP47]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The average current life expectancy entails that women will spend over one-third of their lives in menopause. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in women begin to increase roughly six years before the final menstrual period, reaching a menopausal plateau that is nearly 14 times the level of FSH observed in men, a profound sex-specific difference. A promising new body of work examines whether these age-associated increases in FSH contribute to multiple menopause-related conditions, including psychiatric morbidities. This paper highlights research advances showing the potential role of FSH and its underlying mechanisms in mental health conditions for women in menopause and makes the call for more research.

### Risedronate sodium (atelvia) [^115uMAxE]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Test Findings:

Parathyroid hormone: The effect of Atelvia 35 mg once-a-week and risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily on parathyroid hormone was evaluated in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. At week 52, in subjects with normal levels at baseline, PTH levels greater than 65 pg/mL (upper limit of normal) were noted in 9% of subjects receiving Atelvia 35 mg once-a-week and 8% of subjects receiving risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily. In subjects with normal levels at baseline, PTH levels greater than 97 pg/mL (1.5 times the upper limit of normal) were seen in 2% of subjects receiving Atelvia 35 mg once-a-week and no subjects receiving risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily. There were no clinically significant differences between treatment groups for levels of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium.

Daily Dosing with risedronate sodium immediate - release 5 mg tablets

The safety of risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg once daily in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multinational trials of 3232 women aged 38 to 85 years with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The duration of the trials was up to three years, with 1619 patients exposed to placebo and 1613 patients exposed to risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and H2antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All women received 1000 mg of elemental calcium plus vitamin D supplementation up to 500 international units per day if their 25-hydroxyvitamin D3level was below normal at baseline.

1 Staging Experiences in Our Laboratory

1.1 Identifying an Assessment Tool

In 2019, we embarked on a series of studies examining risk for psychopathology (e.g. eating disorders, psychosis) across premenopause, perimenopause, and postmenopause in population‐based samples of women ages 40–62. We began by surveying the literature to identify commonly used and validated self‐report questionnaires of menopausal status that could be used in our initial pilot study. We had limited resources for this work, as we were adding a measure of menopausal status to an existing study of eating disorder risk in preadolescent/adolescent male twins that also assessed the twins' mothers, most of whom were in midlife. We were hoping to identify a commonly used questionnaire that could be integrated into our existing study protocol.

Our search revealed that most studies in our field relied on women's age, self‐identified status only, or a study‐specific questionnaire or interview to assess menopausal status (see Table 1). Few details were provided about questionnaire items, their psychometric properties, or the name of the scale/instrument, and in many cases, the assessment method was not described/reported or was unclear (see Table 1). We discovered the same issues in the broader menopause literature: study‐specific instruments and limited measure information. Ultimately, we were unable to identify a commonly used questionnaire for menopausal staging.

TABLE 1
Assessment methods for menopausal staging in eating disorder studies.

We therefore modified an existing questionnaire we found online (Perimenopause Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ); Johns Hopkins Medicine) that seemed to capture the STRAW+10 changes in cycle frequency and length. Because this questionnaire specifically focused on perimenopause (rather than premenopause, postmenopause), we added items to help identify women in all stages (e.g. dates of last three menstrual cycles; use of hormonal contraceptives or other medications including hormones; reproductive surgeries that could influence menstrual cycles).

If clinical concern persists, measure "Free testosterone blood level (calculated from total testosterone and SHBG or equilibrium dialysis)" and interpret branches "Free testosterone elevated" versus "Free testosterone normal", with the latter leading to "Re-evaluate if hirsutism progresses", and evaluation for androgen excess via "Androgen excess laboratory work-up†". Major disorders listed are "Polycystic ovary syndrome", "Nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia", "Cushing's syndrome", "Virilizing tumor", and "Hyperprolactinemia".

The incidence of all-cause mortality was 2.0% in the placebo group and 1.7% in the risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily group. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 24.6% in the placebo group and 27.2% in the risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions was 15.6% in the placebo group and 14.8% in the risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily group. The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than 10% of subjects were: back pain, arthralgia, abdominal pain and dyspepsia.

### Can we predict age at natural menopause using ovarian reserve tests or mother's age at menopause? A systematic literature review [^1171gWdY]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This review aimed to appraise data on prediction of age at natural menopause (ANM) based on antimüllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), and mother's ANM to evaluate clinical usefulness and to identify directions for further research.

Methods

We conducted three systematic reviews of the literature to identify studies of menopause prediction based on AMH, AFC, or mother's ANM, corrected for baseline age.

Results

Six studies selected in the search for AMH all consistently demonstrated AMH as being capable of predicting ANM (hazard ratio, 5.6–9.2). The sole study reporting on mother's ANM indicated that AMH was capable of predicting ANM (hazard ratio, 9.1–9.3). Two studies provided analyses of AFC and yielded conflicting results, making this marker less strong.

Conclusions

AMH is currently the most promising marker for ANM prediction. The predictive capacity of mother's ANM demonstrated in a single study makes this marker a promising contributor to AMH for menopause prediction. Models, however, do not predict the extremes of menopause age very well and have wide prediction interval. These markers clearly need improvement before they can be used for individual prediction of menopause in the clinical setting. Moreover, potential limitations for such use include variations in AMH assays used and a lack of correction for factors or diseases affecting AMH levels or ANM. Future studies should include women of a broad age range (irrespective of cycle regularity) and should base predictions on repeated AMH measurements. Furthermore, currently unknown candidate predictors need to be identified.

Bone mineral density (BMD) testing — indications and role note that testing of BMD is useful for screening and monitoring therapy in people at high risk for osteoporosis if evidence of bone loss would result in modification of therapy, with examples including postmenopausal women, patients with hyperparathyroidism or other bone disorders, and those being treated with medications associated with bone loss (e.g., glucocorticoids). A list of indications for BMD testing is shown in Table 10. Testing of BMD is the gold standard in diagnosing osteoporosis; however, not everyone has access to BMD.

### Estrogen deficiency in the menopause and the role of hormone therapy: integrating the findings of basic science research with clinical trials [^115SsQEC]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Menopause, defined by the cessation of menstrual cycles after 12 months of amenorrhea not due to other causes, is associated with significant hormonal changes, primarily a decrease in estrogen, androgen, and progesterone levels. This review delves into the effects of estrogen deficiency during the perimenopausal transition and postmenopause, integrating the findings of basic science with clinical trials. Here, we first outline the variation in endogenous estrogens before and after menopause, exploring both genomic and nongenomic actions of estrogen and its estrogen receptors throughout the body. Next, we detail the spectrum of menopausal symptoms, from acute vasomotor, urogenital, and psychological issues during perimenopause to chronic reproductive, cardiovascular, neurological, skeletal, dermatologic, immune, and digestive changes postmenopause. Finally, we evaluate the role of hormone therapy in alleviating these symptoms, weighing its benefits against known risks. Publicizing these findings and an accurate representation of the risks and benefits of estrogen replacement to our aging patients is fundamental to improving their care, quality, and even quantity of life.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1157rq8n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To update practice guidelines for the therapeutic use of androgens in women.

Participants

A Task Force appointed by the Endocrine Society, American Congress of Obestricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), European Society of Endocrinology (ESE), and International Menopause Society (IMS) consisting of six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

The Task Force commissioned two systematic reviews of published data and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials. The GRADE methodology was used; the strength of a recommendation is indicated by a number "1" (strong recommendation, we recommend) or "2" (weak recommendation, we suggest).

Consensus Process

Multiple e-mail communications and conference calls determined consensus. Committees of the Endocrine Society, ASRM, ACOG, ESE, and IMS reviewed and commented on the drafts of the guidelines.

Conclusions

We continue to recommend against making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency syndrome in healthy women because there is a lack of a well-defined syndrome, and data correlating androgen levels with specific signs or symptoms are unavailable. We recommend against the general use of T for the following indications: infertility; sexual dysfunction other than hypoactive sexual desire disorder; cognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic, or bone health; or general well-being. We recommend against the routine use of dehydroepiandrosterone due to limited data concerning its effectiveness and safety in normal women or those with adrenal insufficiency. We recommend against the routine prescription of T or dehydroepiandrosterone for the treatment of women with low androgen levels due to hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, surgical menopause, pharmacological glucocorticoid administration, or other conditions associated with low androgen levels because there are limited data supporting improvement in signs and symptoms with therapy and no long-term studies of risk. Evidence supports the short-term efficacy and safety of high physiological doses of T treatment of postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction due to hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Importantly, endogenous T levels did not predict response to therapy. At present, physiological T preparations for use in women are not available in many countries including the United States, and long-term safety data are lacking. We recommend that any woman receiving T therapy be monitored for signs and symptoms of androgen excess. We outline areas for future research. Ongoing improvement in androgen assays will allow a redefinition of normal ranges across the lifespan; this may help to clarify the impact of varying concentrations of plasma androgens on the biology, physiology, and psychology in women and lead to indications for therapeutic interventions.

### Update on medical and regulatory issues pertaining to compounded and FDA-approved drugs, including hormone therapy [^113qxRfQ]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

GUIDELINES FOR CBHT

The Endocrine Society, The North American Menopause Society, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, and International Menopause Society recommend against CBHT use by anyone without a medical condition preventing them from using FDA-approved HT.,- The FDA has also issued caution against compounded drug use. Concerns include inadequate evidence of efficacy and safety, variable purity and potency, and insufficient labeling.,- The FDA made a statement about CBHT (2008): "FDA is concerned that the claims for safety, effectiveness, and superiority that these pharmacy operations are making mislead patients, as well as doctors and other healthcare professionals. Compounded drugs are not reviewed by the FDA for safety and effectiveness. Patients who use compounded hormone drugs should discuss menopausal HT options with their healthcare provider to determine whether compounded drugs are the best option for their specific medical needs".

Some CBHT prescribers use salivary or serum testing of hormone levels for titration, but these tests are considered meaningless without pharmacokinetic data, and no RCT has correlated hormone levels in saliva or serum with outcomes. An FDA statement on saliva testing to titrate CBHT says, "Hormone levels in saliva do not accurately reflect the amount of hormones a woman has in her body for the purpose of adjusting hormone therapy dose levels. A woman's hormone levels change throughout the day and from day to day". None of the major menopause societies recommend using salivary testing to guide treatment; their treatment guidelines advise to prescribe the lowest effective dose of FDA-approved HT for menopausal symptom relief.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: update on assessing ovarian function [^117XA8LF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells of small, growing follicles in the ovary. Serum AMH levels strongly correlate with the number of growing follicles, and therefore AMH has received increasing attention as a marker for ovarian reserve. This review summarizes recent findings and limitations in the application of serum AMH in ovarian reserve assessment.

Evidence Acquisition

A PubMed search was conducted to find recent literature on the measurements and use of serum AMH as a marker for ovarian reserve.

Evidence Synthesis

Serum AMH levels are measured to assess the "functional ovarian reserve", a term that is preferred over "ovarian reserve", since AMH levels reflect the pool of growing follicles that potentially can ovulate. Serum AMH levels are used in individualized follicle-stimulating hormone dosing protocols and may predict the risk of poor response or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome but has limited value in predicting ongoing pregnancy. Serum AMH levels are studied to predict natural or disease-related age of menopause. Studies show that the age-dependent decline rates of AMH vary among women. The generalized implementation of serum AMH measurement has also led to an increase in diagnostic assays, including automated assays. However, direct comparison of results remains problematic.

Conclusion

Serum AMH remains the preferred ovarian reserve marker. However, the lack of an international standard for AMH limits comparison between AMH assays. Furthermore, little is known about endogenous and exogenous factors that influence serum AMH levels, which limits proper interpretation of AMH values in a clinical setting.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring: Serial BMD testing may be done to determine if or when to initiate treatment and to monitor the response; age-related bone loss occurs at an average rate of 0.5 to 1.0% per year, menopause-related bone loss begins 3 to 5 years before the last menstrual period and continues for 3 to 5 years after, occurring at 1 to 2% per year, and more rapid loss of 3 to 5% a year may occur in some women; one SD is about a 10% deviation from the young-adult mean, so a 10% bone loss will result in a decrease of about 1.0 T-score units, and serial monitoring is based on absolute BMD and not T-scores; for patients on treatment or near a fracture intervention threshold, BMD testing every 1 to 2 years is an option; in patients on treatment, stable or increasing BMD at the spine and hip indicates a satisfactory response, whereas if BMD decreases significantly, patients should be evaluated for noncompliance, secondary causes, or medications that might cause bone loss; facilities should determine their least significant change (LSC), with ISCD guidance of 30 patients in duplicate or 15 in triplicate, the LSC usually set at the 95% confidence limit for change, and if the difference exceeds the LSC the probability that it is real is greater than 95%.

### Reproductive hormones in relation to white matter hyperintensity volumes among midlife women [^116VtTUK]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

This study had several limitations. First, reproductive hormone concentrations were assessed once. It is notable that 99% of the women in this study were postmenopausal. Although reproductive hormones fluctuate dramatically over the menopause transition, they typically stabilize in postmenopause, rendering a single observation during this period of the lifespan more suitable compared to earlier in the lifespan. Future work can consider how trajectories of reproductive hormones over the menopause transition relate to cerebrovascular health later in life. Second, although this sample had some racial/ethnic diversity, future work should be conducted with more diverse samples, particularly including larger numbers of Asian and Latina women, so that any racial/ethnic differences in associations can be rigorously considered and to enhance the generalizability of findings. Participants had a relatively favorable CVD risk factor profile, due in part to recruitment of a portion of the study sample from a cohort that excluded women who smoked, had insulin‐dependent diabetes, or had clinical CVD; future work can consider these associations among women with a higher CVD risk factor burden. This sample was conducted among largely postmenopausal late midlife women; how endogenous reproductive hormones relate to WMHV at other points in the female lifespan or how these hormones relate to WMHV among men cannot be inferred from these data.

### Ovulation in a postmenopausal woman [^114ohprU]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the first documented case of ovulation in a postmenopausal woman.

Design

Case study.

Setting

University reproductive endocrinology and infertility clinic.

Patient(S)

A 57-year-old woman, who had been postmenopausal for 3 years and presented with breast tenderness and was found to have laboratory and ultrasound evidence of ovulation.

Intervention(S)

Laboratory evaluation and transvaginal ultrasound.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Ovulation in a postmenopausal woman.

Result(S)

Laboratory evaluations revealed estrogen and progesterone consistent with an ovulatory pattern. Ultrasound revealed a thickened endometrium and a corpus luteum, both of which resolved after menses.

Conclusion(S)

This is the first report of ovulation in a postmenopausal woman. This observation opens the door to new questions about the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in menopause as well as about ovarian senescence.

### Effect of sex hormones on coronavirus disease 2019: an analysis of 5, 061 laboratory-confirmed cases in south Korea [^113vFpN7]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Data from several countries have shown a male-biased sex ratio in COVID-19 mortality. In previous mice models, female hormones had a protective effect on mortality related to SARS-CoV infection. McCoy et al suggested that androgens, which may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell, were implicated in COVID-19 mortality. However, in our study, male sex was not an independent risk factor for mortality, and there was no significant association between HT use and the clinical outcomes of peri- and postmenopausal women. Although our study did not corroborate the protective role of female hormones against SARS-CoV-2 infection, further studies including emerging cases across several countries are required for determining the effects of sex hormones on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This study has several limitations. First, owing to the nature of HIRA data, it was impossible to investigate detailed patient information, such as smoking history, viral loads, laboratory results, and radiologic findings, which could influence the clinical outcomes. In addition, we could not evaluate the exact interaction between female sex hormone levels and clinical outcomes because of the limited laboratory data available. Second, we cannot rule out the possibility of the underestimation of the number of male patients owing to asymptomatic or mild infections. A cohort study of patients with subclinical manifestations is needed for determining the sex ratio of the overall SARS-CoV-2 infections. Third, because of the limited number of women who received HT, we could not fully evaluate the effect of sex hormones on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Moreover, it is difficult to determine whether the patient was using the prescribed medications using claims data, and thus, HT use was evaluated based on drug codes for HT. Fourth, the menopausal status of female patients could not be evaluated. However, considering that the mean age at menopause (49.3 ± 0.1 y) is relatively lower in Korea than in other countries, the patients included in the subgroup analysis may represent peri- and postmenopausal women.

### Is timing everything? A meeting report of the society for women's health research roundtable on menopausal hormone therapy [^111QyGbk]. Journal of Women's Health (2013). Low credibility.

The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR) is a national, nonprofit organization based in Washington DC that is dedicated to transforming women's health through science, advocacy, and education. For more than 10 years, women and the physicians who treat them have been concerned about the safety of menopausal hormone therapy, largely since the early termination of two large federally funded studies. Considerable confusion remains despite decades of accumulated evidence from observational studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses. In November 2012, SWHR convened 18 of the foremost experts within the field for a roundtable event to discuss the collective evidence related to the risks and benefits of hormone therapy. This report includes a synopsis of those discussions, the clinical statements that were generated and agreed upon, and the research recommendations suggested by the assembled experts.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^113PGLfS]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy — premenopausal patients and menopausal assessment: If premenopausal at diagnosis, the NCCN Panel recommended 5 years of tamoxifen alone (category 1) or tamoxifen with OFS (category 1) or OFS plus AI for 5 years (category 1). Patients premenopausal at diagnosis who become amenorrheic with chemotherapy may have continued estrogen production from the ovaries without menses, and menopausal status cannot be determined while receiving OFS. Because AIs can stimulate ovarian function, to assure a true postmenopausal status, serial assessment of circulating LH, FSH, and estradiol is mandatory when considering this subset for AI therapy; frequency of testing of estradiol and FSH/LH levels should be individualized.

### Selection of appropriate biomarkers to monitor effectiveness of ovarian function suppression in pre-menopausal patients with ER + breast cancer [^113aydzK]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Considerations for future trials

Based on the above discussion, we recommend that the primary endpoint of ovarian function suppression be measured by E₂ levels in breast cancer trials. Estradiol should be used since it most closely reflects ovarian function and is the most relevant hormone activating estrogen receptors in the breast (Fig. 1). The ASCO guidelines indicate that detection of premenopausal E₂ levels in women while on GnRH agonist therapy is a sign of incomplete ovarian suppression. Measurement of FSH and/or LH levels could be secondary endpoints. Resumption of menses regardless of hormone levels would indicate failure of therapy. The primary concern when evaluating any formulation is the potential for E₂ escape if the GnRH agonist formulation wears off at the end of the dosing period, before the next dose is scheduled. We suggest trials also checking E₂ levels towards the end of the dosing interval to confirm it is still suppressed. While in clinical practice it would be important to evaluate for the resumption of menses and/or cyclical fluctuations in climacteric symptoms, whether clinical trial procedures would include such assessments needs to be considered.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone for women in the peri-or postmenopausal phase [^115QVnUc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

During menopause a decreasing ovarian follicular response generally causes a fluctuation and eventual decrease in estrogen levels. This can lead to the development of various perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms (for example hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness). Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is one of the main precursors of androgens, which in turn are converted to testosterone and estrogens. It is possible that the administration of DHEA may increase estrogen and testosterone levels in peri- and postmenopausal women to alleviate their symptoms and improve general wellbeing and sexual function (for example libido, dyspareunia, satisfaction). Treatment with DHEA is controversial as there is uncertainty about its effectiveness and safety. This review should clearly outline the evidence for DHEA in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and evaluate its effectiveness and safety by combining the results of randomised controlled trials.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering DHEA to women with menopausal symptoms in the peri- or postmenopausal phase.

The databases that we searched (3 June 2014) with no language restrictions applied were the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS. We also searched conference abstracts and citation lists in the ISI Web of Knowledge. Ongoing trials were searched in the trials registers. Reference lists of retrieved articles were checked.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing any dose and form of DHEA by any route of administration versus any other active intervention, placebo or no treatment for a minimal treatment duration of seven days in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data after assessing eligibility for inclusion and quality of studies. Authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Twenty-eight trials with 1273 menopausal women were included in this review. Data could be extracted from 16 trials to conduct the meta-analysis. The overall quality of the studies was moderate to low with the majority of studies that were included in the meta-analysis having reasonable methodology. Compared to placebo, DHEA did not improve quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.34, P = 0.10, 8 studies, 287 women (132 from parallel and 155 from crossover trials), I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence; one trial of the nine that reported on this outcome was removed in a sensitivity analysis as it was judged to be at high risk of bias). DHEA was found to be associated with androgenic side effects (mainly acne) (odds ratio (OR) 3.77, 95% CI 1.36 to 10.4, P = 0.01, 5 studies, 376 women, I² = 10%, moderate quality evidence) when compared to placebo. No associations were found with other adverse effects. It was unclear whether DHEA affected menopausal symptoms as the results from the trials were inconsistent and could not easily be pooled to provide an overall effect due to different types of measurement (for example continuous, dichotomous, change and end scores). DHEA was found to improve sexual function (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.55, P = 0.01, 5 studies, 261 women (239 women from parallel trials and 22 women from crossover trials), I² = 0%; one trial judged to be at high risk of bias was removed during sensitivity analysis) compared to placebo. There was no difference in the acne associated with DHEA when comparing studies that used oral DHEA (OR 2.16, 95% CI 0.47 to 9.96, P = 0.90, 3 studies, 136 women, I² = 5%, very low quality evidence) to one study that used skin application of DHEA (OR 2.74, 95% CI 0.10 to 74.87, P = 0.90, 1 study, 22 women, very low quality evidence). The effects did not differ for sexual function when studies using oral DHEA (SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.35, P = 0.36, 5 studies, 340 women, I² = 0) were compared to a study using intravaginal DHEA (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.81, 1 study, 218 women). Test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 1.77, df = 1 (P = 0.18), I² = 43.4%. Insufficient data were available to assess quality of life and menopausal symptoms for this comparison. There were insufficient data available to compare the effects of DHEA to hormone therapy (HT) for quality of life, menopausal symptoms, and adverse effects. No large differences in treatment effects were found for sexual function when comparing DHEA to HT (mean difference (MD) 1.26, 95% CI -0.21 to 2.73, P = 0.09, 2 studies, 41 women, I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence that DHEA improves quality of life but there is some evidence that it is associated with androgenic side effects. There is uncertainty whether DHEA decreases menopausal symptoms, but DHEA may slightly improve sexual function compared with placebo.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1174zrG3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to considerations for hormone therapy, ES 2015 guidelines recommend to consider evaluating the baseline risk of breast cancer in patients considering hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms, and take this risk into consideration when advising for or against hormone therapy and when selecting type, dose, and route of administration.

### Menopause transition: annual changes in serum hormonal patterns over the menstrual cycle in women during a nine-year period prior to menopause [^113yF98E]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

To examine the hormonal characteristics of menstrual cycles in healthy women approaching menopause, serum hormone profiles were investigated annually in this longitudinal study of 13 healthy women between 4 and 9 yr before menopause and the year of the menopause. Serum FSH, LH, estradiol, progesterone, total inhibin, inhibins A and B, and prolactin were determined in blood samples collected annually three times weekly for 4 wk beginning with the onset of menses. Menstrual bleeding diaries covering this 4- to 9-yr period were also collected allowing the prospective identification of the final menstrual period. A change in serum hormone patterns was observed in cycles approaching menopause, exemplified by an increasing number of cycles of prolonged length with a prolonged follicular phase resulting in a failure to detect a luteal phase rise in serum progesterone within the 4-wk collection period. These prolonged cycles (designated B cycles based on a previous work) were analyzed separately and compared with the remaining ovulatory (D) cycles. No B cycles were identified in any women earlier than 27 cycles from menopause. The proportion of B cycles increased as menopause approached, reaching 62% in the last 10 cycles. The proportion of D cycles decreased accordingly. The B cycles during the initial 4-wk collection period were characterized by elevated FSH, LH, FSH/inhibin A and FSH/inhibin B ratios, and longer duration, although cycle length/subject was not significantly different presumably due to the small number of B cycles. The D cycles showed no changes in hormonal profiles over the 4- to 9-yr time period. These data indicate that there is a time-related change in the character of menstrual cycles as menopause approaches, with an increasing proportion of cycles observed with prolonged follicular phases that may either be delayed ovulatory cycles or anovulatory cycles. The increase in the proportion of B cycles with elevated early follicular phase FSH levels and low inhibin/FSH ratios toward menopause provides a basis for the apparent early increase in serum FSH and decrease in serum inhibins observed previously in studies of the menopause transition based on sampling confined to the follicular phase only. The data amplify and clarify current concepts of the endocrine basis of the menopause transition.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111QMrMq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

III. Clinical care of postmenopausal women

(11) Recommendations regarding full assessment of FSD before commencing testosterone therapy FSD including HSDD, FSAD, and orgasmic disorder/dysfunction have multiple etiologies including biopsychosocial factors such as neuroendocrine imbalance, physical ill health or disease, interpersonal difficulties, psychological distress, and sexually repressive cultural or religious values (Grade C). Treatments should follow this biopsychosocial model and include pharmacologic options (hormone therapies and other pharmacologic agents), psychotherapy, or multimodal treatments that combine both (Grade B).

(12) Recommendations regarding current testosterone therapy and postmenopausal women The only evidence-based indication for the use of testosterone in women is for the treatment of postmenopausal women who have been diagnosed as having HSDD after formal biopsychosocial assessment (Level I, Grade A). There is an unmet need for the provision and approval of testosterone treatments specific to women, formulated with the aim of approximating physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women (Expert Opinion). Where an appropriate approved female testosterone preparation is not available, off-label, prescribing of an approved male formulation is reasonable, provided hormone concentrations are maintained in the physiologic female range (Expert Opinion). Compounded "bioidentical" testosterone therapy cannot be recommended for the treatment of HSDD because of the lack of evidence for efficacy and safety, unless an authorized equivalent preparation is not available (Expert Opinion). In the absence of an available approved product, if a compounded product is needed, the compounding pharmacy should be compliant with purity of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Good Manufacturing Practice to meet industry standards for quality and safety. Dosing should be limited to achieving testosterone concentrations in the physiologic premenopausal range. Use of any testosterone preparation that results in supraphysiologic concentrations of testosterone, including pellets and injections, is not recommended (Expert Opinion). Should a trial of testosterone therapy be given for HSDD, a baseline total testosterone concentration should be measured before commencement, with a repeat level 3–6 weeks after treatment initiation (Level IIA, Grade C). Patients should be monitored for their clinical response to treatment and assessed for signs of androgen excess with a serum total testosterone level every 6 months, to screen for overuse (Expert Opinion). If no benefit is experienced by 6 months, treatment should be ceased (Level IB, Grade C).

### Combined effects of endogenous sex hormone levels and mammographic density on postmenopausal breast cancer risk: results from the breakthrough generations study [^115uQeTA]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Participants

Study subjects were identified from the BGS, a United Kingdom-based cohort study with over 113 000 participants designed to investigate breast cancer aetiology. Participants were initially recruited from mailing lists of supporters of the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer and volunteers from the general population who then nominated friends and family as potential participants. They completed a postal questionnaire and, if willing (91.7%), donated a blood sample, which were predominantly taken by general practitioner practices and posted to the study's laboratory on the same day. The baseline questionnaire consisted of 44 pages including comprehensive information on many breast cancer risk factors. Participants are contacted approximately every 3 years to collect follow-up information on breast cancer diagnoses and updated risk factor information. The study was approved by the South Thames Multicentre Research Ethics Committee and participants provided informed consent.

The BGS contains a nested case–control study for analyses, where data collection for the full cohort is not feasible. Cases are subjects newly diagnosed with a primary invasive or in situ breast cancer since study entry and ascertained by the time of the analysis. Diagnoses were generally initially self-reported on follow-up questionnaires and were then confirmed by cancer registry, general practitioner or pathology records. One control per case is randomly selected from subjects who have been breast cancer free for at least as long as the matched case, within strata of categories of year and age at study entry, ethnicity and the number of days (0–1, 2, ⩾3) between blood draw and receipt of the blood sample in the laboratory, the latter to account for the effect of processing delays on measured plasma sex hormone concentrations. The current analysis is restricted to Caucasian women who were postmenopausal at blood draw, not on postmenopausal HT or other hormonal treatments at the time of blood draw or in the period 3 months before, and for whom we were able to retrieve non-symptomatic mammograms before diagnosis for cases and before the date a control reached a matched case's diagnosis age. Being postmenopausal was defined as having had a natural menopause at least 2 years before blood draw at cohort entry or having had a bilateral oophorectomy, or, for those whose menopausal status was unknown, having reached age 55 (current smokers) or 56 (never/former smokers) years at cohort entry. The inclusion criteria for this analysis led to incomplete matched case–control pairs, as a consequence of which we analysed the data incorporating the matching based on strata of selection to maintain statistical power.

### Sharing the multidisciplinary clinical approach to peri-and postmenopausal women: a Delphi consensus among Italian gynecologists, endocrinologists, and cardiologists for an integrated and optimal approach to clinical practice [^116vwoJx]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The critical phase of perimenopausal period is marked by a reduction in estrogen levels, leading to various clinical issues (vasomotor and neurodegenerative symptoms, increased osteoporosis risk and cardiovascular risk). These complex clinical scenarios pose challenges to clinicians in providing the right support for diagnosis and treatment. A group of Italian cardiologists, endocrinologists, and gynecologists conducted a survey among expert colleagues to assess consensus on controversial issues and best practices for screening and treating peri- and postmenopausal women.

Methods

The Delphi methodology was used to analyze responses from a qualitative expert panel comprising 25 cardiologists, 25 endocrinologists, and 25 gynecologists, selected nationwide. Two consecutive questionnaires were proposed between February and May 2023. Agreement among experts was assessed following the Delphi method as developed by the RAND Corporation.

Results

The results of this Delphi Consensus have been shared by the leading scientific societies: Italian Society of Cardiology, Italian Society of Endocrinology, Italian Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics, and Italian Hospital Obstetricians Gynecologists Association.

Conclusions

The experts highlighted comorbidities and hormone deprivation as crucial clinical problems to be evaluated in perimenopausal women, requiring investigation from cardiovascular and endocrinologic perspectives to assess cardiovascular risk, involving the use of BMI, standard blood samples, endocrine-metabolic tests, and lifestyle assessment, particularly in women with higher cardiovascular and metabolic risks candidates for hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The experts also agreed on the benefits of HRT in improving lipid metabolism and reducing insulin resistance, thereby mitigating the metabolic risks associated with menopause. However, this therapy should be tailored considering individual women's comorbidities and thrombotic risk.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^113xW3KT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal Transition and Circulating Testosterone

Menopausal transition is associated with a decrease in the number of antral follicles and ovarian volume, as well as a decline in serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH) as a marker for antral follicle count and ovarian reserve. When the number of antral follicles and ovarian granulosa cells decrease, estradiol levels decline and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels increase. Menopause, the last spontaneous menstruation, occurs on average at age 51 years when circulating estradiol has decreased to a level insufficient to stimulate the endometrium to grow and then shed. During this period, menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes, sweating, and sleep problems, are common and associated with the gradual decline in estradiol.

In contrast to the decrease in estradiol, circulating levels of testosterone decline as a consequence of age-related, but not menopause-related, reductions in secretion by both the adrenal gland and the ovary. This means a 50% reduction in testosterone in women aged 40–45 compared with women in the 18–24 age group. In premenopausal women, about 50% of circulating testosterone arises from direct secretion from the ovary and the adrenal gland, in equal amounts, under pituitary control of luteinizing hormone (LH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), respectively. The remaining 50% of testosterone is produced from peripheral conversion by ovarian and adrenal inactive androgen precursors (A4, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEAS). Testosterone is further converted in target tissues to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5α reductase, and together these hormones constitute the 2 classical bioactive androgens that bind to the androgen receptor. In postmenopausal women, a larger part of these active androgens is synthesized in peripheral tissue from DHEA within the cell according to the concept of intracrinology.

### Association of vaginal estradiol tablet with serum estrogen levels in women who are postmenopausal: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114xCsSw]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

There are very few data to help define a safe systemic estradiol concentration after menopause. Serum estrogen levels are associated with individual participant characteristics, including body mass index (BMI). A systematic review found that common vaginal estrogen treatment regimens are associated with posttreatment mean estradiol concentrations ranging from 8.6 to 30 pg/mL (to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 3.671), depending on the type of estrogen product and type of assay used to measure the hormone. A meta-analysis of breast cancer risk with endogenous hormone concentrationsused data from 9 studies with median serum estradiol levels ranging from 5.9 to 36.5 pg/mL and suggested greater risk for breast cancer with higher serum estradiol or estrone levels. In a randomized clinical trial of 7290 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, those randomly assigned to placebo with baseline serum estradiol concentrations higher than 2.7 pg/mL had a significantly greater risk (6.8-fold higher) for breast cancer during 4 years compared with those with baseline concentrations lower than or equal to 2.72 pg/mL. Also, randomization to raloxifene treatment significantly reduced breast cancer risk compared with placebo, but only in the subset of women with baseline estradiol levels higher than 2.72 pg/mL. These results suggest that concentrations above this threshold may be associated with an increased risk for breast cancer.

We hypothesized that use of vaginal estrogen in women with bothersome vaginal symptoms would not lead to a significant increase in serum estradiol concentrations at 12 weeks. To test this hypothesis, we compared change in serum estradiol, estrone, and sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations during 12 weeks of treatment in the active vs placebo groups of a randomized clinical trial of a vaginal estradiol tablet for treatment of postmenopausal vaginal discomfort. We included SHBG because lower levels have independently been associated with cardiovascular risk, and because oral estrogen treatment has been shown to increase SHBG levels. Because of the high level of imprecision and nonspecificity of estradiol and estrone immunoassays in the low range prevalent among women during menopause, we measured these hormones using a highly sensitive liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry assay, certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Hormone Standardization (HoSt) Program.

### Vitamin D supplementation after the menopause [^113DcT9j]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a selective literature search of the years 2018 through to February 2020 in PubMed, using the search terms 'vitamin D', 'menopause', 'postmenopausal women', 'body composition', 'metabolic syndrome', and 'aging'. In addition, secondary searches for specific topics were performed. In this review we will discuss different clinical conditions related to low vitamin D levels in postmenopausal women, some of which may have slowly developed years before menopause onset. This narrative review also included publications of crucial importance that pre-date 2018. To facilitate text reading, serum 25(OH)D results in nmol/L were converted to ng/ml, being 2.5 nmol/L = 1 ng/mL. In addition, 1 µg of calcifediol is equivalent to 60 IU.

Prior to the examination of the various clinical conditions prevalent in postmenopause that may be related to vitamin D, the problem of serum vitamin D measurement should be mentioned. Despite being much facilitated in the 21st century, there are important variation coefficients observed among methods, even within a particular method there may be a high degree of variation. There is a need for 25(OH)D immunoassay methods in each center to be calibrated against standardized liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry or international reference preparations.

### What does anti-Müllerian hormone tell you about ovarian function? [^117FNVCb]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

The measurement anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is leading to new insights into ovarian function. AMH is produced by small growing follicles, thus is distinct from ovulation and is a step closer to being able to assess the true ovarian reserve. AMH is measureable from birth to near the menopause, with a peak in the mid-20s. Changes in adolescence are likely to lead to new understanding of ovarian maturation at puberty. AMH is becoming a routine test in assisted conception, reflecting a decline in the primordial follicle pool during the later reproductive years, and also identifying women at risk of over-response. Thus, its relationship with the ovarian reserve changes from an inverse one in the first quarter century to a positive one thereafter as both decline in parallel. AMH does not vary significantly across the menstrual cycle, but it is not fully gonadotrophin-independent, showing delayed changes consistent with the site of production from smaller growing follicles. There is considerable interest, both professional and public, in its ability to predict remaining reproductive lifespan, which clinically may be of value in the assessment of ovarian reserve following damage, for example postchemotherapy or ovarian surgery. AMH is markedly increased in polycystic ovarian syndrome and may be of diagnostic value. The considerable promise of AMH measurement is ahead of the robustness of the data in allowing clinical interpretation in most contexts, but it is clear that it will in the future offer novel opportunities for the assessment of ovarian function in health as well as disease.

### Risk for midlife psychosis in women: critical gaps and opportunities in exploring perimenopause and ovarian hormones as mechanisms of risk [^115Jkhrb]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Women show a heightened risk for psychosis in midlife that is not observed in men. The menopausal transition (i.e. perimenopause) and accompanying changes in ovarian hormones are theorized to account for this midlife increase in risk. This narrative review aims to empirically examine these theories by reviewing studies of midlife and perimenopausal psychosis risk in women and potential ovarian hormone mechanisms of effects. Clinical and pre-clinical studies examining the effects of midlife age, menopausal stage, and ovarian hormones across adulthood on psychosis risk were identified. Synthesis of this body of work revealed that the peak ages of midlife psychosis risk in women overlap with the age range of key menopausal stages (especially the perimenopausal transition), although studies directly assessing menopausal stage are lacking. Studies examining ovarian hormone effects have almost exclusively focused on earlier developmental stages and events (e.g. pregnancy, the menstrual cycle) and show increases in psychotic symptoms in women and female rats during periods of lower estradiol levels. Estrogen treatment also tends to enhance the effects of neuroleptics in females across species at various reproductive phases. Initial data are promising in suggesting a role for menopausal stage and ovarian hormones in psychosis risk. However, critical gaps in our knowledge base remain, as there is a tendency to rely on indirect and proxy measures of menopausal status and hormones. Opportunities for future research are discussed with the goal of increasing research in this critical area of women's health.

### Ovarian reserve testing: a user's guide [^11491hvy]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Ovarian reserve is a complex clinical phenomenon influenced by age, genetics, and environmental variables. Although it is challenging to predict the rate of an individual's ovarian reserve decline, clinicians are often asked for advice about fertility potential and/or recommendations regarding the pursuit of fertility treatment options. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state-of-the-art of ovarian reserve testing, providing a guide for the obstetrician/gynecologist generalist and reproductive endocrinologist. The ideal ovarian reserve test should be convenient, be reproducible, display little if any intracycle and intercycle variability, and demonstrate high specificity to minimize the risk of wrongly diagnosing women as having diminished ovarian reserve and accurately identify those at greatest risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation prior to fertility treatment. Evaluation of ovarian reserve can help to identify patients who will have poor response or hyperresponse to ovarian stimulation for assisted reproductive technology. Ovarian reserve testing should allow individualization of treatment protocols to achieve optimal response while minimizing safety risks. Ovarian reserve testing may inform patients regarding their reproductive lifespan and menopausal timing as well as aid in the counselling and selection of treatment for female cancer patients of reproductive age who receive gonadotoxic therapy. In addition, it may aid in establishing the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome and provide insight into its severity. While there is currently no perfect ovarian reserve test, both antral follicular count and antimüllerian hormone have good predictive value and are superior to day-3 follicle-stimulating hormone. The convenience of untimed sampling, age-specific values, availability of an automated platform, and potential standardization of antimüllerian hormone assay make this test the preferred biomarker for the evaluation of ovarian reserve in women.

3.4 Virilising Ovarian Tumours (VOTs)

VOTs are predominantly benign tumours that can present at any age, with 25% presenting postmenopausally. The prevalence of VOTs in post‐menopausal (PM) women with hyperandrogenism (HA) is around 2.7%. Approximately 5%–8% of ovarian tumours are hormonally active and 1% secrete androgens. Androgen‐secreting tumours derive from sex‐cord and stromal cells of the ovary (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Classification of primary ovarian tumours (VOTs): Primary ovarian tumours can be grouped according to the WHO classification into epithelial and non‐epithelial. Androgen‐secreting tumours typically arise from sex‐cord and stromal cells of the ovary.

Figure 3

The diagnostic approach should be divided into routine or urgent pathways based on the presence or absence a number of central clinical and biochemical factors. Baseline biochemical work up: FSH, LH, oestradiol, 17‐hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), androstenedione (A4), sex hormone‐binding globulin (SHBG) and prolactin (PRL). FSH, follicle‐stimulating hormone; LH, luteinising hormone; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; ONDST, overnight dexamethasone suppression test; PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome; PET, positron emission tomography; UFC urinary free cortisol.

Sertoli‐Leydig Cell Tumours (SLCT) are the most common type in premenopausal women, whereas Leydig cell tumours (LCT) are the most common pathology after the menopause. Granulosa cell tumours (GCT) account for 70% of pure sex cord tumours and are the commonest cause of hyperoestrogenism.

### Assay variation confounds the diagnosis of hypovitaminosis D: a call for standardization [^112NrruM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Endemic hypovitaminosis D contributes to osteoporosis development. However, variation in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) measurement is reported and confounds the diagnosis of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency. This report emphasizes the marked variability observed in serum 25OHD measurements between laboratories. Initially, postmenopausal women had serum 25OHD determinations: 42 in laboratory A, 20 in laboratory B. Their mean (sem) serum 25OHD concentrations were 46 (2.1) and 21 (2.3) ng/ml in laboratories A and B, respectively. Furthermore, there was little overlap in serum 25OHD among these clinically similar individuals. Specifically, 17% of those measured in laboratory A but 90% in laboratory B were below an arbitrary threshold value of 32 ng/ml. Subsequently, serum was obtained from 10 healthy adults. Two aliquots from each individual, one of which was spiked with 20 ng/ml 25OHD, were sent to six laboratories. Substantial variability was noted between these six laboratories. The mean serum 25OHD concentration ranged from 17.1–35.6 ng/ml. Similarly, the mean increase produced by spiking with 20 ng/ml ranged from 7.7–18.0 ng/ml. In conclusion, 25OHD assays yield markedly differing results; whether an individual is found to have low or normal vitamin D status is a function of the laboratory used. If the medical community is to make progress in correcting widespread hypovitaminosis D, 25OHD measurement must be standardized.

### Menopause and the workplace: consensus recommendations from the menopause society [^111SpHtu]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Menopause is a natural life transition experienced by half the world's population. Women aged 50 years and older are the fastest growing demographic group in many countries, making essential contributions to the workforce. Although menopause is a universal and natural life transition, the symptom experience is highly variable among women. Some women may experience few or no symptoms, whereas others may be bothered by moderate to severe symptoms for a decade or longer, which can adversely affect quality of life, relationships, job satisfaction, and career advancement. Indeed, menopause symptoms, including vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms, as well as sleep and mood disturbances are associated with multiple adverse work outcomes. Studies to date have demonstrated that these adverse work outcomes related to menopause symptoms include a compromised ability to work, reduced work productivity, absenteeism, and even loss of employment or an early exit from the workforce. Further, the relationship between menopause symptoms and work may be bidirectional, with certain aspects of the work environment being linked with a greater menopause symptom burden, such as insufficient restroom facilities, unpredictable or long work hours, the inability to take breaks, and confined or crowded workspaces. Thus, workplace solutions may need to be tailored based on women's individual needs, the work environment, and the type of work. The Menopause Society, in conjunction with an expert panel of medical and legal experts and women's health advocates, has developed a set of consensus recommendations that challenges employers to create a menopause-supportive workplace for their employees. These recommendations include, among other things, suggestions for employers to review policies and healthcare plans and benefits and to consider flexibility and accommodations that may be needed for some women with menopause symptoms. Guidance for women with menopause symptoms that affect them at work in terms of understanding their resources and empowering them to be self-advocates are also provided, as well as recommendations for what occupational health professionals should know and do for women with bothersome menopause symptoms in the workplace.

### Estradiol (Dotti) [^111V7SX2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, 2 estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to DOTTI nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for amenorrhea, more specifically with respect to evaluation for etiology, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, ES 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain the following laboratory tests as part of the initial endocrine evaluation in patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea:

- TSH, fT4

- prolactin

- LH, FSH

- estradiol

- anti-Müllerian hormone.

### Menopausal hormone therapy use among postmenopausal women… [^111nN6ud]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Annually, more than 1. 3 million women in the US transition into menopause. 1 Menopausal transition is associated with profound hormonal changes, which can be symptomatic in 80% of women, and these symptoms, including vasomotor, genitourinary, sleep difficulties, and cognition, can be severe in about 30% of women. 2 Vasomotor symptoms, which are episodes of profuse heat accompanied by sweating and flushing, cause anxiety and sleep disruption and tend to be the most lifestyle-limiting symptom in many women.
3. Of prescribed MHT during the 2017–2020 cycle, estrogen-only formulations accounted for
52. 8%, progestogen-only formulations for 10. 5%, combined estrogen and progestogen for
36. 1%, and combined estrogen and testosterone for 0. 6%.

There were drastic switches from using progestogen-only and combined estrogen and progestogen formulations to estrogen-only formulations after 2001 to 2002, but this trend reversed after the 2007–2008 cycle. These estimates remained similar when restricted to women 52 years and older. was observed across all age groups and for all MHT formulations, but the largest absolute increases were among younger postmenopausal women aged 50 to 59 years for transdermal administrations and combined estrogen and progestogen formulations. 26 In contrast, the present findings in the US context indicated that MHT use continued to decline among US women from 2009 to 2020, particularly among women aged 52 to 65 years.

MHT remains the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, and professional societies in North America recommend it primarily for managing vasomotor symptoms, genitourinary syndromes, and bone loss arising from menopause, though not for the prevention of coronary heart diseases or any other chronic conditions. 4 They also recommend starting MHT as early as possible before 60 years of age when the risk-benefit ratio is favorable, as well as using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to manage symptoms and tailoring MHT use to each woman with a periodic risk-benefit reassessment.

### USPSTF recommendation statement: hormone therapy after menopause… [^1126w15K]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Findings Although the use of hormone therapy to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal women is associated with some benefits, there are also well-documented harms. The USPSTF determined that the magnitude of both the benefits and the harms of hormone therapy in postmenopausal women is small to moderate. Therefore, the USPSTF concluded with moderate certainty that combined estrogen and progestin has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions for most postmenopausal women with an intact uterus and that estrogen alone has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions for most postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy. Many health outcomes potentially associated with the use of hormone therapy in postmenopausal women have been examined.

The USPSTF found convincing evidence that use of combined estrogen and progestin has a moderate benefit in reducing the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women and adequate evidence that it has a small benefit in reducing the risk of diabetes. Menopausal hormone therapy refers to the use of combined estrogen and progestin in women with an intact uterus, or estrogen alone in women who have had a hysterectomy, taken at or after the time of menopause. For this recommendation, the USPSTF considered evidence on the benefits and harms of systemic menopausal hormone therapy but not local formulations of hormone therapy, because these are not generally used for the primary prevention of chronic conditions. Evidence is limited whether the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy vary by age, race/ethnicity, or timing of initiation after menopause.

In the WHI trial, the test for trend by age group showed a statistically significant trend toward lower all-cause mortality among younger women assigned to estrogen alone but not women assigned to combined estrogen and progestin. To update its 2012 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed evidence about the benefits and harms of systemic hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women and whether outcomes vary among women in different subgroups or by timing of intervention after menopause. The use of hormone therapy, whether administered orally, transdermally, or locally for the treatment of menopausal symptoms or for other indications is outside the scope of this recommendation.

### Hormone therapy and biological aging in postmenopausal women… [^115D4eFs]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Are there associations between hormone therapy, socioeconomic status, and discrepancies between chronological and biological age among postmenopausal women, and can this explain the association between HT and risk of mortality. Findings In this cohort study involving 117 763 postmenopausal women, HT use was significantly associated with a smaller aging discrepancy in postmenopausal women with different SESs, with a more evident association observed in women with low SES. The association between HT and a smaller aging discrepancy mediated the association between HT and decreased mortality risk. Meaning These findings support HT use in postmenopausal women to promote healthy aging and address related health inequalities, but further investigations are warranted to confirm the clinical benefits. Importance Menopause is associated with biological aging, and hormone therapy is associated with health outcomes in postmenopausal women.

Objective To evaluate the association between HT use and discrepancies between chronological and biological age in postmenopausal women as well as the potential modifying role of socioeconomic status. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, postmenopausal women with historical HT use were biologically younger than those not receiving HT, with a more evident association observed in those with low SES. The biological aging discrepancy mediated the association between HT and decreased mortality. Promoting HT in postmenopausal women could be important for healthy aging. Among the factors involved in women's health, hormone therapy has been the focus of much attention. Menopause is associated with the loss of estrogen production by the ovaries. 4 In addition, there is an association between menopause and the biological aging process, indicating the urgent need to address accelerated aging in postmenopausal women.

5, 6 Exogenous systemic estrogen is recommended for managing menopausal vasomotor symptoms. Finally, to evaluate the selection bias, a nonresponse analysis was conducted comparing baseline characteristics of included and excluded participants. This large population-based, retrospective cohort study found a significant association between historical HT use and a smaller biological aging discrepancy in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, this association was modified by SES and more evident in women with a disadvantaged socioeconomic position. In addition, the mediation analysis showed that the phenotypic age discrepancy significantly mediated the association between ever using HT and decreased mortality risk, especially for CVD mortality. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the association between HT use and biological aging discrepancy and to examine the modifying role of the SES.
