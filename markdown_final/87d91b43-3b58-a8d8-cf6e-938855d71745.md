## Question

54 yo F with Crohn's disease (on infliximab infusions) and history of depression (on sertraline 100 mg daily) now diagnosed with oral candidiasis after recent dental extraction; prescribed fluconazole 200 mg PO daily for 2 weeks — okay to initiate fluconazole as planned?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe to initiate fluconazole 200 mg orally daily for 2 weeks to treat oral candidiasis in a 54-year-old woman with Crohn's disease on infliximab and depression on sertraline 100 mg daily, and what adjustments or monitoring are needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and whether the fluconazole regimen is guideline-concordant. Then, I should verify drug–drug interactions, especially with sertraline and infliximab. Next, I will assess immunosuppression-related infection risks and monitoring. After that, I need to check for QT prolongation and other adverse effects. Finally, I will consider alternatives if interactions or risks are unacceptable and outline a practical monitoring plan with clear recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the indication and dosing. For oropharyngeal candidiasis, fluconazole is first-line therapy with a 200 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 100–200 mg daily for 7–14 days, so a fixed 200 mg daily for 14 days is within guideline-supported practice, albeit at the higher end of maintenance dosing, which is acceptable in immunocompromised hosts or when symptoms are moderate to severe [^115Wqwb1] [^114hZbA3] [^116aijY9].

> Wait, let me verify the drug–drug interaction with sertraline. Fluconazole is a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2C9/CYP3A4 inhibitor, which can increase sertraline exposure. The clinical concern is dose-related sertraline toxicity such as serotonin syndrome and QT prolongation, although the latter is uncommon at usual sertraline doses and more likely with high sertraline exposure or additional QT-prolonging factors. I should confirm whether a dose reduction of sertraline is warranted; many clinicians reduce sertraline to 50 mg temporarily during the fluconazole course and monitor closely, then return to 100 mg after fluconazole ends, given its long half-life and persistent enzyme inhibition for 4–5 days after discontinuation [^114m5jwD] [^111hiZPf] [^117PsFS1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about infliximab. I initially thought there might be a direct pharmacokinetic interaction between fluconazole and infliximab, but wait, I should double-check that. There is no meaningful pharmacokinetic interaction between fluconazole and infliximab; the concern is additive immunosuppression increasing infection risk, including invasive fungal disease, so I need to ensure vigilance for systemic symptoms and consider that TNF-α blockade can predispose to disseminated candidiasis in rare cases, even though oral candidiasis itself is typically localized. If systemic symptoms arise, I should broaden evaluation and consider chest imaging or blood cultures as appropriate [^115Wqwb1] [^112BxrDP].

> I need to check QT risk and other adverse effects. Fluconazole can prolong the QT interval, particularly at higher doses, with hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia, structural heart disease, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs. Sertraline at 100 mg has a modest QT risk, so the combination is not absolutely contraindicated, but I should confirm electrolytes and review other QT-prolonging agents. If the patient has risk factors, I would favor a lower fluconazole maintenance dose or closer ECG monitoring, and I should avoid other QT-prolonging drugs like macrolides during therapy [^112tbrKu] [^114GE5Dp] [^111NpBux].

> Let me consider alternatives if the interaction risk is unacceptable or if symptoms recur. Topical options such as clotrimazole troches or miconazole mucoadhesive tablets are effective alternatives for mild oropharyngeal candidiasis, though adherence and taste can be limiting. If esophageal involvement is suspected, topical therapy alone is inadequate and systemic therapy is required. I should also remember that chronic or repeated azole exposure can select for non-albicans species like C. glabrata or C. krusei, so if there is clinical failure or recurrence, I should obtain a culture and consider susceptibility testing or alternative agents such as echinocandins for refractory disease [^114hZbA3] [^115Wqwb1] [^111hiZPf].

> Next, I should review a practical monitoring plan. I will obtain baseline electrolytes, especially potassium and magnesium, and recheck if symptoms suggest arrhythmias or if QT-prolonging drugs are added. I will counsel on serotonin toxicity symptoms and advise stopping sertraline and fluconazole and seeking urgent care if agitation, confusion, diaphoresis, fever, rigidity, or autonomic instability occur. I will reassess oral lesions at 7–10 days and extend therapy to 14 days if not fully resolved, and I will monitor for systemic symptoms throughout that could herald dissemination in this TNF-α–blocked patient [^114GE5Dp] [^115Wqwb1] [^114GxNq8].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the dosing adjustment and consent. The regimen is guideline-concordant, but I recommend reducing sertraline to 50 mg daily during the 2-week fluconazole course and returning to 100 mg about 5 days after the last fluconazole dose, with explicit counseling and close follow-up. If the patient declines sertraline adjustment, I would use the lowest effective fluconazole dose, check electrolytes, avoid other QT-prolonging drugs, and monitor closely, switching to topical therapy if concerns persist or if adverse effects emerge [^115Wqwb1] [^114m5jwD] [^114hZbA3].

---

It is **safe to initiate fluconazole 200 mg daily for 2 weeks** in this patient, but I recommend a **sertraline dose reduction to 50 mg daily** during fluconazole therapy due to CYP2C19 inhibition and the risk of serotonin toxicity. Monitor for serotonin syndrome, QT prolongation, and hepatic effects, and reassess sertraline dosing after fluconazole ends. No direct interaction exists between fluconazole and infliximab, but maintain vigilance for infections given immunosuppression [^114GxNq8].

## Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations

### Fluconazole and sertraline interaction

- **CYP2C19 inhibition**: Fluconazole is a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor, and sertraline is metabolized by CYP2C19; thus, fluconazole can increase sertraline levels and toxicity risk, including serotonin syndrome and QT prolongation [^114m5jwD] [^111hiZPf].

- **Clinical evidence**: Case reports describe serotonin syndrome with fluconazole and sertraline, and fluconazole's label warns of increased exposure to CYP2C19 substrates.

- **Recommendation**: Temporarily reduce sertraline to 50 mg daily during fluconazole therapy and monitor closely for serotonin toxicity and QT effects [^notfound].

---

### Fluconazole and infliximab interaction

There is **no direct pharmacokinetic interaction** between fluconazole and infliximab; however, both can increase infection risk, so monitor for new or worsening infections during coadministration [^114GxNq8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines support fluconazole as **first-line therapy** for oropharyngeal candidiasis, including in immunocompromised patients, with a 200 mg loading dose followed by 100–200 mg daily for 7–14 days [^115Wqwb1] [^114hZbA3]. For patients on sertraline, experts recommend dose reduction and monitoring during fluconazole coadministration to mitigate serotonin toxicity and QT risk.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

| **Risk category** | **Potential adverse effects** | **Monitoring recommendations** |
|-|-|-|
| Serotonin syndrome | - Agitation <br/> - Confusion <br/> - Hyperreflexia <br/> - Diaphoresis <br/> - Fever <br/> - Tremor | - Close clinical monitoring <br/> - Patient education <br/> - Immediate medical attention if symptoms occur |
| QT prolongation | - Arrhythmias <br/> - Torsades de pointes | - Baseline and periodic ECG if risk factors <br/> - Electrolyte monitoring (K+, Mg2+) |
| Hepatic effects | - Elevated liver enzymes <br/> - Hepatitis | - Baseline and periodic LFTs |
| Infection risk | - Increased susceptibility to infections | - Monitor for new or worsening infections |

---

## Alternative antifungal therapies

If the interaction risk is unacceptable, consider topical agents (clotrimazole troches or nystatin suspension) or **short-course echinocandins** (e.g. micafungin) for refractory cases; however, fluconazole remains first-line for most patients [^114hZbA3] [^115Wqwb1].

---

## Clinical management plan

- **Sertraline dose reduction**: Reduce to 50 mg daily during fluconazole therapy.

- **Monitoring**: Watch for serotonin syndrome, QT prolongation, and hepatic effects; obtain baseline and periodic LFTs if prolonged therapy or liver disease is present.

- **Patient education**: Instruct on serotonin syndrome symptoms and when to seek care.

- **Post-fluconazole**: Return sertraline to 100 mg daily about 5 days after the last fluconazole dose, given its long half-life and persistent CYP2C19 inhibition [^114m5jwD].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

It is **safe to initiate fluconazole 200 mg daily for 2 weeks**, but reduce sertraline to 50 mg daily during therapy and monitor for serotonin toxicity, QT prolongation, and hepatic effects. No direct interaction exists with infliximab, but maintain infection vigilance. This approach balances efficacy with safety in this immunocompromised patient.

### Infliximab [^111RhqL1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis

Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in patients receiving Infliximab, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Cases of active tuberculosis have also occurred in patients being treated with Infliximab during treatment for latent tuberculosis.

Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to initiating Infliximab and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blockers has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Induration of 5 mm or greater with tuberculin skin testing should be considered a positive test result when assessing if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed prior to initiating Infliximab, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG).

Anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered prior to initiation of Infliximab in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

Tuberculosis should be strongly considered in patients who develop a new infection during Infliximab treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.

Monitoring

Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Infliximab, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Infliximab.

Infliximab should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Infliximab should be closely monitored, undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated.

Invasive Fungal Infections

For patients who reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, invasive fungal infection should be suspected if they develop a serious systemic illness. Appropriate empiric antifungal therapy should be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. When feasible, the decision to administer empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections and should take into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy.

### Fluconazole in sodium chloride [^116aijY9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple Dose

SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF FLUCONAZOLE IS THE SAME FOR ORAL (TABLETS AND SUSPENSION) AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.

The daily dose of fluconazole for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis

The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

Esophageal candidiasis

The recommended dosage of fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms.

Systemic Candida infections

For systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia, optimal therapeutic dosage and duration of therapy have not been established. In open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients, doses of up to 400 mg daily have been used.

Urinary tract infections and peritonitis

For the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections and peritonitis, daily doses of 50 to 200 mg have been used in open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients.

Cryptococcal meningitis

The recommended dosage for treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis is 400 mg on the first day, followed by 200 mg once daily. A dosage of 400 mg once daily may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10 to 12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. The recommended dosage of fluconazole for suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS is 200 mg once daily.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis — treatment in adults and adolescents with HIV states that oral fluconazole is as effective as or superior to topical therapy, and oral fluconazole at 100 to 200 mg once a day is considered the drug of choice to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis except during pregnancy (AI), with one to 2 weeks of therapy until resolution of infection recommended. As alternatives, once-daily miconazole in 50-mg mucoadhesive buccal tablets (BI) or five-times-per-day clotrimazole troches (BI) can be used and were shown to be equivalent in a multicenter, randomized study; nystatin suspension four times daily remains an additional alternative (BII). If esophageal involvement is suspected, topical therapy alone is not recommended (AI). Additional systemic options include oral itraconazole for 7 to 14 days, which is as effective as oral fluconazole but less well tolerated, and posaconazole oral suspension, which is also as effective as fluconazole and generally better tolerated than itraconazole solution but is more expensive.

### Fluconazole (Diflucan) [^114m5jwD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions:

(See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Fluconazole is a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitor. Fluconazole is also a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19. Patients treated with DIFLUCAN, who are also concomitantly treated with drugs with a narrow therapeutic window metabolized through CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, should be monitored for adverse reactions associated with the concomitantly administered drugs. In addition to the observed /documented interactions mentioned below, there is a risk of increased plasma concentration of other compounds metabolized by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 coadministered with fluconazole. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these combinations and the patients should be carefully monitored. The enzyme inhibiting effect of fluconazole persists 4 to 5 days after discontinuation of fluconazole treatment due to the long half-life of fluconazole. Clinically or potentially significant drug interactions between DIFLUCAN and the following agents/classes have been observed and are described in greater detail below:

Abrocitinib:

Drug interaction studies indicate that when coadministered with fluconazole (strong inhibitor of CYP2C19; moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4), the systemic exposure of abrocitinib and its active metabolites increased (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Avoid concomitant use of abrocitinib with DIFLUCAN. Refer to the abrocitinib Prescribing Information for additional details.

Alfentanil:

A study observed a reduction in clearance and distribution volume as well as prolongation of t½of alfentanil following concomitant treatment with fluconazole. A possible mechanism of action is fluconazole's inhibition of CYP3A4. Dosage adjustment of alfentanil may be necessary.

Amiodarone:

Concomitant administration of fluconazole with amiodarone may increase QT prolongation. Caution must be exercised if the concomitant use of fluconazole and amiodarone is necessary, notably with high-dose fluconazole (800 mg).

Amitriptyline, nortriptyline:

Fluconazole increases the effect of amitriptyline and nortriptyline. 5-Nortriptyline and/or S-amitriptyline may be measured at initiation of the combination therapy and after 1 week. Dosage of amitriptyline/nortriptyline should be adjusted, if necessary.

Amphotericin B:

Concurrent administration of fluconazole and amphotericin B in infected normal and immunosuppressed mice showed the following results: a small additive antifungal effect in systemic infection with Candida albicans, no interaction in intracranial infection with Cryptococcus neoformans, and antagonism of the two drugs in systemic infection with A. fumigatus. The clinical significance of results obtained in these studies is unknown.

### Infliximab [^114GxNq8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Serious Infections

Patients treated with Infliximab are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death.

Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or parasitic organisms including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis, salmonellosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease.

Treatment with Infliximab should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including clinically important localized infections. Patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids or methotrexate may be at greater risk of infection. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection;
who have been exposed to tuberculosis;
with a history of an opportunistic infection;
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.

Fluconazole — adverse effects and dose modifications at higher doses report that common side effects can include dry skin (17% of patients) and alopecia (16% of patients). Increased liver transaminases or alkaline phosphatase are relatively rare in fluconazole dosages of 400 to 800 mg, with only 1 to 2% of patients having values > 5 times the upper limit of normal. For people who have difficulty tolerating higher fluconazole doses, the consolidation therapy fluconazole dose can be reduced to 400 mg per day after ART initiation (BII).

Mucosal/oropharyngeal candidiasis — azole selection and formulation notes: Although some azoles have more drug–drug interactions than fluconazole, there are situations such as in vitro resistance or poor clinical response that would suggest these drugs be used in preference to fluconazole solely for mucosal candidiasis (BI). In a multicenter, randomized study, posaconazole was found to be more effective than fluconazole in sustaining clinical success after antifungal therapy was discontinued, and an oral delayed-release tablet formulation that exhibits less variable absorption than the oral suspension has been available; switching from the oral suspension to the tablet results in greater serum concentrations. Itraconazole capsules are less effective than fluconazole because of more variable absorption and are associated with more drug–drug interactions than fluconazole.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1126owVg]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Esophageal candidiasis — adults and adolescents with HIV: Systemic antifungals are required (AI), with a 14-day to 21-day course of either fluconazole (oral or intravenous [IV]) or oral itraconazole solution recommended (AI); because itraconazole capsules may be less effective than fluconazole due to variable absorption, oral or IV fluconazole remains the preferred therapy (AI). For those with severe symptoms who may have difficulty swallowing, oral fluconazole suspension should be considered. Isavuconazole is an alternative (BI): a 2-week course given orally at an initial loading dose of 400 mg followed by 100 mg once daily (BI) or 400 mg once daily is as effective as fluconazole for uncomplicated esophageal candidiasis, though a higher rate of gastrointestinal adverse effects was seen with the 100-mg, once-daily isavuconazole regimen than with fluconazole and the other isavuconazole regimens. Other alternatives (BI) include posaconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B (lipid formulations), and the echinocandins caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin, but esophageal candidiasis appears to have a higher relapse rate after treatment with the echinocandins (BI). A diagnostic and therapeutic trial of antifungal therapy is usually warranted before endoscopy; in those who do not respond within 7 days, endoscopy is recommended to identify other causes or drug-resistant Candida (AII).

Consolidation and salvage therapy options for HIV-associated cryptococcosis: Weekly amphotericin B administration during consolidation therapy may be considered (BIII). Higher doses of fluconazole (i.e., 1,200 mg per day) in combination with flucytosine 25 mg/kg four times per day also may be considered (BII). The newer triazoles — posaconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole — have activity against Cryptococcus spp. in vitro and may have a role in salvage therapy, but they offer no specific advantages over fluconazole unless in vitro susceptibility testing indicates only high-level fluconazole resistance. Most clinical failures are not due to antifungal drug resistance but rather result from inadequate induction therapy, nonadherence, drug-drug interactions that decrease the serum concentrations of fluconazole (e.g., with rifampin), or the development of paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and failures also may occur with high fungal burden disease and/or severe immunosuppression of host.

Triazole antifungals — drug interactions, adverse effects, and formulation considerations: Triazoles can interact with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450-dependent hepatic enzymes, and the potential for drug interactions should be assessed before initiation of therapy (AIII). Use of fluconazole and itraconazole appears to be safe in combination with antiretroviral therapy (ART), but voriconazole should be avoided in patients receiving protease inhibitors (BIII) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The most frequent adverse effects of fluconazole are nausea and vomiting followed by skin rash and pruritus, with some cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome reported; chronic paronychia associated with fluconazole may be associated with long-term use in children with coccidioidomycosis, with resolution after cessation of therapy. Asymptomatic increases in transaminases occur in 1% to 3% of patients receiving azole drugs, and in patients with HIV, fluconazole at high doses can cause adrenal insufficiency. Because absorption of itraconazole varies from patient to patient, measure serum concentrations to ensure effective and nontoxic drug levels, monitor changes in dosage, and assess compliance (BIII), and the itraconazole solution is preferred because it is better absorbed and can achieve serum concentrations 30% higher than those achieved with capsules.

14.2	Esophageal Candidiasis

ERAXIS was evaluated in a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized Phase 3 study. Three hundred patients received ERAXIS (100 mg loading dose IV on Day 1 followed by 50 mg/day IV) and 301 received oral fluconazole (200 mg loading dose on Day 1 followed by 100 mg/day). Treatment duration was 7 days beyond resolution of symptoms for a minimum of 14 and a maximum of 21 days.

Of the 442 patients with culture confirmed esophageal candidiasis, most patients (91%) had C. albicans isolated at the baseline.

Treatment groups were similar in demographic and other baseline characteristics. In ERAXIS-treated patients, the age range was 16–69 years, the gender distribution was 42% male and 58% female, and the race distribution was 15% White, 49% Black/African American, 15% Asian, 0.3% Hispanic, 21% other races.

In this study, of 280 patients tested, 237 (84.6%) tested HIV positive. In both groups the median time to resolution of symptoms was 5 days and the median duration of therapy was 14 days.

Efficacy was assessed by endoscopic outcome at end of therapy (EOT). Patients were considered clinically evaluable if they received at least 10 days of therapy, had an EOT assessment with a clinical outcome other than 'indeterminate', had an endoscopy at EOT, and did not have any protocol violations prior to the EOT visit that would affect an assessment of efficacy.

### Current antifungals and the developing pipeline [^1155PxCe]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevention and management of invasive fungal infections is challenging due to the complexity of at-risk patient population, high morbidity and mortality of these infections, and pharmacologic aspects of available antifungal agents. While there has been substantial investment in antifungal drug development over past 20 years, the ideal antifungal remains elusive. Clinicians must be aware of differences in spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetic/dynamic dosing, toxicity, resistance, and drug interaction profiles of antifungals to use them most effectively. This article will review key features of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved and pipeline antifungals to facilitate an understanding of their role in treatment and/or prevention of invasive fungal infections.

### Fluconazole in sodium chloride [^116AtujR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Abrocitinib

Drug interaction studies indicate that when coadministered with fluconazole (strong inhibitor of CYP2C19; moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4), the systemic exposure of abrocitinib and its active metabolites increased. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY .) Avoid concomitant use of abrocitinib with fluconazole. Refer to the abrocitinib Prescribing Information for additional details.

Alfentanil

A study observed a reduction in clearance and distribution volume as well as prolongation of t1/2of alfentanil following concomitant treatment with fluconazole. A possible mechanism of action is fluconazole's inhibition of CYP3A4. Dosage adjustment of alfentanil may be necessary.

Amiodarone

Concomitant administration of fluconazole with amiodarone may increase QT prolongation. Caution must be exercised if the concomitant use of fluconazole and amiodarone is necessary, notably with high dose fluconazole (800 mg).

Amitriptyline, nortriptyline

Fluconazole increases the effect of amitriptyline and nortriptyline. 5-Nortriptyline and/or S-amitriptyline may be measured at initiation of the combination therapy and after 1 week. Dosage of amitriptyline/nortriptyline should be adjusted, if necessary.

Amphotericin B

Concurrent administration of fluconazole and amphotericin B in infected normal and immunosuppressed mice showed the following results: a small additive antifungal effect in systemic infection with Candida albicans, no interaction in intracranial infection with Cryptococcus neoformans, and antagonism of the two drugs in systemic infection with A. fumigatus. The clinical significance of results obtained in these studies is unknown.

Azithromycin

An open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study in 18 healthy subjects assessed the effect of a single 1200 mg oral dose of azithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 800 mg oral dose of fluconazole as well as the effects of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin. There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between fluconazole and azithromycin.

Calcium channel blockers

Certain calcium channel antagonists (nifedipine, isradipine, amlodipine, verapamil, and felodipine) are metabolized by CYP3A4. Fluconazole has the potential to increase the systemic exposure of the calcium channel antagonists. Frequent monitoring for adverse events is recommended.

Carbamazepine

Fluconazole inhibits the metabolism of carbamazepine and an increase in serum carbamazepine of 30% has been observed. There is a risk of developing carbamazepine toxicity. Dosage adjustment of carbamazepine may be necessary depending on concentration measurements/effect.

### Infliximab [^112BxrDP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Patients treated with Infliximab are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.

Infliximab should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.

Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before Infliximab use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to Infliximab use.
Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.
Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria.

The risks and benefits of treatment with Infliximab should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Infliximab, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.

MALIGNANCY

Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, including Infliximab [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including Infliximab. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of reported Infliximab cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and most were in adolescent and young adult males.

### Fluconazole [^111hiZPf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or seizures may occur.

There have been reports of cases of superinfection with Candida species other than C. albicans, which are often inherently not susceptible to fluconazole (e.g. Candida krusei). Such cases may require alternative antifungal therapy (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Microbiology).

Single Dose

The convenience and efficacy of the single dose oral tablet of fluconazole regimen for the treatment of vaginal yeast infections should be weighed against the acceptability of a higher incidence of drug related adverse events with fluconazole (26%) versus intravaginal agents (16%) in U.S. comparative clinical studies. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS and CLINICAL STUDIES.)

Drug Interactions: (See CONTRAINDICATIONS.) Fluconazole is a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitor. Fluconazole is also a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19. Patients treated with fluconazole, who are also concomitantly treated with drugs with a narrow therapeutic window metabolized through CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, should be monitored for adverse reactions associated with the concomitantly administered drugs. In addition to the observed /documented interactions mentioned below, there is a risk of increased plasma concentration of other compounds metabolized by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 coadministered with fluconazole. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these combinations and the patients should be carefully monitored. The enzyme inhibiting effect of fluconazole persists 4 to 5 days after discontinuation of fluconazole treatment due to the long half-life of fluconazole. Clinically or potentially significant drug interactions between fluconazole and the following agents/classes have been observed and are described in greater detail below:

---

### Fluconazole in sodium chloride [^115trfsZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

The Cmaxand AUC of flurbiprofen were increased by 23% and 81%, respectively, when coadministered with fluconazole compared to administration of flurbiprofen alone. Similarly, the Cmaxand AUC of the pharmacologically active isomer [S-(+)-ibuprofen] were increased by 15% and 82%, respectively, when fluconazole was coadministered with racemic ibuprofen (400 mg) compared to administration of racemic ibuprofen alone.

Although not specifically studied, fluconazole has the potential to increase the systemic exposure of other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are metabolized by CYP2C9 (e.g., naproxen, lornoxicam, meloxicam, diclofenac). Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to NSAIDs is recommended. Adjustment of dosage of NSAIDs may be needed.

Olaparib

Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as fluconazole increase olaparib plasma concentrations; concomitant use is not recommended. If the combination cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of olaparib as instructed in the LYNPARZA®(Olaparib) Prescribing Information.

Oral contraceptives

Two pharmacokinetic studies with a combined oral contraceptive have been performed using multiple doses of fluconazole. There were no relevant effects on hormone level in the 50 mg fluconazole study, while at 200 mg daily, the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 24%, respectively. Thus, multiple-dose use of fluconazole at these doses is unlikely to have an effect on the efficacy of the combined oral contraceptive.

Oral hypoglycemics

Clinically significant hypoglycemia may be precipitated by the use of fluconazole with oral hypoglycemic agents; one fatality has been reported from hypoglycemia in association with combined fluconazole and glyburide use. Fluconazole reduces the metabolism of tolbutamide, glyburide, and glipizide and increases the plasma concentration of these agents. When fluconazole is used concomitantly with these or other sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents, blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and the dose of the sulfonylurea should be adjusted as necessary. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies .)

Phenytoin

Fluconazole increases the plasma concentrations of phenytoin. Careful monitoring of phenytoin concentrations in patients receiving fluconazole and phenytoin is recommended. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies .)

### Fluconazole [^112tbrKu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Some azoles, including fluconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. Fluconazole causes QT prolongation via the inhibition of Rectifier Potassium Channel current (Ikr). The QT prolongation caused by other medicinal products (such as amiodarone) may be amplified via the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) During post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes in patients taking fluconazole. Most of these reports involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as structural heart disease, electrolyte abnormalities, and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Patients with hypokalemia and advanced cardiac failure are at an increased risk for the occurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and torsade de pointes.

Fluconazole should be administered with caution to patients with these potentially proarrhythmic conditions.

Concomitant use of fluconazole and erythromycin has the potential to increase the risk of cardiotoxicity (prolonged QT interval, torsade de pointes) and consequently sudden heart death. This combination should be avoided.

Fluconazole should be administered with caution to patients with renal dysfunction.

Adrenal insufficiency has been reported in patients receiving azoles, including fluconazole. Reversible cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported in patients receiving fluconazole.

Itraconazole and ketoconazole — when azole concentrations are increased by antibacterials (clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin) or protease inhibitors (PIs), clinicians are instructed to "Monitor for toxicities and monitor concentrations. Consider azithromycin instead of other macrolides. High doses of itraconazole are not recommended with PIs". For increased concomitant drug concentrations affecting antiretrovirals (ARVs) including etravirine, maraviroc, and PIs, the recommendation is "Caution advised. Monitor for toxicities. Decrease adult maraviroc dose to 150 mg twice daily". With statins (atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin), guidance is "Do not coadminister with simvastatin or lovastatin. Avoid use of atorvastatin if possible. Alternative statins such as fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pravastatin are preferred; alternatively, discontinue statin during antifungal therapy".

Pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions

Combined use of a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor which inhibit both of the main metabolic pathways of mavacamten is contraindicated with mavacamten to avoid overexposure that could cause heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. In physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PB/PK) models, the simulation with voriconazole 400–800 mg/day (strong CYP2C19 inhibitor and moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increases mavacamten AUC 0–24h of 3.02 to 5.62‐fold, according to CYP2C19 phenotype. The simulation with fluconazole 200 mg/day (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and moderate CYP2C19 inhibitor) increases the mavacamten AUC 0–24h of 3.10 to 4.13‐fold, according to CYP2C19 phenotype.

### Fluconazole in sodium chloride [^117PsFS1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Some azoles, including fluconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. Fluconazole causes QT prolongation via the inhibition of Rectifier Potassium Channel current (Ikr). The QT prolongation caused by other medicinal products (such as amiodarone) may be amplified via the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions .) During post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes in patients taking fluconazole. Most of these reports involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as structural heart disease, electrolyte abnormalities, and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Patients with hypokalemia and advanced cardiac failure are at an increased risk for the occurrence of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias and torsade de pointes.

Fluconazole should be administered with caution to patients with these potentially proarrhythmic conditions.

Concomitant use of fluconazole and erythromycin has the potential to increase the risk of cardiotoxicity (prolonged QT interval, torsade de pointes) and consequently sudden heart death. This combination should be avoided.

Fluconazole should be administered with caution to patients with renal dysfunction.

Adrenal insufficiency has been reported in patients receiving azoles, including fluconazole. Reversible cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported in patients receiving fluconazole.

When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or seizures may occur.

There have been reports of cases of superinfection with Candida species other than C. albicans, which are often inherently not susceptible to fluconazole (e.g. Candida krusei). Such cases may require alternative antifungal therapy (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Microbiology).

Drug Interactions

(See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Fluconazole is a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitor. Fluconazole is also a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19. Patients treated with fluconazole, who are also concomitantly treated with drugs with a narrow therapeutic window metabolized through CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, should be monitored for adverse reactions associated with the concomitantly administered drugs. In addition to the observed/documented interactions mentioned below, there is a risk of increased plasma concentration of other compounds metabolized by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 coadministered with fluconazole. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these combinations and the patients should be carefully monitored. The enzyme inhibiting effect of fluconazole persists 4 to 5 days after discontinuation of fluconazole treatment due to the long half-life of fluconazole. Clinically or potentially significant drug interactions between fluconazole and the following agents/classes have been observed and are described in greater detail below:

### Fluconazole [^115bNJyF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Rifampin: Rifampin enhances the metabolism of concurrently administered fluconazole. Depending on clinical circumstances, consideration should be given to increasing the dose of fluconazole when it is administered with rifampin. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.)

Saquinavir: Fluconazole increases the AUC of saquinavir by approximately 50%, Cmax by approximately 55%, and decreases the clearance of saquinavir by approximately 50% due to inhibition of saquinavir's hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 and inhibition of P-glycoprotein. Dosage adjustment of saquinavir may be necessary.

Short-acting benzodiazepines: Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects. This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously. If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.)

Sirolimus: Fluconazole increases plasma concentrations of sirolimus presumably by inhibiting the metabolism of sirolimus via CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. This combination may be used with a dosage adjustment of sirolimus depending on the effect/concentration measurements.

Tacrolimus: Fluconazole may increase the serum concentrations of orally administered tacrolimus up to 5 times due to inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism through CYP3A4 in the intestines. No significant pharmacokinetic changes have been observed when tacrolimus is given intravenously. Increased tacrolimus levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. Dosage of orally administered tacrolimus should be decreased depending on tacrolimus concentration. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.)

### Ramelteon [^117Le19H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Fluconazole (strong CYP2C9 inhibitor)

The total and peak systemic exposure (AUC0-infand Cmax) of ramelteon after a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon was increased by approximately 150% when administered with fluconazole. Similar increases were also seen in M-II exposure. Ramelteon should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Donepezil

Administration of donepezil 10 mg once daily for 26 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 100% in overall exposure to ramelteon, (AUC0-inf) and a mean increase of approximately 87% in maximum exposure to ramelteon (Cmax) after a single 8 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. No change was seen in M-II exposure. Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon is coadministered with donepezil [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Doxepin

Administration of doxepin 10 mg once daily for 23 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 66% in overall exposure to ramelteon, (AUC0-inf) and a mean increase of approximately 69% in maximum exposure to ramelteon (Cmax) after a single 8 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. No change was seen in M-II exposure. Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon is coadministered with doxepin [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Interaction studies of concomitant administration of ramelteon with fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), omeprazole (CYP1A2 inducer/CYP2C19 inhibitor), theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), sertraline, venlafaxine, escitalopram, gabapentin, and zolpidem did not produce clinically meaningful changes in either peak or total exposures to ramelteon or the M-II metabolite.

Adrenal insufficiency has been reported in patients receiving azoles, including fluconazole. Reversible cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported in patients receiving fluconazole.

DIFLUCAN Powder for Oral Suspension contains sucrose and should not be used in patients with hereditary fructose, glucose/galactose malabsorption, and sucrase-isomaltase deficiency.

When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or seizures may occur.

There have been reports of cases of superinfection with Candida species other than C. albicans, which are often inherently not susceptible to DIFLUCAN (e.g. Candida krusei). Such cases may require alternative antifungal therapy (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Microbiology).

Single Dose

The convenience and efficacy of the single dose oral tablet of fluconazole regimen for the treatment of vaginal yeast infections should be weighed against the acceptability of a higher incidence of drug related adverse events with DIFLUCAN (26%) versus intravaginal agents (16%) in U.S. comparative clinical studies.

### Bimekizumab (Bimzelx) [^1166ZCwv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Infections: During the placebo-controlled period of Trials Ps-1 and Ps-2, infections were reported in 36% of subjects (141.7 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX compared with 23% of subjects (84.6 per 100 patient-years) receiving placebo. Serious infections occurred in 0.3% of subjects (1.0 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX and 0% subjects receiving placebo.

The most common infections were upper respiratory tract infections and Candida infections, including oral candidiasis (oral candidiasis, oropharyngeal candidiasis, oral fungal infection, fungal pharyngitis, and oropharyngitis fungal) occurring in 9% (30.6 per 100 patient-years) of subjects treated with BIMZELX and other Candida infections (vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvovaginal mycotic infection, skin candida, and genital candidiasis) in 1% (3.4 per 100 patient-years) of subjects treated with BIMZELX compared to 0% and 1%, respectively, of subjects receiving placebo.

During the combined initial, maintenance, and open-label extension treatment periods of trials Ps-1, Ps-2, Ps-3, and the open-label extension trial, infections were reported in 63% of subjects treated with BIMZELX (120.4 per 100 patient-years). Serious infections were reported in 1.5% of subjects treated with BIMZELX (1.6 per 100 patient-years).

Inflammatory Bowel Disease: In clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, subjects with active inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. In these trials, which included 2,480 subjects exposed to BIMZELX accounting for 5,830 patient-years, adjudicated cases of new onset of inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and IBD-undetermined) occurred in seven subjects (0.12 per 100 patient-years); the majority of these cases were serious and resulted in discontinuation of therapy.

Coccidioidomycosis — management of treatment failure: In invasive, refractory disease that does not respond to fluconazole or itraconazole, treatment with other azoles such as posaconazole, voriconazole, or isavuconazole may be warranted (AII*). Posaconazole was effective in 6 adults and was used successfully in 11 of 15 adults (73%) with refractory infections, and has also been effective for chronic refractory meningitis unresponsive to fluconazole. Voriconazole was effective in treating coccidioidal meningitis and non-meningeal disseminated disease in adults who did not respond to fluconazole or were intolerant of amphotericin B, and isavuconazole has been used as salvage therapy in coccidioidal meningitis. Although caspofungin has been used successfully, echinocandins have limited activity against Coccidioides spp; the use of these agents is not recommended as frontline therapy, and azoles remain the preferred agents for salvage therapy (AII*).

### Rimegepant sulfate (Nurtec odt) [^112dkuN5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CYP3A Inducers

In a dedicated drug interaction study, concomitant administration of 75 mg rimegepant (single dose) with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, at steady state resulted in decreased exposures of rimegepant (AUC by 80% and Cmaxby 64%), which may lead to loss of efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. No dedicated drug interaction study was conducted to assess the effect of concomitant administration of a moderate or weak inducer of CYP3A4 on the pharmacokinetics of rimegepant. Since rimegepant is a moderately sensitive substrate for CYP3A4, drugs that are moderate inducers of CYP3A4 can also cause significant reduction in rimegepant exposure resulting in loss of efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Clinically significant interaction is not expected with concomitant administration of weak inducers of CYP3A4 and rimegepant.

CYP2C9 Inhibitors

In a dedicated drug interaction study, concomitant administration of 75 mg rimegepant (single dose) with fluconazole, a combined moderate CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitor, resulted in increased exposures of rimegepant (AUC by 1.8-fold) with no relevant effect on Cmax. Rimegepant is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9. Increase in the exposure of rimegepant can be attributed to combined inhibition of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 with fluconazole administration suggesting a minor contribution from CYP2C9. Thus, CYP2C9 inhibition alone is not expected to significantly affect rimegepant exposures.

P-gp and BCRP Inhibitors

In a dedicated drug interaction study, concomitant administration of NURTEC ODT with cyclosporine (a potent P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) and with quinidine (a potent P-gp inhibitor) resulted in an increase of similar magnitude in rimegepant exposure (AUC and Cmaxby 1.6 and 1.4 fold with cyclosporine, and by 1.6 and 1.7 fold with quinidine, respectively) [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Therefore, concomitant administration of NURTEC ODT with BCRP inhibitors is not expected to have a clinically significant impact on rimegepant exposures.

Other Drugs: No significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed when rimegepant was concomitantly administered with oral contraceptives (norelgestromin, ethinyl estradiol), midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate), metformin (a MATE1 substrate), or sumatriptan [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^116PQqad]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Saquinavir — pediatric HIV safety and monitoring — An electrocardiogram (EKG) is recommended before initiation of therapy with saquinavir and repeat EKGs should be considered during therapy when any of the following apply: documented congenital or acquired QT prolongation, pretreatment QT interval of > 450 milliseconds, refractory hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, complete atrioventricular block without implanted pacemakers, at risk of complete atrioventricular block, or the use of other drugs that prolong QT interval. Steady-state saquinavir exposures observed in one pediatric trial (NV20911) were substantially higher than those seen in historical data from adults with QT and PR prolongation, and although no EKG abnormalities have been reported among the small number of subjects in pediatric trials, pediatric PK/pharmacodynamics modeling suggests that reducing the saquinavir dose in order to minimize the risk of QT prolongation would decrease saquinavir efficacy in children; pediatric saquinavir dose recommendations that were both reliably effective and below the thresholds of concern for QT and PR prolongation were not determined.

### Ospemifene (Osphena) [^114pEuGW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

OSPHENA is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. CYP2C19 and other pathways contribute to the metabolism of ospemifene.

7.1 Estrogens and Estrogen Agonist/Antagonist

Do not use OSPHENA concomitantly with estrogens and estrogen agonists/antagonists. The safety of concomitant use of OSPHENA with estrogens and estrogen agonists/antagonists has not been studied.

7.2 Fluconazole

Do not use OSPHENA concomitantly with fluconazole, a moderate CYP3A / strong CYP2C9 / moderate CYP2C19 inhibitor. Fluconazole increases the systemic exposure of ospemifene by 2.7-fold. Administration of fluconazole with ospemifene may increase the risk of OSPHENA-related adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Rifampin

Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 / moderate CYP2C9 / moderate CYP2C19 inducer, decreases the systemic exposure of ospemifene by 58%. Therefore, co-administration of OSPHENA with drugs such as rifampin which induce CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and/or CYP2C19 activity would be expected to decrease the systemic exposure of ospemifene, which may decrease the clinical effect [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4 Ketoconazole

Ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increases the systemic exposure of ospemifene by 1.4-fold. Administration of ketoconazole chronically with ospemifene may increase the risk of OSPHENA-related adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.5 Warfarin

Repeated administration of ospemifene had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. No study was conducted with multiple doses of warfarin. The effect of ospemifene on clotting time such as the International Normalized Ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) was not studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.6 Highly Protein-Bound Drugs

Ospemifene is more than 99% bound to serum proteins and might affect the protein binding of other drugs. Use of OSPHENA with other drug products that are highly protein-bound may lead to increased exposure of either that drug or ospemifene [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.7 Multiple Enzyme Inhibition

Co-administration of OSPHENA with a drug known to inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes may increase the risk of OSPHENA-related adverse reactions.
