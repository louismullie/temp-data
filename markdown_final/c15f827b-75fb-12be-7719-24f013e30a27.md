C. Judaism
D. Islam

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which tradition, in addition to Jainism, began as a world-renouncing movement, with answer choices of Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "world-renouncing" means in the context of South Asian religious history. Then, I should verify which of the listed traditions originated with a founder who explicitly rejected worldly attachments and pursued ascetic, renunciant paths. Next, I will check the historical origins of each option to ensure I'm not conflating later developments with founding impulses. Finally, I will confirm the best-supported answer and briefly note why the alternatives do not fit the criterion of beginning as a world-renouncing movement.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: "world-renouncing" refers to movements that prioritize monastic or ascetic withdrawal from household life, material possessions, and social entanglements in pursuit of liberation or enlightenment. Jainism is a classic example, with its emphasis on ahimsa, austerity, and mendicancy, so I need to look for a tradition with a comparable founding orientation toward renunciation and asceticism [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine Buddhism, because I recall Siddhartha Gautama's journey from prince to ascetic to enlightened teacher. Wait, let me verify the founding narrative: he left palace life, practiced severe asceticism, and then taught the Middle Way, which still centrally features monastic renunciation as a path to nirvana; this aligns with a world-renouncing origin, and multiple sources situate Buddhism's emergence alongside Jainism in the śramaṇa milieu of ancient India, reinforcing that both began as renunciant movements [^notfound].

> Next, I should review Hinduism, but hold on, let's not conflate later ascetic strands with its origins. Hinduism, or the Vedic tradition, began as a householder-centered ritual culture with fire sacrifices and social obligations; renunciant orders like sannyasa developed within Hinduism over time, yet the tradition did not begin as a world-renouncing movement, so this option does not meet the criterion despite later ascetic currents [^notfound].

> I will now examine Judaism and Islam. Judaism's foundational narratives and laws are built around covenant, community, and family life, with no renunciant monastic ideal at its origin; similarly, Islam from its inception emphasized ummah, family, and lawful engagement with the world, even as it incorporated fasting and pilgrimage. Neither tradition began as a world-renouncing movement, so both can be excluded here [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that I'm not overlooking any nuance. The only option with a clear, founding world-renouncing orientation is Buddhism, which emerged in the same ascetic environment as Jainism and institutionalized monastic renunciation as a core path; therefore, the correct answer is A. Buddhism [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **Buddhism**. Like Jainism, Buddhism began as a world-renouncing movement founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha), who left his royal life to pursue asceticism and enlightenment. Both traditions emphasize **renunciation of worldly attachments** and the pursuit of liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam did not originate as world-renouncing movements; they primarily focus on household life, community, and ritual observance.

## Buddhism as a world-renouncing movement

Buddhism was founded in the 6th century BCE by Siddhartha Gautama, who renounced his princely life to seek enlightenment through ascetic practices and meditation. The Buddha's teachings emphasize the **Four Noble Truths** and the **Eightfold Path**, which guide followers toward liberation from suffering and the cycle of rebirth (samsara). Monasticism is a central aspect of Buddhism, with monks and nuns renouncing worldly possessions and commitments to focus on spiritual development.

---

## Comparison with Jainism

Jainism, founded by Mahavira in the 6th century BCE, shares similar principles of renunciation and asceticism. Both Buddhism and Jainism advocate for **non-violence (ahimsa)**, truthfulness, and detachment from material possessions. The primary goal in both traditions is to achieve liberation (moksha or nirvana) from the cycle of rebirth through rigorous spiritual practices and ethical living.

---

## Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam

In contrast, Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam did not originate as world-renouncing movements. Hinduism encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, including household life, ritual observance, and social duties. While Hinduism includes ascetic traditions, it did not begin as a **world-renouncing movement**. Judaism and Islam similarly emphasize community life, family, and ritual observance, with ascetic practices playing a limited role.

---

## Conclusion

Buddhism, like Jainism, began as a world-renouncing movement emphasizing renunciation, asceticism, and spiritual liberation. Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam, on the other hand, primarily focus on household life, community, and ritual observance. Therefore, the correct answer is **Buddhism**.

### Religion and the World Health Organization: an evolving relationship [^d1763b75]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the relationship between WHO and religious actors took another turn, when Samuel Hynd (1924–2016), the son of a medical missionary and health minister of Swaziland, the CMC and several member states from the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions began to argue that the HFA initiative ought to be extended with a 'spiritual dimension' of health. The effort was led by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and supported by other Gulf states, where since the 1970s, the Islamic 'revival' (tajdid) had begun to force political regimes to legitimate themselves as culturally 'authentic' nation-stations unbeholden to Western influence. This began to influence Islamic medical elites through the Islamic Organisation of Medical Sciences. In 1978, the desire to include a 'spiritual dimension' in healthcare was expressed to the Executive Board by a member from Libya and Bandhu D. Bisht, the deputy director-general of India's ministry of health and a passionate follower of Sri Aurobindo, who submitted a detailed background paper arguing that a 'spiritual dimension' was the 'Factor X' missing in the roll out of universal healthcare.

The attempt was supported by members of the Non-Aligned Movement — an alliance of former colonial states in support of the NIEO — and in 1983 the 'spiritual dimension' was tabled for discussion at the 36th WHA. Halfdan Mahler was tasked to write a report to clarify the matter, in which he presented the term 'spirituality' as an overarching ethical framework for global health, an 'ennobling idea' rooted in 'humane qualities as a sense of decency, empathy with the world's health underprivileged, compassion and the desire for social justice regarding health'. Notwithstanding endorsement by the director-general, opposition by member states allied with the Soviet bloc and concerns over the politicisation of international health policy — assembly meetings regularly escalated into tirades against the Israeli occupation of Palestine — likely factored into a vote at the 37th assembly in 1984 to settle for an unbinding 'invitation' for member states to add a 'spiritual dimension' to their health programmes 'in accordance with their social and cultural patterns'.

### Kumbh mela religious gathering as a massive superspreading event: potential culprit for the exponential surge of COVID-19 cases in India [^dc019b44]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

India, a predominantly Hindu country that occupies the greater part of South Asia, recently celebrated the Kumbh Mela or the "festival of pitcher," a very significant religious gathering of millions of Hindu devotees and sages at the country's riverbanks on April 1 to April 30, 2021, despite the threat of exponential surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the country. Being the second most populous country in the world with roughly one-sixth of the world's population, India also became the second most affected country during the COVID-19 pandemic on April 12, 2021, while the country was in the middle of a month-long religious celebration. As of July 31, 2021, there are already 31,654,584 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India, with 424,384 deaths.

This grand religious gathering is usually celebrated on certain auspicious days in the Hindu calendar, which typically commences in January. However, because of the pandemic, the Indian government opted to postpone the event to April and shorten the festival duration to only 30 days from the usual, which is 100 days or more. It was also reported that weeks before the festival started, an impending second wave of COVID-19 cases was overtaking India and appeals to cancel the festival began circulating in the country. However, this was shut down by the government as the Prime Minister continued inviting devotees and assured them that it was clean and safe. As such, an overwhelming number of devotees, paying no visible observance to COVID-19 protocols, attended the religious gathering. Although the festival was postponed to a later date and shortened to 1 month, the Kumbh Mela still attracted millions of Hindu pilgrims across the country because of its religious significance and cultural traditions.

### Contention and collaboration: the tenuous encounter of modern ayurveda and Western medicine in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries [^ac804b68]. Medical Humanities (2024). Medium credibility.

Complementary medicine systems are ascending to rapid popularity as the twenty-first century progresses. Often adapted from ancient systems of healing such as Ayurveda, these modern alternative medical movements reappraise millennia-old health traditions that found their inception at the confluence of religious philosophy and herbal healing. Naturally, contemporary global economic forces and a desire to market traditional medicine products in an enticing fashion have characterised how historic traditional medicine systems are presented in the modern context. By establishing a vision of complementary medicine born from ancient traditions, it becomes clear how traditional methods of healing can contend with Western biomedicine-the prevailing standard of care around the globe. The claims made by both sides parry along a line of scientific validity, efficacy and regulatory purview. India, the birthplace of Ayurveda and an epicentre of contemporary medical education, is a prime arena to study the friction between biomedicine and traditional medicine. In this piece, I focus on the modernisation of Ayurveda and how it has found conflict with allopathic medicine. I posit that Ayurveda has re-emerged since the early twentieth century as a key tenet of Indian modernity: and in doing so has found contention with Western medicine. I furthermore argue that despite existing discord, the two medical traditions are not inherently antithetical. They can be synergistic, so long as healthcare delivery and education recognise the limits of each and focus on coaction rather than contradiction.

### Indian = hindu? The development of nationalist attitudes among hindu and muslim children in India [^3be83864]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

Many political movements across the world today define citizenship in exclusionary ethnic or religious terms. This study extends research on ethnic-national associations in adults to children, adding to the relatively sparse literature on the development of national associations in children and in nonwestern contexts. Explicit and implicit religious-national associations were examined in a sample of 160 nine- to sixteen-year-olds (79 Hindu; 81 Muslim) in Gujarat, India. Results suggest that while Hindu children show a strong Indian = Hindu association by age 9, Muslim children appear to be buffered from this association. Furthermore, this association uniquely predicts variance in children's attitudes about social policy and their concept of nationality, above and beyond their age, religion, and intergroup attitudes.

### "So, when a woman becomes ill, the total structure of the family is affected, they can' T do anything… " voices from the community on women with breast cancer in India: a qualitative focus group study [^fdc19d13]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women globally. Psychological distress is common and is related to the impact of this disease on the woman's role in the family and wider community. A recent systematic review found that Indian women with breast cancer, living in India or as immigrants in Canada experienced distress, both ameliorated and exacerbated by similar cultural issues. India is the world's second-most populous country, with a rich culture including patriarchy, strong family systems and religious beliefs. The role of women in society has changed over time from a high position during the early Indus Valley civilisation to one of submissiveness to father, husband and son. A joint family system where several married couples and their children may live in the same house has persisted and is further reinforced by urban-industrial civilisation. Four major religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism) originated in India alongside indigenous faiths and tribal creeds which have survived for centuries. The influence of religion is embedded within the culture and "travels" with the person, influencing the responses and behaviours of Indian women anywhere in the world.

Breast cancer prevalence has been rising steadily in India, where it is currently the most common female cancer (25 to 31%). Unfortunately, most breast cancers are detected at a late stage; 50% are locally advanced at diagnosis. This is probably due to lack of awareness, a non-existent breast cancer screening programme, sociocultural barriers like the Purdah system and an unwillingness to expose themselves or subject themselves to breast examinations and imaging. The primary modality of treatment is surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and is delivered through public sector hospitals or funded through private- and employer-funded insurance, personal out-of-pocket fees, community-based and non-profit organisations, and by external funds from loans and grants. A recent qualitative study among women with breast cancer highlighted the psychological distress in Indian women in relation to prevailing societal attitudes regarding the role of women as wife, mother and the carer of older in-laws and hair loss as a particular source of distress. Greater support from the community and other social networks are shown to improve the quality of life of breast cancer patients after diagnosis and their views will help us to understand the cultural context within which Indian women experience breast cancer, which is important for clinicians involved in their care.

### The history of risk: a review [^1e2403bd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

It is a fascinating and uncommonly appreciated fact that our current "modern times," characterized by the technological advances that shape and define our daily lives, originate from the introduction of a Hindu-Arabic numbering system in Italy in the early 1200s. The ability of society to utilize numerals for arithmetic calculus propelled our understanding of odds, risk, and probability, starting from the time of the Renaissance in Europe to our current modern age in a global perspective. Most readers are likely not aware that almost all significant inventions, innovations, and developments in science, economics, technology, and health care in the past 200–300 years originated from the ability to predict future events and to make conscientious, balanced decisions on the risk and probability of our actions. The revolutionary "risk movement" was capitalized during the Renaissance and brought to fruition in the sixteenth and seventeenth century in France, Italy, and Germany by a few selected risk-takers who dared to think outside of the religious boundaries of their time. These heuristic thinkers and pioneers showed courage in defying the state-of-the-art rules which had historically been defined and enforced by society and religion. Pragmatically speaking, what distinguishes ten-thousands of years of the history of humankind from our current "modern times" has been almost exclusively driven by the introduction of probability theory and risk management. Before the sixteenth century, humankind was guided by their faith and belief in fate and divine intervention. The incoming understanding and new mastery of risk, which is in essence owed to the introduction of the Hindu-Arabic numbering system to Italy in the early 1200s, led to the evolution of our modern society in the twenty-first century. Impressively, the precursor of our modern numerals dates back to the brilliant Indian mathematician Brahmagupta, who also introduced the number "zero" in his encompassing treatise "The Opening of the Universe" (Brāhmasphutasiddhānta) in 628 AD. The age of the crusades in the Middle East allowed for Western civilization to collide with the Arabic empire during the Medieval period. The Arabs had previously introduced the Hindu numbering system after their invasion of India. Dice games that were brought to Europe through the crusaders set the basis for our modern game of Craps. Interestingly, Al-Zahr (the Arabic word for dice) provided the root for our modern designation of "hazard." As surgeons expose their patients to hazard/risk on a daily basis, it appears pertinent to reflect on the historic origin of probability theory and risk management, to improve the understanding of these crucial entities as part of the surgical decision-making.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^fd45418a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

These limitations are offset by important strengths. Previous accounts had theorized the secular transition as uniform. We propose that the secular transition follows three distinct steps. Since modernization renders religious solutions to life's problems less efficient, populations drop religious traits in the P-I-B sequence. Previous tests of the secular transition model were limited to the western world. Our analysis applies and tests the model successfully across all continents. Previous studies suggested that the secular transition model might be restricted to traditionally Christian countries. Our analysis reveals the model may apply just as well to countries that are traditionally Muslim, Buddhist or Hindu (more time will need to pass before we know conclusively). An additional strength of our study lies in the robustness of our findings across multiple datasets. Specifically, we observe consistent evidence for the hypothesized three-step pattern in both the Pew dataset and in analyses of the WVS/EVS data, the latter replicated using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs.

How do religious resurgences fit with this model of the stages of the secular transition? The 20th century has witnessed notable religious resurgences, including the emergence of the Pentecostal movement, the widespread resurgence of Islam in various countries since the 1970s, and the Orthodox resurgence in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's disintegration. Our answer is multifaceted. The combined influence of communist repression, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the Orthodox resurgence is evident in the data. Countries that have experienced these three phenomena do not conform to the expected pattern predicted by the model, instead exhibiting limited or no cohort differences in religiosity indicators. It is possible that the interplay of secularization and resurgence cancel each other out, but further investigation is necessary to confirm this. However, the Pentecostal and Muslim resurgences do not appear in our data. Our hypothesis is that these resurgences are an inherent aspect of the broader process of modernization and secularization. While they temporarily reinvigorate religion within society, they do not alter the overarching secularization trend.

### Kumbh mela religious gathering as a massive superspreading event: potential culprit for the exponential surge of COVID-19 cases in India [^219e12da]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The Kumbh Mela is a significant religious gathering of millions of Hindu devotees in India. It is celebrated on certain auspicious days in the Hindu calendar and attracts millions of pilgrims across the country. Despite the religious intention of millions of Hindu devotees, it raised public health concerns as it became a massive superspreading event for COVID-19. Being the second most populous country, India became the second most affected country during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the arrival of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and the presence of the double mutated variant, which was first identified in India, the Kumbh Mela probably aggravated the country's COVID-19 situation which resulted in an uncontrollable second wave. Several cases of COVID-19 across India had been contact-traced to returnees from the event who acted as a nidus to help spread the infection. As a consequence, India's healthcare system was severely challenged as a result of the overwhelming hospitalizations and increasing fatalities resulting in an acute manpower shortage in healthcare along with the depletion of drugs and medical supplies despite being one of the largest pharmaceutical hubs globally. Leaders and governments around the world should learn from India's experience and thereby take preventive measures to manage potential superspreading events to curb the spike of COVID-19 cases.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^6df4d979]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Religiosity tends to decline across generations. However, religious decline is more pronounced in some countries and the diminishing aspects of religion vary by context. To explain such variation, we extend the general secular transition model, which proposes that countries undergo a similar process of secularization beginning at different points in time. We explain that secular transition happens in three steps: first, public ritual participation declines; second, the importance of religion to individuals declines; and third, people shed religious affiliation. We test this model using datasets from surveys in 111 countries (Pew Research Center), 58 countries (World Values Survey and European Values Study (WVS/EVS)), and a subset of 17 countries measured in at least five WVS/EVS waves. We show the model fits countries with Christian, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist pluralities. While Eastern post-Soviet countries deviate from this pattern, traditionally Muslim countries appear to follow its early stages. However, we recommend caution in interpreting longitudinal claims, due to limited data.

### Kumbh mela religious gathering as a massive superspreading event: potential culprit for the exponential surge of COVID-19 cases in India [^e839f13f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The abovementioned recommendations and strategies can be emulated by other countries to prevent potential superspreading events such as what happened in India. Unfortunately, the case of Kumbh Mela as the likely culprit for the surge of COVID-19 cases in India's second wave presented how complacency in observing COVID-19 preventive protocols and underestimating viral transmission have gone awry. Since this religious gathering depicts how societal and cultural underpinnings play a critical role in people's behaviors, early engagement of communities and understanding people's knowledge, attitudes, and practices are of great importance in designing emergency health responses specifically in the preventive and mitigation phases.

It has been quite unfortunate that a large majority of people who attended Kumbh Mela to celebrate life have ironically faced the grim reality of having to face death themselves or among those around them. The COVID-19 situation in India is surely beyond heartbreaking. Societal beliefs and practices of people may at times be detrimental to themselves and others if observed without attention to public health concerns. As the global community suffers from the pandemic crisis, this article provides a perspective on how societies can help mitigate the further spread of the virus through observing COVID-19 preventive practices. Hence, everyone must remember to continue to remain vigilant with leaders and governments around the world hopefully learning from this ordeal, to prevent potential superspreading events from occurring in the future.

 — The Puranas, scriptures of ancient India

The Himalaya, "abode of snow," dominates the landscape of Nepal. Home of the highest peaks in the world, including Mount Everest, the country is traversed and bound by the massive range. "In a hundred ages of the gods, I could not tell thee of the glories of the Himalaya," elegize Hindu texts. A barrier to the movement of people for thousands of years, the slopes, glaciers, rivers, and lakes associated with the range discouraged outside interference and military adventures. In the remote gorges, valleys, and high plateaus, flourished instead the individual and unique cultures of a diverse population.

Landlocked in the south by India, the north by Tibet, present-day Nepal historically comprised the kingdoms of the Kathmandu Valley. At the crossroads of trade and multiple religious traditions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism), the valley became a shared sacred site, a focus of social and cultural exchange, and the creative locus of much Himalayan art. The symbiosis of Hinduism and Buddhism is reflected in the art of the indigenous Newar.

When famed Chinese envoy Wang Hsüan-tse visited Nepal in the 7th century, he wrote with admiration of the metalwork in King Narendradeva's palace in Kathmandu and mentioned the king's elaborate belt decorated with golden images of Buddha. He also noted many architectural marvels and houses embellished with sculptures and paintings.

### A shared Y-chromosomal heritage between muslims and hindus in India [^86f07341]. Human Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

Arab forces conquered the Indus Delta region in 711 AD: and, although a Muslim state was established there, their influence was barely felt in the rest of South Asia at that time. By the end of the tenth century, Central Asian Muslims moved into India from the northwest and expanded throughout the subcontinent. Muslim communities are now the largest minority religion in India, comprising more than 138 million people in a predominantly Hindu population of over one billion. It is unclear whether the Muslim expansion in India was a purely cultural phenomenon or had a genetic impact on the local population. To address this question from a male perspective, we typed eight microsatellite loci and 16 binary markers from the Y chromosome in 246 Muslims from Andhra Pradesh, and compared them to published data on 4,204 males from East Asia, Central Asia, other parts of India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran, the Middle East, Turkey, Egypt and Morocco. We find that the Muslim populations in general are genetically closer to their non-Muslim geographical neighbors than to other Muslims in India, and that there is a highly significant correlation between genetics and geography (but not religion). Our findings indicate that, despite the documented practice of marriage between Muslim men and Hindu women, Islamization in India did not involve large-scale replacement of Hindu Y chromosomes. The Muslim expansion in India was predominantly a cultural change and was not accompanied by significant gene flow, as seen in other places, such as China and Central Asia.

### When the glass is half full: early life experiences and adult optimism in 22 countries [^e69678bc]. Npj Mental Health Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimism holds a deep-rooted tradition in many world religions, especially in the so-called "salvation religions" (e.g. Christianity, Islam, Jainism, Buddhism, etc.) that emphasize liberation through means such as faith and good deeds. Prior empirical evidence has suggested that having a religious upbringing is associated with greater likelihood of exhibiting elements of positive psychological functioning in adulthood (e.g. greater purpose in life), although its association with optimism has seldom been examined directly. This study provides novel evidence on a strong dose-response association between religious service attendance during childhood and higher levels of adult optimism on average across countries. Interestingly, the country-specific results further indicate that the associations hold in some of the most secular countries(e.g. Japan, Sweden, Hong Kong, U.K.). We speculate that individuals who participate in religious congregations in secular regions are likely those with a particularly strong sense of faith, meaning, and hope.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^4aee4cc9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We have presented a revised model of secular transition according to which cohorts drop dimensions of religiosity in a specific order over time, abandoning higher involvement dimensions sooner than lower involvement dimensions. According to the model, religiosity differences show up first in public ritual attendance, then private importance of religiosity, and finally nominal belonging (the P-I-B sequence). The model implies rationality in the sense of dropping more costly religious traits first (Supplementary Discussion 1).

This model addresses the puzzle of variation in cohort differences across countries and indicators of religiosity worldwide. It predicts that a country at a certain threshold of modernization will enter a secular transition process. During this process, younger cohHorts become consecutively less religious than older cohorts.

The P-I-B sequence can be perceived in traditionally Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu, as well as traditionally Christian countries. In traditionally Christian countries, the full sequence can be observed. In traditionally Muslim countries, only the two first steps become apparent. In traditionally Buddhist/Hindu countries, the sequence is clearly discernible, but the estimations for participation are to be interpreted with caution since participation was measured differently in different surveys. The P-I-B sequence can furthermore be demonstrated both for women and men.

One group of countries does not follow the predictions of the model: eastern, post-communist countries. We argue that the specific history of a communist past with state repression and a societal crisis in 1990, has led to a transitory nationalist-religious upswing that currently masks the longer secular transition trend.

### Demographic variation in pain across 22 countries [^5993f02d]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Measures

Demographics variables

Continuous age was classified as 18–24, 25–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and 80 or older. Gender was assessed as male, female, or other. Marital status was assessed as single/never married, married, separated, divorced, widowed, and domestic partner. Employment was assessed as employed, self-employed, retired, student, homemaker, unemployed and searching, and other. Education was assessed as up to 8 years, 9–15 years, and 16+ years. Religious service attendance was assessed as more than once/week, once/week, one-to-three times/month, a few times/year, or never. Immigration status was dichotomously assessed with: "Were you born in this country, or not?" Religious tradition/affiliation with categories of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Sikhism, Baha'i, Jainism, Shinto, Taoism, Confucianism, Primal/Animist/Folk religion, Spiritism, African-Derived, some other religion, or no religion/atheist/agnostic; precise response categories varied by country. Racial/ethnic identity was assessed in some, but not all, countries, with response categories varying by country. For additional details on the assessments see the GFS codebook or Crabtree et al.

Outcome variable

Our pain measure comes from the following question: 'How much bodily pain have you had during the past 4 weeks?' Respondents could answer a lot, some, not very much, or none at all. To test the hypotheses about the proportion of people in pain, in our main analyses this variable was dichotomized as A lot/some (1) vs. not very much/none at all (0). We also conducted post-hoc sensitivity analysis with alternative dichotomization points including A lot (1) vs some/not very much/none at all (0) and A lot/some/not very much (1) vs none at all (0).

### Clarifying karma for culturally concordant care [^735c3e1e]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

We thank the authors for this timely review highlighting how culture influences the communication preferences for Asian patients with cancer. As they note, religious beliefs affect these considerations, and they recommend clinicians use religious terminology to demonstrate their understanding of Hindu beliefs. However, we hope to provide a more nuanced understanding of the belief in karma in contrast to the authors' presentation of this concept, which we feel may inadvertently propagate the notion that Hindu patients may prefer suffering over symptom management at the end of life.

Karma, or action, is the principle of cause and effect where actions produce consequences across multiple rebirths (ie, reincarnation), and the aim of life for Hindus is to liberate oneself from this karmically induced cycle of rebirth (moksha). While specific understanding of karmic consequences varies significantly across and within religions (eg, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism), most agree that the intent and performance of an action are governed by free will. The process by which karmic consequences manifest across lifetimes is, however, generally beyond human perception or control. Therefore, the doctrines of karma and rebirth emphasize positive future action as a means to correct the past, not the endurance of suffering. In the context of serious illness, while some may interpret their illness as a consequence of negative past actions, greater weight would likely be placed on reducing symptoms to continue karmically beneficial activities important to one's values, such as prayer or charity. According to this framework, few Hindus would argue that foregoing symptom management produces a longitudinal karmic benefit, as has been implied in case reportsand literature reviews, which have concluded that end-of-life comfort is only concordant with Christianity and Judaism but not with Hinduism or Buddhism. We worry that this misunderstanding may widen inequities in care, especially when previous studies of Asian patients in the United States, Canada, and Indiahave conversely demonstrated how the belief in karma can coexist with symptom management.

Continuous age was classified as 18–24, 25–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and 80 or older. Gender was assessed as male, female, or other. Marital status was assessed as single/never married, married, separated, divorced, widowed, and domestic partner. Employment was assessed as employed, self-employed, retired, student, homemaker, unemployed and searching, and others. Education was assessed as up to 8 years, 9–15 years, and 16+ years. Religious service attendance frequency was assessed as more than once/week, once/week, one-to-three times/month, a few times per year, or never. Immigration status was dichotomously assessed with: "Were you born in this country, or not?" Religious tradition/affiliation with categories of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Sikhism, Baha'i, Jainism, Shinto, Taoism, Confucianism, Primal/Animist/Folk religion, Spiritism, African-Derived, some other religion, or no religion/atheist/agnostic; precise response categories varied by country. Racial/ethnic identity was assessed in some, but not all, countries, with response categories varying by country. For additional details on the assessments, see the COS GFS codebook or ref.

Outcome variable

Self-rated mental health was assessed using a single-item measure: "How would you rate your overall mental health?" with response options ranging from 0 = Poor, to 10 = Excellent. We analyzed the mean of these as a continuous variable. Single-item SRMH measures have been widely used in epidemiological research studies, including the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI), the Canadian Community Health Survey, and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. In addition, single-item SRMH measures have demonstrated strong construct validity, as they are associated with clinical measures of mental health, psychiatric hospitalizations, and suicide risk.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^da8f8504]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Validity issues and robustness checks

In what follows, we describe how we have addressed possible validity issues.
In our analyses, we have assumed that the cohort differences with younger cohorts being less religious than older cohorts are caused by cohort effects and not life-cycle effects. This assumption may be criticized. We acknowledge that the evidence corroborating the assumption is stronger for western than for non-western countries. However, proponents of a life-cycle argument would have to explain why - if their assumptions were correct - in very religious countries, people would have more participation as they age, in medium religious countries, people would have more participation, importance, and belonging as they get older, and in very secular countries, the population would increase affiliation as it ages. It seems unlikely that someone would try to make such an argument.
Another issue for our analysis concerns measurement invariance. Indicators of religiosity may be non-comparable across countries since the actions, beliefs and values measured mean something different in different religions. In congregational religions such as Christianity or Islam religionists gather for public rituals in a community or congregation and often see their identity strongly in terms of this community. In non-congregational religions such as Shinto, Buddhism or Hinduism, the emphasis lies more on individual practice and public rituals are seen as beneficial, but not necessary. Public rituals are not held in a regularly occurring religious service of a group (or congregation); rather, individuals and families seek out temples and shrines when they feel the need to do so. There is often no felt belonging to an imagined large confessional group, but there may be the strong feeling of belonging to an ethnic or caste group; furthermore, individuals and especially families have links to specific temples or shrines; however, they may also worship at other places and to gods, buddhas, or kamis of different religious traditions. –. The effect may then be that, assuming a real latent level of religiosity, the indicator over- or underestimates religiosity. We address the problem by analyzing cohort differences, comparing an older and a younger cohort in every country. This controls for possible bias. The problem remains, however, when we construct our measure of country secularity where biased estimators may bias the positioning of the countries. To address this point, we conduct robustness tests with different ways of constructing country secularity (Supplementary Methods 7). On the subject of measurement invariance, our model makes an additional point. Studies that test measurement invariance for religiosity items over a large number of countries and that assume all countries to be "at the same time" may get it wrong. They may conclude that there is measurement invariance, while, in fact, countries are at different points in time on the secular transition and therefore must show different correlational structures.
An important question is the choice of indicators of religiosity. What we measure with "importance of religion in one's life" is an indicator for personal religiosity in a very broad sense including religious beliefs and personal practices such as prayer. These different elements, and especially belief variables vary strongly across different religious and cultural areas. We have therefore chosen to use only one indicator both in the Pew study and the WVS/EVS data, whose meaning seems to be relatively well comparable across cultures and who clearly taps personal religiosity. As a robustness check, we investigate how well our results hold when measuring the "importance" dimension in two other ways: (a) with a composite measure of importance of religion and prayer; and (b) with a composite measure of importance of religion, importance of god, belief in god, and self-description as a religious person (Supplementary Methods 8).
We do not use a measure of modernization (e.g. the HDI index) as an independent variable, since we do not seek to causally explain secularization. Neither do we use such an indicator as a control, since we do not expect the secular transition to happen independently of modernization. Controlling for modernization (e.g. with an indicator such as the HDI) would then introduce bias rather than reduce it.
We model our three dependent variables using a sigmoid (inverse logit) function. We chose the logit function due to its intuitive interpretability compared to alternative link functions. However, one might question whether the results would differ under alternative specifications. A good alternative candidate would be the probit function (non-parametric functions are not feasible because of the relatively small number of countries). In Supplementary Methods 9 we show graphically that results look very similar with probit. AIC measures of logit and probit are also very close.
Our results are furthermore robust with respect to (a) varying the cut point with respect to cohorts; (b) varying the cut points with respect to attendance and importance of religion; (c) including or excluding the controls; including or excluding imputed values; including or excluding the weights in WVS/EVS data. (Supplementary Methods 10, 11, 12).

The 11th century was culturally and medicinally one of the most exciting periods in the history of Islam. Medicine of this day was influenced by the Greeks, Indians, Persians, Coptics, and Syriacs. One of the most prolific writers of this period was Ibn Jazlah, who resided in Baghdad in the district of Karkh. Ibn Jazlah made many important observations regarding diseases of the brain and spinal cord. These contributions and a review of the life and times of this early Muslim physician are presented.

### Childhood predictors of suffering in adulthood across 22 countries [^9fc2659d]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Religious affiliation at age 12 was also assessed in all countries, but there were considerable cross-country differences in the response categories endorsed by participants because some religious affiliations are only applicable in certain countries and not others. Religious affiliation at age 12 response category options included Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Sikhism, Baha'i, Jainism, Shinto, Taoism, Confucianism, primal/animist/folk religion, Spiritism, Umbanda, Candomblé, and other African-derived religions, Chinese folk/traditional religion, some other religion, or no religion/atheist/agnostic. When more than 5% of a within-country sample endorsed the no religion/atheist/agnostic category, this was used as the reference category in the country-specific analyses; otherwise, the most prominent religious group was used. Additionally, all religious affiliation categories endorsed by less than 3% of a within-country sample were collapsed into a single religious affiliation category. Racial/ethnic identity was assessed in most (18/22) countries, and response categories varied across countries. Country-specific analyses used a binary racial/ethnic identity variable based on whether an individual was in the most prominent group in the sample versus a minority group. Additional details about the measurement of the predictors can be found in the Global Flourishing Study codebook.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^3ba510b2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

That having been said, African countries are still very religious and there is no African country approaching the middle or the end of the secular transition. Thus, only the future can tell whether they will take the third step, as predicted by our model. All European countries are in medium or later stages of the secular transition; for these countries, both our statistical and historical evidence do indeed suggest a P-I-B trajectory. In these countries, participation started to drop in the 19th century, the drop in finding religion important followed subsequently, and the drop in religious belonging started in the 1960s.

Religious decline in countries with different historical religions

The secular transition and the P-I-B sequence manifest in countries with traditionally Christian, Buddhist/Hindu, and Muslim backgrounds, although traditionally Muslim countries only exhibit the first two stages (P-I) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Methods 2). In 69% of the world's countries and territories, Christians are the largest religious group. Accordingly, most countries in our datasets are traditionally Christian, and these countries span the range of the secular transition. Here, the P-I-B sequence is most clearly visible. While our dataset includes fewer traditionally Buddhist and Hindu countries, the P-I-B sequence remains discernible. We acknowledge that participation in acts of worship at temples within Asian religions differs from participation in congregational religions. For this reason, we employed a specialized measure tailored to East Asian societies in order to accurately assess participation in that region (see the methods section under dependent variables below). Notably, when using data specifically designed to measure participation at Buddhist sites, we observe the same age-related patterns in attendance that are evident in religions emphasizing congregational worship. This is particularly remarkable given that some scholars have argued that concepts such as participation or belonging are not or only with difficulty applicable to non-congregational Asian religions such as Buddhism or Hinduism –.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^6252af3f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Religiosity-cohort gap in participation, importance, and belonging in different countries and majority religions (country secularity ranked).

Pew data. All countries shown, except eastern post-communist countries. Differences in percentage of weekly attendance, high importance of religion and religious belonging between younger (< 40) and older (+ 40) individuals in different countries. Positive differences show younger individuals being less religious than older individuals. The countries on the y axis are ranked from most religious (top) to least religious (bottom). We plot the 95% confidence intervals. For better visibility, only half of the confidence interval is plotted - for positive percentage values at the right of the respective percentage bar, for negative percentage values at the left of the respective percentage bar.

In the case of traditionally Muslim countries, we find that they are all situated in the first stages of the secular transition and only show the first two steps of the P-I-B sequence. These two steps, however, are clearly identifiable and their difference is statistically significant. For younger cohorts, we observe: participation – importance: −0.536 [−0.612; −0.46]; For older cohorts, we find: participation – importance: −0.506 [−0.586; −0.424]. The generational differences between younger and older respondents in each of the two indicators participation: −0.171 [−0.254; −0.09], and importance: 0.141 [−0.218; −0.067] are equally significant.

Due to limits of data and the current status of the secular transition in countries with non-Christian religious pluralities, we cannot be certain that these countries will follow the stages predicted by our model. The number of traditionally Buddhist and Hindu countries in our dataset is small. Consider, for example, that the only countries in the world where Hindus are the largest group are Nepal, India, and Mauritius. The only country with a Jewish majority is Israel; with respect to the secular transition, this country seems to be, as already noted, an outlier.

### Religion and the World Health Organization: an evolving relationship [^46c6eeae]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

During the 1970s and 1980s, ideological and geopolitical interests had advanced the 'spiritual dimension' in the WHO's attempt to roll out primary healthcare. The 1990s had seen little development, but towards the end of the decade and the early 2000s, the spread of neoliberalism and increased reliance on partnerships with civil society once more rendered religious actors a valued resource. Rather than emerging from WHA discussions on an ethical framework in the sense of Mahler's 'ennobling ideas', this relationship evolved from a pragmatic recognition that the achievement of the WHO's institutional goals necessitated cooperation with civil society, including religious actors.

As Grillshas suggested, the relationship between multilateral organisations and religious actors remains fraught by apparent contradictions: even if a closer relationship is desired by both parties — as in the recent 'pragmatic turn' — such engagement may be feared to enable groups working to undermine the secular mandate of multilaterals accorded by their member states. Western liberal values, which have dominated the UN system since its creation by allied post-War intellectual elites, are perceived as a foreign ideology by many member states and at times compete with core values of religious actors, such as community participation. The distinction between 'rational' multilateral and 'value-based' religious actors — problematic both because it implies that multilaterals are devoid of ethical values and that the values of religious actors contradict reason, the influence of the American religious right and more generally the suspected allegiance of multilaterals to the private sector, continue to create strong opposition to cooperation. This adds to practical concerns relating to the quality of care, transparency and accountability of health programmes operated or funded by religious actors, conflicting and incomplete data and exaggerated claims regarding the contribution of religion to global health.

### Teaching spirituality to humanitarians [^29fa5490]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

New era of moral dilemmas for humanitarians

As we enter the global humanitarian arena on a wider scale, new issues challenging our views of morality and ethics will certainly present themselves. These include, but are not limited, to the sexual harassment scandal in OXFAM, a worldwide humanitarian organisation, and genocide in Myanmar. Should institutions and individuals work with such organisations, or in these countries, where human rights are routinely violated or shun them? An argument could be made for either position; engagement to bring about a change or shun them to enforce change — a decision based on a person's beliefs and conscience.

Our own experience illustrates the moral versus ethical dilemmas in our humanitarian work. High net worth Guyanese individuals and politicians generally travel to the USA for treatment even for those procedures that are performed routinely in Guyana. Jindal's team does not perform surgical procedures that are done by the local surgeons, so as not to take away their source of income. In course of their humanitarian mission, a well-known politician approached the team to perform a routine cataract operation, which would avoid him the inconvenience of going to the USA. This posed a dilemma for the team on whether to operate or supervise the local surgeon. Jindal's team eventually operated on him as the team felt that positive publicity generated by operating on a well-known local politician would help the mission in the long run. Another illustrative example is that the benefactor of the author's humanitarian mission to Guyana is an Indo-Guyanese living in New York. He was forced out of Guyana as a young child due to a brutal dictatorship by an Afro-Guyanese. The population of Guyana is evenly divided between those of African and Indian (originally from India) heritage. At the beginning of the mission in 2007, he wished that our efforts are directed ONLY towards the 'Indian' half of the population. This policy would produce an inequitable result. Jindal's team was able to convince the benefactor that adherence to our legal and moral code would produce a more sustainable outcome by providing care to all eligible patients, regardless of their ethnicity.

### Interdisciplinary perspectives on' what matters most' in the cultural shaping of health-related stigma in Indonesia [^a5297df3]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This qualitative study on 'WMM' and health-related stigma in Indonesia used in-depth interviews and a group discussion to explore the perspectives of scholars who interact with health-related stigma in various Indonesian contexts. This study is part of a larger research project and precedes a study in which the perspectives of persons affected by stigmatised conditions are ascertained (Sopamena et al, in preparation).

Context of the study

The collectivist nature of Indonesian culture plays a significant role in individuals' daily lives, relationships and beliefs. Collectivism has been strongly influenced by sociocultural beliefs, norms and values towards community members' attitudes and forms of behaviour. Social norms are also heavily influenced by religious and local customs (adat)and Indonesia's culture is interwoven with various religious aspects. External influences from other cultures, like Hinduism and Buddhism from India, started to pervade Indonesia from the beginning of the first century. Islam gradually spread among the population through Arabic traders, followed by European missionaries who introduced Christianity during the colonial period. Currently, over 87% of Indonesians identify as Muslim. An example of the interconnectedness of culture and religion are the Walisongo (the Nine Saints), which adopted a humanist approach to gradually introduce Islamic values to the Javanese population who then held their own traditional values. Globalisation continues to impact culture and religion, for example through human rights, feminism and beliefs in equality. In this study, we understand religion as being a part of culture.

Study population and recruitment

Study participants were recruited using purposive sampling based on predetermined criteria. Women were made up approximately half of the participants, to include male and female gender perspectives, since gender was thought to impact WMM. The inclusion criteria for participants were to be (a) a native Indonesian expert in one of the following disciplines: anthropology, sociology, public health, psychology and/or medicine, who had lived in Indonesia for most of their life; (b) involved in work concerning health-related stigma in Indonesia; and (c) able to participate in an online interview with the researchers. Emails were sent to such experts and snowball sampling was used to find additional participants from information provided by initial participants.

### Is decolonisation sufficient? [^843e66a6]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

A similar pattern can be traced in the case of India's nutrition and food policy. In postindependence India, the recognition of the superiority of animal sources of protein (eggs, milk and meat) and its inclusion in the diet, was systematically erased in favour of vegetarian sources of protein in the name of economics — an analysis by Indian scientists who were themselves vegetarians. Recently there has been consistent opposition from Dalit ('lower' caste) groups to what are seen as Brahminical ('upper' caste) food practices, within which even the inclusion of eggs in mid-day meals for school children is a topic of debate.NGOs who support the government in providing mid-day meals have refused to provide eggs to poor, protein-deficient children because it goes against their religious beliefs. Criticism of such endeavours invite allegations of using 'cliched colonial tropes of starving children' (see, for instance, reference). What is more, 'scientific' commissions like the EAT Lancet Commission on Food Planet and Health are lauding India's experience to show that a plant-based diet is indeed implementable (see Karpagam's commentary on remarks by Brent Loken of the EAT Forum on the commission's launch in April 2019). As Karpagamrightly critiques 'these false notions only serve the purpose of reinforcing age-old casteist control of food policy-making by the vegetarians of the country, while erasing and criminalising the eating habits of the majority'. How do we analyse these examples from a decolonial perspective, and what lessons from history might we pay heed to?

### Fasting recovers age-related hypertension in the rats: reset of renal renin-angiotensin system components and klotho [^da2778cb]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Several studies suggest the anti-aging effects of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in rodent models. Beneficial effects of RAS blockers on aging through increased klotho and sirtuin expression and activation of vitamin D signaling parallel the effects of calorie restriction (CR) in delaying aging. Various models of fasting are common in several religious traditions such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, as well as in ascetic practices in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, etc. Numerous evidences show that fasting has a beneficial role on human health by improving various metabolic markers. Our recent findings revealed that the restoration of RAS equilibrium in both the aorta and heart may be a part of involving mechanisms of fasting benefits on its cardiovascular rejuvenation.

As mentioned above, imbalance of RAS is assumed to play in the progression of aging and aging-related disorders such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, osteoporosis, cancer and hypertension. In addition, local RAS elements in different tissues such as brain, heart, and kidney contribute to regulatory process and the aging of these organs. It seems that, effective interventions to delay local RAS age-related changes can be helpful in the prevention of age-related hypertension. Due to the lack of sufficient knowledge, in this study, age-related changes in kidney RAS components were evaluated. Then, the effect of a 3-month period of two fasting regimes, fasting one day per week (FW) or fasting every other day (EOD) on the components of renal RAS and arterial blood pressure in three age groups of rats was investigated.

### Hinduism and reproductive decision-making: karma, samsara, and the in-between [^156b3ff2]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2020). Medium credibility.

Investigations of the role of religious philosophy in reproductive decision-making has exclusively focused on Abrahamic traditions. However, those who practice Eastern religions, such as Hinduism, represent an increasing proportion of the population in the United States and may present for prenatal care. Here, we consider tenets of Hindu philosophy as they may pertain to decision-making surrounding women's pregnancy termination. Such tenets include the cycle of rebirth (samsara), karma, dharma, Hindu writing, and the multivalent nature of Hindu philosophy. Through this brief communication we hope to present a starting point for further exploration which will increase cultural competency of genetic counselors while enhancing awareness of variations of religious beliefs patients may hold.

### A cross-national analysis of sociodemographic variation in suffering across 22 countries [^6ebc00ce]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Sociodemographic variables

Seven sociodemographic variables were assessed consistently across the 22 countries: age, gender, marital status, employment status, years of education, frequency of religious service attendance, and immigration status. Continuous age was classified into 18–24, 25–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and 80 years or older categories. Gender was assessed as male, female, or other. Marital status was assessed as single/never married, married, separated, divorced, widowed, and domestic partner. Employment was assessed as employed, self-employed, retired, student, homemaker, unemployed and looking for a job, and none of these/other. Education was assessed as up to 8 years, 9–15 years, and 16 or more years. Frequency of religious service attendance was assessed as more than once a week, once a week, one-to-three times a month, a few times a year, and never. Immigration status was dichotomously assessed with an item that asked participants to report whether or not they had been born in the country where data collection was taking place.

Religious affiliation was also assessed in all countries, but there were considerable cross-country differences in the response categories endorsed by participants because some religious affiliations are only applicable in certain countries and not others. Religious affiliation response category options included Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Sikhism, Baha'i, Jainism, Shinto, Taoism, Confucianism, Primal/animist/folk religion, Spiritism, Umbanda, Candomblé, and other African-derived religions, Chinese folk/traditional religion, some other religion, or no religion/atheist/agnostic. Racial/ethnic identity was assessed in most (18/22) countries, and response categories varied across countries. Additional details about measurement of the sociodemographic variables can be found in the GFS Codebook.

### Controversies in faith and health care [^7574f3e2]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Differences in religious faith-based viewpoints (controversies) on the sanctity of human life, acceptable behaviour, health-care technologies and health-care services contribute to the widespread variations in health care worldwide. Faith-linked controversies include family planning, child protection (especially child marriage, female genital mutilation, and immunisation), stigma and harm reduction, violence against women, sexual and reproductive health and HIV, gender, end-of-life issues, and faith activities including prayer. Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and traditional beliefs have similarities and differences in their viewpoints. Improved understanding by health-care providers of the heterogeneity of viewpoints, both within and between faiths, and their effect on health care is important for clinical medicine, public-health programmes, and health-care policy. Increased appreciation in faith leaders of the effect of their teachings on health care is also crucial. This Series paper outlines some faith-related controversies, describes how they influence health-care provision and uptake, and identifies opportunities for research and increased interaction between faith leaders and health-care providers to improve health care.

Historical notes

The world's population in 2017 is approximately 7,515,600,000 inhabitants: in Asia: 4,478,320,000; in Africa: 1,246,510,000; in Europe: 739,210,000; in Latin America: 647,570,000; in North America: 363,224,000; and in Oceania: 40,470,000. Certain highlights matter: China: 1,372,100,000; India: 1,282,000,000; USA: 328,130,000; Indonesia: 260,580,000; Nigeria: 191,840,000; Russia: 143,376,000; Japan: 126,050,000.

The global situation is complicated and there are signals of change. A populist is leading the USA; his aggressive behavior with his allies and the type of introspective economic policy has no precedents in this country. Russia is trying to establish and safeguard its borders in the South and West which were lost in part after the fall of the USSR. At the same time, Russia is a major provider of gas to Finland, Germany, Ukraine, and other European countries. China settled its borders invading Tibet and then controlling the sources of the main Chinese waterways and preserving these territories from the neighbors in the South by the Himalayas, and also controlling (albeit with continuous troubles) the remote region of Xingjiang. Now China expands peacefully in Africa creating macrostructures, railways, pipelines, and connections at low cost, negotiating primary natural products, and selling mobile phones and motorcycles to a wide public. China also would like to have its own control between the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans beyond Panama by financing and controlling a new canal in Nicaragua. Islamic countries in Africa and Asia still need to overcome their internal ethnic and religious barriers before being considered motors of humanistic and scientific progress. Sub-Saharan Africa is still a failed great promise. Central and South America may progress in the coming years provided that resources are better distributed and obsolete governs are replaced by democratic ones. Disarmament and negotiations with the FARC and reduction of narcotrafficking in Colombia is encouraging, but the situation is worsening in Mexico.

### The hajj and COVID-19: how the pandemic shaped the world's largest religious gathering [^07f9fa73]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The Hajj pilgrimage, one of the five pillars of Islam, is held in Saudi Arabia in the second week of Dhu'l-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar. It is one of the world's largest mass gatherings, constituting more than 2.5 million Muslim pilgrims from more than 180 countries. The COVID-19 pandemic posed a significant public health threat for such mass gatherings. Thus, a health risk assessment for the 2020 Hajj was held by the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health and the WHO Collaborating Centre for Mass Gatherings Medicine, which concluded that foreign pilgrims should be excluded from the 2020 Hajj and that the number of pilgrims should be significantly reduced. Timely decisions allowed the Saudi government to conduct the Hajj, despite an initial postponement. However, the number of pilgrims was significantly downscaled, and extensive new protocols were set in place because of the pandemic. This article aims to shed light on the challenges faced and efforts made by Saudi Arabia to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 during the religious proceedings of the Hajj.

### Engaging globally with how to achieve healthy societies: insights from India, Latin America and east and Southern Africa [^4f0649a9]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Insights from across diverse ideas

The findings highlight the influence of often coexisting and contrasting paradigms and approaches to healthy societies. While the trajectories reflect different cultures and political economy contexts, they suggest some shared insights for future engagement on healthy societies.

Overcoming the consequences of imposed paradigms

The evidence points to how an imposed pathogenic paradigm in the three southern regions undermined the local cultural understanding of health. The application of tropical medicine, the coercive segregation of local populations, the promotion of selective PHC as better aligned to neoliberal reforms and of allopathic medicine as a catch-up with Western development asserted a superiority of Western approaches and neoliberal policies, discounting, suppressing and even criminalising local systems. When combined with eugenic theories, a biomedical focus enabled racist or discriminatory discourses in health. In more recent years, significant technical and financial resources from private actors, international and global agencies reinforced a selective, vertical disease-focused approach.

In all three regions, precolonial ideas, outlined in box 1, re-emerged in new forms in anticolonial and antineoliberal movements, with ideas of BV and ICH; Gandhi's mind, body, soul and community health paradigm in India; and the promotion of reciprocity and claims over natural resources articulated by ESA countries. An understanding of healthy societies has thus been linked to reclaiming cultures for dispossessed countries and people, a process that is ongoing, given the deep link between health, identity and justice. At the same time, such indigenous practice may be susceptible to manipulation, as, for example, has been observed in Hindu nationalism's use of Ayurveda to drive forms of ethnic exclusion and a discourse of obligation and security over that of rights and citizenship.

A tropical medicine exceptionalism in how healthy societies are achieved in the south can be argued to have raised a barrier to the mutually useful exchange of learning between all regions on shared population health problems. It blocked for decades the wider uptake of useful positive learning from southern regions on local food and dietary practices; community health systems and community health workers; and on cultural and psychosocial integration in health, despite the relevance for multicultural, multiethnic societies in diverse regions. Ideas on healthy societies call for openness to 'reverse innovation', moving beyond the current dominance of institutions in high-income countries as a source of global ideas towards greater mutual horizontal exchange between and across regions.

### Spiritual fitness: a new dimension in Alzheimer's disease prevention [^c27da3c8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

RELIGION, SPIRITUALITY, HEALTH, AND WELL-BEING

It is a major premise of this article that today's detrimental stressful existence impedes the creation of a healthy lifestyle, including psychological and spiritual well-being, while well-being augments brain function and may prevent AD. Most people intuitively know what religion is: the practice of a certain set of rules, rituals, and traditions that bring one closer to God. However, what is spirituality itself?

In 2008, Koenig argued that spirituality should be sharply defined, especially from a research perspective. In his 2020 Handbook of Spirituality, Religion, and Mental Health, he states, however, that people in Western nations are going through a transition to less religious identity over all. For exa-mple, he cites that 89% of Americans believe in God, 90% pray on a regular basis, yet only 77% report aff-iliation with a religious group. However, 82% acknowledge the need for spiritual growth. Also of note is that 84% of the world's population is religiously affiliated, and 68% of unaffiliated individuals believe in a higher power. Additionally, according to a Yoga Alliance/Yoga International study published in 2016, at least 36 million Americans practice yoga and 300 million do so worldwide, while 80 million Americans are likely to try yoga within 12 months. The number of people who meditate in the US is now at least 35 million.

### Adolescent and young adult tattooing, piercing, and scarification [^cb690502]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Scarification practices and evidence base — scarification is the practice of intentionally irritating the skin to cause a permanent pattern of scar tissue, with studies describing high rates among international communities yet no studies reported from the United States. There was some renewed interest in the 1990s and 2000s as a movement to revive indigenous rituals from around the world, embracing a more authentic or spiritual body experience.

### History of leprosy in India: an overview of historic and modern contributions [^4fae50a5]. Clinics in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, India holds the unenviable position of the origin of leprosy. The disease is thought to have spread, via trade and war, to China, Egypt, and the Middle East, and later to Europe and the Americas. From antiquity to modernity, Indian society treated leprosy singularly for custom and law, a response shaped by both scientific knowledge and cultural attitudes. Over the past centuries, tireless research by eminent physicians and scientists working in India have helped establish a better understanding of clinical, bacteriologic, pathologic, and immunologic aspects of leprosy. Therapeutic modalities that were initially restricted to chaulmoogra expanded to include newer anti-leprotic medications and even surgical reconstruction of deformities. India's future challenges in leprosy control include stigmata, educational knowledge gaps, and multiple systems of medicine. This contribution is an attempt to comprehensively discuss the historic aspect of this exclusive disease focusing on the varied scientific contributions from India.

### What does It mean to "Age well" among British and javanese older adults? A cross-cultural qualitative study [^fd3e0d19]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

I think it's a Christian outlook. It's a spiritual and faith thing that supports my ability to enjoy life and to be content. In terms of our attendance at church and our reading and prayer, that is key to the way we are, I feel. The way that God has been faithful to us and given us the life that we have at the moment. (B12)

Praying is good. It turns out that the reward that can already be felt is being tranquil. Practicing the night prayer, the dhikr, and getting close to Allah is very good. Talking to Allah makes me feel very good. (J14)

For some, the primary driving force behind their engagement in religious practices stemmed from their conviction in the existence of an afterlife. However, Javanese participants more frequently expressed this sentiment than British participants:

Religious practices are conducted to provide for the afterlife. The next day, when you leave this world as you are getting older, what you're looking for is having enough provision in the afterlife so that Allah will accept it and grant us a heaven. (J9)

Social and religious activities were undertaken with the purpose of ensuring sufficient provisions for the afterlife, but also because they provided tranquillity and peace in the here and now.

Based on the available data, it is evident that there exists a potential for interaction between the various themes (see Figure 1). Good health, a positive outlook, a sense of safety, and spirituality and religiosity have the power to improve social relationships, and so contribute to the feeling of aging well. Furthermore, although most factors have direct benefits for aging well, in some cases, health may also play an important role by allowing older people to participate in religious activities and hence impacts aging well indirectly in this way. Furthermore, it is worth emphasizing that spirituality and religiosity may generate positive viewpoints among older people, which eventually contributes to aging well.

Traditional ways of healing illnesses originating in ancient societies are called complementary medicine today. Many of the traditional medical systems are based on sound fundamental principles and centuries of practices by healers. This article reviews some of the most commonly practiced traditional medical systems. A common factor noted in several traditional systems is a holistic approach to the well-being of a person's body, mind, and spirit.

### Fertility intentions and the way they change following birth-a prospective longitudinal study [^51cbcc4f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Macro level factors such as societal normative expectations, religion, and policies affect fertility intentions and rates. The current study was conducted in Israel, which is considered to be a modern yet traditional and pronatalist society. Israel has the highest fertility rates in the Western industrialized world, with an average of 3.16 children per woman. Despite declining fertility rates in the developed world in the last few decades, Israeli fertility rates remain high. Correspondingly, voluntary childlessness is rare and not a socially acceptable decision. Women's fertility intentions in Israel are formed vastly through tradition and gender roles, in addition to the predominant nationalistic and religious sentiments. Judaism, the dominant religion in Israel (74.3% of the population), emphasizes motherhood and fertility as an important role for women: The religious commandment states that one should "be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth" (Genesis 1:28) and fertility itself is considered a blessing (Deuteronomy 7: 13–14). The Muslim population in Israel is also characterized by high birth rates, but since the current research was conducted among mostly Jewish women, we will not elaborate on that here.

### Moralistic gods, supernatural punishment and the expansion of human sociality [^fafce7c1]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Since the origins of agriculture, the scale of human cooperation and societal complexity has dramatically expanded. This fact challenges standard evolutionary explanations of prosociality because well-studied mechanisms of cooperation based on genetic relatedness, reciprocity and partner choice falter as people increasingly engage in fleeting transactions with genetically unrelated strangers in large anonymous groups. To explain this rapid expansion of prosociality, researchers have proposed several mechanisms. Here we focus on one key hypothesis: cognitive representations of gods as increasingly knowledgeable and punitive, and who sanction violators of interpersonal social norms, foster and sustain the expansion of cooperation, trust and fairness towards co-religionist strangers. We tested this hypothesis using extensive ethnographic interviews and two behavioural games designed to measure impartial rule-following among people (n = 591, observations = 35,400) from eight diverse communities from around the world: (1) inland Tanna, Vanuatu; (2) coastal Tanna, Vanuatu; (3) Yasawa, Fiji; (4) Lovu, Fiji; (5) Pesqueiro, Brazil; (6) Pointe aux Piments, Mauritius; (7) the Tyva Republic (Siberia), Russia; and (8) Hadzaland, Tanzania. Participants reported adherence to a wide array of world religious traditions including Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as notably diverse local traditions, including animism and ancestor worship. Holding a range of relevant variables constant, the higher participants rated their moralistic gods as punitive and knowledgeable about human thoughts and actions, the more coins they allocated to geographically distant co-religionist strangers relative to both themselves and local co-religionists. Our results support the hypothesis that beliefs in moralistic, punitive and knowing gods increase impartial behaviour towards distant co-religionists, and therefore can contribute to the expansion of prosociality.

### India | Yellow book… [^9a0ec3c5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Destination overview India is approximately one-third the size of the United States but has four times the population — over 1. 4 billion people — making it the most populous country in the world. Rich in history, culture, and diversity, India is the birthplace of four of the world's religions: Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Tuberculosis Approximately 25% of all tuberculosis cases worldwide are reported from India. Travelers planning to work in high-risk settings or in crowded institutions are at risk of exposure. Travelers visiting ill friends, visiting ill relatives, or engaging in congregate activities also can face TB exposure risk. Animal bites and wounds can transmit diseases other than rabies. Cellulitis, fasciitis, and wound infections can result from the scratch or bite of any animal. Potentially fatal to humans, B virus is carried by macaques.

These Old World monkeys inhabit many of the temples in India, scatter themselves in many tourist gathering places, and are kept as pets. Mass gatherings Drawing tens of millions of people, Kumbh Mela is the largest mass gathering event in the world. Celebrated according to the Hindu calendar, Kumbh Mela occurs 4 times over an approximately 12-year cycle. During each observance of this normally 4-month-long festival, pilgrims ritually bathe in 1 of 4 sacred rivers in India. Mass casualty trauma and transmission of antimicrobial-resistant organisms and enteric and respiratory pathogens are among the more serious risks to health and safety associated with attendance. Political and religious unrest Demonstrations and general strikes often cause inconvenience. Religious violence occurs occasionally. Travelers should obey curfews and travel restrictions and avoid demonstrations and rallies because of the potential for violence.

Medical tourism Well-trained, English-speaking healthcare professionals and low cost for high-quality treatment make India a healthcare destination for a mix of alternative, conventional, and wellness medicine.

### Israel: health and beyond [^051bf26e]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing-but fragile and limited-health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.

### Religion, women's health, and obstetrician-gynecologists [^e5e4ae44]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Religions continue to be a strong moral, even political, force in the world. They are often seen to be in conflict with women's health; we argue that this should not continue to be the case. The conflict can be traced back to when religions had their birth and early development in patriarchal communities in which women were marginalized to the edges of society. In addition, religious leadership has traditionally been dominated by men and exclusive of women. The recent introduction of new scientific technologies, which has empowered women to regulate and control their fertility, challenged traditional norms and raised a religious-inspired moral panic. However, a recent initiative has been gaining momentum. An enlightened religious leadership and a new generation of feminist religious activists are calling for a review of the original texts and a reinterpretation in a sociocultural context that is different from when they were first revealed. Obstetrician-gynecologists, while having to practice in a socioreligious context and continuing to face challenges in providing health care in religiously diverse societies, have a social responsibility to stand by women and to uphold that religions do not and should not stand in the way of advancing their health and rights.

### Tobacco industry misappropriation of American Indian culture and traditional tobacco [^cd477cda]. Tobacco Control (2018). Low credibility.

In a 1995 media profile on SFNTC, CEO Robin Sommers credited his "fascination with American Indian culture"for inspiring the marketing concept.

The initial thought had to do with American Indian use of tobacco in its natural state, honoring tradition, the respectful nature surrounding the American Indian use of tobacco. Inherent in that concept was tobacco without additives.

SFNTC created an image of their brand NAS as a specialty product too exclusive to be sold in the same venues as other commercial tobacco.NAS was sold directly to a small number of retailers, focusing on "health food stores, smoke shops… coffee bars, independent grocers, and gift stores"to further reinforce the 'natural' aspect of tobacco and join the broader health-conscious movement of the 1980s and 1990s. Part of this image was carefully cultivated by marketing products as 'additive-free' and using only certified organic tobacco. In 1996, SFNTC management recognised that consumers were becoming more interested in what they were putting into their bodies and started showing preference for organic and chemical-free options. SFNTC saw an opportunity to fill that niche within the cigarette world.

Research conducted by industry competitors found that the use of American Indian imagery by SFNTC served to "bond people with America's origins".PM found that the logos and graphics on NAS packaging led consumers to believe that smoking cigarettes was a normal human activity and that they were supporting a worthy Native cause (assuming that the brand was under American Indian ownership). Focus groups held by consultants for B&W found that the use of American Indian imagery contributed to consumers' perceptions that SFNTC was a small company creating a healthier, more natural product.PM concluded that the images used by SFNTC contributed significantly to smokers' emotional connection and loyalty with these products.

In one 1994 promotional document, SFNTC referred to the use of 'natural' tobacco as being closer to the way it was intended to be used — as part of American Indian traditions — and completely separate from nicotine addiction. The connection between traditional tobacco and the 'natural' marketing technique seemed to resonate with one customer in particular, who was featured in a SFNTC promotional document and said (of her husband):

### Formulation and treatment: integrating religion and spirituality in clinical practice [^c7535947]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Developing scientifically sound and clinically meaningful case formulations is so challenging that it may verge on becoming a "lost art". Pressures (scientific, economic, and cultural) remain that prevent child and adolescent psychiatrists from getting a complete understanding of the patient and family. Including a strong consideration of data related to religion, spirituality, and worldview may seem only to complicate an already arduous task. The clinician who includes these factors in treatment is faced with decisions of when to discuss these issues, how to discuss them and in what depth, and finally, when to refer to a religious/spiritual professional. Nonetheless, the importance of these factors in the lives of many children and families leaves no option but to address them as directly as possible. It is well worth the effort and, in many cases, will open new areas for clinical improvement in patients.

### Emergence of medicine for mass gatherings: lessons from the hajj [^d67680fd]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Although definitions of mass gatherings (MG) vary greatly, they consist of large numbers of people attending an event at a specific site for a finite time. Examples of MGs include World Youth Day, the summer and winter Olympics, rock concerts, and political rallies. Some of the largest MGs are spiritual in nature. Among all MGs, the public health issues, associated with the Hajj (an annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia) is clearly the best reported-probably because of its international or even intercontinental implications in terms of the spread of infectious disease. Hajj routinely attracts 2·5 million Muslims for worship. WHO's global health initiatives have converged with Saudi Arabia's efforts to ensure the wellbeing of pilgrims, contain infectious diseases, and reinforce global health security through the management of the Hajj. Both initiatives emphasise the importance of MG health policies guided by sound evidence and based on experience and the timeliness of calls for a new academic science-based specialty of MG medicine.

### Linking diet, religion and cancer… [^7ca0777a]. ASCO (2007). Low credibility.

Abstract 21172 Background: Consumption of onion and garlic has been shown to give protection against various cancers. Motivated by this observation we intended to look at the cancer incidence in a population belonging to Jain religion that does not consume garlic and onion due to religious belief. This study was done to see cancer incidence in children of Jain religion as compared to other religions at a single centre. Results: As per 2001 Census of India, distribution of population in India as per various religions is Hindu 80. 5%, Muslim
13. 4%, Christian 2. 3%, Sikh

1. 9%, Buddhist 0. 8%, Jain
0. 4% and others 0. 6%. Proportion of population in 0–6 year of age in India is 15. 9% and as per religions Hindu
15. 6%, Muslim 18. 7%, Christian
13. 5%, Sikh 12. 8%, Buddhist
14. 4% and Jain 10. 6%. Literacy rates of India is 64. 5% and by religion is Hindu 65%, Muslim
59. 1% Christian 80. 3%, Sikh
69. 4%, Buddhist 72. 7% and Jain 94%.

Distribution of population in Delhi as per various religions is Hindu 82%, Muslim 11. 7%, Christian
0. 9%, Sikh 4%, Buddhist 0. 2% and Jain 1%. Total of 201 patients were diagnosed with cancer and distribution as per religions was Hindu 162, Muslim 15, Christian 3, Sikh 8, Buddhist 1 and Jain 12. Conclusions: Incidence of cancer in children of different religions is similar to that of proportions of population of different religions in Delhi except for Jain religion where incidence of cancer is 6 times higher despite lesser number children in 0–6 year in this population as compared to other religions. Major difference is the diet lacking in onion and garlic. Other reason could be increased literacy levels in Jain community. This link between diet, religion and cancer in Jain population needs to be studied in a larger muticenteric setting as it has implications for the whole world. No significant financial relationships to disclose.

### HRS expert consensus statement on the management of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) in patients nearing end of life or requesting withdrawal of therapy [^8bd3bcbc]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Medium credibility.

Relevance of religious perspectives to deactivation of CIEDs in terminally ill patients — major religious traditions in Western societies support patients' withdrawal-of-treatment choices when the burden is perceived by the patient to be disproportionate to the benefit; patients who choose deactivation based on their religious beliefs are to be respected not only in their legal right to refuse treatment but also in their appeals to religious reasons for their choices. Respect includes honoring patients' own understanding of their traditions, and if patients or surrogates are unclear or conflicted, they should have access to pastoral counseling and relevant clergy, as well as to ethics consultation.

### HRS expert consensus statement on the management of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) in patients nearing end of life or requesting withdrawal of therapy [^cb020ee0]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Medium credibility.

Choices regarding death and CIED deactivation — religious frameworks emphasize that religious traditions offer a framework of meaning for end of life care, do not treat death as simply a "full stop" or an unmitigated evil, and the majority of traditions do not allow actively taking life. Religious scholars recognize the distinction between direct killing and allowing death; accordingly, since choices to deactivate pacemakers, ICDs, or CRTs are choices to let life go and not directly to kill, religious justifications for such deactivations are explicitly available in many traditions and tacitly assumed in others. In this view, to let die need not be to intend death or actively to cause it, and accepting death by removing unreasonable barriers is not to violate the value of human life or the intrinsic dignity of any person but to accept the inevitable process of dying as part of human living.

### How can existential or spiritual strengths be fostered in palliative care? An interpretative synthesis of recent literature [^e2bacca0]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Faith

Lastly, faith was also found to be an existential or spiritual strength in certain studies. Through placing trust in the supernatural and honouring it, some patients receiving palliative care experienced the grace of the divine. Analysis of these studies revealed two strength-building approaches: living the tradition and relating to a benevolent force.

Living the tradition

Within the palliative phase, some patients sought to enhance their knowledge of, and/or adherence to, spiritual or religious traditions. By strongly (re)connecting to basic Christian, Buddhist or Islamic tenets, such as the importance of connecting with family and the community, the wheel of cause and effect or the unconditional surrender to the will of God, they found basic beliefs that could give strength. Adhering to doctrinal activities such as prayer, meditation or making merits by giving alms, honoured these beliefs and made them practical, providing invigorating guidance.

Relating to a benevolent force

Though relating to God as a benevolent force could be a part of living the tradition, relating to a benevolent force outside of tradition was also found to be an important strength-building approach for some patients. These patients sought to feel and relate to a benevolent force as a friend or partner, being there for them and guiding the process of care. Some also related to this force of good as a current flowing through the care professional.

### Dissecting the genetic history of the roman catholic populations of west coast India [^927065c2]. Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Migration and admixture history of populations have always been curious and an interesting theme. The West Coast of India harbours a rich diversity, bestowing various ethno-linguistic groups, with many of them having well-documented history of migrations. The Roman Catholic is one such distinct group, whose origin was much debated. While some historians and anthropologists relating them to ancient group of Gaud Saraswat Brahmins, others relating them for being members of the Jews Lost Tribes in the first Century migration to India. Historical records suggests that this community was later forcibly converted to Christianity by the Portuguese in Goa during the Sixteenth Century. Till date, no genetic study was done on this group to infer their origin and genetic affinity. Hence, we analysed 110 Roman Catholics from three different locations of West Coast of India including Goa, Kumta and Mangalore using both uniparental and autosomal markers to understand their genetic history. We found that the Roman Catholics have close affinity with the Indo-European linguistic groups, particularly Brahmins. Additionally, we detected genetic signal of Jews in the linkage disequilibrium-based admixture analysis, which was absent in other Indo-European populations, who are inhabited in the same geographical regions. Haplotype-based analysis suggests that the Roman Catholics consist of South Asian-specific ancestry and showed high drift. Ancestry-specific historical population size estimation points to a possible bottleneck around the time of Goan inquisition (fifteenth century). Analysis of the Roman Catholics data along with ancient DNA data of Neolithic and bronze age revealed that the Roman Catholics fits well in a basic model of ancient ancestral composition, typical of most of the Indo-European caste groups of India. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis suggests that most of the Roman Catholics have aboriginal Indian maternal genetic ancestry; while the Y chromosomal DNA analysis indicates high frequency of R1a lineage, which is predominant in groups with higher ancestral North Indian (ANI) component. Therefore, we conclude that the Roman Catholics of Goa, Kumta and Mangalore regions are the remnants of very early lineages of Brahmin community of India, having Indo-Europeans genetic affinity along with cryptic Jewish admixture, which needs to be explored further.

### Recommendations for the management of diabetes during ramadan applying the principles of the ADA / EASD consensus: update 2025 [^b3678cd4]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Ramadan fasting is a sacred ritual observed by approximately 1.8 billion Muslims each year, most of whom adhere to fasting due to its significance as a core pillar of Islam. Able-bodied Muslims who are capable of fasting are religiously required to do so. Ramadan is profoundly spiritual and of great importance in the Muslim community that occurs for roughly 30 days, in alignment with the lunar calendar. During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food and drink for 11–16 h a day on average; however, this could be significantly shorter or longer depending on the season and the geographic location, ultimately breaking their fast during the sunset meal 'Iftaar'. Before the great strides were taken in the management of diabetes, these patients were initially considered not able to observe this holy month, creating significant frustration and disconnect with their families and loved ones. As patient outcomes improved through the emergence of better pharmacotherapy and increasing use of technology, these restrictions have been reconsidered. This prompted us to create the 2005 first global statement regarding best practices in the management of diabetes during Ramadan as an official American Diabetes Association (ADA) report. Since then, we have received numerous requests and comments asking for updated versions that include the latest data, medications, and technology. We decided to issue an update every 5 years, including 2010, 2015 and 2020. Our updated recommendations collate some of the more directly implicative findings on patient care for Ramadan fasting and align closely with the ADA's consensus for diabetes management. We recommend the prioritisation of pharmacologic therapies with a low risk profile for hypoglycaemia. Technological advancements, including integrated pump-sensor systems, hybrid closed-loop systems, and artificial intelligence (AI)-equipped continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, show great promise in the monitoring of blood glucose levels and can provide tangible reductions in hypoglycaemia episodes, suggesting possible utility in the facilitation of fasting in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Our recommendations align with the ADA consensus for the use of CGM devices, in concordance with appropriate time in range (TIR) targets to reduce hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability. The implications of Ramadan fasting on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk remain uncertain due to the sparsity of evidence, but the literature suggests an increased risk. Until more conclusive evidence is reported, we advise patients with a high ASCVD risk to avoid Ramadan fasting. We emphasise the pivotal role primary care providers (PCPs) have in counselling, managing, and following patients who intend to fast and advise counselling to begin ideally 6–8 weeks prior to Ramadan start, with particular recommendations to be given to patients post-bariatric surgery.

### Reconstructing Indian population history [^ffd40c7a]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

India has been underrepresented in genome-wide surveys of human variation. We analyse 25 diverse groups in India to provide strong evidence for two ancient populations, genetically divergent, that are ancestral to most Indians today. One, the 'Ancestral North Indians' (ANI), is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans, whereas the other, the 'Ancestral South Indians' (ASI), is as distinct from ANI and East Asians as they are from each other. By introducing methods that can estimate ancestry without accurate ancestral populations, we show that ANI ancestry ranges from 39–71% in most Indian groups, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers. Groups with only ASI ancestry may no longer exist in mainland India. However, the indigenous Andaman Islanders are unique in being ASI-related groups without ANI ancestry. Allele frequency differences between groups in India are larger than in Europe, reflecting strong founder effects whose signatures have been maintained for thousands of years owing to endogamy. We therefore predict that there will be an excess of recessive diseases in India, which should be possible to screen and map genetically.

### Induced abortion in the world: 1. perception of abortion throughout the centuries and by religions [^945d062a]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

However, as summarized by Blanchard, the admissibility of abortion is divisive even among Protestants because when it comes to ethics, they ostensibly agree on the centrality of Biblical Scripture. This, however, creates a problem because the meaning of a Scripture written thousands of years ago is definitely not self‐explanatory, with a number of factors, such as tradition, reason, and experience, conditioning any decision. Blanchard concludes that, "after decades of getting no closer to theological agreement,… perhaps it is time for Protestants to take a break from talking about abortion as such" and "focus our limited time and energy on creating systemic conditions for reproductive justice and engaging in concrete practices of hospitality and neighbor love."

Judaism

The position of the Jewish faith is not univocal either: traditionally, for Orthodox Jews abortion is banned except when the life of the mother is at risk, since the third Noahide Law contains the admonition, "He who spills the blood of a man in a man, his blood will be spilt" and the Talmud defines "a man in a man" as a preborn fetus in his mother's womb. In this connection, Maimonides in his 12th‐century interpretation of Jewish law, wrote: "A descendant of Noah who kills any human being, even a fetus in its mother's womb, is to be put to death".

Reformed Judaism is definitely more open to abortion, starting from the fact that the Talmud states that the preborn baby is "one of the living limbs of the mother". In addition, two statements in the Talmud affirm that for the first 40 days of pregnancy the fetus is "mere water" and has no status at all, which incidentally is the same according to some Islamic scholars. For the first 40 days, the fetus has zero status and is merely a part of the woman's body.

### The genetic legacy of religious diversity and intolerance: paternal lineages of christians, jews, and muslims in the iberian peninsula [^2c5ba69c]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

Although evidence of the cultural impact of historical events can be gleaned from sources such as archaeology, place names, and linguistic elements, there is often debate about the weight of their corresponding demographic impact. Genetic analysis of modern populations can offer a more direct approach to recognizing the impact of migrations and invasions in historical times, especially when source populations for migrations are clearly differentiated from recipient populations. The Iberian Peninsula is of particular interest in this context, because it has a complex recent history over the last two millennia, involving the long-term residence of two very different populations with very distinct geographical origins and their own particular cultural and religious characteristics — North African Muslims and Sephardic Jews.

North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula are separated by a mere 15 km of water at the Gibraltar Strait, making the region a potential migration route between Africa and Europe. Historically documented contact began dramatically in 711 CE, when a Berber army under Arab leadership crossed from Morocco, winning a key battle the following year. Within only four years, the invaders had conquered the entire peninsula, with the exception of the northern Basque country, Cantabria, Galicia, Asturias, and most of the Pyrenees in the north, which remained largely unoccupied. Arab and Berber forces then remained in control for more than five centuries, with a gradual withdrawal toward Andalusia in the south and a final expulsion in 1492. Today, signs of this lengthy Islamic occupation are abundantly obvious in the place names, language, archaeology, architecture, and other cultural traits of Spain and Portugal, but its demographic impact is less clear.

Childhood abuse

Childhood abuse victimization was assessed with the question: "Were you ever physically or sexually abused when you were growing up?". Responses included "yes" and "no". This information was not obtained in Israel due to restrictions on asking such questions.

Felt like an outsider in family

Participants' sense of family belonging during childhood was assessed with the question: "When you were growing up, did you feel like an outsider in your family". Response options included "yes" and "no".

Self-rated health

Participants reported their health status during childhood in response to the question: "In general, how was your health when you were growing up? Was it excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?"

Immigration status

Immigration status was assessed with the question "Were you born in this country?" The responses include "yes" and "no".

Religious service attendance

Participants' frequency of religious service attendance during childhood was assessed with a question: "How often did you attend religious services or worship at a temple, mosque, shrine, church or other religious building when you were around 12 years old". The response options range from 1 (at least once a week) to 4 (never).

Birth year

Participants reported their current age (in years), and their birth years were calculated as the year of data collection minus their current age.

Gender

Participants reported their gender, and the response options include "male", "female", and "other gender identities".

Religious affiliation

Religious affiliation in childhood was measured with the question: "What was your religion when you were 12 years old". Response options include 15 major religions (e.g. Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism etc.), "some other religion", and "No religion/Atheist/Agnostic". The exact response categories varied as appropriate for each country, and this variable was included in the country-specific analyses only but not in the meta-analysis across countries. To reduce data sparsity, in regression models the response categories of religious affiliation with a prevalence < 3% were collapsed. "No religion/Atheist/Agnostic" was used as the reference group when at least 3% of the observed sample within the country endorsed this category; otherwise, the most prominent religious group was used as the reference category.

### Aesthetic surgery and religion: islamic law perspective [^ce2227f0]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Plastic surgeons are called upon to perform aesthetic surgery on patients of every gender, race, lifestyle, and religion. Currently, it may seem natural that cosmetic surgery should be perceived as permissible, and in our modern liberal age, it seems strange to attempt justifying certain surgical acts in the light of a particular cultural or religious tradition. Yet every day, cruel realities demonstrate that although the foremost intention of any scripture or tradition has been mainly to promote religious and moral values, most religions, including Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, invariably affect human behavior and attitude deeply, dictating some rigid positions regarding critical health issues.

Methods

A Web search was conducted, and the literature was reviewed using the Medline search tool.

Results

Islamic law closely regulates and governs the life of every Muslim. Bioethical deliberation is inseparable from the religion itself, which emphasizes continuities between body and mind, between material and spiritual realms, and between ethics and jurisprudence.

Conclusions

The rule in Islam is that individuals should be satisfied with the way Allah has created them. Islam welcomes, however, the practice of plastic surgery as long as it is done for the benefit of patients. Even if it clearly considers "changing the creation of Allah" as unlawful, Islamic law is ambiguous regarding cosmetic surgery. Its objection to cosmetic surgery is not absolute. It is rather an objection to exaggeration and extremism. It has been mentioned that "Allah is beautiful and loves beauty".

### Islamic ethical framework for research into and prevention of genetic diseases [^5d869355]. Nature Genetics (2007). Medium credibility.

Medical genetics involves the application of genetic knowledge and technology to specific clinical and epidemiologic concerns. Using genetics to benefit society requires that empirically verified knowledge be used within an ethical framework that combines appeal to written precedent with sensitivity to the options of individuals and families dealing with choices and necessities within the laws, norms and traditions of their society. Islamic bioethics is derived from a combination of principles, duties and rights, and to a certain extent a call to virtue, ihsan. It emphasizes prevention, and it teaches that the patient must be treated with respect and compassion and that the physical, mental and spiritual dimensions of the illness experience must be taken into account. Strategic planning for the prevention and care of genetic disorders, and for genomic research, within the context of Islamic religion and culture is promising and may provide lessons to the developed world. Islamic bioethics provides fundamental principles for genetic counseling, particularly in regard to consanguinity, which was part of the Arabian culture long before Islam but which was discouraged by the second Islamic khalifa. These fundamental principles are important for implementing many preventive and genomic research programs and for maintaining flexibility to respond to new biomedical technologies.

### Ancient DNA from the skeletons of roopkund lake reveals mediterranean migrants in India [^67f831ac]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The Roopkund_B cluster is more puzzling. It is tempting to hypothesize that the Roopkund_B individuals descend from Indo-Greek populations established after the time of Alexander the Great, who may have contributed ancestry to some present-day groups like the Kalash. However, this is unlikely, as such a group would be expected to have admixture with groups with more typical South Asian ancestry (as the Kalash do), or would be expected to be inbred and to have relatively low genetic diversity. However, the Roopkund_B individuals have evidence for neither pattern (Supplementary Note 9). Combining different lines of evidence, the data suggest instead that what we have sampled is a group of unrelated men and women who were born in the eastern Mediterranean during the period of Ottoman political control. As suggested by their consumption of a predominantly terrestrial, rather than marine-based diet, they may have lived in an inland location, eventually traveling to and dying in the Himalayas. Whether they were participating in a pilgrimage, or were drawn to Roopkund Lake for other reasons, is a mystery. It would be surprising for a Hindu pilgrimage to be practiced by a large group of travelers from the eastern Mediterranean where Hindu practices have not been common; Hindu practice in this time might be more plausible for a southeast Asian individual with an ancestry type like that seen in the Roopkund_C individual. Given that the Roopkund_B and Roopkund_C individuals died only in the last few centuries, an important direction for future investigation will be to carry out archival research to determine if there were reports of large foreign traveling parties dying in the region over the last few hundred years.

Taken together, these results have produced meaningful insights about an enigmatic ancient site. More generally, this study highlights the power of biomolecular analyses to obtain rich information about the human story behind archaeological deposits that are so highly disturbed that traditional archaeological methods are not as informative.

### Induced abortion in the world: 1. perception of abortion throughout the centuries and by religions [^7883b674]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The World Health Organization estimates that 73 million induced abortions are performed in the world each year; yet abortion remains the most controversial and contested procedure in the whole of medicine and is the cause of harsh disagreement and animosity in many societies.

Induced abortion entails the deliberate termination of human pregnancy. Most often the term is taken to refer to the practice undertaken before the fetus can survive outside the uterus, but it also applies to processes that entail fetal sacrifice before birth. Abortion has religious, moral, and cultural dimensions that are often misappropriated for political gains. Abortion is at the center of major ethical debates where advocates and opponents clash. A major tenet of the argument of those opposed to liberalizing access to abortion is that it desecrates the value or sanctity of human life and suppresses innocent human life, while advocates of free access to abortion emphasize a woman's right to self‐determination and right of control of her own body especially in cases that pose additional risk and for victims of rape. The language used in the exchanges is often highly emotive and reflects entrenched stances that leave no place for reconciliation.

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^d2b8fd85]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

APA Multicultural Guidelines — religion and health care considerations state that many Muslims view illness as a "trial from God," and when conceptualized in this way, it is not appropriate to solely treat the underlying medical condition; spiritual healing is also needed. The text notes that some religions prohibit certain medical interventions and that Muslims are not allowed to consume pork while some vaccines and medicines are derived from pig products; if a Muslim client presents with an illness, making sure that the agreed-upon medicine does not contain certain substances, like pig products, is needed. It adds that the practitioner strives to be knowledgeable about what healthcare practices go with or against religious identity and that this knowledge would likely improve the therapeutic relationship by creating honesty, dialogue, and trust.

Measures

Childhood Demographic Variables: Relationship with mother during childhood was assessed with the question: 'Please think about your relationship with your mother when you were growing up. In general, would you say that relationship was very good, somewhat good, somewhat bad, or very bad?' Responses were dichotomised to very/somewhat good versus very/somewhat bad. An analogous variable was used for relationship with father. We dichotomised these two variables to avoid a multi-collinearity issue because these two variables were highly correlated. 'Does not apply' was treated as a dichotomous control variable for respondents who did not have a mother or father due to death or absence. Parental marital status during childhood was assessed with responses of married, divorced, never married, and one or both had died. Financial status was measured with: 'Which one of these phrases comes closest to your own feelings about your family's household income when you were growing up, such as when YOU were around 12 years old?' Responses were lived comfortably, got by, found it difficult, and found it very difficult. Abuse was assessed with yes/no responses to 'Were you ever physically or sexually abused when you were growing up?' Participants were also asked: 'When you were growing up, did you feel like an outsider in your family?' Childhood health was assessed by: 'In general, how was your health when you were growing up? Was it excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?' Immigration status was assessed with: 'Were you born in this country, or not?' Religious attendance during childhood was assessed with: 'How often did YOU attend religious services or worship at a temple, mosque, shrine, church, or other religious building when YOU were around 12 years old?' with responses of at least once/week, one-to-three times/month, less than once/month, or never. Gender was assessed as male, female, or other. The choice of age 12 reflects a balance between ensuring adequate recall ability and capturing a key stage in developmental transitions. Continuous age (year of birth) was classified as 18–24, 25–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and 80 or older. Childhood religious tradition/affiliation had response categories of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Sikhism, Baha'i, Jainism, Shinto, Taoism, Confucianism, Primal/Animist/Folk religion, Spiritism, African-Derived, some other religion, or no religion/atheist/agnostic; precise response categories varied by country. Racial/ethnic identity was assessed in some, but not all, countries, with response categories varying by country. In some cases, the reference category was chosen based on the category with the largest number of respondents (e.g. subjective financial status of family growing up — got by) or the mid-category (e.g. health when you were growing up — good). For additional details on the assessments see the COS GFS codebook or Crabtree et al.

### Engaging globally with how to achieve healthy societies: insights from India, Latin America and east and Southern Africa [^950fcf6f]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

In many Latin American countries, political activists adopted Virchow's SM approach noted in box 1. Rather than reducing health outcomes to individual risk factors, they viewed health as linked to social class and organised evidence and sociopolitical activism to confront the socioeconomic causes of ill health. Followers of Virchow who migrated to Latin America established SM courses. One of those trained was Salvador Allende, who was Chile's health minister and later president in 1970 who applied SM in socialist policies and in creating a tax-funded, universal National Health System. In Argentina, Ramón Carrillo and Juan Justo promoted investments in nutrition and living conditions to improve workers' health. Argentine-born physician Ernesto (Che) Guevara influenced the radical socioeconomic changes made after the 1959 Cuban Revolution, addressing the determinants of well-being and expanding universal primary care. Notwithstanding their positive health impact, when US-supported military dictatorships took power from the 1970s; they overturned these SM policies in favour of neoliberal market reforms, with the repression and exile of many SM proponents.

In India, when state-led modernisation failed to deliver on social expectations, social movements advocated that '… the struggle for liberation (was) not just from alien rule but also from internal decay' (Kothari, p220). They stimulated grassroots community health projects that connected health with social justice and local democratic control. Mahatma Gandhi, the lawyer and anticolonial nationalist, was critical of earlier biomedical approaches. He proposed health promotion to achieve a balance between body, mind and spirit. He saw this as starting at village level, with healthy lifestyles, conditions and local herbal remedies promoted by primary health centres and community health workers. Many grassroots groups and issue-based coalitions adopted this paradigm in the 1970s. They learnt new concepts of a 'health worker' from the Chinese barefoot-doctor experience and promoted the idea of 'people's health in people's hands'.

### Religion and spirituality: why and how to address It in clinical practice [^7e47a444]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Religion and spirituality (R/S) have been influential in societies' history, daily life, and identity in the past and in today's society. From a sociological perspective, R/S contributes to family development and organization, influences culture, and often contributes to forming opinions, beliefs, and concepts about oneself, family, society, and the world. In addition, R/S help shape individuals, families, and communities' ethical and moral understanding, thus influencing their behavior. This review article aims to provide the clinician with tools to understand, assess, and provide interventions that consider the patients' and their families' R/S. A recent review of the topic focused on general aspects of the R/S but we are unaware of reviews that integrate attachment, moral foundation theory, and forgiveness. This review will integrate these additional features into our understanding of the role of R/S in the delivery of mental health.

3 CONCLUSION

Given the multi‐faceted reality herewith described, it is important to emphasize that the question of whether abortion is, or is not, morally acceptable could not be answered through reference to ancient texts, or to the authority of Hippocrates, or ancient Egyptian, Greek, or Roman physicians or leaders, because both knowledge of the early stages of life and the way societies addressed the problem as well as the status of women in society varied over time. It is also important to mention that — in practical terms — various cultures are likely to have practically addressed the issue differently from the stance taken by religious or other authorities.

Having said this, in the overall panorama of induced abortion, religion will continue to have an important, although probably not a decisive, role in debates about ethics and law. This stems from the place that the "sacred" has in human life or imagination and the place of religion in relation to the sacred. Current interpretation of the main world religions — in terms of the number of followers — is often framed as having a negative stance towards abortion. It is clear that abortion occupies a prominent place in modern ethical and politico‐legal debate; this, however, should not be taken to indicate equivalent prominence throughout history. Technically, safe termination of pregnancy has not been easy until recently. Until the advent of the 21st century, it required surgical intervention and technology that was not available at the dawn of modern times, as attempts at surgical (manual) pregnancy termination would have been accompanied by serious morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, descriptions of ancient potions suggest that these were unlikely to have been effective or were toxic also to the woman. However, those with money and connections have been able to obtain safe treatment at least since the 19th century.

### Culture and history in psychiatric diagnosis and practice [^3c6bae4b]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

A brief review of the history of Western psychiatry underscores how happenings in Anglo European societies during the early modern and modern era impacted on regional populations in the midst of profound demographic, social and political economic change. Such factors along with cultural conventions created an amalgam of behavior problems: social responses to these under the aegis administrative bodies gave rise to the discipline and profession of psychiatry. Central tenets that we take for granted as facts about psychiatric disorders (e.g., their manifestations, natural history, diagnosis) were shaped by historical and cultural influences. Psychiatry may outline a science of the psyche and its disturbances but it also reflects a cultural interpretation about personal experience, responsibility, social behavior, and the requirements for social order. The cultural character of the psychiatric enterprise itself, just as much as the characteristics of its disorders, constitute the subject matter of cultural psychiatry. Events during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in Anglo European societies gave rise to psychiatry. First, there took place the differentiation of psychiatric disorders from the pool of human social and behavior problems. Second, and in relation to this, a segment of the medical profession was accorded (or appropriated) a social mandate and acquired an obligation to treat victims of mental disorders. The historical sociology of psychiatry constitutes one aspect of cultural psychiatry. The second covers developments during the latter part of the twentieth century. At this juncture, psychiatry became the target of labeling theorists in sociology, cultural relativists in anthropology, antipsychiatrists from within the discipline itself, and revisionist and critical historians of psychiatry. An outgrowth of this is the perspective that underscores the important role played by values, ideas, and world-views in how individuals experience and carry out their lives, phenomena that are critical to the expression, interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. That the science and practice of modern psychiatry incorporate an ethnocentric, Anglo European bias or slant on psychopathology is an integral assumption of cultural psychiatry. By describing how other non-Western systems of psychiatry have operated, for example, their theories and practices, one gains a further appreciation of the important role of culture in shaping Western psychiatry. This is taken up in an article by Fàbrega elsewhere in this issue where concepts and practices of traditional Chinese and Indian medicine that pertain to mental health and illness are reviewed.

### The national suicide prevention strategy in India: context and considerations for urgent action [^f05ca063]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

India reports the highest number of suicide deaths in the world. At this time when the Indian Government is formulating a national suicide prevention strategy, we have reviewed the current status of suicides in India, focusing on epidemiology, risk factors, and existing suicide prevention strategies to identify key challenges and priorities for suicide prevention. The suicide rate among Indian girls and women continues to be twice the global rate. Suicide accounts for most deaths in the 15–39 years age group compared with other causes of death. Hanging is the most common method of suicide, followed by pesticides poisoning, medicine overdose, and self-immolation. In addition to depression and alcohol use disorders as risk factors, several social and cultural factors appear to increase risk of suicide. The absence of a national suicide prevention strategy, inappropriate media reporting, legal conflicts in the interpretation of suicide being punishable, and inadequate multisectoral engagement are major barriers to effective suicide prevention. A scaffolding approach is useful to reduce suicide rates, as interventions provided at the right time, intensity, and duration can help navigate situations in which a person might be susceptible to and at risk of suicide. In addition to outlining research and data priorities, we provide recommendations that emphasise multilevel action priorities for suicide prevention across various sectors. We call for urgent action in India by integrating suicide prevention measures at every level of public health, with special focus on the finalisation and implementation of the national suicide prevention strategy.

Religious self‐categorization

Religious self‐categorization was assessed with a single item "What is your religion?" at Waves 1–3 and 5–7. The response options were 1 (No religion), 2 (Buddhism), 3 (Christianity), 4 (Christianity: Catholic), 5 (Christianity: Protestant), 6 (Hinduism), 7 (Islam), 8 (Judaism), 9 (Sikhism), and 10 (Other religion).

Religiosity

Religiosity was assessed with three items capturing its key components (i.e. public involvement, private practices, importance). We combined these widely used items and examined overall religiosity which — according to meta‐analyses — is the most common approach to studying religiosity (e.g. Hardy et al; Yonker et al.). The first item, "How important is religion to you?", was assessed at Waves 1–7. The response options were 1 (Very important), 2 (Fairly important), 3 (Not very important), and 4 (Not at all important). The second item, "How often do you visit a religious meeting place (e.g. a church, a mosque, a synagogue or a temple)?", was assessed at Waves 1–3 and 5–7. The response options were 1 (Never), 2 (Occasionally (but less than once a month)), 3 (At least once a month), 4 (At least once a week), and 5 (Every day). The third item, "How often do you pray?", was assessed at Waves 1–3 and 5–7. The response options were 1 (Never), 2 (Occasionally (but less than once a month)), 3 (At least once a month), 4 (At least once a week), 5 (One to four times a day), and 6 (Five times a day or more). We rescaled the first and third items to a five‐point scale with higher values indicating greater religiosity. Across time, the items loaded on a single factor explaining between 73.8% and 77.8% of the variance. Cronbach's α across waves ranged from.82 to.85. We computed mean scores for Waves 1–3 and 5–7.

### Therapeutic abortion in islam: contemporary views of muslim shiite scholars and effect of recent Iranian legislation [^6aad0674]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2006). Low credibility.

Abortion is forbidden under normal circumstances by nearly all the major world religions. Traditionally, abortion was not deemed permissible by Muslim scholars. Shiite scholars considered it forbidden after implantation of the fertilised ovum. However, Sunni scholars have held various opinions on the matter, but all agreed that after 4 months gestation abortion was not permitted. In addition, classical Islamic scholarship had only considered threats to maternal health as a reason for therapeutic abortion. Recently, scholars have begun to consider the effect of severe fetal deformities on the mother, the families and society. This has led some scholars to reconsider the prohibition on abortion in limited circumstances. This article reviews the Islamic basis for the prohibition of abortion and the reasons for its justification. Contemporary rulings from leading Shiite scholars and from the Sunni school of thought are presented and reviewed. The status of abortion in Muslim countries is reviewed, with special emphasis on the therapeutic abortion law passed by the Iranian Parliament in 2003. This law approved therapeutic abortion before 16 weeks of gestation under limited circumstances, including medical conditions related to fetal and maternal health. Recent measures in Iran provide an opportunity for the Muslim scholars in other countries to review their traditional stance on abortion.

### Strangers or friends? A proposal for a new spirituality-in-medicine ethic [^95d4cfa8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We argue that debate regarding whether and how physicians should engage religious concerns has proceeded under inadequate terms. The prevailing paradigm approaches dialogue regarding religion as a form of therapeutic technique, engaged by one stranger, the physician, upon another stranger, the patient. This stranger-technique framework focuses the debate on questions of physicians' competence, threats to patients' autonomy, and neutrality regarding religion, and in so doing, it too greatly circumscribes the scope of physician-patient dialogue. In contrast, we argue that dialogue regarding religion is better approached as a form of philosophical discourse about ultimate human concerns. Such moral discourse is often essential to the patient-physician relationship, and rather than shrinking from such discourse, physicians might engage patients regarding religious concerns guided by an ethic of moral friendship that seeks the patient's good through wisdom, candor, and respect.

### The illusion of moral decline [^22eddcb2]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

The social fabric appears to be unravelling: civility seems like an old-fashioned habit, honesty like an optional exercise and trust like the relic of another time. Some observersclaim that "the process of our moral decline" began with the "sinking of the foundations of morality" and proceeded to "the final collapse of the whole edifice", which brought us "finally to the dark dawning of our modern day, in which we can neither bear our immoralities nor face the remedies needed to cure them". But as apt as this description of our times may seem, it was written more than 2,000 years ago by the historian Livy, who was bemoaning the declining morality of his fellow Roman citizens. From ancient to modern times, social observers have often lamented the ugly turns their societies have taken, and have often suggested that a recent decline in morality — in kindness, honesty and basic human decency — was among the causes.

Why have so many different people in so many different times and places been convinced that their fellow citizens are now less moral than they once were? One possibility is that morality has, in fact, been declining worldwide for millennia — declining so steadily and so precipitously that people in every era have been able to observe that decline in the brief span of a human lifetime. The other possibility is that the perception of moral decline is a psychological illusion to which people all over the world and throughout history have been susceptible. We provide evidence for the latter possibility. First, we show that people in at least 60 nations do indeed believe that morality is declining, and that they have believed this for at least 70 years. Second, we show that people attribute this decline both to the decreasing morality of individuals as they age and to the decreasing morality of successive generations. Third, we show that people's reports of the current morality of their contemporaries have not declined over time, which strongly suggests that the perception of moral decline is an illusion. Fourth and finally, we describe tests of a simple psychological mechanism that can produce the illusion of moral decline and can predict some of the circumstances under which it will be attenuated, eliminated or reversed (for example, when respondents are asked about the morality of people they know well or people who lived before the respondent was born).

### Induced abortion in the world: 1. perception of abortion throughout the centuries and by religions [^56cbaaaf]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 The doctrine of the sanctity of life

The anti‐abortion stance has at its core the doctrine of sanctity of human life. This notion is likely to have pre‐dated the Judeo‐Christian teaching that man is made in God's image, and that life is a gift from God. To strict religious advocates, the sanctity of life is absolute, although there is some debate on whether life becomes (or should be considered) sacred at conception, at a point during gestation, or at birth. There is also a consideration of which life is to be protected as a priority, that of the mother or the fetus. The concept of sanctity of human life is now widely recognized, including by persons who do not subscribe to any religion; this, however, does not necessarily mean that life should be preserved at all times, or at all cost. For instance, ancient and some modern societies still support capital punishment. At least to some, therefore, the notion of sanctity of human life is compatible with it being subjected to rules or customs, which means that it can be overridden in specific situations. Archeology has uncovered clear evidence of human sacrifice, including in the name of religion, in ancient societies. Infanticide was practiced in pre‐Christian Rome and pre‐Islamic Arabia. In both cases, the practice stopped because of the prohibitions imposed by religions, rather than by the influence of an innate predilection of human nature.

### HRS expert consensus statement on the management of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) in patients nearing end of life or requesting withdrawal of therapy [^0eb0e768]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) deactivation — ethical and religious principles are outlined as follows: Patients (and their surrogates) have the right to refuse or withdraw any life-sustaining treatment including CIED therapies based on their health-care-related values, preferences and goals, and deactivation of a CIED is not assisted suicide or euthanasia and is ethically and legally permissible. Major religious traditions in Western culture support legal and ethical rationales for respecting patients' rights to refuse medical treatment, and religious belief may motivate a patient to choose or refuse deactivation. The distinction between letting life go (allowing to die) and taking life (intending to actively kill) is emphasized, with the patient's determination of disproportionate burden central to religious justifications for permissibility of letting life go. A clinician whose beliefs differ may not override a patient's or surrogate's choice but may appeal to his/her own right not to participate in deactivation by involving a colleague who is willing to carry out the procedure, and patients should be provided the support they want and need to make decisions about deactivation coherent with their spiritual and moral beliefs.

The prayer is known to be comprised of a set of unique postures and movement transitions that are repeated alongside certain mantras and recitationsand may be subdivided into five times daily mandatory prayer as well as into special versions, with the latter being performed to gain more reward from God. It comprises sets of movement sequences termed 'raka'ah' (singular = rakaat). To begin a rakaat, an individual starts in the upright position known as the 'Qiyaam'. After certain Quranic recitations, the Qiyaam is followed by a brief bowing known as 'Ruku' and subsequent return into the upright position. From an upright position, an individual moves into the 'Sujood' or prostration while kneeling and placing the forehead and palms on the ground twice. After that, the individual remains kneeling, termed the 'Tahiyaat'. In general, after two raka'ah are completed, the individual may then terminate their prayer by rotating their head to the right and left sides in an action called 'Salaam'

When studying the Salaah as a form of physical activity, many scholars have noted the Salaah as an example of a beneficial low-intensity aerobic activity that holds similarities to exercises such as yoga and tai chi. As a divine commandment from God, the Salaah is seen as the ultimate act of obedience. Many scholars, however, have been investigating the Salaah in terms of understanding the physiological benefits of performing the Salaah as an act of worship and as a form of physical activity. The problem experienced in many contemporary investigations on the Salaah is the need for physiological risk profile data markers on sedentary populations in the African and South African contexts. The rationale of this study was to use the Salaah as a form of activity to be measured, as the Salaah can be potentially strenuous and physically demanding. Therefore, the Salaah may provide information to attest to the potential benefits to physiological risk profiles of those who perform the prayer. This study investigated the physiological risk profiles of asymptomatic sedentary individuals who perform the Salaah through selected morphological, cardiovascular and neuromuscular parameters.

### Teaching spirituality to humanitarians [^01bb167e]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

There is an increasing interest in humanitarian missions in medical institutions in high-income countries (HICs). It is now widely accepted that humanitarians should undertake a course on ethics and human rights before embarking, and debriefing after, humanitarian missions to low/middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the teaching of religion, spirituality and morality is generally not included in ethics courses.

It is now recognised that religious and spiritual concerns are important for understanding health-related behaviours and sources of social support to patients, which makes it important for humanitarians to appreciate and understand these nuances in their work. Religious institutions and clergy, both in HICs and LMICs, often function as gatekeepers for individuals seeking healthcare, particularly mental health, among poor and disenfranchised populations. Religious practices and moral codes vary widely in different parts of the world which may affect both the humanitarian and recipient of global health. In addition to religious beliefs and moral codes, the younger generation of healthcare workers, both in HICs and LMICs, have increasingly adopted spirituality and metaphysics. Humanitarians travelling from HICs to LMICs may face questions regarding their practices of meditation, yoga, mindfulness, and spirituality which may cause conflicts within themselves or in their dealing with their counterparts and the population seeking their attention in LMICs.

Humanitarians, who in the past, avoided contentious topics such as child marriage, genital mutilation, female infanticide, structural racism and white supremacy in Western medicinein their interaction with their counterparts in LMICs, should be prepared to debate these through the lens of compassion and spirituality, even if they are not directly connected with their work.

I propose that a course on anthropology to include religious and spiritual practices, and moral codes of the population of the host country be included in the pre-departure briefing of humanitarians. A grounding in spirituality could provide a robust ethical and moral framework that may help humanitarians to negotiate the complexities of structural racism, nationalism, militarism and greed.

### Spiritual fitness: a new dimension in Alzheimer's disease prevention [^66ce340c]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The ultimate purpose of this article is to review how religious and spiritual involvement may prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, it presents research not only on the various aspects of religious and spiritual involvement but also on a practical app-roach to achieving spiritual fitness™, a new concept combining multiple aspects of religious involvement, spirituality, and psychological well-being.

An important component of that practical approach is the regular practice of techniques enhancing spiritual fitness. Kirtan Kriya will be introduced later as an example of a memory meditation exercise suitable for everyday use with numerous effects on spiritual fitness hallmarks suggested in multiple research studies.

In a systematic review of the effect of religious and spiritual involvement on cognitive function from 2019, 82% of the research articles reported positive associations between religious involvement, spirituality, and brain health. According to the above-noted systematic review, religious and spiritual involvement appears therefore to be protective against cog-nitive decline in middle and old age adults. The opposite appears to be true as well. According to research by Dos Santos, lower spiritual well-being is associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia.

With the aging of the world's population, AD continues to be a serious problem including increased caregiver stress and burden. Currently there are 5.7 million cases in the United States (US), about 44–50 million cases worldwide and approximately 150,000 deaths each year in America, making AD the third leading cause of death in the US among seniors before the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note is that African Americans and other underserved populations are twice as likely to suffer from AD. Dire predictions are for total case numbers to surge to 14–16 million Americans living with AD and up to 152 million worldwide by 2050. If a preventative approach does not gain widespread utilization, financial costs are estimated to further soar in the future. In the US alone, AD and all forms of dementia cost the nation an estimated $305 billion in 2020.

### The urologist's guide to religion and male factor fertility treatment [^bc61a7b0]. Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To create a reference guide for six of the major U.S. religions for use by reproductive health specialists to provide patient-centered care for a culturally diverse patient population.

Materials and Methods

We utilized primary source reviews of various religious texts and verified electronic databases to examine perspectives on use of, in vitro fertilization (IVF), intrauterine insemination (IUI), sterilization procedures such as vasectomy and tubal ligation, and surrogacy for six major U.S. religions: Catholicism, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, and Islam. Each statement of religious belief was either taken directly from primary source documents or cross-referenced across several secondary sources to ensure accuracy. Perspectives were compiled into a reference document and table for clinical use.

Results

Most religions have focused statements concerning assisted reproduction and vasectomy. While there are caveats for most religions, IVF and IUI are largely opposed only by the Catholic church, surrogacy is not permissible in the LDS Church, Catholic Church, and Islam, and vasectomy is not permissible for the Catholic Church, LDS Church, Judaism, and Islam. Similarly, tubal ligation is also not permitted for these religions with the exception of Judaism of which while vasectomy is considered a violation of the Torah, sterilization of a woman is not explicitly discussed in the old testament. Instead, a rabbinic decree states permanent female sterilization as against the views of the faith. The religions with the most lenient rules concerning reproduction and permanent contraception explored include Buddhism and Hinduism each of which have no reservations pertaining to IVF, IUI, surrogacy, or permanent sterilization.

Conclusion

Religion often plays a significant role in patients' attitudes towards use of ART, permanent sterilization, and surrogacy. Familiarity with the religious beliefs and perspectives is important for the reproductive health specialist in order to provide appropriate counseling for their patients.

Impact Statement

A summative reference guide can help provide patient-centered care for reproductive health and family planning.

### On the origin of American tuberculosis [^c105d65e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

After more than a century of debate, it is now firmly established that tuberculosis existed in the New World before the arrival of Columbus. What is not yet known is how or when, exactly, the infection reached the Americas, how it spread from one continent to the other, and whether the pre-Columbian infection was caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium bovis.

### Involvement of civil society in India's polio eradication program: lessons learned [^c2ee9ec4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Last, but not least, the most valuable lesson that all program partners learnt was to work together seamlessly. It did not start out that way, but in the face of so much resistance, there was no option but to band and bond together and to stop blaming each other. Solutions were thought of jointly. Each partner knew its own role and played its part as best it could. Acknowledging the government's captaincy, its request was taken as a command and no partner ever refused to tackle an issue, no matter how difficult it was.

This strategy should pave the way for future programs. Efforts must be complementary, not competitive. Roles need to be defined based on partner competencies: for example, technical agencies are best equipped to provide technical guidance, whereas community-based organizations are skilled in communication and behavior change.

As all sectors of society contributed their best efforts to make the program a success, the program finally turned into a people's movement. Success came finally when polio transmission ended, and India was certified polio-free in March 2014 — a hard-won fight but rich in lessons for the future. In 2012, at the request of the district government administration, a large installation commemorating civil society's contribution was placed in the middle of a busy thoroughfare in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, a town once considered the epicenter of polio transmission in the world. The administration also requested the establishment of a polio museum in the district hospital. A polio gallery was made that tracked the history of how polio was eradicated from India. In July 2014, a village headman, using his own unrestricted funds, erected a huge gate called the Polio Eradication Gate in Jansath, Muzaffarnagar, a district in Uttar Pradesh that had had many polio cases in the not-too-distant past.

India's polio eradication program is a shining example of what can be achieved if civil society is brought into the inner circle of planning and policy making and if each partner's contribution is recognized and respected. The work must not stop here but needs to be continued with the same, if not even stronger, momentum and commitment toward the remaining public health challenges of our time.

### The rod and the serpent: history's ultimate healing symbol [^76d11fc6]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The snake has served as a medical emblem for more than 2400 years, since its association with the ancient Greek god of medicine and healing, Asclepius, in the 4th century BC. Its symbolic background can be traced further back to the worship of gods of earth's blossom in ancient Egypt and earth-related deities of the archaic period of Greek antiquity. It is featured entwined around a staff of knowledge and wisdom in most anaglyphs depicting Asclepius. The snake was impressed in the Old and the New Testament as well as in the Christian tradition as a symbol of sin, rejuvenation, death, resurrection, asthenia, and therapy. It is postulated that the double-snake motif was reintroduced by Renaissance philosophers as a medical emblem due to the symbolic connections of Hermes with deliverance and redemption. However, its use during the last two centuries seems to lack substantial historical background. The historical, mythological, and traditional retrospection of the snake's symbolism validates its appropriateness in the health-care field.

### Interventions to support spirituality among adults with cancer: a scoping review [^d7f9b0d3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Overview of included publications

Publications included in this scoping review spanned reports on RCTs (n = 8), quasi-experimental studies (n = 7), qualitative studies (n = 6), mixed/multiple methods studies (n = 2), a pilot study (n = 1), a single group open-label trial (n = 1), a secondary analysis (N = 1), and a case report (n = 1) (see Fig. 2). The provided Supplementary Table includes details on each of the included publications. Studies originated from eight different countries, with most from the USA (n = 10), China (n = 5), and India (n = 4). Across studies, participants were most commonly white, female (several studies focused specifically on breast cancer and cervical cancer), between the age of 40 and 60 years old, and had at least a high school education.

Fig. 2
Designs of included studies (N = 26)

Available interventions

Across the 26 included publications, 21 unique interventions were identified within the context of structured research studies, while three additional studies explored the implementation and impact of spiritually focused interventions as they were naturally integrated into real-world settings without a formal research protocol. These studies were included to capture how spirituality-related interventions are applied and experienced outside of controlled research environments, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of current practices. Interventions were considered "unique" if they differed in name and core components (such as delivery method, contents, and/or therapeutic approach). Our team reviewed the descriptions of each intervention in detail to determine whether they represented a distinct intervention model. Interventions included in this review covered a span of approaches, such as a mind map-based life review program, spiritual group therapy, mindfulness-based art therapy, psilocybin-assisted therapy, and family-oriented dignity therapy and traditional healing practices. Some interventions were rooted in specific religious traditions, while the majority were spiritual but non-religious in orientation.

### Brain death revisited: it is not' complete death' according to islamic sources [^3dc2d884]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

Concepts, such as death, life and spirit cannot be known in their quintessential nature, but can be defined in accordance with their effects. In fact, those who think within the mode of pragmatism and Cartesian logic have ignored the metaphysical aspects of these terms. According to Islam, the entity that moves the body is named the soul. And the aliment of the soul is air. Cessation of breathing means leaving of the soul from the body. Those who agree on the diagnosis of brain death may not able to agree unanimously on the rules that lay down such diagnosis. That is to say, there are a heap of suspicions regarding the diagnosis of brain death, and these suspicions are on the increase. In fact, Islamic jurisprudence does not put provisions, decisions on suspicious grounds. By virtue of these facts, it can be asserted that brain death is not absolute death according to Islamic sources; for in the patients diagnosed with brain death the soul still has not abandoned the body. Therefore, these patients suffer in every operation performed on them.

### Lucy and jupiter-understanding the planetary origins [^2f9a3f03]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

This is not the first time the name Lucy comes up in questions of origin. In 1974, AL 288–1, or more commonly known as Lucy, was discovered in Ethiopia and is the skeleton of the 3.2-million-year-old hominin species Australopithecus afarensis. It is the early evidence of bipedal and upright walking-gait, similar to that of humans. Although the skeleton is named after the Beatles' song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, which was playing in the camp on the evening of the skeleton's discovery, one might wonder about a possible deeper meaning. Lucius, the Latin origin of the name Lucy, means 'light bringer', or 'born at the dawn of light', which is quite appropriate for the first upright walking skeleton. It makes only sense that NASA adopted the program name Lucy from paleoanthropology. Just like the Lucy skeleton marks one of the earliest direct predecessors of humans, the Trojan asteroids may provide the earliest evidence of how our Solar System and its planets, including Earth, formed.

Southwest Research Institute.

In Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar', one character noted that our generation was born too late to explore Earth, and too early to explore space – yet it feels we might be just in the perfect sweet spot to explore our Solar System origins. It remains to be seen whether NASA's Lucy can live up to its Latin meaning and actually become a light-bringer. The Jovian system itself may hold the keys to unlocking these questions of origins to some extent either way. Jupiter hosts Europa, an icy-ocean moon, which could theoretically offer the possibility of hosting primitive life forms, and will be visited by NASA's Clipper mission in the early 2030s. Appropriately, just like Lucy, also the Roman king of gods, Iuppiter, corresponds to the meaning of light in its indo-european linguistic roots — the Jovian system might indeed shine a major light on our questions of origin. Exciting times lie ahead of us!

### Hopelessness among middle-aged and older blacks: the negative impact of discrimination and protecting power of social and religious resources [^a6ea9827]. Innovation in Aging (2020). Medium credibility.

The social support and engagement derived from these relationships are critical for coping with stress and protecting against mental health conditions. Extant research has shown that blacks who receive greater emotional support from their family are less likely to have depression, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicidal ideation and attempts. Although negative interactions with family members or friends can be a source of stress for blacks, the emotional support received can lessen the impact of these interactions to limit adverse mental health.

Religious beliefs, regular religious service attendance, and church members are also important resources in the black community. Historically, the Black Church has been a foundational institution in the lives of black Americans. A tradition of research has documented the importance of the Black Church not only as a religious institution but also a cultural, social, educational, financial, and political institution that is central to many black communities. For example, the Black Church was an important symbol of the Civil Rights Movement and some of the most prominent leaders of this movement, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Fred Shuttlesworth, and Ralph Abernathy, were clergymen. Black churches were major points of mobilization for the effort as church members provided food and housing to civil rights workers and comprised a great proportion of the participants in civil rights demonstrations. In addition to their involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, throughout history, black churches have offered and still offer a wide range of community outreach programs and services, including senior citizen groups, antipoverty and material aid programs, food and clothing banks, health services, tutoring and educational programs, and employment programs.
