## Question

Is eculizumab indicated for drug-induced aplastic anemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether eculizumab is indicated for drug-induced aplastic anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of drug-induced aplastic anemia versus complement-mediated hemolysis. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend as first-line therapy for aplastic anemia. Next, I need to review eculizumab's mechanism, approved indications, and pivotal trial populations. After that, I will examine the AA–PNH interface, including clone prevalence, hemolysis, and screening cadence. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical recommendation with safety considerations and follow-up testing.

> Let me first confirm the disease biology and core treatment goals in drug-induced aplastic anemia, because if I get that wrong, the rest will unravel quickly. Aplastic anemia is a marrow failure syndrome characterized by immune-mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem cells, leading to hypocellular marrow and pancytopenia; the therapeutic objective is immune suppression and restoration of hematopoiesis, not control of complement-mediated hemolysis, and first-line therapy for severe/very severe AA is equine antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporin, with eltrombopag added in severe/very severe disease per contemporary BSH guidance, whereas transplantation is considered based on age, donor availability, and fitness [^113u4rvC] [^113tvzia] [^114ggjbW].

> Wait, let me verify my initial instinct about complement inhibition here, because it's tempting to overgeneralize immune therapies. Eculizumab is a terminal complement C5 inhibitor indicated for PNH and aHUS; its clinical value is in blocking intravascular hemolysis and thromboinflammation, and neither labeling nor pivotal data support use for AA itself, which is a T-cell–mediated marrow failure rather than a complement-driven hemolytic process, so eculizumab would not restore hematopoiesis in drug-induced AA [^115VLpMV] [^111Po3fH] [^1155kTH7].

> Hold on, I should verify the AA–PNH overlap before I draw a hard line. Up to half of AA patients harbor small PNH clones at diagnosis, typically without clinical hemolysis; large clones are clinically significant due to hemolysis and thrombosis risks, and guidelines advise systematic PNH screening at AA diagnosis, repeating at 6 months if negative, then annually, with more frequent checks if a clone is detected early, because clonal expansion or new-onset hemolysis would pivot management toward complement blockade for the PNH component [^113otLo8] [^116ZSEQm] [^114cdZw8].

> I need to check whether eculizumab has ever been shown to improve outcomes in AA without hemolysis, because that would change the calculus. The pivotal TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD trials enrolled patients with classical PNH and demonstrated robust hemolysis control, hemoglobin stabilization, and reduced transfusions, but they did not study AA without hemolysis; moreover, even in PNH patients with coexisting AA, eculizumab controls hemolysis without correcting underlying marrow failure, reinforcing that it is not a disease-modifying therapy for AA itself [^115VLpMV] [^113mwbq9] [^111Po3fH].

> But wait, what if an AA patient has a PNH clone — should clone size alone trigger eculizumab. I should double-check that nuance. Expert reviews emphasize that treatment should be driven by clinical hemolysis and thrombosis risk rather than clone size per se; in AA with a clinically significant PNH clone and evidence of complement-mediated hemolysis, eculizumab is appropriate for the hemolytic component, while AA still requires ATG/CsA-based immunosuppression with or without eltrombopag, underscoring parallel, indication-specific therapy streams [^115VRCME] [^113otLo8] [^113tvzia].

> Let me think about safety and logistics before concluding, because ignoring these would be a mistake. Eculizumab increases vulnerability to invasive meningococcal disease and other encapsulated organisms, so patients require meningococcal vaccination and risk counseling prior to therapy; chronic C5 inhibition is generally well tolerated yet costly and often indefinite, further underscoring the need to reserve it for clear, hemolysis-driven indications rather than bone marrow failure alone [^112HeG7A] [^1155kTH7] [^113chNMq].

> Pulling this together, I should confirm the final clinical position succinctly. Eculizumab is not indicated for drug-induced aplastic anemia itself; standard-of-care for AA is equine ATG plus cyclosporin, with eltrombopag added in severe/very severe disease or considered in selected adult settings, alongside early consideration of allogeneic transplantation where appropriate; however, if the AA patient develops a clinically significant PNH clone with biochemical/clinical evidence of complement-mediated hemolysis, eculizumab is appropriate to control the PNH hemolysis as adjunct therapy, while AA-directed immunosuppression or transplant strategy continues in parallel, and longitudinal PNH screening should be embedded at baseline, 6 months, and annually thereafter to detect such evolution [^113u4rvC] [^113tvzia] [^114ggjbW] [^116ZSEQm].

Eculizumab is **not indicated for aplastic anemia (AA)** and should not be used to treat AA. It is a complement C5 inhibitor approved for PNH and aHUS and is **appropriate only for AA patients with clinically significant PNH clones with hemolysis or thrombosis** [^113tvzia] [^115VRCME] [^113otLo8]. Eculizumab **does not address immune-mediated marrow failure** in AA; standard therapy remains immunosuppression with ATG plus cyclosporine [^113u4rvC], with or without eltrombopag [^113tvzia], or allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^114ggjbW]. Use of eculizumab in AA without PNH is **unsupported** and may expose patients to unnecessary risks and costs [^1155kTH7].

---

## Mechanism of action of eculizumab

Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that **binds complement component C5**, preventing its cleavage into C5a and C5b and thereby blocking formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) [^115tkWNh]. This inhibits terminal complement–mediated intravascular hemolysis, the core pathology in PNH and aHUS [^1155kTH7].

---

## Pathophysiology of aplastic anemia

AA is characterized by **immune-mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem cells**, leading to pancytopenia and marrow hypocellularity. The primary mechanism is autoreactive T-cell–mediated stem cell injury, not complement-mediated hemolysis.

---

## Clinical evidence for eculizumab in aplastic anemia

There is **no clinical evidence supporting eculizumab for AA without PNH**. Its role in AA is limited to patients who develop clinically significant PNH clones with hemolysis or thrombosis, where it targets complement-mediated hemolysis rather than marrow failure.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend eculizumab for AA without PNH**. Standard first-line therapy is immunosuppression with ATG plus cyclosporine [^113u4rvC], with or without eltrombopag [^113tvzia], or allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^114ggjbW]. Eculizumab is considered only when AA coexists with clinically significant PNH clones causing hemolysis or thrombosis.

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety profile

Eculizumab effectively reduces hemolysis, stabilizes hemoglobin, and lowers thrombosis risk in PNH [^111Po3fH], but **does not improve marrow failure in AA**. Its safety profile includes an increased risk of meningococcal infection, headache, and infusion reactions; meningococcal vaccination is required before use.

---

## Comparison with other treatments

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism** | **Indication** | **Effectiveness in AA** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Eculizumab | Complement C5 inhibition | - PNH <br/> - aHUS | Not effective in AA without PNH |
| ATG + cyclosporine | Immunosuppression | AA | Effective first-line therapy [^113tvzia] |
| Eltrombopag | Thrombopoietin receptor agonist | AA | Effective adjunctive therapy [^113Ze19k] |
| Allogeneic stem cell transplantation | Replacement of hematopoietic stem cells | AA | Curative in eligible patients [^114ggjbW] |

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Cost**: Eculizumab is expensive and not justified in AA without PNH [^1155kTH7].
- **Safety**: Increased risk of serious infections, including meningococcal disease.
- **Lack of evidence**: No data support its use in AA without PNH.

---

## Ongoing research and clinical trials

There are **no significant ongoing trials evaluating eculizumab in AA without PNH**; current research focuses on immunosuppressive strategies, stem cell transplantation, and novel agents targeting immune-mediated marrow failure.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Eculizumab is **not indicated for AA without PNH**. It does not address immune-mediated marrow failure in AA and **should be considered only** when clinically significant PNH clones with hemolysis or thrombosis are present. Standard AA therapy remains immunosuppression with ATG plus cyclosporine, with or without eltrombopag, or allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^113tvzia].

Therapeutic complement inhibition by eculizumab has revolutionized the treatment of these patients and is considered the standard of care for PNH patients with haemolytic disease or thromboembolic complications. Eculizumab is symptomatic, with PNH-related symptoms resurfacing upon withdrawal. Haemolysis-related transfusions, clinical signs arising from intravascular haemolysis, and thrombosis occurrence are all good reasons to begin therapy, whereas clone size per se is not. Conversely, patients with ongoing bone marrow failure from moderate or severe aplastic anaemia are less likely to derive any benefit from eculizumab. For these patients, therapy should address the underlying bone marrow failure.

All patients receiving eculizumab should be vaccinated, as the most severe risks of terminal complement blockade are life-threatening neisserial infections. In some countries, like France and the UK, penicillin prophylaxis is usually recommended, but this has not yet been formally evaluated. Despite eculizumab being a breakthrough therapy for PNH, recent efforts have aimed at further improving the standard therapy in PNH. In this manuscript, we review issues in anti-complement treatment for PNH, setting the goals for future complement inhibitors in development for PNH.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for aplastic anemia, specifically concerning initial assessment, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a careful reassessment to confirm the precise diagnosis. It is crucial to exclude clonal evolution to myelodysplastic syndrome or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, as this will influence the choice of conditioning. Furthermore, it is essential not to miss constitutional aplastic anemia to avoid serious and potentially lethal toxicity from the transplant and the inappropriate selection of a family donor.

### Treating C3 glomerulopathy with eculizumab [^111ifott]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Of note, high range urinary protein might also lead to accelerated renal elimination of eculizumab and therefore weaken the treatment response to eculizumab since therapeutic drug levels might not be maintained. In these cases, careful evaluation of complement activity, such as CH50 as an indicator of total complement activity or eculizumab serum concentrations, might be helpful in order to detect possible underdosing.

In contrast to aHUS, where eculizumab represents a successful therapy, response rates in C3G patients are heterogeneous. C3G and aHUS share uncontrolled activation of the alternative complement pathway and pathophysiological key regulators, such as mutations in complement factors or autoantibodies. However, the two diseases display fundamental differences: In aHUS, complement activation occurs on endothelial surfaces, leading to endothelial damage and thrombus formation. In C3G, complement activation occurs predominantly in the fluid phase, resulting in excess formation of activated C3 and cleavage products, which are deposited in the kidney and raise glomerular damage. Despite eculizumab-driven blockage of the terminal complement cascade, upstream C3 cleavage products may cause continuing glomerular damage. This provides reasons for diverging response rates to eculizumab in aHUS and C3G. Therefore, further studies evaluating other complement inhibitors, such as the emerging group of C3-convertase inhibitors, are needed. In this context, genetic and immunologic screening with the registration of relevant mutations, such as the CFHR5 genotype of patient DDD2 in the C3G database, is crucial.

### Sustained response and long-term safety of eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^1169NPHg]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a hematologic disorder characterized by clonal expansion of red blood cells (RBCs) lacking the ability to inhibit complement-mediated hemolysis. Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the C5 complement protein, blocks serum hemolytic activity. This study evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of eculizumab in 11 patients with PNH during an open-label extension trial. After the completion of an initial 12-week study, all patients chose to participate in the 52-week extension study.

Eculizumab, administered at 900 mg every 12 to 14 days, was sufficient to completely and consistently block complement activity in all patients. A dramatic reduction in hemolysis was maintained throughout the study, with a decrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels from 3110.7 IU/L before treatment to 622.4 IU/L (P = 0.002). The proportion of PNH type III RBCs increased from 36.7% at baseline to 58.4% (P = 0.005). The paroxysm rate of days with gross evidence of hemoglobinuria per patient each month decreased from 3.0 during screening to 0.2 (P < .001) during treatment. The median transfusion rate decreased from 1.8 U per patient each month before eculizumab treatment to 0.3 U per patient each month (P = 0.001) during treatment. Statistically significant improvements in quality-of-life measures were also maintained during the extension study.

Eculizumab continued to be safe and well tolerated, and all patients completed the study. The close relationship between sustained terminal complement inhibition, hemolysis, and symptoms was demonstrated.

### Eculizumab for complement mediated thrombotic microangiopathy in sickle cell disease [^114MfiQ7]. Haematologica (2020).

All patients and/or their guardians described in this report provided written consent for the off-label use of eculizumab. These patients received meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccinations as part of routine SCD standard-of-care or just before receiving eculizumab. They continued on a prophylactic antibiotic regimen while on treatment.

CM-TMA from an underlying mutation involving the complement regulatory genes is traditionally called atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome or 'atypical HUS' (aHUS). CM-TMA occurring secondary to complement amplifying disorders, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, malignancy, infections, or autoimmune diseases, is termed 'secondary HUS'. The clinical vignettes suggest that some complications of SCD may also reflect complement activation-induced secondary HUS. As SCD is a chronic hemolytic condition and plasma free HGB and heme can activate complement, additional complement activation during episodes of disease exacerbation may lead to increased hemolysis. This creates a sustained positive feedback loop that leads to life-threatening anemia. Because sickle erythrocytes are uniquely susceptible to complement-mediated damage, this may further exacerbate the disease. Heme-dependent endothelial dysfunction seen in SCD can also be modulated by complement activation. In addition, heme can regulate the coagulation system, which likely reflects another important feature of SCD pathophysiology that contributes to inflammation and thrombosis. Increased C5a production has also been shown to cause acute lung injury.

- **Fludarabine-containing conditioning**:
	- Administer in adult patients or patients with a high risk of graft failure.
	- Also administer in patients receiving matched unrelated donor-hematopoietic cell transplantation, cord blood transplantation, or haplo-hematopoietic cell transplantation.

### Eculizumab for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [^1155kTH7]. Lancet (2009). Low credibility.

The complement system plays a central role in both innate and acquired immunity. However, the contribution of complement activation to pathobiology is largely ancillary. An exception to this non-dominant role of complement in disease is the haemolytic anaemia of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). The intravascular haemolysis, which is the clinical hallmark of PNH, results from a deficiency in the complement inhibitory proteins, decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) and membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL, CD59).

Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and prevents the activation of complement C5 and the subsequent formation of the cytolytic membrane attack complex of complement. Eculizumab inhibits the intravascular haemolysis of PNH, reduces transfusion requirements, stabilizes haemoglobin concentration, and improves quality of life. Although chronic treatment with eculizumab increases the risk of infections with Neisseria meningitidis, the drug is generally safe and well-tolerated. However, similar to other drugs developed for the treatment of ultra-orphan diseases, eculizumab is expensive, and treatment must continue indefinitely because C5 inhibition does not affect the underlying process (i.e. clonal proliferation of haemopoietic stem cells with a mutant phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation class A [PIGA] gene) of PNH. Moreover, due to the heterogeneous nature of the disease, treatment with eculizumab is not suitable for all patients with PNH.

### Multicenter phase 3 study of the complement inhibitor eculizumab for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^113mwbq9]. Blood (2008). High credibility.

The terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab was recently shown to be effective and well tolerated in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Here, we extended these observations with results from an open-label, non-placebo-controlled, 52-week, phase 3 clinical safety and efficacy study evaluating eculizumab in a broader PNH patient population.

Eculizumab was administered by intravenous infusion at 600 mg every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks; 900 mg 7 ± 2 days later; followed by 900 mg every 14 ± 2 days for a total treatment period of 52 weeks. Ninety-seven patients at 33 international sites were enrolled. Patients treated with eculizumab responded with an 87% reduction in hemolysis, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels (P < .001). Baseline fatigue scores in the FACIT-Fatigue instrument improved by 12.2 ± 1.1 points (P < .001).

Eculizumab treatment led to an improvement in anemia. The increase in hemoglobin level occurred despite a reduction in transfusion requirements from a median of 8.0 units of packed red cells per patient before treatment to 0.0 units per patient during the study (P < .001). Overall, transfusions were reduced 52% from a mean of 12.3 to 5.9 units of packed red cells per patient. Forty-nine patients (51%) achieved transfusion independence for the entire 52-week period. Improvements in hemolysis, fatigue, and transfusion requirements with eculizumab were independent of baseline levels of hemolysis and degree of thrombocytopenia. Quality of life measures were also broadly improved with eculizumab treatment.

### Phase 3 randomized COMMODORE 1 trial: Crovalimab versus eculizumab in complement inhibitor-experienced patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^115D5VJC]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). High credibility.

Crovalimab, a novel C5 inhibitor, allows for low-volume, every-4-week, subcutaneous self-administration. COMMODORE 1 (NCT04432584) is a phase 3, global, randomized trial evaluating crovalimab versus eculizumab in C5 inhibitor-experienced patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Adults with lactate dehydrogenase ≤ 1.5× upper limit of normal and receiving approved eculizumab doses for ≥ 24 weeks were randomized 1:1 to receive crovalimab (weight-based tiered dosing) or continue eculizumab. The original primary study objective was efficacy; however, given the evolving treatment landscape, target recruitment was not met, and all efficacy endpoints became exploratory, with safety as the new primary objective.

- **Exploratory efficacy endpoints**: Transfusion avoidance, hemolysis control, breakthrough hemolysis, hemoglobin stabilization, FACIT-Fatigue score, and patient preference (crovalimab vs. eculizumab).

Eighty-nine patients were randomized (45 to crovalimab; 44 to eculizumab). During the 24-week primary treatment period, adverse events (AEs) occurred in 77% of patients receiving crovalimab and 67% receiving eculizumab. No AEs led to treatment withdrawal or death, and no meningococcal infections occurred. Sixteen percent of crovalimab-treated patients had transient immune complex reactions (also known as Type III hypersensitivity events), an expected risk when switching between C5 inhibitors that bind to different C5 epitopes; most were mild/moderate, and all resolved without treatment modification. Crovalimab-treated patients had sustained terminal complement activity inhibition.

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis events observed in the phase 3 randomized studies of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^116MdgWJ]. Haematologica (2021). Low credibility.

Until recently, eculizumab was the only approved treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Since its regulatory approval in 2007, it has changed the paradigm for the treatment of patients with PNH. Long-term experience has established that eculizumab is efficacious and well tolerated; however, approximately 11–27% of patients may experience breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) on approved dosages of eculizumab during long-term treatment.

Breakthrough hemolysis, characterized by the return of intravascular hemolysis and reappearance of classical PNH symptoms, may occur due to suboptimal C5 inhibition and/or complement amplifying conditions (CAC), such as infection, surgery, or pregnancy, which may lead to increased complement activation resulting from higher C3b density. In some patients with suboptimal C5 inhibition or CAC, BTH may be ameliorated by shortening the 2-week dosing interval and/or increasing the dose of eculizumab.

### A systematic review of the role of eculizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus-associated thrombotic microangiopathy [^111YPTic]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Eculizumab is a recombinant fully humanized IgG2/IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to C5, thus preventing the formation of the terminal complement complex. It is currently used successfully in the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The use of eculizumab is being explored in the treatment of other types of glomerulonephritis in which complement dysregulation is implicated, including IgA nephropathy and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). In view of its mode of action, eculizumab has also been considered for use in lupus nephritis (LN).

The aim of this project was to determine the role of eculizumab as adjunctive therapy in patients with LN. The objectives were to perform a systematic literature review using the PICOS framework: (P)articipants – all ages, sexes, and ethnicities included; (I)ntervention – those who received complement inhibition therapy for their systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); (C)omparison – before and after complement inhibition therapy; (O)utcome – any measurable outcome; and (S)tudy design – any study design.

### Eculizumab for treating patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^111Po3fH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a chronic, non-malignant disease of the hematopoietic stem cells, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of 1.3 new cases per one million individuals per year. The treatment of PNH has been largely empirical and symptomatic, involving blood transfusions, anticoagulation, and supplementation with folic acid or iron. Eculizumab, a biological agent that inhibits the complement cascade, was developed to prevent hemolytic anemia and severe thrombotic episodes.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical benefits and harms of eculizumab for treating patients with PNH.

- **Search methods**: We conducted a comprehensive search strategy. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946 to 15 May 2014), EMBASE (from 1980 to 25 June 2014), and LILACS (from 1982 to 25 June 2014). We did not apply any language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of their publication status or language. No limits were applied with respect to the period of follow-up. We excluded quasi-RCTs. We included trials comparing eculizumab with placebo or best available therapy. We included any patient with a confirmed diagnosis of PNH. The primary outcome was overall survival.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We independently performed a duplicate selection of eligible trials, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction.

### Eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor, improves anaemia in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [^1134Yt8U]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

In paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), chronic destruction of PNH red blood cells (RBCs) by complement leads to anaemia and other serious morbidities. Eculizumab inhibits terminal complement-mediated PNH RBC destruction by targeting C5. In the phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled TRIUMPH study, eculizumab reduced haemolysis, stabilized haemoglobin levels, reduced transfusion requirements, and improved fatigue in patients with PNH. Herein, we explored the effects of eculizumab on measures of anaemia in patients from the TRIUMPH study and the open-label SHEPHERD study, a more heterogeneous population.

Eculizumab reduced haemolysis regardless of pretreatment transfusion requirements and regardless of whether or not patients became transfusion-dependent during treatment (P < 0.001). Reduction in haemolysis was associated with increased PNH RBC counts (P < 0.001) while reticulocyte counts remained elevated. Eculizumab-treated patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of haemoglobin as compared with placebo in TRIUMPH and relative to baseline levels in SHEPHERD (P < 0.001 for each study).

Eculizumab lowered transfusion requirements across multiple pretreatment transfusion strata and eliminated transfusion support in a majority of both TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD patients (P < 0.001). Patients who required some transfusion support during treatment with eculizumab showed a reduction in haemolysis and transfusion requirements, and an improvement in fatigue. Eculizumab reduces haemolysis and improves anaemia and fatigue, regardless of transfusion requirements.

### Empaveli [^113MNFcg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The study was conducted in complement-inhibitor experienced adult patients with PNH, known as Study APL2–302. It enrolled patients with PNH who had been treated with a stable dose of eculizumab for at least the previous 3 months and had hemoglobin levels less than 10.5 g/dL.

Eligible patients entered a 4-week run-in period during which they received EMPAVELI 1,080 mg subcutaneously twice weekly along with their dose of eculizumab. Subsequently, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 1,080 mg of EMPAVELI twice weekly or their dose of eculizumab throughout the 16-week randomized controlled period (RCP).

Randomization was stratified based on the number of packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions within the 12 months prior to Day -28 (< 4; ≥ 4), and platelet count at screening (< 100,000/mm³; ≥ 100,000/mm³). Once the RCP was completed, all patients entered a 32-week open-label period (OLP) and received monotherapy with EMPAVELI. Patients initially randomized to eculizumab underwent a second 4-week run-in period during which they received EMPAVELI in addition to eculizumab, before continuing with EMPAVELI monotherapy. All patients who completed the 48-week period were eligible to enroll in a separate long-term extension study.

### Eculizumab for complement mediated thrombotic microangiopathy in sickle cell disease [^113D3aMN]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

This collection of cases emphasizes a previously underappreciated role of complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (CM-TMA) across a broad range of sickle cell disease (SCD) presentations. It may reflect novel insights into the pathophysiology of acute exacerbations of SCD that may be sensitive to complement inhibition, potentially avoiding severe hemolytic complications in SCD.

### Dissecting complement blockade for clinic use [^111cCdRV]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

In this issue of Blood, Peffault de Latour et al. describe ex vivo measurements of complement activity in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients on eculizumab treatment. This is the first systematic pharmacodynamic (PD) study of eculizumab in PNH patients, which shows that CH50 is a promising biomarker of therapeutic complement blockade.

### C3 inhibition with pegcetacoplan in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria treated with eculizumab [^114JcFyn]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). High credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired, life-threatening hematologic disease characterized by chronic complement-mediated hemolysis and thrombosis. Despite treatment with eculizumab, a C5 inhibitor, 72% of individuals remain anemic. Pegcetacoplan (APL-2), a PEGylated C3 inhibitor, has the potential to provide more complete hemolysis control in patients with PNH. This open-label, phase Ib study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of pegcetacoplan in subjects with PNH who remained anemic during treatment with eculizumab. Pharmacodynamic endpoints were also assessed as an exploratory objective of this study. Data are presented for six subjects in cohort 4 who received treatment for up to 2 years.

A total of 427 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported, 68 of which were possibly related to the study drug. Eight serious TEAEs occurred in two subjects; three of these events were considered possibly related to the study drug. Pegcetacoplan pharmacokinetic concentrations accumulated with repeated dosing, and steady state was reached at approximately 6–8 weeks. Lactate dehydrogenase levels were well controlled by eculizumab at baseline. Pegcetacoplan increased hemoglobin levels and decreased both reticulocyte count and total bilirubin in all six subjects. Improvements were observed in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue scores. Two subjects discontinued for reasons unrelated to pegcetacoplan. All four subjects who completed the study transitioned to pegcetacoplan monotherapy following eculizumab treatment.

### Eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome: 10-year pharmacovigilance analysis [^111586Cd]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

The reporting rate for solid and haematological tumors remained stable over the 10-year assessment period. Importantly, patients with PNH and aHUS may be predisposed to developing malignancies. For example, patients with PNH may also have concurrent bone marrow dysfunction, placing them at increased risk of developing acute leukaemia. Thus, haematological malignancy in the setting of PNH is more likely to be a manifestation of underlying abnormalities of haematopoietic function than an effect of eculizumab. Consistent with a potential association between malignancy and disease factors, the analysis showed diversity in tumour types and age at onset of malignancies for PNH and aHUS, respectively. Particularly low rates of malignancy were reported in pediatric patients with PNH and aHUS, consistent with the rarity of cancer in this age group.

Published information on background incidences of malignancies in patients with PNH or aHUS, regardless of treatment, is limited. However, some analyses comparing cohorts of treated and untreated patients showed no difference in cumulative incidence of clonal evolution to MDS or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In addition, in a systematic review of published studies in patients with PNH (N = 1665), 5.1% progressed to MDS or AML, and malignancy was the cause of death in 11.9%. Similar to patients with PNH, patients with aHUS who undergo transplantation or who otherwise receive long-term immunosuppressive treatment are at increased risk of malignancy.

### Advances in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^116GMvN6]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

In the era of eculizumab, the number of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has decreased significantly. However, owing to the possibility of severe aplastic anemia (AA) or a suboptimal response to eculizumab, HSCT still plays an important role in the treatment of patients with PNH combined with AA or hemolysis-related symptoms, despite its high level of risk. Here we review studies involving patients with PNH who underwent HSCT over the past 15 years and conclude that patients with refractory AA/PNH and patients with severe classical PNH are candidates for HSCT in countries where eculizumab is unavailable. The major causes of death following transplantation include graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infection, and thrombotic microangiopathy. A haploidentical donor is a potential choice for patients without an HLA-matched donor. In addition, the use of eculizumab in combination with HSCT may help prevent GVHD.

### Ultomiris [^116q6KrM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Study in eculizumab-experienced adult patients with PNH

The study in eculizumab-experienced patients (ALXN1210-PNH-302; NCT03056040) was a 26-week, multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled, non-inferiority Phase 3 study conducted in 195 patients with PNH who were clinically stable after being treated with eculizumab for at least the past 6 months. Patients who demonstrated clinically stable disease after being treated with eculizumab for at least the prior 6 months were randomized 1:1 to either continue eculizumab or to switch to Ultomiris administered intravenously.

The mean total PNH granulocyte clone size was 83%, the mean total PNH monocyte clone size was 86%, and the mean total PNH RBC clone size was 60%. Ninety-five percent of patients had a documented PNH-associated condition diagnosed prior to enrollment in the trial, including anemia (67%), hematuria or hemoglobinuria (49%), history of aplastic anemia (37%), history of renal failure (9%), myelodysplastic syndrome (5%), pregnancy complication (7%), and other (14%). Major baseline characteristics were balanced between the two treatment groups.

- **Efficacy**: Efficacy was established based on hemolysis as measured by LDH percent change from baseline to Day 183. Supportive efficacy data included transfusion avoidance, the proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin, and the proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis through Day 183. Non-inferiority of Ultomiris to eculizumab was demonstrated across endpoints.

### C3 inhibition with pegcetacoplan in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria treated with eculizumab [^1139omui]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Ravulizumab (Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Boston, MA) is another anti‐C5 humanized monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of adults with PNH by the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Ravulizumab differs structurally from eculizumab by the substitution of four amino acids that extend its circulating half‐life. It has been shown to be non‐inferior to eculizumab for transfusion avoidance and hemoglobin stabilization. Currently, there are no therapeutic options that address extravascular hemolysis in patients with PNH.

Given the clinical impact of C3‐mediated extravascular hemolysis in patients with PNH, research into C3 as a possible therapeutic target is warranted. We hypothesized that in subjects with PNH who remained anemic during treatment with eculizumab, complement blockade at the level of C3 with pegcetacoplan (APL‐2; Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Waltham, MA) would improve hemoglobin levels and provide more complete hemolysis control.

Pegcetacoplan is an investigational, targeted C3 inhibitor consisting of two 15‐amino acid cyclic peptides conjugated to a linear polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule to increase its half‐life. Pegcetacoplan binds to C3 and inhibits its activation. It also binds to and prevents the activity of C3b, inhibiting the activity of convertases containing a C3b subunit, including C3 and C5 convertases associated with the alternative pathway, and C5 convertase associated with the classical pathway. We report the results from an open‐label, phase Ib study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of pegcetacoplan in subjects with PNH.

### C3dg-CR3 interaction in erythrophagocytosis [^116oGBwE]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

In this issue of Blood, Lin et al. elegantly demonstrate that the erythrocytes from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) undergoing eculizumab treatment, which are opsonized with the complement C3dg, can interact with complement receptor 3 (CR3) on activated monocytes, thus leading to erythrophagocytosis.

### Ravulizumab (ALXN1210) vs eculizumab in adult patients with PNH naive to complement inhibitors: The 301 study [^1151xPQf]. Blood (2019). Low credibility.

Ravulizumab (ALXN1210), a new complement C5 inhibitor, provides immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition. This phase 3, open-label study assessed the noninferiority of ravulizumab to eculizumab in complement inhibitor-naive adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Patients with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels ≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and at least one PNH symptom were randomized 1:1 to receive ravulizumab or eculizumab for 183 days (N = 246).

- **Coprimary efficacy endpoints**: Proportion of patients remaining transfusion-free and LDH normalization.
- **Secondary endpoints**:
	- Percent change from baseline in LDH
	- Change from baseline in FACIT-Fatigue score
	- Proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis
	- Stabilized hemoglobin
	- Change in serum free C5

Ravulizumab was noninferior to eculizumab for both coprimary and all key secondary endpoints (Pinf < 0.0001):

- **Transfusion avoidance**: 73.6% vs. 66.1%; difference of 6.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), -4.66, 18.14]
- **LDH normalization**: 53.6% vs. 49.4%; odds ratio, 1.19 [0.80, 1.77]
- **Percent reduction in LDH**: -76.8% vs. -76.0%; difference [95% CI], -0.83% [-5.21, 3.56]
- **Change in FACIT-Fatigue score**: 7.07 vs. 6.40; difference [95% CI], 0.67 [-1.21, 2.55]
- **Breakthrough hemolysis**: 4.0% vs. 10.7%; difference [95% CI], -6.7% [-14.21, 0.18]
- **Stabilized hemoglobin**: 68.0% vs. 64.5%; difference [95% CI], 2.9% [-8.80, 14.64]

The safety and tolerability of ravulizumab and eculizumab were similar; no meningococcal infections occurred. In conclusion, ravulizumab was successfully demonstrated as noninferior to eculizumab in this patient population.

### Alvaiz [^113Ze19k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Eltrombopag was studied in a single-arm, single-center, open-label trial (Study ETB115AUS28T, referred to as Study US28T [NCT00922883]) in 43 patients with severe aplastic anemia who had an insufficient response to at least one prior immunosuppressive therapy and who had a platelet count less than or equal to 30 × 10⁹/L. Eltrombopag was administered at an initial dose of 50 mg once daily for 2 weeks and increased over 2-week periods up to a maximum dose of 150 mg once daily. The efficacy of eltrombopag in the study was evaluated by the hematologic response assessed after 12 weeks of treatment. Hematologic response was defined as meeting 1 or more of the following criteria:

- **Criteria for hematologic response**:
	1. Platelet count increases to 20 × 10⁹/L above baseline, or stable platelet counts with transfusion independence for a minimum of 8 weeks.
	2. Hemoglobin increase by greater than 1.5 g/dL, or a reduction in greater than or equal to 4 units of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for 8 consecutive weeks.
	3. ANC increase of 100% or an ANC increase greater than 0.5 × 10⁹/L.

Eltrombopag was discontinued after 16 weeks if no hematologic response was observed. Patients who responded continued therapy in an extension phase of the trial.

The treated population had a median age of 45 years (range, 17 to 77 years), and 56% were male. At baseline, the median platelet count was 20 × 10⁹/L, hemoglobin was 8.4 g/dL, ANC was 0.58 × 10⁹/L, and absolute reticulocyte count was 24.3 × 10⁹/L. Eighty-six percent of patients were red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent.

### The complement inhibitor eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^115VLpMV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

The study TRIUMPH was published by Hillmen P. and colleagues in 2006 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study pertains to paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

- **Research question**: What is the effect of eculizumab in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, RCT.

- **Population**: 87 patients (52 female, 35 male).

	- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

	- **Exclusion criteria**: Complement deficiency, an active bacterial infection, history of meningococcal disease, and receipt of bone marrow transplantation.

- **Interventions**:

	- **Eculizumab group (n = 43)**: IV at a dose of 600 mg weekly for 4 weeks, followed 1 week later by a 900-mg dose, and then 900 mg every other week through week 26.

	- **Placebo group (n = 44)**: Matching placebo.

- **Primary outcome**: Significant increase in stabilization of hemoglobin levels in the absence of transfusions (49% vs. 0%; ARD 49, 95% CI 19.93 to 78.07).

- **Secondary outcomes**:

	- Significant decrease in units of packed red cells transfusion (0 vs. 10; MD -10, 95% CI -15.93 to -4.07).

	- Significant increase in change in the QoL during treatment, global health status scale (10.9 points vs. -8.5 points; MD 19.4, 95% CI 7.89 to 30.91).

- **Safety outcomes**: Significant difference in serious adverse events (9% vs. 20%).

- **Conclusion**: In patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, eculizumab showed significant benefits in stabilizing hemoglobin levels, reducing transfusion requirements, improving quality of life, and presenting a favorable safety profile.

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis events observed in the phase 3 randomized studies of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^1116HS3v]. Haematologica (2021). High credibility.

In patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) receiving complement inhibitor therapy, a breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) event represents a loss of disease control. BTH manifests through classical PNH symptoms and may require blood transfusion. More critically, it can be associated with the return of morbidity linked to PNH, including potentially life-threatening thromboembolic events. A consensus definition of BTH, derived following a literature review and interviews with PNH experts, and prospectively accepted by regulatory authorities, was utilized in the two phase III studies of ravulizumab. These studies evaluated the incidence and causality of BTH in patients who were naïve to complement inhibitor therapy, as well as those previously stabilized on eculizumab. In both studies, ravulizumab was shown to be non-inferior to eculizumab in the assessment of BTH. Treatment with ravulizumab was associated with numerically fewer episodes of BTH compared to eculizumab in each study.

The analysis showed that no BTH events in patients treated with weight-based dosing of ravulizumab were associated with elevations in free C5 levels. In contrast, several patients treated with eculizumab across both studies experienced BTH events that were temporally associated with elevations in free C5 levels (C5 ≥ 0.5 mg/mL), suggesting these patients may have had suboptimal C5 control. In such cases, BTH has been shown to be successfully managed in some patients by adjusting the dosing amount and/or frequency of eculizumab administration.

### Terminal complement inhibition and control of hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria who switched from high-dose eculizumab to ravulizumab: a phase IV, single-arm clinical trial [^113hSp4V]. Haematologica (2025). Low credibility.

Over the treatment period, 12 out of 18 patients (66.7%) avoided transfusion. In previous trials of ravulizumab in patients with PNH, transfusion avoidance levels of 76.6% and 86.5% were reported following one year of treatment; the lower proportion in this study may be due to the smaller sample size, the shorter follow-up, and differences in the patient populations.

The main limitation of this study is the small sample size, which precludes formal statistical comparisons. This was expected, as the study was based on a subpopulation of patients with a rare disease receiving a dose above the approved fixed-dose regimen. In addition, the study recruited patients from two referral centers in a single country; consequently, findings should be interpreted with caution and may not be generalizable to the wider PNH population. Finally, only patients receiving eculizumab 1,200 mg Q2W were included in the study, so findings may not be applicable to the small proportion of patients requiring even higher doses of eculizumab.

In summary, switching treatment from high-dose intravenous eculizumab (1,200 mg Q2W) to standard, weight-based intravenous ravulizumab resulted in minimal changes in laboratory measures at an improved dosing interval, with no new safety signals reported. These findings support the use of weight-based ravulizumab as a suitable and well-tolerated alternative to eculizumab.

### Nationwide survey on the use of eltrombopag in patients with severe aplastic anemia: A report on behalf of the French Reference Center for Aplastic Anemia [^116ED51f]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Few therapeutic options are available for patients with aplastic anemia who are ineligible for transplantation or refractory to immunosuppressive therapy. Eltrombopag was recently shown to produce trilineage responses in refractory patients; however, the effects of real-life use of this drug remain unknown. This retrospective study (2012–2016) was conducted by the French Reference Center for Aplastic Anemia on patients with relapsed/refractory aplastic anemia, and patients ineligible for antithymocyte globulin or transplantation, who received eltrombopag for at least 2 months. Forty-six patients with aplastic anemia received eltrombopag either without prior antithymocyte globulin treatment (n = 11) or after antithymocyte globulin administration (n = 35) in a relapsed/refractory setting. Eltrombopag (median daily dose 150 mg) was introduced 17 months (range 8–50) after the diagnosis of aplastic anemia.

At the last follow-up, 49% were still receiving treatment, 9% had stopped due to a robust response, 2% due to toxicity, and 40% due to eltrombopag failure. Before eltrombopag treatment, all patients received regular transfusions. The overall rates of red blood cell and platelet transfusion independence were 7%, 33%, 46%, and 46% at 1, 3, and 6 months, and at the last follow-up. Responses were slower to develop in antithymocyte treatment-naïve patients. In patients achieving transfusion independence, hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts improved by 3 g/dL (interquartile range 1.4–4.5) and 42×10⁹/L (interquartile range 11–100), respectively.

### Modified Delphi panel consensus recommendations for management of severe aplastic anemia [^115weDo8]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

In medically fit patients who received horse ATG + CsA as first-line therapy, we recommend the following: In patients aged ≤ 60 years refractory to initial therapy (Figure 2B) or relapsed after obtaining a response, we recommend allo-HSCT with the best available donor (MRD, MUD, or haploidentical). In patients aged > 60 years, refractory to initial therapy or relapsed after obtaining a response, we also recommend allo-HSCT with an MRD. Allo-HSCT with a best available alternative donor (e.g. MUD or haploidentical) may be considered depending on individual patient circumstances. For patients who relapsed after obtaining a response (Figure 3B), a second course of high-intensity therapy or resuming CsA with eltrombopag can be attempted to reinduce response; we recommend this option particularly in patients with late immune-type AA relapses.

- **Patients aged > 20 years**: When allo-HSCT is not a medical option, we recommend high-intensity or low-intensity medical therapy in combination with eltrombopag (Table 2).
- **Patients aged ≤ 20 years**: When allo-HSCT is not a medical option, we did not agree on whether eltrombopag should be provided with second-line medical therapy because of limited data for this option in young patients. We also recommend evaluating all patients for available clinical trials.

In all medically unfit patients regardless of age (Figures 2C and 3C), we recommend the following: low-intensity therapy (Table 2) with eltrombopag; single-agent eltrombopag in patients who did not receive eltrombopag in the first-line setting; romiplostim can also be considered.

### Clinical efficacy and safety of switching from eculizumab to ravulizumab in adult patients with aHUS- real-world data [^115k3eZq]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

The complement factor 5 (C5)-inhibitor eculizumab has been established as the standard-of-care for the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). In 2021, the long-acting C5-inhibitor ravulizumab was approved, extending intervals of intravenous treatment from two to eight weeks, resulting in an improvement in the quality of life for patients and lowering direct and indirect therapy-associated costs.

- **Methods**: This multicenter, retrospective data analysis of 32 adult patients with aHUS (including 10 kidney transplant recipients) treated with eculizumab for at least three months and switched to ravulizumab aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of switching medication in the real-world setting. Hematologic parameters, kidney function, therapy, and aHUS-associated events were evaluated three months before and until up to 12 months after switching to ravulizumab.

- **Results**: Mean age (range) at ravulizumab initiation was 41 years (19–78 years), and 59% of the patients were female. Genetic analysis was available for all patients, with 72% showing a pathogenic variant. Median time (range) on eculizumab before switching was 20 months (3–120 months). No new events of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) or worsening of renal function were reported during up to 12 months of follow-up during ravulizumab treatment.

- **Conclusions**: This is the largest, non-industry derived, multi-center retrospective analysis of adult patients with aHUS switching C5-inhibitor treatment from eculizumab to ravulizumab in the real-world setting. Switching to ravulizumab was safe and efficient, resulting in sustained hematologic and renal stability for the patients.

### Up-front alternative donor HCT in severe aplastic anemia: Gaps and opportunities to translate evidence into practice [^115ngkz9]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Realizing the full potential of any clinical trial depends on several factors. Previously published studies show that even with strong data from rigorous clinical trials, the translation of research findings into clinical practice remains limited. Several impactful and practice-changing multi-institutional studies were conducted in the field of HCT in the last two decades; however, the successful translation of these findings into clinical practice varied. Based on these experiences, we now know that the strength of evidence alone is insufficient; equal emphasis must be placed on ensuring its implementation by identifying and engaging relevant stakeholders. Consequently, the field of dissemination and implementation science has gained momentum, emphasizing the need for proactive integration of implementation frameworks and stakeholder engagement in ongoing trials to bridge the gap between evidence and practice if the trials meet endpoints.

- **Stakeholder awareness and engagement**: The first step in stakeholder engagement involves increasing awareness among community hematologists and HCT physicians on existing gaps in the SAA treatment landscape and the potential relative advantage of up-front alternative donor HCT to fill these gaps. Discussions about potential long-term complications associated with the use of TBI and Cy could possibly deter clinicians from implementing these practices.

Few therapeutic options are available for patients with aplastic anemia who are ineligible for transplantation or refractory to immunosuppressive therapy. Eltrombopag was recently shown to produce trilineage responses in refractory patients. However, the effects of real-life use of this drug remain unknown.

This retrospective study (2012–2016) was conducted by the French Reference Center for Aplastic Anemia on patients with relapsed/refractory aplastic anemia and patients ineligible for antithymocyte globulin or transplantation, who received eltrombopag for at least 2 months. Forty-six patients with aplastic anemia were given eltrombopag without prior antithymocyte globulin treatment (n = 11) or after antithymocyte globulin administration (n = 35) in a relapsed/refractory setting.

Eltrombopag (median daily dose 150 mg) was introduced 17 months (range, 8–50) after the diagnosis of aplastic anemia. At last follow-up, 49% were still receiving treatment, 9% had stopped due to a robust response, 2% due to toxicity, and 40% due to eltrombopag failure. Before eltrombopag treatment, all patients received regular transfusions.

The overall rates of red blood cell and platelet transfusion independence were 7%, 33%, 46%, and 46% at 1, 3, 6 months and last follow-up. Responses were slower to develop in antithymocyte treatment-naïve patients. In patients achieving transfusion independence, hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts improved by 3 g/dL (interquartile range, 1.4–4.5) and 42×10⁹/L (interquartile range, 11–100), respectively.

### Advancements in complement inhibition for PNH and primary complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy [^113chNMq]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Eculizumab, a C5 inhibitor, was the first approved complement-directed therapy for patients with PNH and aHUS and has been associated with reduced morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Eculizumab is administered intravenously, with a loading dose of 600 mg weekly for four doses, followed by a maintenance dose of 900 mg every two weeks. This monoclonal antibody targets the C5 protein, blocking its activation and preventing the formation of the terminal attack complex. Although eculizumab is well tolerated, it carries a 0.5% annual risk of contracting N. meningitidis infection.

Leading studies, including the TRIUMPH (N = 87) and SHEPHERD (N = 97) trials, report hemoglobin stabilization, reduced red blood cell transfusions, decreased hemolysis, and improved fatigue among patients with PNH. Importantly, eculizumab is the only approved therapy for treating women with PNH during pregnancy, reducing mortality and the incidence of thrombotic events.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of adult aplastic anaemia: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^114z47vU]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for aplastic anaemia, particularly the evaluation for inherited AA, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive assessment. This includes a detailed family history, abdominal ultrasound, echocardiogram, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest, pulmonary function tests, and evaluation for other extra-hematopoietic abnormalities, such as liver cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, or renal anomalies. The presence of these abnormalities can support a diagnosis of constitutional rather than idiopathic bone marrow failure.

### Long-term outcome of a randomized controlled study in patients with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia treated with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a severe aplastic anemia working party trial from the European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplantation [^113VjjAi]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Acquired aplastic anemia is a rare disease defined by peripheral pancytopenia associated with hypocellularity of the bone marrow. The aim of treatment for aplastic anemia is to improve peripheral blood counts and achieve transfusion independence. First-line treatment for younger patients (≤ 40 years old) with a matched sibling donor is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The standard of care for adult patients ineligible for SCT is immunosuppressive therapy (IST), which includes a combination of horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA). In contrast to patients undergoing SCT, those treated with IST are not cured from their disease and are at risk of late complications such as relapse and development of late clonal diseases, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, the delayed recovery of peripheral blood counts exposes patients to infectious and hemorrhagic complications.

Immunosuppression remains a suboptimal treatment, as about 30% of patients fail to respond and even in responding patients, blood counts often remain subnormal, possibly requiring maintenance IST with CSA. Efforts have been made for 40 years to improve the standard horse ATG plus CSA treatment. Other immunosuppressive combinations, as well as the use of high-dose cyclophosphamide, have been evaluated without showing the expected breakthrough.

### The complement inhibitor eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^115tkWNh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

We tested the safety and efficacy of eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against terminal complement protein C5 that inhibits terminal complement activation, in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 trial. Patients received either placebo or eculizumab intravenously; eculizumab was given at a dose of 600 mg weekly for 4 weeks, followed 1 week later by a 900-mg dose and then 900 mg every other week through week 26. The two primary endpoints were the stabilization of hemoglobin levels and the number of units of packed red cells transfused. Biochemical indicators of intravascular hemolysis and the patients' quality of life were also assessed.

- **Results**: Eighty-seven patients underwent randomization. Stabilization of hemoglobin levels in the absence of transfusions was achieved in 49% (21 of 43) of the patients assigned to eculizumab and none (0 of 44) of those assigned to placebo (P < 0.001). During the study, a median of 0 units of packed red cells was administered in the eculizumab group, as compared with 10 units in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Eculizumab reduced intravascular hemolysis, as shown by the 85.8% lower median area under the curve for lactate dehydrogenase plotted against time (in days) in the eculizumab group, as compared with the placebo group (58,587 vs. 411,822 U per liter; P < 0.001). Clinically significant improvements were also found in the quality of life, as measured by scores on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy.

### Voydeya [^116zcSkz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Voydeya is indicated as an add-on therapy to ravulizumab or eculizumab for the treatment of extravascular hemolysis (EVH) in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Voydeya is a complement factor D inhibitor used in this capacity.

- **Limitations of use**: Voydeya has not been shown to be effective as monotherapy and should only be prescribed as an add-on to ravulizumab or eculizumab.

### Eculizumab for complement mediated thrombotic microangiopathy in sickle cell disease [^117Wjrjd]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

A graphic representation of a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR), vaso-occlusive crisis, and drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia episode is provided. During the DHTR episode, the patient received a transfusion (black arrows) on day one and presented with DHTR on day 7 with a hemoglobin (HGB) level of 9.4 g/dL, which dropped to a nadir of 5.6 g/dL by day 8, along with absolute reticulocytopenia, as expected in DHTR. Thrombocytopenia coincided with this severe anemia and was accompanied by elevations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin (T. Bili), and aspartate transaminase (AST).

Other evidence for intravascular hemolysis included reduced haptoglobin levels (< 14; reference 30–120 mg/dL) and elevated plasma free HGB levels (120; reference < 30 mg/dL). Eculizumab (E) 600 mg was initiated on day 8 and administered weekly for a total of four doses. The patient developed acute chest syndrome (ACS) and received one unit of crossmatch-compatible, U-negative red blood cells (RBC) following a dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on day 9.

The resolution of hemolysis was evidenced by the improvement in LDH and HGB following the first dose of eculizumab and was maintained throughout the hospital stay, with thrombocytopenia recovering within one week of complement inhibition. The patient required an additional transfusion on day 19 due to rebound anemia, likely secondary to frequent blood draws, since markers of hemolysis and complement activation on day 22 did not worsen.

### Long-term outcome of a randomized controlled study in patients with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia treated with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: A severe aplastic anemia working party trial from the European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplantation [^112ogEFQ]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Early death occurs secondary to infection, bleeding, or complications of severe anemia. Limited data are available on late malignant and non-malignant complications after immunosuppressive therapy (IST). Today, 16 years after initiation, this randomized controlled study provides a unique opportunity to assess the long-term outcomes of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) patients treated with IST. We aimed to evaluate the durability of response to treatment, survival outcomes, and the risk of long-term complications in patients treated with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA), with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).

### Long-term outcome of a randomized controlled study in patients with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia treated with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a severe aplastic anemia working party trial from the European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplantation [^113szEYP]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

The study presents the cumulative incidence of late complications in patients with severe aplastic anemia treated with horse antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.

- **Cumulative incidence of relapse**: Patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) treated with horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA), with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), show varying cumulative incidence of relapse.

- **Cumulative probability of being transplanted**: This measures the probability of transplantation in patients with SAA treated in the first line with horse ATG and CSA, with death without transplant being a competing event.

- **Cumulative incidence of clonal evolution**: Patients with SAA treated with horse ATG and CSA, with or without G-CSF, demonstrate different rates of clonal evolution to a hematologic malignancy, such as myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia or isolated cytogenetic abnormalities.

- **Cumulative incidence of any late event**: The study also observes the cumulative incidence of any late events, including relapse, myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia, isolated cytogenetic abnormalities, solid cancer, clinical paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, aseptic osteonecrosis, and chronic kidney disease in patients with SAA treated with horse ATG and CSA, with or without G-CSF.

### Impact of eculizumab treatment on paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: A treatment versus no-treatment study [^114AtsKZ]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Intravascular hemolysis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) can effectively be controlled with eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds complement protein C5. We report here a retrospective comparison study between 123 patients treated with eculizumab in the recent period (> 2005) and 191 historical controls from the French registry. Overall survival (OS) at six years was 92% (95% CI, 87 to 98) in the eculizumab cohort versus 80% (95% CI, 70 to 91) in historical controls diagnosed after 1985 (HR 0.38 [0.15 to 0.94], P = 0.037).

There were significantly fewer thrombotic events (TEs) in the group of patients treated with eculizumab (4% [1–10]) compared to the historical cohort (27% [20–34]). However, TEs may still occur after the initiation of eculizumab treatment, and previous TEs still have a negative impact on survival. Evolutions to myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia were similar in both cohorts, but there was less evolution to aplastic anemia in the treatment group. In multivariate analysis, the absence of a previous TE and treatment with eculizumab were associated with better OS. Treatment with eculizumab improves overall survival in classic PNH patients without increasing the risk of clonal evolution.

### Complement gene variant effect on relapse of complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy after eculizumab cessation [^112LMLBG]. Blood Advances (2023). Low credibility.

- **Suggested framework for consideration of eculizumab discontinuation in CM-TMA**: The role of complement inhibitor therapy and its discontinuation is less clear in the setting of these "noncomplement" variants. Note that the study had small numbers of patients with variants in these genes, which should be considered when making decisions regarding complement inhibitor duration.

The main limitations of our study include its retrospective nature. The presented population predominantly derives from retrospective cohorts, case series, and individual case reports, some of which were published when experience regarding the use and discontinuation of terminal complement inhibitors was minimal, leading to heterogeneous treatment of CM-TMA events. Only one clinical trial designed to evaluate the predictive role of factors, including genetic variants in CM-TMA, has been published at the time of writing. Other prospective trials included in this study were not designed or powered to evaluate the possible discontinuation of complement inhibition therapy in CM-TMA, but rather to assess the efficacy of eculizumab in this disorder, and as such, are limited regarding the level of detail when reporting complement gene variants. Similarly, in the setting of this single prospective trial designed to investigate the risk of relapse after eculizumab discontinuation, the cohort does not provide insight on other laboratory assessments (i.e. complement serology, urine protein/creatinine ratio) that may prove useful for relapse risk stratification after eculizumab discontinuation.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of adult aplastic anaemia: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^111zj53d]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for aplastic anemia, specifically concerning blood transfusions, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend considering a restrictive transfusion strategy (hemoglobin 70–80 g/L; 80 g/L for patients with cardiovascular disease) in stable hospitalized patients. For outpatients, it is advised to adopt individualized transfusion plans based on symptoms and comorbidities, aligning with the limited data in myelodysplastic syndrome.

### Erythropoietin treatment during complement inhibition with eculizumab in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^117T1U4C]. Haematologica (2007). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by intravascular hemolysis leading to anemia and other clinical manifestations. Transfusions are often required to support hemoglobin at tolerable levels. A PNH patient with aplastic anemia was treated with the complement inhibitor eculizumab, followed by treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo).

Eculizumab alone reduced hemolysis, increased PNH red blood cell (RBC) mass, and decreased transfusions. The addition of rHuEpo during eculizumab therapy enhanced erythropoiesis, further increased PNH RBC mass and hemoglobin levels, and rendered the patient transfusion independent for more than two years. These data show that driving erythropoiesis during eculizumab treatment provided further benefit to a patient with PNH and underlying bone marrow failure.

### Ultomiris [^1161e32c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The study in eculizumab-experienced and complement-inhibitor naïve pediatric patients with PNH, identified as ALXN1210-PNH-304 (NCT03406507), was a multi-center, open-label Phase 3 study. It involved eculizumab-experienced and complement inhibitor treatment-naïve pediatric patients with PNH. A total of 13 pediatric patients completed intravenously administered ULTOMIRIS treatment during the primary evaluation period (26 weeks). Five of these patients had never been treated with complement inhibitors, while 8 had been treated with eculizumab. Eleven of the thirteen patients were between 12 and 17 years of age at first infusion, with two patients under 12 years old (11 and 9 years old). Table 26 presents the baseline characteristics of the pediatric patients enrolled in study ALXN1210-PNH-304.

- **Dosage and administration**: Based on body weight, patients received a loading dose of ULTOMIRIS on Day 1, followed by maintenance treatment on Day 15 and once every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or once every 4 weeks (q4w) for patients weighing < 20 kg. For patients who entered the study on eculizumab therapy, Day 1 of study treatment was planned to occur 2 weeks from the patient's last dose of eculizumab.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with moderate aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia treated with daclizumab [^113fpWLd]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Pure red cell aplasia and moderate aplastic anemia are marrow failure states with an immune pathogenesis. Previously, we described short-term improvements in blood counts in two pilot studies treating moderate aplastic anemia (mAA) and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) patients with daclizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interleukin-2 receptor; we now report our long-term experience with a larger cohort of patients.

- **Design and methods**: After a median follow-up period of 4.8 years, 19 of 45 (42%) evaluable mAA patients and 10 of 26 (38%) patients with PRCA responded by three months, and 2 additional mAA patients responded by six months following administration of the drug.

- **Results**: Seven of 28 (25%) mAA patients achieved long-term packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion independence, and all PRCA responders achieved long-term PRBC transfusion independence.

- **Conclusions**: Red cell transfusion-independence prior to treatment in mAA patients predicted response. The only significant adverse treatment-related events were transient rashes and arthralgias. Daclizumab is safe and effective and produces lengthy remissions in patients with PRCA and mAA.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of sustained eculizumab treatment in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [^112FG2Yq]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Long-term treatment with eculizumab resulted in sustained haematological improvement in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. Transfusion independence was achieved by 52% (102 of 195) of patients within the first 6 months of treatment, which increased to 82% by the last 6 months of treatment. Over the 36-month period, the number of units of PRBCs transfused was reduced by 55%. In addition, there was a continuous improvement in haemoglobin levels, which was achieved despite the reduction in transfusions.

The standard eculizumab maintenance dose of 900 mg every 14 ± 2 days was sufficient to maintain inhibition of haemolysis in 89% of patients. In the 21 patients who reported breakthrough haemolysis, shortening the dosing interval to less than 14 days was sufficient to maintain inhibition of haemolysis, and none of these patients discontinued treatment because of a lack of therapeutic effect. It is important for patients to be monitored for any signs or symptoms of breakthrough haemolysis so that the dosing can be adjusted accordingly or, in cases of persistent breakthroughs, to ensure the patient has not developed human anti-human antibodies (HAHA) or neutralizing antibodies to eculizumab.

Subsequent to the end of the study, a more sensitive analysis became available for the identification of HAHA in patients receiving eculizumab. With this new analysis, two of the patients in the long-term extension study were found to have low positive values for neutralizing antibodies, which exceeded the prespecified threshold for the in vitro assay. This finding had no impact on the clinical response to eculizumab.

### When to stop eculizumab in complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathies [^117AXE9x]. American Journal of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The terminal complement-inhibitor eculizumab has dramatically changed the management of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and has also shown promise for treating certain forms of secondary HUS (sHUS), including that caused by drugs and solid-organ/hematopoietic stem cell transplant. While effective, eculizumab is costly and inconvenient. In this review, we evaluate the literature on eculizumab cessation in these diseases to better inform clinicians who consider stopping therapy. Reported relapse rates in aHUS after stopping eculizumab are as high as 30%, suggesting indefinite therapy is reasonable and that patients who choose to stop should be closely monitored. In sHUS, relapse is rare, justifying short courses of eculizumab.

### Incomplete inhibition by eculizumab: Mechanistic evidence for residual C5 activity during strong complement activation [^115LMrUn]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Eculizumab inhibits the terminal lytic pathway of complement by blocking the activation of the complement protein C5 and shows remarkable clinical benefits in certain complement-mediated diseases. However, several reports suggest that activation of C5 is not always completely suppressed in patients, even under an excess of eculizumab over C5, indicating that residual C5 activity may derogate the drug's therapeutic benefit under certain conditions. By using eculizumab and the tick-derived C5 inhibitor, coversin, we determined conditions ex vivo in which C5 inhibition is incomplete.

The degree of such residual lytic activity depended on the strength of the complement activator and the resulting surface density of the complement activation product C3b, which autoamplifies via the alternative pathway (AP) amplification loop. At high C3b densities required for binding and activation of C5, both inhibitors reduce but do not abolish this interaction. The decrease of C5 binding to C3b clusters in the presence of C5 inhibitors correlated with the levels of residual hemolysis.

- **Residual hemolytic activity**: However, by employing different C5 inhibitors simultaneously, residual hemolytic activity could be abolished. The importance of AP-produced C3b clusters for C5 activation in the presence of eculizumab was corroborated by the finding that residual hemolysis after forceful activation of the classical pathway could be reduced by blocking the AP.

By providing insights into C5 activation and inhibition, our study delivers the rationale for the clinically observed phenomenon of residual terminal pathway activation.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of adult aplastic anaemia: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^116ZSEQm]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for aplastic anemia, specifically in relation to screening for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining screening at the diagnosis of AA. If the initial test is negative, repeat testing after 6 months, and then continue with annual testing unless symptoms or signs develop. If the screening is or becomes positive, repeat testing every 3 months for the first year. Reduce the frequency of testing only if the proportion of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria cells has remained stable.

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis events observed in the phase 3 randomized studies of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^1172Hkc1]. Haematologica (2021). High credibility.

Eculizumab is a first-line treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH); however, approximately 11–27% of patients may experience breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) on approved doses of eculizumab. Ravulizumab, a new long-acting C5 inhibitor with a four times longer mean half-life than eculizumab, provides immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition over 8-week dosing intervals.

In two phase III studies, ravulizumab was non-inferior to eculizumab (Pinf ≤ 0.0004) for the BTH endpoint; fewer patients experienced BTH with ravulizumab versus eculizumab in both studies: 301 [complement inhibitor-naïve patients], 4.0% vs. 10.7%; 302 [patients stabilized on eculizumab at baseline], 0% vs. 5.1%.

In the analysis, patient-level data were evaluated to assess causes and clinical parameters associated with incidents of BTH reported during the 26-week treatment periods in the ravulizumab phase III PNH studies. Of the five BTH events occurring in ravulizumab-treated patients across the studies, none were temporally associated with suboptimal C5 inhibition (free C5 ≥ 0.5 mg/mL); four (80%) were temporally associated with complement-amplifying conditions (CAC).

Of the 22 events occurring in eculizumab-treated patients, 11 were temporally associated with suboptimal C5 inhibition, including three events also associated with concomitant infection. Six events were associated with CAC only. Five events were unrelated to free C5 elevation or reported CAC. These results suggest that the immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition achieved through weight-based dosing of ravulizumab…

### How we'll treat paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: diving into the future [^117P2fs6]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

The introduction of eculizumab for the treatment of PNH led to the description of C3-mediated extravascular haemolysis as a novel mechanism of disease in PNH, unmasked by anti-C5 therapy. Now, the clinical use of proximal complement inhibitors is raising different questions about our understanding of complement biology in PNH, eventually identifying possible pitfalls of this novel treatment strategy.

- **Pitfalls and caveats of novel anti-complement therapies in PNH**:
	- Novel anti-C5 agents seem as effective as eculizumab, with possible advantages related to longer dosing intervals and easier administration routes (i.e. subcutaneous), which result in more convenient treatment options for patients and care providers.
	- Novel anti-C5 agents may have better pharmacological properties, possibly allowing for a deeper C5 inhibition; some data suggest that in some cases, this may reduce the risk of pharmacokinetic breakthrough haemolysis, while episodes of pharmacodynamic breakthrough haemolysis associated with complement-amplifying conditions seem unaffected.
	- The safety profile of novel anti-C5 agents seems consistent with that of eculizumab, with the exception of transient autoimmune manifestations, due to drug-target-drug immune complexes in patients switching from eculizumab to other anti-C5 antibodies targeting different C5 epitopes.
	- Novel anti-C5 agents, intrinsically, cannot address the unmet clinical need of C3-mediated extravascular haemolysis.

### Proposal for individualized dosing of eculizumab in atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome: Patient friendly and cost-effective [^114qqQpK]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

As therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of eculizumab is not yet implemented in every clinic, we aimed to develop a 4-week dosing interval of eculizumab without the necessity of measuring drug concentrations. With our 4-week dosing interval, 91% of all patients reach the efficacy target during the complete dosing interval.

As lifelong eculizumab administration does not seem a prerequisite for effective treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), one may consider a one-time higher dose to allow effective treatment during a holiday; thus, the cost increments due to longer dosing intervals are limited. Furthermore, outpatient treatment costs are saved when administering eculizumab every 4 weeks instead of every 2 weeks.

With the recent introduction of the long-acting C5-inhibitor ravulizumab-cwvz, the development of a 4-week interval regimen of eculizumab has likely become less relevant. However, we believe that eculizumab might still be the drug of choice in several subgroups of aHUS, such as patients who need short-term treatment.

Different analytical methods to measure eculizumab concentrations and classical pathway activity were used in this study for logistical reasons. Although one may argue that using different bioanalytical assays, which may result in slightly different results for eculizumab concentrations, is a shortcoming of our study, our systematic analysis and cross-validation of the bioanalytical methods allowed us to correct for this phenomenon. This enabled us to perform an integral analysis of all pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data on this rare disease. Nonetheless, our findings stress the necessity of cross-validation of laboratory methods.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of adult aplastic anaemia: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^113otLo8]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for aplastic anemia, specifically with respect to screening for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend recognizing that small paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clones can be detected in up to 50% of patients with AA, usually without evidence of hemolysis. It is important to recognize that large clones are clinically significant and may result in hemolysis as well as an increased thrombotic risk (hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria).
