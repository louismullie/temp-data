## Question

What are the diagnostic tests used to identify esophageal conditions?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnostic tests are used to identify esophageal conditions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how symptoms guide the initial diagnostic pathway. Then, I should verify the first-line structural evaluation with endoscopy and when to obtain biopsies. Next, I will examine reflux testing strategies for unproven versus proven GERD. After that, I need to assess motility testing with high-resolution manometry and adjuncts like FLIP and barium. I will then consider extraesophageal symptom workups and the lack of a gold standard. Finally, I should review emerging tools, special populations, and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats and limitations, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-backed evidence and performance characteristics [^111cXxE6] [^112BbBRE].

> Let me first confirm the symptom-driven triage because test selection hinges on whether the presentation is reflux-type, obstructive-type, or extraesophageal-type; typical reflux symptoms often start with an empiric PPI trial, but I need to remember that symptom response is neither sensitive nor specific for GERD, so objective testing is required when the diagnosis is uncertain or management decisions depend on it, and extraesophageal symptoms require parallel evaluation for ENT, pulmonary, or allergic etiologies rather than assuming reflux causality [^111AdDTS] [^1172KSFs] [^111cmmDg].

> I will now examine the first-line structural test, and upper endoscopy with biopsies is the anchor for dysphagia and persistent reflux; wait, let me verify the biopsy thresholds and sampling strategy because missing eosinophilic esophagitis is common if I under-sample, so I should obtain at least 5–6 biopsies from proximal and distal esophagus even if mucosa looks normal, and I should also consider a low threshold for multiple biopsies in dysphagia to evaluate for EoE and other mucosal diseases [^111MRBjf] [^114KoSAx] [^114eoA1a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about GERD just because heartburn is present; I need to check the reflux testing strategy next, and ambulatory reflux monitoring is the standard for objective GERD diagnosis, with off-therapy pH or pH-impedance preferred when GERD is unproven and on-therapy pH-impedance when GERD is proven but symptoms persist, while prolonged wireless pH monitoring can improve yield in intermittent symptoms; I should double-check that endoscopic evidence of high-grade erosive esophagitis or long-segment Barrett's obviates the need for reflux monitoring in many cases [^112NP6wx] [^113E6eUZ] [^117XMqtB] [^1146HQs6].

> Next, I should review motility testing for obstructive symptoms or when endoscopy is unrevealing; high-resolution manometry is the gold standard and outperforms conventional manometry for achalasia and other motor disorders, and I need to ensure I incorporate provocative maneuvers such as multiple rapid swallows and rapid drink challenge to improve diagnostic yield; let me verify that FLIP can help when HRM is borderline or incomplete, and that manometry is not a diagnostic test for GERD itself but is essential to exclude major motor disorders before antireflux procedures [^115njQZS] [^116S7DNi] [^111bxeAd] [^11419r5f].

> But wait, what if endoscopy and manometry are discordant or equivocal; I should consider barium esophagography as an adjunct, particularly a timed barium esophagram to quantify esophageal emptying in achalasia and to delineate strictures, rings, or post-surgical anatomy; I need to check the limitations because barium has suboptimal sensitivity for motility disorders compared with HRM, so I should not overinterpret a normal esophagram when clinical suspicion remains high [^111qABDy] [^112PMVdW] [^115wugNb].

> I will now examine extraesophageal symptoms, and I should confirm that there is no single gold-standard test linking cough, hoarseness, or laryngitis to reflux; the workup should be integrated and multidisciplinary, with empiric PPI trials used cautiously and objective reflux testing considered only after ENT or pulmonary evaluations and after optimizing acid suppression, and I should avoid oropharyngeal pH monitoring given poor diagnostic performance and limited therapeutic yield [^111cmmDg] [^113uy53E] [^112SqJuS].

> Let me consider emerging and adjunctive tools, but I need to ensure I don't overstate their utility; baseline or mucosal impedance can perform comparably to endoscopy or reflux monitoring in some analyses, salivary pepsin lacks validated utility for extraesophageal reflux, and EsoCheck/EsoGuard represent nonendoscopic approaches under study for Barrett's detection in selected populations rather than established clinical replacements for EGD, so I should frame these as investigational or adjunctive pending broader validation [^111xKEHm] [^113uy53E] [^112eEn1d].

> I should double-check special populations and scenarios because thresholds and sequencing differ; in pediatrics, eosinophilic GI diseases beyond EoE require segment-specific eosinophil thresholds and judicious endoscopic sampling, while in patients with chest pain without heartburn, reflux monitoring can be considered after cardiac etiologies are excluded, and in complex postoperative or reoperative dysphagia, barium esophagram and FLIP can add anatomic and functional insights when HRM is limited [^114ko56S] [^111aB4BW] [^115zfHWk].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic flow while acknowledging evidence limitations; for reflux-type symptoms, start with an empiric PPI trial recognizing its limited diagnostic accuracy, and if symptoms persist or objective confirmation is needed, proceed to endoscopy and then ambulatory reflux monitoring off therapy if endoscopy is normal; for obstructive-type symptoms, prioritize endoscopy with adequate biopsies first, then HRM with provocative maneuvers and consider FLIP or barium if results are borderline; for extraesophageal symptoms, coordinate ENT and pulmonary evaluations and avoid reflexively attributing symptoms to reflux without integrated testing and cautious empiric therapy, always revisiting the diagnosis if responses do not align with expectations [^111AdDTS] [^115njQZS] [^111cmmDg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that a normal endoscopy excludes GERD; I should correct that because endoscopy has low sensitivity for GERD in the absence of erosive disease, so a normal EGD does not rule out physiologic reflux, which is precisely why ambulatory reflux monitoring is pivotal when the clinical picture and endoscopy are discordant or when procedural therapy is planned [^113eQ4xv] [^112NP6wx].

> Finally, I need to ensure the limitations of evidence are transparent; many recommendations are conditional with low to very low quality evidence, questionnaires and symptom scales have limited diagnostic accuracy, and overtesting can yield false positives that complicate management, so shared decision-making, judicious test selection, and reassessment after objective data are essential to avoid anchoring bias and unnecessary interventions [^111NiBfg] [^114PzhHZ] [^112EkqKS].

Esophageal tests include **endoscopy with biopsy** to assess mucosa and obtain tissue for histology [^114bqDkN]; **high-resolution manometry** to diagnose motility disorders [^115njQZS]; **ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring** to quantify reflux and correlate symptoms [^113suQBJ]; **barium esophagram** to define anatomy and detect strictures or rings [^111qABDy]; and **functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP)** to measure distensibility and complement manometry [^111bxeAd]. These tests are selected based on symptoms and suspected pathology: endoscopy for dysphagia or alarm features [^111MRBjf], manometry for motility, pH-impedance for reflux, barium for structural assessment, and FLIP for equivocal manometry or surgical planning [^116zH1Kw] [^113MeWMV].

---

## Endoscopy with biopsy

- **Purpose**: Direct visualization of esophageal mucosa; obtain biopsies for histopathology [^116A5ru4].
- **Indications**: Dysphagia, odynophagia, alarm symptoms, refractory GERD, suspected EoE, Barrett's, malignancy [^111MRBjf].
- **Procedure**: Flexible endoscope through mouth to esophagus; biopsies via forceps [^116A5ru4].
- **Findings**: Mucosal inflammation, erosions, strictures, rings, Barrett's, EoE, malignancy [^113eQ4xv].
- **Limitations**: Invasive; sedation risks; may miss subtle motility or functional disease [^111XVzhk].

---

## High-resolution manometry (HRM)

- **Purpose**: Measures esophageal pressures to diagnose motility disorders [^115njQZS].
- **Indications**: Dysphagia, noncardiac chest pain, suspected achalasia, EGJ outflow obstruction, pre-surgical planning [^115njQZS].
- **Procedure**: Nasal catheter with pressure sensors; 10 supine swallows; provocative maneuvers (MRS, RDC) [^116S7DNi].
- **Findings**: Achalasia types, distal esophageal spasm, hypercontractile esophagus, weak peristalsis, normal [^1154GQ2g].
- **Limitations**: Patient tolerance, artifacts, operator dependence [^notfound].

---

## Ambulatory reflux monitoring (pH-impedance)

- **Purpose**: Quantifies acid/nonacid reflux and correlates with symptoms [^112BbBRE].
- **Indications**: Suspected GERD with normal endoscopy, refractory GERD, extraesophageal symptoms, pre-surgical planning [^112NP6wx].
- **Procedure**: Nasal catheter or wireless capsule; 24–96 hour recording; off or on PPI per strategy [^112vBmKr].
- **Findings**: Acid exposure time, reflux episodes, symptom association [^111AdDTS].
- **Limitations**: Invasive, nasal discomfort, variable reflux day-to-day [^117XMqtB].

---

## Barium esophagram

- **Purpose**: Structural and functional assessment of esophagus and EGJ [^111qABDy].
- **Indications**: Dysphagia, suspected strictures/rings, achalasia, pre-surgical planning, postoperative assessment [^111qABDy].
- **Procedure**: Oral barium; fluoroscopic imaging; timed barium for emptying [^111qABDy].
- **Findings**: Strictures, rings, webs, diverticula, hiatal hernia, achalasia, motility patterns [^111qABDy].
- **Limitations**: Radiation, lower sensitivity for subtle motility disorders [^112PMVdW].

---

## Functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP)

FLIP complements HRM by measuring **EGJ distensibility** and is indicated for equivocal manometry, pre-surgical planning, or achalasia follow-up. During endoscopy, a balloon catheter inflates to assess distensibility and compliance [^notfound]. It identifies reduced EGJ distensibility in achalasia and hypertensive disorders, and has limited availability and operator dependence [^notfound].

---

## Selection of esophageal tests

| **Suspected condition** | **Primary test** | **Secondary test** |
|-|-|-|
| GERD | pH-impedance | Endoscopy |
| Eosinophilic esophagitis | Endoscopy + biopsy | pH-impedance |
| Achalasia | HRM | Barium esophagram |
| Stricture/ring | Barium esophagram | Endoscopy |
| Barrett's esophagus | Endoscopy + biopsy | None |
| Refractory GERD | pH-impedance | HRM |

---

## Emerging and experimental tests

Emerging tests include **salivary pepsin** for extraesophageal reflux (limited utility) [^113uy53E], **mucosal impedance** for mucosal integrity and reflux detection (promising) [^111xKEHm], and **high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM)** for detailed bolus flow and pressure analysis (research) [^115iybxo].

---

Esophageal tests span endoscopy, manometry, reflux monitoring, barium imaging, and FLIP, each with specific roles and limitations. Test selection should be **symptom- and suspicion-driven** to accurately diagnose and guide management.

ACG clinical guidelines — organization and methods explain that this guideline is structured in the format of summaries of evidence, recommendations, and key concepts pertaining to esophageal physiologic tests used for the evaluation of 3 symptom categories: obstructive symptoms, esophageal reflux symptoms, and extraesophageal or atypical symptoms. The authors developed specific patient population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) questions within the 3 symptom categories, with a dedicated informationalist at the University of Michigan helping perform literature searches to extract relevant manuscripts within the assigned PICO question, and two authors assigned to each PICO question each reviewed the literature searches and then conferred on supportive evidence specific to each question. In this ACG clinical guideline, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation process was used to describe performance characteristics and clinical value of esophageal physiologic tests and provide recommendations for their utilization in routine clinical practice.

### ACG clinical guidelines: clinical use of esophageal physiologic testing [^111NiBfg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions on esophageal physiologic testing — precision-focused use amid low evidence quality, with need for better studies. Esophageal presentations, patient self-report questionnaire information, and even empiric therapeutic trials are not always predictive of esophageal disorders with high certainty. The overall goal of esophageal physiologic testing should be to identify unique characteristics about each symptomatic patient that will allow delivery of precision, personalized management. A major setback is that existing esophageal research evaluating the value of esophageal function tests has very low quality of evidence. However, despite low GRADE quality and conditional recommendations, esophageal physiologic testing options form an integral part of patient evaluation in the setting of esophageal symptoms that persist without objective evidence of etiology or pathophysiology on endoscopy. Proper test selection, with understanding of test performance characteristics and limitations, can help identify disease processes and predict symptom outcome from management. Prospective high-quality studies using multiple modalities of esophageal tests for symptomatic patients are needed to understand the true value of each physiologic test in predicting outcome.

Esophageal GERD syndromes — Diagnostic testing is invoked in 3 broad scenarios: to avert misdiagnosis, to identify complications of reflux disease, and in the evaluation of empirical treatment failures; in the endoscopic evaluation of dysphagia the endoscopist should have a low threshold for obtaining multiple biopsies, preferably at least 5, to evaluate for eosinophilic esophagitis; for troublesome symptoms not adequately responsive to empirical twice-daily PPI therapy, endoscopy is again the first diagnostic test to consider, followed after a normal endoscopy by esophageal manometry and then by ascertaining whether there is excessive esophageal acid exposure when PPI therapy is withheld; high-quality evidence supporting the broad utility of alarm features as a diagnostic tool is quite limited, but individual alarm features with the best performance include weight loss, dysphagia, and epigastric mass on examination.

Patient-reported symptom questionnaires in obstructive esophageal symptoms — diagnostic performance and limitations: Multiple standardized tools (e.g., the Mayo Dysphagia Questionnaire and the Brief Esophageal Dysphagia Questionnaire [BEDQ]) may modestly differ between patients with and without esophageal motor disorders; however, the BEDQ was only 70% sensitive and 65% specific in identifying major motor disorders, and in eosinophilic esophagitis a low symptom score detected histologic or endoscopic remission with approximately 60% accuracy; although such tools aid evaluation and tracking, their inconsistent association with objective findings severely limits their utility to independently diagnose specific esophageal disorders, and key concepts state that questionnaires may aid evaluation but should not be used alone to diagnose specific conditions.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^1176DC9W]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

The Lyon Consensus proposes conclusive criteria for and against the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and adjunctive metrics that either consolidate or refute GERD diagnosis when primary criteria are inconclusive. New published research indicates that testing strategies and thresholds differ when investigating patients with unproven versus proven GERD. The definition of GERD needed to be updated following improved specificity of diagnostic testing. Finally, as ROME V diagnostic criteria are being developed for oesophageal disorders of gut–brain interaction (DGBI), specific criteria for diagnosis and exclusion of GERD were needed that were consistent with emerging research. For several reasons (table 1), an update of the original Lyon Consensus is essential and timely.

Table 1
Justification of update of the Lyon Consensus

The current update of the Lyon Consensus seeks to improve specificity of the modern diagnosis of GERD, to make oesophageal diagnostic algorithms congruent for identification of conclusive GERD, and for exclusion of GERD when favouring DGBI or other oesophageal disorders. Additionally, Lyon Consensus 2.0 defines GERD considering recent evidence, describes 'actionable' GERD where evidence from oesophageal testing supports revising, escalating or personalising GERD management, and identifies symptoms that have a high versus low likelihood of pathophysiological relationship to reflux episodes.

Diagnostic tests for extraesophageal reflux — there are no established diagnostic tests that unequivocally link any suspected extraesophageal symptom to GERD. Tests commonly used include laryngoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, ambulatory pH monitoring, combined pH-impedance ambulatory monitoring, and novel tests such as salivary pepsin and mucosal impedance, but they suffer from either lack of sensitivity or specificity and have limited associated treatment outcomes.

### Multi-society consensus conference and guideline on the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^116zH1Kw]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) diagnostic workup — typical versus extra-esophageal symptoms: EGD, manometry, and pH testing are essential components of the diagnostic workup for patients with typical esophageal GERD symptoms, and manometry is used to rule out other motility disorders such as achalasia; for patients with atypical or extra-esophageal symptoms such as cough, throat clearing, chest pain, or hoarseness, additional workup including pH/impedance testing should be employed with possible referral to other specialty providers as determined by the physician.

Diagnostic tests for suspected esophageal GERD syndromes — evidence search and literature limitations: The search combined terms for diagnostic interventions (endoscopy, esophageal manometry, ambulatory pH monitoring, pH testing) with "esophageal GERD syndrome", and added the MeSH term "GERD" and "multichannel intraluminal impedance", yielding 125 relevant papers. Commentary indicates this question was particularly difficult to address in an evidence-based fashion because very little literature focused on testing management strategy trials, tending instead to demonstrate capabilities of new technologies without rigorously testing clinical validity.

### The role of barium esophagography in an endoscopy world [^113b7kRX]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Barium esophagography, although an old test, remains important to the understanding of esophageal physiology and diagnosis of esophageal disorders. It provides additive and/or confirmatory information to endoscopy and is the more accurate means of yielding diagnosis. Barium esophagography allows correlation of symptoms with barium findings and with varied textures substances. It allows, particularly for oropharyngeal dysfunction, implementation therapeutic maneuvers and instructions while testing. The caveat to maintaining the benefits of barium esophagography is continuing to promote and support expertise from our radiologists in performing these studies, which has been challenged by our cost-efficient and high-tech medical society.

### Gastric and esophageal emergencies [^112ivq1s]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of esophageal and gastric disorders is complicated and broad and includes iatrogenic, structural, inflammatory, neuromuscular, neoplastic, and infectious causes. Symptoms can be nonspecific and are often initially attributed to cardiac or respiratory causes. These disorders have both acute and chronic presentations that require different approaches to diagnosis and management. A thorough history and physical examination enable emergency physicians to initiate evaluation of gastroesophageal disorders. Complete evaluation often requires a combination of emergent screening to rule out life-threatening problems as well as coordinated outpatient testing.

In conclusion, the current systematic review and NMA shows that esophageal mucosal impedance and baseline impedance has a high diagnostic performance similar to esophageal reflux monitoring or endoscopy. The future direction of GERD management should be developing and improving techniques with high diagnostic performance; not only for a precision phenotype definition but also for a tailored treatment strategy.

### Chicago classification version 4.0technical review: update on standard high-resolution manometry protocol for the assessment of esophageal motility [^116S7DNi]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

The Chicago Classification v4.0 (CCv4.0) is the updated classification scheme for esophageal motility disorders using metrics from high-resolution manometry (HRM). A key feature of CCv.4.0 is the more rigorous and expansive protocol that incorporates single wet swallows acquired in different positions (supine, upright) and provocative testing, including multiple rapid swallows and rapid drink challenge. Additionally, solid bolus swallows, solid test meal, and/or pharmacologic provocation can be used to identify clinically relevant motility disorders and other conditions (eg, rumination) that occur during and after meals. The acquisition and analysis for performing these tests and the evidence supporting their inclusion in the Chicago Classification protocol is detailed in this technical review. Provocative tests are designed to increase the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of HRM studies for disorders of esophageal motility. These changes attempt to minimize ambiguity in prior iterations of Chicago Classification, decrease the proportion of HRM studies that deliver inconclusive diagnoses and increase the number of patients with a clinically relevant diagnosis that can direct effective therapy. Another aim in establishing a standard manometry protocol for motility laboratories around the world is to facilitate procedural consistency, improve diagnostic reliability, and promote collaborative research.

### Esophageal motor disorders [^114v56TE]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Esophageal motor function remains of investigative and clinical interest because of its relevance to symptoms and its relation to the occurrence and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Refinement in diagnostic methods continues to occur, and improved tests for identifying the nature or severity of motor disturbances in both the proximal and distal esophageal regions are now well described. Controversy concerning the management of achalasia, the best-understood distal motor disorder, is resolving as the benefits and disadvantages of available treatment options are becoming recognized. The relation of esophageal motor dysfunction to outcomes from antireflux surgery remains incompletely understood.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^112SqJuS]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Extraesophageal symptoms attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) provides the following diagnostic guidance: Best Practice Advice 1: The role of a gastroenterologist in patients referred for evaluation of suspected extra esophageal symptom is to assess for gastroesophageal etiologies that could contribute to the presenting symptoms. Best Practice Advice 2: Non-GI evaluations by ENT, pulmonary and/or allergy are essential and often should be performed initially in most patients as the cause of the symptoms are more likely explained by these other entities than reflux. Best Practice Advice 3: Empiric therapy with aggressive acid suppression for 6–8 weeks with special focus on response of the extraesophageal symptoms can help in assessing association between reflux and extraesophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 4: No single testing methodology exists to definitively identify reflux as the etiology for the suspected extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 5: Constellation of patient presentation, diagnostic test results and response to therapy should be employed in the determination of reflux as a possible etiology in extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 6: Testing may need to be off or on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy depending on patients' presenting demographics and symptoms in assessing the likelihood of abnormal gastroesophageal reflux. A. On therapy testing may be considered in those with high probability of baseline reflux. B. Off therapy testing may be considered in those with low probability of baseline reflux with the goal of identifying moderate to severe reflux at baseline.

### ACG clinical guidelines: clinical use of esophageal physiologic testing [^115njQZS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

High-resolution manometry in obstructive esophageal symptoms — primary recommendations and comparative evidence states: We recommend that patients with obstructive esophageal symptoms without a mechanical cause undergo high-resolution esophageal manometry for the evaluation for esophageal motility disorders (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend HRM over conventional line tracing manometry for the diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders in patients with obstructive esophageal symptoms (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Supporting evidence includes that a multicenter randomized trial of 247 patients demonstrated an improved diagnostic yield for achalasia with HRM compared with CM, and diagnoses tended to be more frequently confirmed in patients who underwent HRM compared with CM.

### Assessing old and new diagnostic tests for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113Xnyai]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A detailed critique of objective measurements of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) would improve management of patients suspecting of having reflux, leading to rational selection of treatment and better outcomes. Many diagnostic tests for GERD have been developed over the past decades. We analyze their development, positive- and negative-predictive values, and ability to predict response to treatment. These features are important for development of medical, surgical, and endoscopic therapies for GERD. We discuss the value of available diagnostic tests and review their role in management of patients with persistent reflux symptoms despite adequate medical or surgical treatment. This is becoming a significant health economic problem, due to the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors. GERD is believed to cause nonesophageal symptoms, such as those provoked by ear, nose, throat, or respiratory disorders. We analyze the value of GERD diagnostic tests in evaluation of these troublesome, nonesophageal symptoms.

Esophageal physiologic testing — diagnostic management of esophageal symptoms includes initial "endoscopy to evaluate for mucosal and mechanical processes", followed by targeted testing. Reflux evaluation uses monitoring "To determine abnormal reflux burden" and "To assess reflux-symptom association", with "unproven GERD test off PPI pH impedance wireless pH catheter pH", and "proven GERD test on PPI pH impedance". For obstructive and atypical presentations, "high resolution manometry, high resolution impedance manometry" are used "To diagnose major motor disorders; to assess peristaltic performance before antireflux surgery; to determine pathophysiology of reflux; to diagnose rumination and SGB", with provocative branches: "provocative HRM:reflux" ("MRS to determine peristaltic reserve" and "RDC to evaluate for outflow obstruction"), "provocative HRM:obstructive" ("RDC, STM to evaluate for outflow obstruction"), and "provocative HRM:atypical" ("Postprandial monitoring to diagnose rumination and SGB"). Adjunctive modalities include "barium radiography" and "FLIP", each described as an "alternative or complementary approach to diagnosis of motor disorders, follow-up after treatment of major motor disorders".

Typical reflux symptoms and diagnostic approach — When patients present with heartburn or acid regurgitation, an empiric trial of acid suppressive therapy is typically used; however, neither symptom assessment (GERD questionnaires) nor response to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trials are adequate for conclusive diagnosis of GERD. The standard for assessment of abnormal esophagogastric acid exposure is ambulatory reflux monitoring, either pH monitoring or pH impedance monitoring; this may not be necessary if endoscopy shows high-grade erosive esophagitis or GERD-related complications, and esophageal HRM is emerging as an adjunctive method when evidence is otherwise inconclusive.

Empiric proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial — As a diagnostic test, the original PPI test used 40–80 mg a day of omeprazole or equivalent in divided doses for 7–28 days, but pooled evidence shows limited accuracy: in 15 studies (1–4 weeks), sensitivity was 78% and specificity only 54% for GERD; in noncardiac chest pain, sensitivity was 80%; and in the Diamond analysis, a 2-week PPI test produced positive responses in 69% with GERD vs 51% without GERD with a positive likelihood ratio of 1.52 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.71, reinforcing limited diagnostic utility and underscoring that objective reflux monitoring is clearest for symptomatic nonresponders, those planned for invasive management, and patients concerned about long-term PPI therapy.

Diagnostic evaluation for achalasia in patients with dysphagia begins with barium esophagography to evaluate for an anatomic lesion of the esophagus or the gastric fundus. Most of the patients with achalasia can be detected with an initial radiologic approach. Esophageal manometry, however, remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of achalasia and is important for patients for whom a correct diagnosis is uncertain or essential. The article reviews these and other diagnostic tests that may be used in evaluating patients suspected of having achalasia.

### Esophageal motility disorders: current approach to diagnostics and therapeutics [^113BuZFS]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Dysphagia is a common symptom with significant impact on quality of life. Our diagnostic armamentarium was primarily limited to endoscopy and barium esophagram until the advent of manometric techniques in the 1970s, which provided the first reliable tool for assessment of esophageal motor function. Since that time, significant advances have been made over the last 3 decades in our understanding of various esophageal motility disorders due to improvement in diagnostics with high-resolution esophageal manometry. High-resolution esophageal manometry has improved the sensitivity for detecting achalasia and has also enhanced our understanding of spastic and hypomotility disorders of the esophageal body. In this review, we discuss the current approach to diagnosis and therapeutics of various esophageal motility disorders.

### Assessing different diagnostic tests for gastroesophageal reflux disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114NAX2w]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common healthcare issues, with an estimated worldwide prevalence of up to 33%, resulting in a heavy economic burden of approximately $13.0 billion/year to the healthcare system in the United States alone, due to the different diagnostic testing and overuse of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) to a great extent. Albeit with the advances of diagnostic tests for GERD, the lack of a 'gold standard' has made identifying patients with GERD one of the biggest dilemmas in clinical practice.

Although GERD is generally empirically diagnosed based on typical reflux symptoms (heartburn and regurgitation), the sensitivity and specificity of the symptom-based diagnosis of GERD is limited due to the complex symptom spectrum for GERD. Patients with suspected GERD symptoms are often first tested for a response to PPI therapy, which definitely results in unnecessary overuse of PPIs because of its high placebo effect and low specificity. So far, upper endoscopy and esophageal pH/pH impedance testing are usually performed to detect GERD complications, as well as documentation of the presence of reflux for an objective GERD diagnosis. In order to develop a better understanding of the pathophysiology and improve appropriate GERD diagnosis, several new diagnostic tests, such as baseline impedance, esophageal mucosal impedance, salivary pepsin, and histopathology have been developed in recent years.

To the best of our knowledge, there has been little published information regarding the comparison of diagnostic performance among individual tests. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to assess the diagnostic characteristics of the GERDQ questionnaire, PPI test, baseline impedance, mucosal impedance, dilated intercellular spaces (DIS), salivary pepsin, esophageal pH/pH impedance monitoring and endoscopy for GERD.

ACG clinical guidelines — esophageal physiologic testing for obstructive symptoms provides graded statements as follows: We suggest that patients with obstructive esophageal symptoms without a mechanical cause should undergo high-resolution manometry (HRM) for evaluation of esophageal motility disorders. We recommend HRM over conventional line tracing manometry for the diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders in patients with obstructive esophageal symptoms. We suggest utilization of supplementary/provocative maneuvers with the HRM protocol to improve the diagnostic yield of esophageal motility disorders in patients with obstructive esophageal symptoms. We suggest the inclusion of a barium tablet with a barium esophagram during the evaluation of obstructive esophageal symptoms. We suggest the use of functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) to complement HRM for the diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders in patients with obstructive esophageal symptoms and borderline HRM findings. We suggest that the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and gastric cardia anatomy should be inspected endoscopically and/or radiographically to assess for mechanical abnormalities in patients with esophageal symptoms after antireflux surgery.

### Modern diagnosis of GERD: the Lyon consensus [^111T7xLZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of GERD

GERD is empirically diagnosed and treated in clinical practice based on the clinician's symptom assessment. Indications for testing include treatment failure, diagnostic uncertainty and treating (or preventing) complications of GERD. However, diagnostic testing may or may not support the initial diagnosis, as the criteria defining GERD are specific to each testing modality. Consequently, understanding the performance characteristics of each diagnostic modality and recognising evidence that supports or refutes the clinical impression of GERD is crucial. The Lyon Consensus evaluated GERD diagnostic tests from that perspective, and test results were categorised as being adequate to establish or refute a GERD diagnosis or inconclusive in the absence of additional supportive evidence.

The primary focus of oesophageal testing has hitherto been restricted to detection of excessive acid reflux as indicative of pathological GERD, supported by reflux-symptom association analysis. The threshold value discriminating abnormal from normal oesophageal acid exposure with 24 hour pH-metry was initially selected based on evidence that higher acid exposure is associated with the presence of reflux oesophagitis. However, the focus of current GERD management is on healing mucosal disease and on managing symptoms. The association of oesophageal acid exposure with patient symptoms is weak, making sole reliance of this metric problematic. Expansion of testing to include oesophageal mucosal impedance, manometry, histopathology and psychometrics may help in this regard, potentially identifying distinct GERD phenotypes with unique management implications. Each test adds a piece to the overall puzzle of symptom generation, disease pathophysiology and precision management.

Clinical history and questionnaires

Typical GERD symptoms (heartburn and acid regurgitation) are more likely than atypical symptoms to respond to treatment, emphasising the value of an accurate clinical history. However, when compared with objective evidence of GERD defined by pH-metry or endoscopy, even an expert history by a gastroenterologist has only 70% sensitivity and 67% specificity, reiterating the distinction between a physiology-based and a symptom-based GERD diagnosis. Likewise, questionnaires such as the reflux disease questionnaire (RDQ) and gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire (GERDQ) have similar limitations when compared with physiological testing. However, in clinical practice, diagnosing and treating GERD based on typical symptoms is pragmatic and endorsed by societal guidelines, even though these symptoms are neither sensitive nor specific for objectively defined GERD.

### Esophageal achalasia: diagnostic evaluation [^114Bsg1u]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic tests

The diagnosis of esophageal disorders relies basically on three well-established, and often complementary tests: upper endoscopy, barium esophagogram, and (high-resolution) manometry.

Upper endoscopy

All patients referred for dysphagia should first undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy with mucosal biopsies to exclude other causes of dysphagia, such as erosive GERD, eosinophilic esophagitis, structural lesions (strictures, webs, or rings), and especially esophageal cancer or "pseudoachalasia". Endoscopy is a fundamentally important test, but not very sensitive in establishing a diagnosis of achalasia because more than 40% of patients with achalasia have normal endoscopic findings. That said, evidence of a dilated or tortuous esophagus with saliva and/or food retention, and a tight EGJ on the passage of the endoscope should raise the clinical suspicion of achalasia (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Possible endoscopic findings in patients with achalasia: a dilated or tortuous esophagus and tight gastroesophageal junction; b dilated esophagus with saliva retention; c dilated esophagus with food stasis

Esophageal candidiasis refractory to treatment is also common in patients with achalasia, and is caused by esophageal stasis. Finding esophageal candidiasis in patients with an intact immune function should prompt their further assessment for evidence of esophageal dysmotility. This also applies to symptomatic patients with a normal endoscopic picture. During the endoscopy, it is important to perform the retroflexion maneuver in the stomach to rule out any small tumors involving the cardia from below, and causing pseudoachalasia.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^11126SPy]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

The management of patients with extraesophageal manifestations of GERD remains challenging. In the absence of specific diagnostic methods capable of identifying individuals who might respond to antireflux therapy, an empiric trial of PPI therapy is the common approach. More invasive diagnostic testing should be reserved for those with poor or partial response to the initial PPI therapy to exclude reflux as the cause of patients' persistent symptoms. Future trials are needed to improve these diagnostic problems and identify the subgroup of individuals with extraesophageal reflux manifestations who may benefit from PPI therapy or antireflux surgery.

Detection of acid and nonacid reflux using esophageal reflux monitoring, which includes conventional and wireless pH monitoring and pH impedance, can be a valuable diagnostic tool when used appropriately in the assessment of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Reflux monitoring may be especially helpful if a management change is desired, such as when initial or empirical treatment is ineffective. However, each of these methods has its limitations, which need to be accounted for in their clinical use. Indications, test performance, interpretation, and clinical applications of esophageal reflux monitoring, as well as their limitations, are discussed in this review.

### Evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111cj12s]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may present with heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, chronic cough, laryngitis, or even asthma. The clinical presentation of GERD is therefore varied and poses certain challenges to the physician, especially given the limitations of the diagnostic testing.

Discussion

The evaluation of patients with suspected GERD might be challenging. It is based on the evaluation of clinical features, objective evidence of reflux on diagnostic testing, correlation of symptoms with episodes of reflux, evaluation of anatomical abnormalities, and excluding other causes that might account for the presence of the patient's symptoms.

Conclusions

The diagnostic evaluation should include multiple tests, in addition to a thorough clinical examination.

### Has high-resolution manometry changed the approach to esophageal motility disorders? [^1154GQ2g]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

High-resolution manometry (HRM) coupled with high-resolution esophageal topography plots (HREPT) has dramatically changed the paradigm of manometric studies. The purpose of the current review is to discuss the salient advantages of HRM that are likely to change the clinical practice of manometry.

Recent Findings

Recent studies evaluating HRM suggest a significant improvement in the sensitivity for the diagnosis of achalasia when compared with conventional manometry. By reproducibly subtyping achalasia into classic achalasia, achalasia with pressurization, or spastic achalasia with differential responses to treatment, HRM has potential to predict clinical outcomes. Preliminary observations with HRM suggest that much of what was labeled distal esophageal spasm is in fact achalasia with esophageal compression and pseudorelaxation, or spastic achalasia. HRM is capable of selectively analyzing discrete esophagogastric junction contributors (lower esophageal sphincter and crural diaphragm) during deglutitive relaxation to clearly identify the site of abnormally high outflow resistance. HRM has improved the recognition of a clinically heterogeneous entity called functional obstruction with potential for directed therapy.

Summary

Improved, accurate and reproducible recognition of manometric diagnoses by HRM will allow the clinician to confidently diagnose esophageal disorders such as achalasia, direct therapy and predict outcomes.

### ACG clinical guidelines: clinical use of esophageal physiologic testing [^116MsWUr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

High-resolution manometry (HRM) protocol and provocative maneuvers — key parameters are described as follows: The standard protocol for esophageal manometry involves 10 supine test swallows, and provocative maneuvers during HRM can augment information obtained from the 10 supine test swallow protocol and improve the diagnosis of motor disorders. Multiple rapid swallows consist of 5 repetitive 2 mL water swallows, taken 5 seconds apart, and a rapid drink challenge consists of free drinking of 100–200 mL of water through a straw as fast as possible in the upright position. A standardized test meal during HRM increases the diagnostic yield for obstructive motility disorders and improves interpretation by reproducing esophageal symptoms, and studies show uniform demonstration of additional clinically useful information from provocative maneuvers compared with the interpretation of the 10-swallow protocol alone.

Key concepts — HRM/HRIM, questionnaires, and follow-up: Patient-reported symptom questionnaires may aid evaluation of patients with obstructive esophageal symptoms, but symptom questionnaires alone should not be used to diagnose specific esophageal conditions. Patient-reported outcome measurement during follow-up after treatment in achalasia, accompanied by an objective measure of esophageal function (e.g., timed barium esophagram) may be used to assess the treatment outcome. Barium esophagography provides information about bolus clearance in patients with dysphagia; high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) provides adjunctive information about bolus clearance. Esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) complements the diagnostic evaluation of chest pain not responsive to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and is important for ruling out major motor disorders and for assessing esophageal peristaltic performance in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms; HRM should be performed before antireflux surgery or invasive GERD management. HRM complements endoscopy and barium esophagography in improving the diagnostic yield of identifying hiatal hernia.

### How to effectively use and interpret the barium swallow: current role in esophageal dysphagia [^111qABDy]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The barium swallow is a commonly performed investigation, though recent decades have seen major advances in other esophageal diagnostic modalities.

Purpose

The purpose of this review is to clarify the rationale for components of the barium swallow protocol, provide guidance on interpretation of findings, and describe the current role of the barium swallow in the diagnostic paradigm for esophageal dysphagia in relation to other esophageal investigations. The barium swallow protocol, interpretation, and reporting terminology are subjective and non-standardized. Common reporting terminology and an approach to their interpretation are provided. A timed barium swallow (TBS) protocol provides more standardized assessment of esophageal emptying but does not evaluate peristalsis. Barium swallow may have higher sensitivity than endoscopy for detecting subtle strictures. Barium swallow has lower overall accuracy than high-resolution manometry for diagnosing achalasia but can help secure the diagnosis in cases of equivocal manometry. TBS has an established role in objective assessment of therapeutic response in achalasia and helps identify the cause of symptom relapse. Barium swallow has a role in the evaluating manometric esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction, in some cases helping to identify where it represents an achalasia-like syndrome. Barium swallow should be performed in dysphagia following bariatric or anti-reflux surgery, to assess for both structural and functional postsurgical abnormality. Barium swallow remains a useful investigation in esophageal dysphagia, though its role has evolved due to advancements in other diagnostics. Current evidence-based guidance regarding its strengths, weaknesses, and current role are described in this review.

### Symptom research on chronic cough: a historical perspective [^115j6QY2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This review provides a perspective on how research on the management of cough has evolved, looks at key methodologic lessons that have been learned from this research and how they may relate to the management of other symptoms, identifies important methodologic challenges that remain to be solved, and lists important questions that still need to be answered. Three important methodologic lessons have been learned. First, cough must be evaluated systematically and according to a neuroanatomic framework. Second, the response to specific therapy must be noted to determine the cause or causes of cough and to characterize the strengths and limitations of diagnostic testing. Third, multiple conditions can simultaneously cause cough. Among the three methodologic challenges that still need to be solved are 1) definitively determining the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring and how best to interpret pH test results, 2) definitively determining the role of nonacid reflux in cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease, and 3) developing reliable and reproducible subjective and objective methods with which to assess the efficacy of cough therapy. Numerous important clinical questions are still unanswered: What role do empirical therapeutic trials play in diagnosing the cause of chronic cough? What is the most cost-effective approach to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough: empirical therapeutic trials or laboratory testing-directed therapeutic trials? How often is environmental air pollution, unrelated to allergies or smoking, responsible for chronic cough?

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^112H2nPX]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy — diagnostic yield in suspected extraesophageal manifestations: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy has a low diagnostic yield, and while esophagitis indicates GERD, it does not link reflux with extraesophageal symptoms; endoscopic esophagitis can be found in 40% of patients with asthma, 20% with primary extraesophageal symptoms, and up to 2% of asymptomatic subjects, and the presence of esophagitis does not predict response to antisecretory therapy; overall, endoscopic abnormalities have poor predictive value for GERD as the cause of extraesophageal symptoms.

### European Society for Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ESNM) recommendations for the use of high-resolution manometry of the esophagus [^113dws3e]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Several patients in gastroenterology practice present with esophageal symptoms, and in case of normal endoscopy with biopsies, high-resolution manometry (HRM) is often the next step. Our aim was to develop a European consensus on the clinical application of esophageal HRM, to offer the clinician guidance in selecting patients for HRM and using its results to optimize clinical outcome.

Methods

A Delphi consensus was initiated with 38 multidisciplinary experts from 16 European countries who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 71 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Consensus (defined as > 80% agreement) was reached for 33 statements.

Results

The process generated guidance on when to consider esophageal HRM, how to perform it, and how to generate the report. The Delphi process also identified several areas of uncertainty, such as the choice of catheters, the duration of fasting and the position in which HRM is performed, but recommended to perform at least 10 5-ml swallows in supine position for each study. Postprandial combined HRM impedance is considered useful for diagnosing rumination. There is a large lack of consensus on treatment implications of HRM findings, which is probably the single area requiring future targeted research.

Conclusions and Inferences

A multinational and multidisciplinary group of European experts summarized the current state of consensus on technical aspects, indications, performance, analysis, diagnosis, and therapeutic implications of esophageal HRM.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^112vBmKr]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

The Lyon Consensus provides conclusive criteria for and against the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and adjunctive metrics that consolidate or refute GERD diagnosis when primary criteria are borderline or inconclusive. An international core and working group was assembled to evaluate research since publication of the original Lyon Consensus, and to vote on statements collaboratively developed to update criteria. The Lyon Consensus 2.0 provides a modern definition of actionable GERD, where evidence from oesophageal testing supports revising, escalating or personalising GERD management for the symptomatic patient. Symptoms that have a high versus low likelihood of relationship to reflux episodes are described. Unproven versus proven GERD define diagnostic strategies and testing options. Patients with no prior GERD evidence (unproven GERD) are studied using prolonged wireless pH monitoring or catheter-based pH or pH-monitoring off antisecretory medication, while patients with conclusive GERD evidence (proven GERD) and persisting symptoms are evaluated using pH-impedance monitoring while on optimised antisecretory therapy. The major changes from the original Lyon Consensus criteria include establishment of Los Angeles grade B oesophagitis as conclusive GERD evidence, description of metrics and thresholds to be used with prolonged wireless pH monitoring, and inclusion of parameters useful in diagnosis of refractory GERD when testing is performed on antisecretory therapy in proven GERD. Criteria that have not performed well in the diagnosis of actionable GERD have been retired. Personalisation of investigation and management to each patient's unique presentation will optimise GERD diagnosis and management.

### ASGE guideline on screening and surveillance of Barrett's esophagus [^113U9sFk]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

Barrett's esophagus (BE) diagnostic performance modeling — prevalence assumptions used for illustrative test yields: For diagnostic performance, the guideline used 2 prevalence estimates to illustrate the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives; these were derived from content experts using the best current available evidence. The estimate of 5% represents the prevalence of BE patients with or without dysplasia in patients referred for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the community, and the estimate of 30% represents the prevalence of BE patients with or without dysplasia in patients referred for EGD at tertiary care or referral centers.

### Does screening for Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus prolong survival? [^112WwvEm]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Despite the paucity of data supporting its use, screening upper endoscopy for patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms to assess for Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma has become a widely accepted practice. We apply the principles of screening to Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Critical application of the key criteria of screening to this situation demonstrates that several criteria are unfulfilled. Key data are not available with which to judge other criteria. The major fault with screening for Barrett's esophagus is that the at-risk population is too broadly characterized and that too many cancers occur outside of this risk pool. Thus, recommendations for screening cannot be endorsed. Efforts may be better directed at further research identifying groups at risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma, developing more accurate and less-invasive methods of diagnosis, and discovering the underlying factors which continue to drive the increased incidence of this disease.

### Diagnosis of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1144HVD3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) encompasses a heterogeneous group of patients with differences in sensitivity to esophageal acid exposure, perception of pain, and physiological tissue involvement. The most difficult patients to understand are those who have a great symptom burden but no endoscopic evidence of esophageal mucosal involvement. These patients with symptomatic GERD (also called nonerosive reflux disease and endoscopy-negative reflux disease) present a diagnostic challenge. Diagnostic tests, like ambulatory pH monitoring, the acid perfusion test, and intraesophageal balloon distension, have limited reliability in patients with this form of GERD whose symptoms may exhibit poor correlation with acid exposure or mechanostimulation. The recent interest in a proton pump inhibitor therapeutic trial to identify the group of symptomatic GERD patients (having ruled out risk factors for more morbid conditions) who will respond to these agents has considerable appeal. It has been shown effective in about 75% of patients, and offers a simple approach to managing the difficult-to-diagnose patient even while further diagnostic procedures are carried out.

### Esophageal cancer screening-NCI… [^116A5ru4]. NCI (2004). Low credibility.

Esophageal Cancer Screening Key Points
- Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.
- There is no standard or routine screening test for esophageal cancer.
- Esophagoscopy
- Biopsy
- Brush cytology
- Balloon cytology
- Chromoendoscopy
- Fluorescence spectroscopy
- Screening tests for esophageal cancer are being studied in clinical trials. There is no standard or routine screening test for esophageal cancer. Although there are no standard or routine screening tests for esophageal cancer, the following tests are being used or studied to screen for it: Esophagoscopy A procedure to look inside the esophagus to check for abnormal areas. An esophagoscope is inserted through the mouth or nose and down the throat into the esophagus. An esophagoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.

Biopsy The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Taking biopsy samples from several different areas in the lining of the lower part of the esophagus may detect early Barrett esophagus. This procedure may be used for patients who have risk factors for Barrett esophagus. Brush cytology A procedure in which cells are brushed from the lining of the esophagus and viewed under a microscope to see if they are abnormal. This may be done during an esophagoscopy. Balloon cytology A procedure in which cells are collected from the lining of the esophagus using a deflated balloon that is swallowed by the patient. The balloon is then inflated and pulled out of the esophagus. Esophageal cells on the balloon are viewed under a microscope to see if they are abnormal. Chromoendoscopy A procedure in which a dye is sprayed onto the lining of the esophagus during esophagoscopy.

Increased staining of certain areas of the lining may be a sign of early Barrett esophagus. Fluorescence spectroscopy A procedure that uses a special light to view tissue in the lining of the esophagus. The light probe is passed through an endoscope and shines on the lining of the esophagus. The light given off by the cells lining the esophagus is then measured. Malignant tissue gives off less light than normal tissue.

### EsoCheck and esoGuard for the detection of Barrett's… [^112eEn1d]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

EsoCheck and EsoGuard for the Detection of Barrett's Esophagus in Patients without Chronic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Symptoms. This clinical trial assesses the EsoCheck and EsoGuard test to detect Barrett's esophagus in patients without gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms and have some risk factors for developing it. BE is a condition in which the flat pink lining of the swallowing tube that connects the mouth to the stomach becomes damaged by acid reflux. It is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer. The capsule balloon test called EC is a new Food and Drug Administration approved method that is office based and examines the esophagus without using sedative medications or an endoscope. EG is a laboratory developed test that has an accuracy of 90% for BE in patients with GERD. EC/EG may help detect BE in patients without GERD symptoms.
- Absence of GERD.
- Adults ≥ age 50, who also have two or more added risk factors for BE from the set of: central obesity, current smoker or smoking history ≥ 10 pack years, white race, male sex, confirmed history of BE/esophageal adenocarcinoma in at least two family members, with one a first degree relative. While BE is most highly prevalent in white males, a black female over age 50 with obesity and a positive smoking history would also be at increased BE risk and would equally meet eligibility criteria.
- Known history of esophageal varices or esophageal stricture
- Any contraindication, as deemed in investigator's medical judgment, to undergoing the EsoCheck procedure, undergoing the EGD procedure, and/or having biopsies taken, including but not limited to due to comorbidities such as coagulopathy or a known history of esophageal diverticula, esophageal fistula and/or esophageal ulceration.
- History of difficulty swallowing or painful swallowing, including swallowing pills
- Oropharyngeal tumor
- History of esophageal or gastric surgery, with exception of uncomplicated surgical fundoplication procedure Additional locations may be listed on ClinicalTrials. gov for NCT06687603. Locations matching your search criteria.

### Esophageal cancer screening (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^111XVzhk]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

The results of a population-based case-control study suggest that symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. The frequency, severity, and duration of reflux symptoms were positively associated with increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Efforts at early detection of squamous cell cancer of the esophagus have concentrated on cytological or endoscopic screening of populations in countries where there is a high incidence. While these programs have demonstrated that it is possible to detect squamous cell cancers at an early asymptomatic. Comparisons of both Chinese and U. S. cytological diagnoses with concurrent histological findings showed low sensitivities for the cytological detection of biopsy-proven cancers. Specificity ranged from 90% to 99% with a positive predictive value of 23% to 94%.

The development of uniform and accurate cytological criteria will require formal cytological-histological correlation studies of esophageal lesions. Such studies should become more feasible with the increasing availability of endoscopy in high-risk populations. 27] The likelihood of finding Barrett esophagus on endoscopy is related to the duration of symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. In a series of 701 individuals, 4% of those with symptoms for less than 1 year had Barrett esophagus on endoscopy, whereas Barrett esophagus was found in 21% of those with more than 10 years of symptoms of GERD. It has been estimated that physicians identify only approximately 5% of the population who have Barrett esophagus. There is insufficient evidence that population screening for Barrett esophagus reduces cancer mortality.

Other techniques to potentially identify dysplastic epithelium that could then be sampled extensively include chromoendoscopy and laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. Evidence of Harm Screening for esophageal cancer by the use of blind nonendoscopically directed balloon cytological sampling for squamous cell carcinoma is minimally inconvenient and uncomfortable. Endoscopic screening for esophageal adenocarcinoma is expensive, inconvenient, and usually requires sedation. Complications such as perforation and bleeding can occur. The incidence of complications, including perforation, respiratory arrest, and myocardial infarction, has been estimated to be 0 to 13 cases per 10, 000 procedures with an associated mortality of 0 to 0. 8 cases per 10, 000 procedures.
