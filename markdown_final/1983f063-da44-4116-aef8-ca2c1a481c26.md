## Question

Clindamycin for viral myocarditis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using clindamycin to treat viral myocarditis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clindamycin's pharmacology and whether it has any antiviral activity. Then, I should review the pathophysiology of viral myocarditis to see if an antibacterial agent could plausibly help. Next, I will check guideline-based management recommendations for viral myocarditis. After that, I will search for any direct evidence supporting clindamycin in this setting and weigh potential harms. Finally, I will consider exceptions such as concomitant bacterial infection and make a recommendation, cross-checking against the FDA label and contemporary cardiology guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology: clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial 50S ribosomal protein synthesis and has no activity against viruses; using it to target a viral process lacks a mechanistic rationale, and I should be careful not to over-extend its spectrum just because it covers anaerobes and many Gram-positive organisms, especially since clindamycin is also a well-known precipitant of C. difficile colitis rather than a treatment for viral disease [^111wL2Ky].

> Next, I should review what viral myocarditis is physiologically: it is predominantly caused by cardiotropic viruses with an initial direct viral injury phase followed by immune-mediated myocardial damage, which explains why management focuses on hemodynamic and heart-failure support rather than antibacterial therapy; I need to ensure I'm not conflating bacterial myocarditis or septic cardiomyopathy with true viral myocarditis here [^112HnfYy] [^115PiFsf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify current guideline-directed care: major statements emphasize supportive, guideline-directed heart failure therapy, management of arrhythmias, hemodynamic support when needed, and restriction of physical activity, while specifically not recommending routine antiviral therapy and certainly not recommending antibiotics for viral myocarditis in the absence of bacterial infection, which aligns with the pathophysiology and the lack of antimicrobial targets in viruses [^112HnfYy] [^111H6t9Y] [^115AFkWE] [^117AKoyo] [^112MySPi].

> I will now examine whether any evidence links clindamycin to improved outcomes in viral myocarditis: I need to check for trials, case series, or mechanistic data, but I find no clinical trials or guideline endorsements; if anything, pharmacovigilance analyses do not even flag antibiotics as a class signal for myocarditis, and individual reports using clindamycin in COVID-19 myocarditis contexts were for empiric skin/soft tissue coverage rather than myocarditis treatment per se, which does not support causality or efficacy in viral myocarditis [^116VZxHC] [^116oVvo4].

> Wait, I should double-check the risk–benefit side: clindamycin carries meaningful risks in a population that may be hemodynamically unstable, including C. difficile colitis, hypotension, and even cardiac arrest as labeled adverse reactions; moreover, the FDA label cautions against use without a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection, so exposing a viral myocarditis patient to these risks without expected benefit would be inappropriate [^111wL2Ky] [^114E4RKG].

> But wait, what if there is a coexisting bacterial process; I need to consider legitimate exceptions: if a patient with viral myocarditis also has a concomitant bacterial infection where clindamycin is indicated (for example, toxin-suppression in invasive group A streptococcal disease as part of a regimen often paired with IVIG, or anaerobic/MRSA coverage when clinically justified), it can be used to treat that bacterial infection, yet I must be clear that this is not treatment for the myocarditis itself [^114E4RKG] [^114E4RKG].

> Let me finalize and cross-verify against the highest-level sources: there is no mechanistic plausibility, no supportive trial data, and no guideline endorsement for clindamycin in viral myocarditis; best practice remains supportive, guideline-directed cardiac care with selective immunosuppression reserved for specific subtypes such as infection-negative autoimmune myocarditis or immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated myocarditis in consultation with specialists, not antibiotics like clindamycin [^112HnfYy] [^115PiFsf] [^1122Royt].

> Conclusion and recommendation: clindamycin should not be used to treat viral myocarditis; management should adhere to evidence-based myocarditis care pathways and reserve clindamycin only for proven or strongly suspected concomitant bacterial infections where it is specifically indicated, consistent with the FDA label and contemporary cardiology guidance [^114E4RKG] [^112HnfYy] [^111H6t9Y].

---

No, clindamycin is not indicated for viral myocarditis [^112HnfYy] because it has **no antiviral activity** [^114E4RKG] and does not address the underlying viral cause or immune-mediated myocardial injury [^112HnfYy]. Its use is limited to suspected or confirmed **bacterial coinfection** [^114E4RKG], and routine use in viral myocarditis is not supported by guidelines or evidence [^112HnfYy]. Management should focus on **supportive care** [^115AFkWE], guideline-directed **heart failure therapy**, and immunomodulation only in select cases [^115QFY6w].

---

## Pharmacological properties of clindamycin

Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit; it is effective against gram-positive cocci and anaerobes but has **no antiviral activity** [^114E4RKG].

---

## Pathophysiology of viral myocarditis

Viral myocarditis involves **direct viral injury and immune-mediated inflammation**, causing myocyte damage, apoptosis, and necrosis [^113pX6v1]. Common viruses include coxsackievirus B, adenovirus, parvovirus B19, and SARS-CoV-2 [^112Rgpb5] [^112HnfYy]; management targets viral replication, immune modulation, and supportive care [^115AFkWE].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend clindamycin** for viral myocarditis [^112HnfYy]. Management instead includes:

- **Supportive care**: Hemodynamic stabilization, oxygen, and fluid management [^113XT5DB].
- **Guideline-directed heart failure therapy**: ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics [^115AFkWE].
- **Immunomodulatory therapy**: Considered only in select cases (e.g. giant cell myocarditis) [^1143C3HR].

Clindamycin is **reserved for suspected or confirmed bacterial coinfection**, such as toxic shock syndrome or bacterial myocarditis [^111y2VvD].

---

## Clinical evidence and studies

There is **no evidence** supporting clindamycin for viral myocarditis; its use is limited to bacterial coinfection, and no studies show benefit [^112HnfYy].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Clindamycin **carries risks**, including [^114E4RKG]:

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and C. difficile infection [^111wL2Ky].
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Anaphylaxis, angioedema, and rash [^111wL2Ky].
- **Hematologic effects**: Agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia [^111wL2Ky].
- **Hepatic effects**: Elevated liver enzymes and jaundice [^111wL2Ky].

These risks **outweigh any theoretical benefit** in viral myocarditis [^114E4RKG].

---

## Alternative therapeutic options

Alternative therapies include:

- **Antiviral agents**: Interferon-beta, ribavirin, and fluoxetine (investigational) [^112JEJQw].
- **Immunomodulatory therapy**: Corticosteroids and IVIG in select cases [^115QFY6w].
- **Supportive care**: Mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation in severe cases [^117WPH92] [^112HnfYy].

---

## Clinical scenarios for clindamycin use

Clindamycin may be considered in viral myocarditis **only if bacterial coinfection is suspected or confirmed**, such as **toxic shock syndrome** [^111y2VvD], due to streptococcal or staphylococcal infection, or **bacterial myocarditis** with confirmed bacterial involvement.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Clindamycin is **not indicated for viral myocarditis** [^112HnfYy] because it lacks antiviral activity and supporting evidence. Management should focus on **supportive care**, guideline-directed **heart failure therapy**, and **immunomodulation** in select cases [^115AFkWE]. Clindamycin is reserved for bacterial coinfection, and its risks outweigh any theoretical benefit in viral myocarditis [^111wL2Ky].

### Diagnosis and management of myocarditis: An evidence-based review for the emergency medicine clinician [^113XT5DB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is a potentially fatal condition that can be misdiagnosed in the emergency department (ED) setting.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this narrative review article is to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of myocarditis, with a focus on emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: Myocarditis occurs when inflammation of the heart musculature causes cardiac dysfunction. Symptoms may range from mild to severe and are often preceded by a viral prodrome. Laboratory assessment and an electrocardiogram can be helpful for the diagnosis, but echocardiography is the ideal test in the ED setting. Some patients may also require advanced imaging, though this will often occur during hospitalization or follow-up. Treatment is primarily focused on respiratory and hemodynamic support. Initial hemodynamic management includes vasopressors and inotropes, whereas more severe cases may require an intra-aortic balloon pump, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or a ventricular assist device. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided while intravenous immunoglobulin is controversial.

- **Conclusion**: Myocarditis is a serious condition with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis, management, and disposition of these patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute myocarditis: A review [^112HnfYy]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Acute myocarditis, defined as a sudden inflammatory injury to the myocardium, affects approximately 4 to 14 people per 100,000 each year globally and is associated with a mortality rate of approximately 1% to 7%.

- **Observations**: The most common causes of myocarditis are viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus; systemic autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus; drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors; and vaccines, including smallpox and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Approximately 82% to 95% of adult patients with acute myocarditis present with chest pain, while 19% to 49% present with dyspnea, and 5% to 7% with syncope. Diagnosis of myocarditis can be suggested by presenting symptoms, elevated biomarkers such as troponins, electrocardiographic changes of ST segments, and echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities or wall thickening. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or endomyocardial biopsy are required for definitive diagnosis. Treatment depends on acuity, severity, clinical presentation, and etiology. Approximately 75% of patients admitted with myocarditis have an uncomplicated course, with a mortality rate of approximately 0%. In contrast, acute myocarditis that is complicated by acute heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias is associated with a 12% rate of either in-hospital mortality or need for heart transplant. Approximately 2% to 9% of patients have hemodynamic instability, characterized by inability to maintain adequate end-organ perfusion, and require inotropic agents or mechanical circulatory devices, such as extracorporeal support.

### Management of cardiac disease in cancer patients throughout oncological treatment: ESMO consensus recommendations [^1122Royt]. Annals of Oncology (2020). High credibility.

In specific circumstances, such as myocarditis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors, the ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend withholding further immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Management should include promptly initiating high-dose corticosteroids, specifically methylprednisolone at 1,000 mg/day, followed by oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day. This treatment should be administered in patients with either suspected or confirmed immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis. Continue corticosteroids until there is a resolution of symptoms and normalization of troponin levels, left ventricular (LV) systolic function, and conduction abnormalities.

### Clindamycin phosphate [^113184A8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Inform your doctor about all the medications you are taking, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Clindamycin phosphate foam may interact with other medicines, and conversely, those medicines may alter the effectiveness of clindamycin phosphate foam. It is especially important to inform your doctor if you take oral medications or use topical products that contain erythromycin.

Maintain an updated list of all your medications to show your doctor and pharmacist when you receive a new prescription.

- **Instructions for use**:
	- Use clindamycin phosphate foam exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Refer to the detailed "Instructions for Use" for guidance on the proper application of clindamycin phosphate foam. Before applying the foam, wash your skin with mild soap and water, then dry thoroughly. Apply the foam once daily to the affected skin area, ensuring that you cover the entire affected region. Dispense the foam directly into the cap rather than onto your hands or face, as it will begin to melt upon contact with warm skin. Always wash your hands after applying the foam.

- **Precautions**:
	- Clindamycin phosphate foam is flammable. Avoid exposure to fire, flames, or smoking during and immediately after application to your skin. Take care to avoid getting the foam in or near your eyes, mouth, lips, or on broken skin.

### Systematic analysis of drug-associated myocarditis reported in the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database [^116VZxHC]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

In this work, in addition to confirming known associations between certain drug categories and myocarditis, several other signals were raised. Even if information content (IC) may be overinflated, most drugs that were not previously flagged as purveyors of myocarditis belong to known drug categories (mainly antipsychotics, salicylates, and vaccines). This suggests and supports the plausibility of some drug-class-effects.

We acknowledge several important biases due to the nature of the pharmacovigilance database. The first is underreporting, associated with halo bias and lack of information on the exposed population for calculation of incidence, which would require sales data from the industry. Myocarditis is mostly caused by viral infections among other causes; hence, the differential etiologic diagnosis may have interfered with some results. Notably, the lack of antibiotic drugs as a full-fledged drug class may be explained by underreporting due to septic myocarditis as an alternative diagnosis. Drug-induced myocarditis remains a rare entity, and true incidence remains elusive due to numerous factors.

The lack of a consensual definition, with multiple criteria possible such as clinical symptoms, EKG modification, cardiac enzyme elevation, and decrease in cardiac function assessed by echocardiography or cMRI, complicates matters. There is also a need for the exclusion of differential diagnoses, details of which were not mentioned in VigiBase®. Moreover, we were not able to return to each report to ensure that an exhaustive search for etiologies and concomitant diagnoses was performed.

### Covid-19 associated myocarditis: A systematic review [^112Rgpb5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Most COVID-19 infections result in a viral syndrome characterized by fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgias. A small but significant proportion of patients develop severe COVID-19, resulting in respiratory failure. Many of these patients also develop multi-organ dysfunction as a byproduct of their critical illness. Although heart failure can be a part of this, there also appears to be a subset of patients who have primary cardiac collapse from COVID-19.

- **Objective**: Conduct a systematic review of COVID-19-associated myocarditis, including clinical presentation, risk factors, and prognosis.

- **Discussion**: Our review demonstrates two distinct etiologies of primary acute heart failure in surprisingly equal incidence in patients with COVID-19: viral myocarditis and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. COVID myocarditis, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and severe COVID-19 can be clinically indistinguishable. All can present with dyspnea and evidence of cardiac injury, although in myocarditis and Takotsubo this is due to primary cardiac dysfunction compared to respiratory failure in severe COVID-19.

- **Conclusion**: COVID-19-associated myocarditis differs from COVID-19 respiratory failure by an early shock state. However, not all heart failure from COVID-19 is from direct viral infection; some patients develop Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Regardless of etiology, steroids may be a beneficial treatment, similar to other critically ill COVID-19 patients. Evidence of cardiac injury in the form of ECG changes or elevated troponin in patients with COVID-19 should prompt providers to consider potential cardiac complications.

### Current state of knowledge on aetiology, diagnosis, management, and therapy of myocarditis: A position statement of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases [^115PiFsf]. European Heart Journal (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for myocarditis, more specifically with respect to immunosuppressive therapy, the ESC 2013 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, if not contraindicated, in patients with proven autoimmune (infection-negative) forms of myocarditis. This includes conditions such as giant cell myocarditis, cardiac sarcoidosis, and myocarditis associated with known extra-cardiac autoimmune disease.

### Recognizing COVID-19-related myocarditis: The possible pathophysiology and proposed guideline for diagnosis and management [^1175GSms]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Low credibility.

Human coronavirus-associated myocarditis is known, and a number of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-related myocarditis cases have been reported. The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host's immune response. COVID-19 myocarditis diagnosis should be guided by insights from previous coronavirus and other myocarditis experience. Clinical findings include changes in electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers, as well as impaired cardiac function.

When cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not feasible, cardiac computed tomographic angiography with delayed myocardial imaging may serve to exclude significant coronary artery disease and identify myocardial inflammatory patterns. Because many COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities, myocardial infarction should be considered. If the diagnosis remains uncertain, an endomyocardial biopsy may help identify active cardiac infection through viral genome amplification and possibly refine the treatment risks of systemic immunosuppression.

Arrhythmias are not uncommon in COVID-19 patients, but the pathophysiology is still speculative. Nevertheless, clinicians should be vigilant to provide prompt monitoring and treatment. The long-term impact of COVID-19 myocarditis, including the majority of mild cases, remains unknown.

### Corticosteroids for viral myocarditis [^112AAKJo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is an uncommon heart disease. There is experimental evidence showing that autoimmune mechanisms follow viral infection, resulting in inflammation and necrosis in the myocardium. However, the use of corticosteroids as immunosuppressives in this condition remains controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of treating viral myocarditis with corticosteroids.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were identified by searching The Cochrane Heart Group Register (to April 2004), the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2003), and databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS for meeting abstracts, LILACS, and the Chinese Biomedical CD Database from their inception to April 20, 2004. Four Chinese medical journals were hand-searched. A total of 507 articles were found, but none was eligible for inclusion in our review.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of corticosteroids for viral myocarditis compared with no intervention, placebo, supportive therapy, antiviral agents therapy, or conventional therapy, including trials of corticosteroids plus other treatment versus other treatment alone, irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers extracted data independently. We asked authors of trials to provide information when diagnosis or methodology was unclear, or data were incomplete. Results were presented as risk ratios (RR) and weighted mean differences (WMD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: No randomized controlled trials of corticosteroids for viral myocarditis were found.

### Acute viral myocarditis [^1168ZNaP]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

The initial evaluation of acute myocarditis includes a detailed history and a careful physical examination to identify potential features that may provide clues to its etiology. Additional technical examinations should include an electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, blood studies, non-invasive imaging techniques, and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB).

Acute myocarditis has been associated with various infections, as shown in Table 2. Viruses are the most important cause of acute myocarditis, especially in developed countries. Based on serological studies, adenoviruses (ADV) and enteroviruses (EV) have long been considered the most common cardiotropic viruses resulting in myocarditis. However, recent studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral diagnosis in cardiac biopsies have indicated that parvovirus B19 (PVB19) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) are the most frequent pathogens in patients with acute myocarditis.

- **Infectious causes of myocarditis**:

Symptoms of acute myocarditis vary, often starting with flu-like symptoms, either of the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, before any cardiac symptoms appear. Cardiac symptoms may occur following a delay of days to weeks, including fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, malaise, and atypical chest discomfort. Further clinical signs may comprise sinus tachycardia, a diminished first heart sound, gallops, murmurs of mitral or tricuspid insufficiency, and, rarely but pathognomonic, a pericardial friction rub. Still, the clinical cardiac signs and symptoms may be vague in many patients. Therefore, this disease should be considered in patients who present with rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy, idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias, or otherwise unexplained cardiac symptoms.

### Myocarditis [^115d2ivx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is an uncommon, potentially life-threatening disease that presents with a wide range of symptoms in both children and adults. In developed countries, viral infection is the most common cause of myocarditis. However, other etiologies include bacterial and protozoal infections, toxins, drug reactions, autoimmune diseases, giant cell myocarditis, and sarcoidosis. Acute injury leads to myocyte damage, which in turn activates the innate and humoral immune system, resulting in severe inflammation. In most patients, the immune reaction is eventually down-regulated, and the myocardium recovers. In select cases, however, persistent myocardial inflammation leads to ongoing myocyte damage and relentless symptomatic heart failure or even death.

The diagnosis is usually made based on clinical presentation and noninvasive imaging findings. Most patients respond well to standard heart failure therapy, although in severe cases, mechanical circulatory support or heart transplantation is indicated. Prognosis in acute myocarditis is generally good, except in patients with giant cell myocarditis. Persistent, chronic myocarditis usually has a progressive course but may respond to immunosuppression.

### Fulminant myocarditis [^11321ZAU]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Fulminant myocarditis is an inflammatory process that occurs in the myocardium and causes acute-onset heart failure. If patients with fulminant myocarditis are aggressively supported in a timely manner, nearly all can have an excellent recovery. In this review, we discuss the clinical and histological distinguishing features of fulminant myocarditis and contrast this disease entity with nonfulminant myocarditis. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, methods of diagnosis, management options, and prognosis of fulminant myocarditis are reviewed in detail.

### Incidence, risk factors, natural history, and hypothesized mechanisms of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination: Living evidence syntheses and review [^112vqi9q]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

- **Strengths and limitations of the review**: This review had several strengths. We used a comprehensive, peer-reviewed search strategy and included grey literature to capture recent data. A second reviewer screened the most relevant citations (based on machine learning) and verified all data and risk of bias assessments. GRADE assessments were based on team consensus, including clinical experts. Patient partners reviewed the evidence and developed interpretations from the patient perspective.

The main limitation of our review was that the COVID-19 literature base is evolving rapidly, with new evidence constantly emerging; nevertheless, some of our review findings were associated with moderate certainty evidence. Furthermore, one or more updates are planned and will be made publicly accessible via the COVID-END website. Because of apparent differences in presentation between myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination seen in our original review and different long-term sequelae, we analyzed these outcomes separately where possible. Although myocarditis and pericarditis often coexist, the former is more easily diagnosed due to the presence of elevated cardiac troponin or imaging findings on cardiac MRI. Conversely, pericarditis is often diagnosed based on chest pain symptoms and findings on echocardiogram, and given this subjectivity, related data are likely less robust.

In some cases, authors clearly considered the term myopericarditis to include myocarditis, pericarditis, or both; whereas in others, this distinction was not transparent, and use of these data for rates of myopericarditis was challenging.

### Viral myocarditis: 1917–2020: From the influenza A to the COVID-19 pandemics [^116ooK8L]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is common during viral infections, with cases described as early as the influenza pandemic of 1917, and the COVID-19 pandemic is no exception. The hallmark is elevated troponin, which occurs in 36% of COVID-19 patients, with electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac magnetic resonance being valuable tools to assist in the diagnosis. Cardiac inflammation may occur secondary to direct cardiac invasion by the virus or due to an intense cytokine storm, often encountered during the course of the disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and judicious use of beta-blockers are beneficial in the management of myocarditis. Corticosteroids may be avoided during the very early phase of viral replication but can be of clear benefit in hospitalized, critically ill patients. Statins are beneficial in shortening the course of the disease and may decrease mortality.

### Current state of knowledge on aetiology, diagnosis, management, and therapy of myocarditis: a position statement of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases [^115MgFVw]. European Heart Journal (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for myocarditis, and more specifically concerning endomyocardial biopsy, the ESC 2013 guidelines recommend taking at least three myocardial samples (from the right or left ventricle), each measuring 1–2 mm, and fixing them immediately in 10% buffered formalin at room temperature for light microscopy. Additional samples should be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C, or stored in RNAlater tubes at room temperature, for viral PCR testing.

### European consensus-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of rare paediatric vasculitides - the SHARE initiative [^114UppDv]. Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for myocarditis, particularly in pediatric patients with vasculitides, the SHARE initiative 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining a careful assessment of the heart. This includes an ECG and echocardiography for all patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, as eosinophilic myocarditis is an important and potentially fatal complication.

---

### Acute viral myocarditis [^112NBpd6]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with acute myocarditis should limit physical activity, as exercise during an active viral infection may increase viral replication and shorten survival. They should also receive standard heart failure treatment, including diuretics, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers. Arrhythmias should be monitored and treated.

- **Mechanical support**: In severe cases, mechanical support with an intra-aortic balloon pump or left ventricular assist device may be necessary as a bridge to recovery or heart transplantation. These measures are intended, however, for symptomatic relief.

To halt disease progression and potential evolution to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, such as virus infection or persistence and autoimmune-mediated myocardial damage, should be addressed. Treating these primary mechanisms requires a detailed diagnosis of the pathogen and sufficient knowledge of the pathophysiology leading to heart failure.

### First therapeutic use of artesunate in treatment of human herpesvirus 6B myocarditis in a child [^115ECzUR]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is an important cause of fulminant or acute viral myocarditis. However, insufficiency of standard antiviral treatment against HHV-6 is an emerging problem.

- **Objectives**: To describe the case of a child with HHV-6 myocarditis who was treated by unloading with a left ventricular assist device and artesunate.

- **Study design**: Case report supported by histological and viral diagnoses via a combination of histology/immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction techniques performed on cardiac tissues before and after treatment.

- **Results**: Following therapeutic intervention, the clinical status and heart function improved. Endomyocardial biopsies revealed decreased levels of HHV-6B DNA in the myocardium and the disappearance of histological findings supporting lymphocytic myocarditis. The left ventricular assist device could be explanted. No adverse effects of artesunate were noted.

- **Conclusions**: In addition to existing heart failure treatments, artesunate can be considered an effective candidate for clinical use in cases of HHV-6B associated myocarditis.

### Myocarditis: Emergency department recognition and management [^1167Wtrg]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is an acute inflammatory syndrome involving the heart and related structures. In many instances, the presentation is obvious, and appropriate treatment and disposition follow accordingly. In other situations, patients present with viral illness of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts (or both) or nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and weakness, leading the clinician astray. Management is largely supportive, including aggressive cardiorespiratory support.

### Acute viral myocarditis [^113rZ4nZ]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Two important observations in the progression of viral infection to heart failure remain unclear. First, patients with initial fulminant myocarditis requiring intense hemodynamic support rapidly recover within days and have a better long-term prognosis compared to patients with (sub)acute myocarditis, who face a worse prognosis due to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The precise reason for this difference is uncertain. One may postulate that a fulminant inflammatory reaction capable of clearing the virus may induce temporary stunning and dysfunction of the myocardium. These patients probably do not enter the second phase of viral-injury-mediated autoimmune responses. In contrast, patients with virus persistence due to a (sub)acute, insufficient inflammatory reaction are more prone to chronic autoimmune inflammation and heart injury.

Secondly, it remains unclear why only some patients develop myocarditis. The cardiotropic viruses causing myocarditis, such as adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV), Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), parvovirus B19 (PVB19), and cytomegalovirus, are common respiratory viruses. Although up to 90% of people will catch one or more of these viruses without their heart being affected, only a select few develop clinical symptoms. The exact incidence of myocarditis remains unclear, partly due to the insensitivity of diagnostic tools used in previous studies, which may lead to an underestimation of its true incidence. The prevalence of myocarditis has been found to be…

### Corticosteroids for viral myocarditis [^1117TeBZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is defined as inflammation of the myocardium accompanied by myocellular necrosis. Experimental evidence suggests that autoimmune mechanisms follow viral infection, resulting in inflammation and necrosis in the myocardium. However, the use of corticosteroids as immunosuppressives for this condition remains controversial.

- **Objectives**: The existing review was updated. The primary objective of this review is to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of treating acute or chronic viral myocarditis with corticosteroids. The secondary objective is to determine the best dose regimen.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 7 of 12, 2012) on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE OVID (1946 to July Week 2, 2012), EMBASE OVID (1980 to Week 29, 2012), BIOSIS Previews (1969 to 20 July 2012), ISI Web of Science (1970 to 20th July, 2012), and LILACS (from its inception to 25 July 2012), Chinese Biomed Database, CNKI and WANFANG Databases (from their inception to 31 December 2012). We applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for viral myocarditis compared with no intervention, placebo, supportive therapy, antiviral agents therapy, or conventional therapy, including trials of corticosteroids plus other treatment versus other treatment alone, irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors extracted data independently. Results were presented as risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs).

### Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes as an in vitro model for coxsackievirus B3-induced myocarditis and antiviral drug screening platform [^112JEJQw]. Circulation Research (2014). High credibility.

Viral myocarditis is a life-threatening illness that may lead to heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias. A major causative agent for viral myocarditis is the B3 strain of coxsackievirus, a positive-sense RNA enterovirus. However, human cardiac tissues are difficult to procure in sufficient enough quantities for studying the mechanisms of cardiac-specific viral infection.

This study examined whether human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) could be used to model the pathogenic processes of coxsackievirus-induced viral myocarditis and to screen antiviral therapeutics for efficacy. hiPSC-CMs were infected with a luciferase-expressing coxsackievirus B3 strain (CVB3-Luc). Brightfield microscopy, immunofluorescence, and calcium imaging were used to characterize virally infected hiPSC-CMs for alterations in cellular morphology and calcium handling. Viral proliferation in hiPSC-CMs was quantified using bioluminescence imaging.

Antiviral compounds, including interferon β1, ribavirin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and fluoxetine, were tested for their capacity to abrogate CVB3-Luc proliferation in hiPSC-CMs in vitro. The ability of these compounds to reduce CVB3-Luc proliferation in hiPSC-CMs was consistent with reported drug effects in previous studies. Mechanistic analyses via gene expression profiling of hiPSC-CMs infected with CVB3-Luc revealed an activation of viral RNA and protein clearance pathways after interferon β1 treatment.

This study demonstrates that hiPSC-CMs express the coxsackievirus, enabling researchers to investigate the mechanisms of viral myocarditis and evaluate potential antiviral therapies.

### Prognostic implications of clinical and imaging diagnostic criteria for myocarditis [^11573gyz]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and expert consensus documents provide different diagnostic criteria for myocarditis. Their overlap and prognostic value have never been compared.

- **Objectives**: This study aims to assess and compare the predictive value of ESC criteria for clinically suspected myocarditis, updated Lake-Louise criteria (LLC), American Heart Association criteria for probable acute myocarditis (pAM), and expert consensus criteria for acute myocarditis (AM) and complicated myocarditis (CM).

- **Methods**: Patients with a clinical suspicion of myocarditis referred for cardiac magnetic resonance were enrolled at two centers. Those with any prior cardiomyopathy were excluded. The association of composite outcome events (heart failure hospitalization, reMyocarditis, sustained ventricular tachycardia, or death) with ESC diagnostic criteria, LLC, pAM, AM, and CM were compared.

- **Results**: Among 1,557 consecutive patients referred for cardiac magnetic resonance with possible myocarditis, 1,050 (62.6% male; 48.9 ± 16.8 years of age) were without an alternative diagnosis. Of those, 938 (89.3%) met ESC criteria for clinically suspected myocarditis, 299 (28.5%) LLC, and 356 (33.9%), 216 (20.6%), and 77 (7.3%) pAM, AM, and CM, respectively. Adverse events occurred in 161 patients (15.3%) during a median follow-up of 3.4 years. The highest annualized event rates (6.6%) were observed in patients meeting LLC, whereas negative ESC criteria indicated excellent prognosis (0.7% annualized event rate).

Myocarditis is an inflammatory cardiomyopathy with a diverse range of both infective and non-infective causes. It is an important cause of dilated cardiomyopathy worldwide, with a variable clinical course ranging from a mild self-limiting illness to fulminant cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical circulatory support and cardiac transplantation. Here, we describe a case of acute myocarditis secondary to Campylobacter jejuni infection in a man in his 50s who presented with an acute coronary syndrome following a recent gastrointestinal illness.

### Predictors of mortality in patients with biopsy-proven viral myocarditis: 10-year outcome data [^116JhYaa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is characterized by a great variation in patient symptoms and clinical course, ranging from mild discomfort to cardiogenic shock and complete restoration to sudden cardiac death (SCD). Endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) are currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases, as only EMBs allow differentiation between noninfectious (e.g. immunomediated) and infectious myocarditis. Specific RNA and DNA viruses are the most common pathogens in acute myocarditis. As EMBs require invasive procedures, accurate noninvasive techniques providing incremental data to EMBs, especially for follow‐up investigations, are highly desirable.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is such a noninvasive tool, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy in patients with myocarditis, which is acknowledged by guidelines. At the time of writing, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is the most established technique for the detection of myocardial damage. Beside the diagnosis of myocarditis itself, markers of prognosis are of paramount importance. The presence of LGE seems to be a good predictor of an adverse outcome in patients with biopsy‐proven myocarditis, superior to other variables such as reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or clinical presentation. Other analyses, in nonischemic and ischemic cardiomyopathies, have confirmed that the presence of LGE is associated with adverse prognosis. However, the negative predictive value of LGE is even higher than its positive predictive value. Thus, the identification of additional LGE characteristics is essential.

### Polyspecific intravenous immunoglobulin in clindamycin-treated patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111y2VvD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that the administration of adjunctive IVIG to clindamycin-treated patients with STSS is associated with a statistically significant reduction in mortality rate. Crucially, our analysis disentangles the effects of clindamycin from those of IVIG, which has sometimes been problematic. Our results, therefore, corroborate the findings of the study by Linnér et al, the largest of the three more recent nonrandomized studies, which suggested that both clindamycin and IVIG were beneficial. Moreover, by limiting the analysis to clindamycin-treated subgroups, we provide a more informative effect size estimate than those derived from the individual datasets. Overall, our results imply that up to one additional death could be prevented for every six clindamycin-treated patients with STSS given IVIG.

Three of the studies we excluded are worthy of further discussion, not least because their main results seem to contradict our findings. The first prospectively assessed the efficacy of IVIG in patients with IGAS infection, with or without STSS, who were admitted to the intensive care units at four tertiary hospitals in Canada. Unfortunately, the authors of that report were unable to provide us with the results for the subset of patients with STSS treated with clindamycin. Thus, although IVIG had no effect on IGAS-associated mortality rates overall, its impact in the subset of patients with STSS remains unknown.

### Plasma exchange plus glucocorticoids in the treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis: A case series and review [^112pac9q]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including anti-programmed cell-death (PD)-1/anti-PD-ligand (PDL-1) monoclonal antibodies, are effective at improving the prognosis of patients with cancer. Among immune-related adverse events, myocarditis associated with anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies is rare but lacks effective treatment and has a very high mortality rate.

In this study, data from the past 8 years were extracted from electronic medical records in the hospital information system to identify patients hospitalized with myocarditis presumably caused by anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 tumor therapy. The clinical data from these patients are reported. Four patients developed myocarditis after undergoing treatment with anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies for malignant tumors, all of whom responded favorably to therapy consisting of plasma exchange and glucocorticoids. All patients improved and were discharged from the hospital. Plasma exchange plus systemic glucocorticoids may be effective for treating anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibody-induced myocarditis in patients with cancer.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor myocarditis: Pathophysiological characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment [^111KHzYf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The initial guidelines for the management of immune-related adverse events (IRAE), developed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), categorized myocarditis into four grades of severity, ranging from grade 1, the mildest, to grade 4, the most severe with life-threatening clinical presentation. These guidelines recommended further workup for any grade of severity, including cardiac biomarkers, ECG, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, and cardiology consultation to consider cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and invasive testing, such as coronary angiography and endomyocardial biopsy. These recommendations relied on anecdotal data due to limited reported literature and recognition of myocarditis related to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy at the time.

Physicians often face challenges in diagnosing myocarditis. For instance, an increase in troponin without symptoms was classified as grade 1 severity myocarditis per these guidelines. However, troponin is a nonspecific marker of myocardial injury, and many factors can contribute to its elevation, not solely myocarditis. A subsequent white paper on myocarditis in the setting of cancer therapeutics aims to guide physicians in developing more standardized definitions and categorizes suspected cases into three groups: definite myocarditis, probable myocarditis, and possible myocarditis.

- **Definite myocarditis**: Presence of at least one of the following: pathology consistent with myocarditis, diagnostic CMR, clinical syndrome of myocarditis, and positive biomarker.

### Estimated cardiac risk associated with macrolides and fluoroquinolones decreases substantially when adjusting for patient characteristics and comorbidities [^114d5NSy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial agents are commonly prescribed for treating infections. However, recent studies have raised concerns about the risk of cardiovascular events associated with their use. Macrolides are commonly used to treat respiratory tract infections, and their mechanism of action against respiratory pathogens is to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Macrolide use is also associated with QT prolongation, and multiple case reports describe cardiac arrhythmias in patients treated with macrolides. However, despite these reports, multiple large retrospective clinical studies investigating the potential risk of the use of macrolides in practice have yielded conflicting results.

In some studies, azithromycin, for example, has been associated with negative cardiac outcomes and death. Specifically, Ray et al. found that in a Medicaid cohort, patients prescribed azithromycin had an increased risk of death compared with patients prescribed amoxicillin. In another study, Chou et al. found cardiac risk not only for macrolides but also for fluoroquinolones, when compared with amoxicillin-clavulanate use. In contrast, Svanstrom et al. demonstrated no increased risk of death from cardiovascular causes from azithromycin in a large population of middle-aged adults in Denmark, compared with penicillin V, and Trifiro et al. found no risk of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) from azithromycin when compared with amoxicillin.

The divergent findings noted in the previously described studies may be attributable to differences in study populations and methods.

### Cleocin phosphate (0009–6582) (standalone) [^114E4RKG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Review of experience at the time of writing suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for any changes in bowel frequency.

Cleocin phosphate products should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Similarly, caution is advised when prescribing clindamycin to atopic individuals.

Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy. The use of Cleocin phosphate may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation.

It is important to note that Cleocin phosphate should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus; instead, it should be infused over at least 10–60 minutes as directed in the dosage and administration section.

- **Renal and liver considerations**: Clindamycin dosage modification is not necessary in patients with renal disease. For patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been observed. However, studies suggest that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary, but periodic liver enzyme determinations should be conducted when treating patients with severe liver disease.

- **Prescribing guidelines**: Prescribing Cleocin phosphate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is not advised.

### Glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin to treat viral fulminant myocarditis [^1176MxF1]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

This commentary refers to 'Coronavirus fulminant myocarditis saved with glucocorticoid and human immunoglobulin', by H. Hu et al. There is little experience in the treatment of coronavirus fulminant myocarditis. Glucocorticoid treatment of viral myocarditis is controversial. Because of a lack of high-quality clinical research evidence, the timing, dosage, and duration of glucocorticoid usage are still uncertain.

Glucocorticoids have multiple functions: they suppress the immune response, act as anti-inflammatories, counteract shock, eliminate allergic reactions, inhibit inflammatory oedema, and reduce adverse effects of toxins and inflammatory factors on the myocardium. In 2013, a meta-analysis showed that left ventricular function improved more significantly in viral myocarditis cases treated with glucocorticoids, and virus replication did not increase, indicating that glucocorticoids are relatively safe.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has dual functions: antiviral and anti-inflammatory. It can, to a certain extent, inhibit virus replication. Some studies indicate that IVIG has value in treating fulminant myocarditis, but most importantly, it should be used at a sufficient dosage at an early stage!

- **Position paper recommendations**: The ESC Working Group on the aetiology, diagnosis, management, and treatment of myocarditis recommends that glucocorticoid and IVIG can be considered in selected patients. We observed that early use of glucocorticoids and IVIG in some patients can shorten the course of fulminant myocarditis and reduce the incidence of multi-organ failure.

### A pharmacoepidemiologic study of the safety and effectiveness of clindamycin in infants [^113q7K7Q]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Despite the absence of adequate safety or efficacy data, clindamycin is widely prescribed in the neonatal intensive care unit. We evaluated the association between clindamycin exposure and adverse events, as well as antibiotic effectiveness in infants.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study of infants receiving clindamycin before postnatal day 121 who were discharged from a Pediatrix Medical Group neonatal intensive care unit (1997–2015). Using a previously developed pharmacokinetic model, we performed simulations to predict clindamycin exposure based on available dosing data. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the association between clindamycin exposure and safety outcomes during and after clindamycin therapy. We reported the proportion of infants with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and clearance of MRSA bacteremia.

- **Results**: A total of 4089 infants received clindamycin at a median (25th-75th percentile) dose of 15mg/kg/d (12–16). Clearance increased with older gestational age. Infants with the highest total clindamycin exposure had marginally increased odds of necrotizing enterocolitis within 7 days (adjusted odds ratio = 1.95 [1.04–3.63]), but exposure was not associated with death, sepsis, seizures, intestinal perforation, or intestinal strictures. Of 25 infants who had MRSA bacteremia, 19 (76%) cleared the infection by the end of the clindamycin course.

- **Conclusions**: Higher clindamycin exposure was not associated with increased odds of death or nonlaboratory adverse events.

### Viral myocarditis-incidence, diagnosis and management [^112ao22M]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

Viral myocarditis has an incidence rate of 10 to 22 per 100,000 individuals. The presentation pattern of viral myocarditis can range from nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath to more aggressive symptoms that mimic acute coronary syndrome. After the initial acute phase presentation, the virus may be cleared, resulting in full clinical recovery; the viral infection may persist; or it may lead to a persistent autoimmune-mediated inflammatory process with continuing symptoms of heart failure. Due to these possibilities, the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of viral myocarditis can be extremely unpredictable and challenging for clinicians.

This article reviews the incidence, etiology, definition and classification, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of viral myocarditis. It also discusses how acute clinical care teams might differentiate between viral myocarditis and other acute cardiac conditions.

### Management of acute myocarditis and chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy: An expert consensus document [^112ZiMVT]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart that may occur because of infections, immune system activation, or exposure to drugs. The diagnosis of myocarditis has changed due to the introduction of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We present an expert consensus document aimed at summarizing the common terminology related to myocarditis while highlighting areas of controversy, uncertainty, and unmet clinical needs.

Controversies persist regarding mechanisms that determine the transition from the initial trigger to myocardial inflammation, and from acute myocardial damage to chronic ventricular dysfunction. It remains uncertain which viruses, besides enteroviruses, cause direct tissue damage, act as triggers for immune-mediated damage, or both.

- **Terminology**: Myocarditis can be characterized according to the etiology, phase, severity of the disease, predominant symptoms, and pathological findings. Clinically, acute myocarditis (AM) implies a short time elapsed from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis (generally less than one month).

In contrast, chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy indicates myocardial inflammation with established dilated cardiomyopathy or a hypokinetic nondilated phenotype, which in the advanced stages evolves into fibrosis without detectable inflammation.

- **Diagnostic and treatment recommendations**: Suggested diagnostic and treatment recommendations for AM and chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy are mainly based on expert opinion, given the lack of well-designed contemporary clinical studies in the field.

We provide a shared and practical approach to patient diagnosis and management in our consensus document.

### Myocarditis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: An expert consensus on data gaps and a call to action [^114eLPvq]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment landscape for cancer. Due to the mechanism of action of ICIs, inflammatory reactions against normal tissue were an anticipated side effect of these agents; these immune-related adverse events have been documented and are typically low grade and manageable. Myocarditis has emerged as an uncommon but potentially life-threatening adverse reaction in patients treated with ICIs. Assessment and characterization of ICI-associated myocarditis is challenging because of its low incidence and protean manifestations. Nevertheless, the seriousness of ICI-associated myocarditis justifies a coordinated effort to increase awareness of this syndrome, identify patients who may be at risk, and enable early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

The "Checkpoint Inhibitor Safety Working Group", a multidisciplinary committee of academic, industry, and regulatory partners, convened at a workshop hosted by Project Data Sphere, LLC, on December 15, 2017. This meeting aimed to evaluate the information on ICI-associated myocarditis, determine methods to collect and share data on this adverse reaction, and establish task forces to close the identified knowledge gaps. In this report, we summarize the workshop findings and proposed steps to address the impact of ICI-associated myocarditis in patients with cancer.

### Fatal cephalosporin-induced acute hypersensitivity myocarditis [^117Vv6pn]. Pediatric Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

A frequently fatal, although rare, side effect of cephalosporin antibiotics is noninfectious myocarditis. We report two cases of hypersensitivity myocarditis secondary to the administration of cephalosporin antibiotics. In both cases, acute hypersensitivity myocarditis was not suspected clinically, and the diagnosis was made postmortem. Histology revealed intense eosinophilic infiltration of the endomyocardium with eosinophil degranulation and myocyte damage. Clinically, death in both cases was due to cardiac failure. When suspected early, appropriate management may be lifesaving.

### Suppression of cytokines and nitric oxide production, and protection against lethal endotoxemia and viral myocarditis by a new NF-kappaB inhibitor [^116bfYJB]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is activated by several factors that increase the inflammatory response, and this activation, in turn, leads to the expression of several genes such as cytokines, which may play an important role in cardiovascular diseases.

- **Aims**: The aim of the study is to examine the effect of SUN C8079, a newly synthesized NF-kappaB inhibitor, in vitro and in vivo.

- **Methods**: We examined the effects of SUN C8079 on the transcriptional responses of NF-kappaB, on activation of NF-kappaB in electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and on the gene expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and iNOS. We also studied the effects of SUN C8079 on lethal endotoxemia and viral myocarditis in mice.

- **Results**: SUN C8079 inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of the genes of TNF-alpha and iNOS by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB in vitro. SUN C8079 inhibited the systemic release of TNF-alpha and improved mortality in LPS-treated mice. In addition to protecting mice against lethal endotoxemia, SUN C8079 prevented the development of myocarditis due to the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and inhibited the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines and the iNOS gene in cardiac tissues.

- **Conclusion**: These findings suggest that the activation of NF-kappaB plays an important role in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia and viral myocarditis, and that the NF-kappaB inhibitor, SUN C8079, may be therapeutic in these disorders.

### Recognition and initial management of fulminant myocarditis: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115vQRwz]. Circulation (2020). Low credibility.

Fulminant myocarditis (FM) is an uncommon syndrome characterized by sudden and severe diffuse cardiac inflammation often leading to death resulting from cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, or multiorgan system failure. Historically, FM was almost exclusively diagnosed at autopsy. By definition, all patients with FM will need some form of inotropic or mechanical circulatory support to maintain end-organ perfusion until transplantation or recovery. Specific subtypes of FM may respond to immunomodulatory therapy in addition to guideline-directed medical care.

Despite the increasing availability of circulatory support, orthotopic heart transplantation, and disease-specific treatments, patients with FM experience significant morbidity and mortality due to delays in diagnosis, initiation of circulatory support, and the lack of appropriately trained specialists to manage the condition. This scientific statement outlines the resources necessary to manage the spectrum of FM, including extracorporeal life support, percutaneous and durable ventricular assist devices, transplantation capabilities, and specialists in advanced heart failure, cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac pathology, immunology, and infectious disease.

Education of frontline providers, who are most likely to encounter FM first, is essential to increase timely access to appropriately resourced facilities, prevent multiorgan system failure, and tailor disease-specific therapy as early as possible in the disease process.

### Herbal medicines for viral myocarditis [^115CvKkB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). High credibility.

Herbal medicines are being used for treating viral diseases, including viral myocarditis, and many controlled trials have been conducted to investigate their efficacy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of herbal medicines on clinical and indirect outcomes in patients with viral myocarditis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library 2003, Issue 3, MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2003), EMBASE (January 1998 to October 2003), Chinese Biomedical Database (1979–2003), AMED (1985–2003), and LILACS accessed in October 2003, and the trials register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field. We hand-searched Chinese journals and conference proceedings, with no language or publication restrictions used.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of herbal medicines (with a minimum of seven days of treatment duration) compared with placebo, no intervention, or conventional interventions were included. Trials of herbal medicine plus conventional drugs versus drug alone were also included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated trial quality. Study authors were contacted for additional information, and adverse effects information was collected from the trials.

- **Main results**: Forty randomized trials, involving 3,448 people, were included. All trials were conducted and published in China, and the methodological quality was assessed as generally low. No trial had a diagnosis of viral myocarditis confirmed histologically, and few trials attempted to establish viral etiology.

### Viral presence-guided immunomodulation in lymphocytic myocarditis: An update [^111FUSaT]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

Latest statements from European and American societies recommend ruling out viral presence in endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis before starting immunosuppression or immunomodulation in acute lymphocytic myocarditis presenting with life-threatening scenarios. However, recommendations in myocarditis are mostly based on heterogeneous studies enrolling patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathies and established heart failure rather than acute myocarditis. Thus, definitive evidence of a survival benefit from immunomodulation guided by viral presence is currently lacking.

Distinguishing innocent bystanders from causative agents among EMB-detected viruses remains challenging and is a major goal to achieve in the near future. Therefore, considerable divergence remains between official recommendations and clinical practice, including the possibility of starting immunosuppressive therapy empirically, without knowing viral PCR results.

This review systematically discusses the unsolved issues of immunomodulation guided by viral presence in acute lymphocytic myocarditis, namely:

- **Virus epidemiology and prognosis**: Examination of differing viral impacts and outcomes.
- **Variability of viral presence rates**: Analysis of inconsistent detection rates in patients.
- **The role of potential viral bystander findings**: Evaluation of non-causative viral detections.
- **The main results of immunosuppression controlled trials in lymphocytic myocarditis**: Insights into trial outcomes.

Furthermore, a practical approach for the critical use of viral presence analysis in guiding immunomodulation is provided, highlighting its importance before starting immunosuppression or immunomodulation. Future multicenter studies are needed to further clarify these aspects.

### Covid-19 myocarditis and postinfection Bell's palsy [^116oVvo4]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Initially, upon admission, cellulitis on the neck was suspected, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, cefotaxime and clindamycin, to cover bacterial pathogens, including oral flora. He did not fulfill the criteria for sepsis.

Based on blood markers (raised TnT, raised NT-proBNP) and echocardiography, cardiac involvement was suspected. In the absence of chest pain, myocardial infarction was considered less likely, but myocarditis was suggested as a differential diagnosis. The patient received acetylsalicylic acid, 300 mg, and was observed with telemetry. A CT angiogram and cardiac MRI were planned to clarify the diagnosis.

Despite a low clinical suspicion of Covid-19, due to a lack of contact and an atypical clinical presentation, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed because of the ongoing pandemic. This swab was positive on reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2.

### Viral myocarditis — diagnosis, treatment options, and current controversies [^1146XqzK]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Myocarditis — a frequent cause of dilated cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death — typically results from cardiotropic viral infection followed by active inflammatory destruction of the myocardium. Characterization of this disease has been hampered by its heterogeneous clinical presentations and diverse aetiologies. Advances in cardiac MRI and molecular detection of viruses by endomyocardial biopsy have improved our ability to diagnose and understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of this elusive disease. However, therapeutic options are currently limited for both the acute and chronic phases of myocarditis. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated potential benefit with immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies, but further investigations are warranted. In this review, we explore the pathophysiology, natural history, and modes of diagnosis of myocarditis, as well as evidence-based treatment strategies. As novel imaging techniques and human in vitro models of the disease emerge, the landscape of therapies for myocarditis is poised to improve.

### Acute viral myocarditis [^114PCfwJ]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

The indication for endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is 'a strong reason to believe that the results will have a meaningful effect on subsequent therapeutic decisions', according to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. This guideline supports the use of EMB for patients presenting with unexplained new-onset heart failure of less than two weeks in duration, associated with a normal-sized or dilated left ventricle in addition to hemodynamic compromise.

The timeframe for obtaining EMBs remains controversial. A conservative approach, where clinicians wait for a maximum of two days before performing EMBs, is justified due to the high percentage of patients who recover spontaneously, as seen in up to 57% of cases. However, in the case of persistent or increasing cardiac dysfunction, urgent coronary angiography should be performed, and EMB should be taken without delay in the presence of non-significant coronary artery disease.

In contrast, a more invasive approach, where EMBs are obtained in all patients with suspected myocarditis, could be justified. This is due to its high diagnostic sensitivity in the earliest stages of myocarditis. Additionally, etiology-based therapy is more effective when started early, before inflammation causes injury and the remodeling process becomes irreversible. Obtaining EMBs at presentation is valuable in understanding the potential role of specific etiological factors, such as specific viral agents, double infections, high viral load, and/or immunohistological inflammation.

### Antipyretics and vaccine-induced myocarditis [^116hdfWu]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

As these drugs are frequently used in patients who have symptoms such as fever or chest pain, proving any causation by antipyretics in the development of myocarditis is very difficult. While this is a great challenge, it is not insurmountable. Finding the link between aspirin use during viral infections and the subsequent development of Reye syndrome was equally challenging due to its widespread use. Like vaccine‐associated myocarditis, Reye syndrome usually develops 3–5 days after the onset of a viral illness. Shortly following Reye and colleagues' description of the syndrome in 1963, salicylates were mentioned as a suspect, but were often disregarded. A key problem, as some authors commented, was that "most children with fever are given aspirin". It would end up taking decades before an association was finally accepted.

Now we find ourselves again in a similar situation, where most individuals with vaccine‐associated side effects treat them with an antipyretic, but on the rare occasion where it is actually reported, there is no discussion of a possible role in myocarditis. Considering that these are drugs used after vaccination, but before the typical period when symptoms of myocarditis develop (usually several days or more following vaccination), they should remain under suspicion until evidence is presented otherwise. While evidence to implicate antipyretics in vaccine‐associated myocarditis does not exist, neither is there evidence to rule them out. Therefore, case–control studies with meticulous gathering of data on antipyretic use are essential to support continued research.

### Consideration on pathogen of viral fulminant myocarditis [^114EWUb6]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Viral fulminant myocarditis (VFM) is a severe form of myocarditis characterized by rapid clinical deterioration. The pathogenesis of VFM is complex and involves multiple mechanisms, including direct viral injury, immune-mediated damage, and the activation of apoptotic pathways. Recent studies have highlighted the role of specific viruses such as enteroviruses and adenoviruses in the development of VFM. The early diagnosis and management of VFM are critical to improve patient outcomes, with treatment strategies focusing on hemodynamic support and the use of antiviral therapies. Further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets for this life-threatening condition.

### Critical role for death-receptor mediated apoptotic signaling in viral myocarditis [^113pX6v1]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Apoptosis of cardiac myocytes plays a key role in the pathogenesis of many cardiac diseases, including viral myocarditis. The apoptotic signaling pathways activated during viral myocarditis and their role in disease pathogenesis have not been clearly delineated.

- **Methods and results**: We investigated the role of apoptotic signaling pathways after virus infection of primary cardiac myocytes. The death receptor-associated initiator caspase, caspase 8, and the effector caspase, caspase 3, were significantly activated after infection of primary cardiac myocytes with myocarditic, but not non-myocarditic, reovirus strains. Furthermore, reovirus-induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis was significantly inhibited by soluble death receptors. In contrast, the mitochondrial membrane potential remained unaltered, and caspase 9, the initiator caspase associated with mitochondrial apoptotic signaling, was only weakly activated in cardiac myocytes after infection with myocarditic reovirus strains. Inhibition of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling had no effect on reovirus-induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis. In accordance with our in vitro data, caspase 8, but not caspase 9, was significantly activated in the hearts of reovirus-infected mice.

- **Conclusions**: Death receptor, but not mitochondrial, apoptotic signaling plays a key role in apoptosis after infection of cardiac myocytes with myocarditic reovirus strains.
