## Question

A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. His mother has noticed he frequently falls while running. He was born at term and pregnancy was uncomplicated. He has a seizure disorder treated with phenytoin. He is at the 20th percentile for height and at 30th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows decreased muscle strength in the lower extremities. There is a deep groove below the costal margins bilaterally. An x-ray of the lower extremities is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?
A. Normal development
B. Proximal tibial growth plate disruption
C. Metabolic abnormality
D. Neoplastic growth

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best explains the clinical picture of a 6-year-old boy with frequent falls, lower-extremity weakness, Harrison's groove, and abnormal lower-extremity radiographs, in the context of chronic phenytoin therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical features and whether they cohere with a unifying diagnosis. Then, I should verify the medication-specific mechanism by which phenytoin could produce these findings. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and actively exclude alternatives. Finally, I will confirm the most likely diagnosis and outline the immediate workup and management implications, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the salient clinical features: frequent falls with lower-extremity weakness, a deep groove below the costal margins bilaterally (Harrison's groove), growth at the lower end of normal, and abnormal lower-extremity radiographs in a child on chronic phenytoin. Wait, let me verify the significance of Harrison's groove — yes, that is a classic sign of rickets reflecting diaphragmatic pull on softened ribs, and it fits with defective mineralization of growing bone rather than a focal growth-plate injury or tumor [^2455d3f2] [^8a03c87c].

> I need to check the mechanistic plausibility of phenytoin causing this. Phenytoin is a hepatic enzyme inducer that accelerates vitamin D metabolism, lowering 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which can lead to hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and osteomalacia/rickets; the FDA labeling explicitly warns about decreased bone mineral density, osteomalacia, and fractures with chronic use, and endocrine guidelines list antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin, as a cause of secondary osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency, reinforcing the causal pathway here [^ebbb5ae8] [^6fdd6777] [^9862e30e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should review the differential and actively exclude alternatives. Normal development does not fit the constellation of falls, weakness, Harrison's groove, and abnormal radiographs, so Option A is unlikely. Proximal tibial growth plate disruption would typically be unilateral or asymmetric and tied to trauma or focal insult, not bilateral deformities with systemic features; the radiographic description here is more consistent with rachitic changes than a focal physeal injury, making Option B less likely. Neoplastic growth would usually present with focal pain, mass, night pain, or systemic B symptoms, and would be an uncommon explanation for bilateral lower-extremity deformities and Harrison's groove in this age group, so Option D is also less likely. By contrast, anticonvulsant-induced rickets/osteomalacia explains the systemic bone disease, muscle weakness, and classic chest sign, aligning with Option C [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the expected radiographic findings to ensure internal consistency. In rickets, metaphyseal fraying, splaying, and widening are characteristic, reflecting defective mineralization of growth plate cartilage; while I don't have the actual image, the stem's "abnormal lower-extremity x-ray" in this clinical context strongly supports rachitic changes rather than a focal growth-plate disruption or neoplasm, which would have different radiographic signatures [^8a03c87c] [^1dd17dbd].

> I will now examine the immediate workup and management implications. I should confirm vitamin D status with 25-hydroxyvitamin D, check calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase, and consider PTH; hypocalcemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase would support rickets, and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D would implicate deficiency, while PTH may be elevated secondary to low vitamin D. If hypocalcemia is present, I need to ensure magnesium is checked because hypomagnesemia impairs calcium correction. Management includes vitamin D repletion with calcium, and in some cases active vitamin D (calcitriol) if deficiency is severe or malabsorption is suspected, with ongoing monitoring of bone health and consideration of alternative antiseizure therapy if feasible [^1952e26c] [^5430a1a1] [^ebf38944].

> But wait, what if the seizures themselves are contributing to the falls rather than bone disease? I should double-check that the clinical triad of bone pain/weakness, Harrison's groove, and rachitic radiographs points primarily to metabolic bone disease rather than pure neuromuscular etiology; while seizures can cause falls, the skeletal findings here are not explained by seizures alone, and the medication mechanism provides a coherent causal chain for the observed phenotype, strengthening the case for anticonvulsant-induced rickets/osteomalacia [^ebbb5ae8] [^2455d3f2].

> Final answer: The most likely cause is a metabolic abnormality — specifically, anticonvulsant-induced vitamin D deficiency rickets/osteomalacia due to chronic phenytoin therapy — which explains the frequent falls, lower-extremity weakness, Harrison's groove, and abnormal lower-extremity radiographs in this 6-year-old boy [^ebbb5ae8] [^2455d3f2] [^8a03c87c].

The most likely cause of this 6-year-old boy's frequent falls, lower extremity weakness, and Harrison's groove is **metabolic abnormality** due to **phenytoin-induced vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia** [^ebbb5ae8]. Phenytoin induces hepatic enzymes that accelerate vitamin D metabolism, causing hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and impaired bone mineralization, leading to rickets/osteomalacia with skeletal deformities and muscle weakness [^b6d80c76] [^ebbb5ae8]. The Harrison's groove reflects diaphragmatic indentation on softened ribs, and the lower extremity findings are classic for rickets/osteomalacia [^2455d3f2]. Management includes vitamin D and calcium supplementation, with consideration of alternative anticonvulsants to prevent ongoing bone loss [^ebf38944] [^c7b8614e].

---

## Pathophysiology of phenytoin-induced bone disease

Phenytoin is a hepatic enzyme inducer that increases the catabolism of vitamin D, reducing its bioavailability and causing **vitamin D deficiency** [^ebbb5ae8]. This deficiency leads to:

- **Hypocalcemia**: Reduced intestinal calcium absorption.
- **Hypophosphatemia**: Increased renal phosphate wasting due to secondary hyperparathyroidism.
- **Impaired bone mineralization**: Defective osteoid mineralization causing osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children [^8a03c87c].

---

## Clinical manifestations

The clinical presentation of phenytoin-induced bone disease includes:

- **Muscle weakness**: Particularly in the lower extremities, contributing to frequent falls [^525df74e].
- **Skeletal deformities**: Bowing of long bones, genu varum/valgum, and Harrison's groove (a horizontal groove at the lower rib cage due to diaphragmatic indentation on softened ribs) [^2455d3f2].
- **Growth retardation**: Short stature and delayed growth velocity [^525df74e].
- **Bone pain**: Due to osteomalacia and increased susceptibility to fractures [^525df74e].

---

## Radiological findings

Radiographic features of rickets/osteomalacia include:

- **Generalized osteopenia**: Reduced bone density.
- **Cortical thinning**: Thinning of cortical bone.
- **Looser's zones**: Pseudofractures or stress fractures.
- **Bowing deformities**: Particularly in the lower extremities [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for a child presenting with frequent falls, lower extremity weakness, and skeletal deformities includes:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Metabolic | - Vitamin D deficiency rickets/osteomalacia <br/> - Hypophosphatemic rickets <br/> - Renal osteodystrophy [^525df74e] |
| Neuromuscular | - Muscular dystrophy <br/> - Spinal muscular atrophy <br/> - Peripheral neuropathy [^e3453ad6] |
| Skeletal | - Osteogenesis imperfecta <br/> - Cleidocranial dysplasia <br/> - Growth plate injuries [^notfound] |
| Neoplastic | - Leukemia <br/> - Neuroblastoma <br/> - Bone tumors [^notfound] |

---

Given the child's chronic phenytoin use and the classic clinical and radiographic features, **phenytoin-induced vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia** is the most likely diagnosis [^ebbb5ae8].

---

## Management

Management of phenytoin-induced bone disease includes:

- **Vitamin D supplementation**: High-dose vitamin D (e.g. 2,000–4,000 IU/day) to restore vitamin D levels [^ebf38944].
- **Calcium supplementation**: Adequate calcium intake to correct hypocalcemia and support bone mineralization [^5430a1a1].
- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [^b3b3bd7a].
- **Alternative anticonvulsants**: Consider switching to non-enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (e.g. levetiracetam, lamotrigine) to prevent ongoing bone loss [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause of the child's frequent falls, lower extremity weakness, and Harrison's groove is a **metabolic abnormality** due to **phenytoin-induced vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia** [^ebbb5ae8]. This diagnosis is supported by the child's chronic phenytoin use, clinical presentation, and characteristic radiographic findings. Appropriate management with vitamin D and calcium supplementation, along with monitoring and consideration of alternative anticonvulsants, is essential to prevent further bone loss and skeletal deformities [^ebf38944].

### The association between antiepileptic drugs and bone disease [^026752a0]. Epilepsy Currents (2003). Low credibility.

A growing body of literature indicates an association between antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and bone disease, including histologic, radiographic, and biochemical evidence. The AEDs most commonly reported to cause decreased bone mineral density and disorders of bone metabolism are inducers of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system (phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, primidone). More recent studies also suggest that valproate, an enzyme inhibitor, causes abnormalities in bone health. Multiple mechanisms have been postulated to support the association; however, no single mechanism explains all the findings. Identifying bone disease in persons with epilepsy receiving AEDs is important, as multiple treatment options are available.

Clinical findings

The affected individual (P1) is a 14-year-old male born to non-consanguineous parents. Pregnancy was notable for oligohydramnios, and he was born via an emergency Caesarian section due to non-reassuring fetal heart rate. As a neonate he had hypotonia, a weak cry, and feeding difficulties. His early motor development was unremarkable, and he walked independently by 14 months of age. Around age 2 years, he was noted to have frequent falls. Over time, he gained the ability to run, but has always had difficulty keeping up with his peers in formal athletic activities. He has a history of persistent dysphagia with frequent choking.

On neuromuscular examination at age 10 years, P1 had prominent, somewhat low-set ears, a slightly elongated face, and mild bilateral ptosis. He had joint laxity in the fingers, wrists, ankles, and toes. His muscle mass was decreased throughout the bilateral upper and lower extremities. He had mild scapular winging that improved with arm abduction (Figure 1). Extraocular movements were intact. On manual muscle testing, strength was Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 4+/5, with greatest weakness in neck flexion, elbow flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion, which were MRC grade 3+/5. Deep tendon reflexes were absent throughout the bilateral upper and lower extremities. He was able to rise from the floor to a standing position with a modified Gowers' maneuver. Walking was notable for a mild Trendelenburg gait with a waddling quality. Muscle ultrasound examination revealed mildly to moderately increased echogenicity with a granular appearance in all muscles imaged, consistent with a myopathic process (Figure 1). A muscle MRI (age 10 years) revealed atrophy and abnormal signaling in the bilateral tibialis anterior muscles, relatively more than the extensor digitorum longus and peroneus longus muscles, and subtle fatty infiltration of the semitendinosus muscle bilaterally (Figure 1). Serum creatine kinase (CK) level was elevated at 1228 U/L (reference value, 10–80 U/L). Forced vital capacity was 89% predicted and did not decrease further in the supine position (age 10 years).

Bone health

Although altered bone mineral density has been reported in about 50% of individuals with RTT, low bone density was documented on densitometry in around 90% of the women in our cohort. We may speculate that this finding can be explained by the characteristics of the sample, with an over-representation of patients treated with antiepileptic drugs and neurologically impaired. Indeed, anticonvulsant therapy, especially with valproate, is an additional risk factor for low bone density and increases fracture risk by threefold in RTT, compared with no or any other prescribed antiepileptic drugs. Also, non-ambulatory patients have a decreased bone mass.

Patients with lower bone density are exposed to a higher risk of fractures, occurring much more frequently in RTT than in the general population. Fractures often occur spontaneously, after minimal trauma or a fall, and predominantly in the upper/lower limbs long bones.

A panel of experts in RTT has recently developed clinical guidelines for the management of bone health. The guidelines are divided in two sections: clinical and bone density assessment, and non-pharmacological and pharmacological intervention strategies. DEXA scans should be used to assess baseline bone mineral density, and monitoring should be done every 1–2 years depending on clinical presentation, and should consider Z-score results as well as previous occurrence of fractures. The increase of physical activity or at least encouragement of supported standing are recommended as non-pharmacological interventions, and the increase of dietary intake of calcium-rich or calcium-fortiﬁed food and vitamin D supplementation are advised. While no clear evidence of benefit from the use of bisphosphonates exists, new potential treatment with zoledronic acid in RTT has been recently suggested as it resulted in an increase in bone density and a reduction in the incidence of fractures.

### Child neurology: friedreich ataxia with upper motor neuron findings: a case study [^7d9e06b5]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

A 16-year-old boy with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, gait abnormalities, and balance problems was found to have Friedreich ataxia. Though Friedreich ataxia typically renders patients areflexic, this child had upper motor neuron findings of spasticity in both lower extremities, with crossed adductors, and 4+ deep tendon reflexes at the patella and Achilles bilaterally. This unusual presentation of an uncommon genetic disorder led to uncertainty of the patient's true diagnosis until genetic testing confirmed that he had 2 alleles with the Friedreich ataxia mutation.

Patient 5 in Family 4

Patient 5 was a 20-year-old woman born to nonconsanguineous parents. She could walk independently at 18 months old, but she exhibited early gait instability and frequent falls. By 6 years old, her dizziness and progressive gait disturbance worsened. At 8 years of age, she began luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog therapy for precocious puberty, and frequent falls (> 10/day) by 9 years old led to medical evaluation. Physical examination revealed thick hair, macrocephaly, a high-arched palate, a saddle nose, enlarged tonsils, scoliosis, and obesity (Fig. 2 F). Although dizziness and gaze-evoked nystagmus were present, cerebellar ataxia was absent. Upper-limb strength was normal, whereas lower-limb strength was significantly reduced (MMT 3), affecting distal flexors and causing foot drop. She had a waddling and shuffling gait with no pyramidal or extrapyramidal signs. Hypoesthesia predominated in the lower extremities, and autonomic dysfunction manifested as constipation. WISC-IV assessment indicated borderline intellectual ability (IQ 83). Her visual acuity was normal. She started CPAP use at night at 10 years old. At 20 years old, her upper-limb strength remained normal, but severe lower-limb weakness necessitated wheelchair use. She exhibited mild dysarthria but maintained intact swallowing function. NCS identified sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy with lower-limb predominance. Brain MRI revealed T2 hyperintensities in the medulla oblongata, periaqueductal region, and corpus callosum (Fig. 2 D, E). Electroencephalogram showed spike-and-wave complexes despite no seizure history.

### Cases from the Osler medical service at johns hopkins university [^0abb8eb4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A 50-year-old African American woman presented with bilateral lower extremity pain, a history of falls during the past several months, and personality and behavior changes. She had been in good health until approximately 5 months before admission, when she began to fall with increasing frequency, often while going down a flight of stairs. She described these falls as her "legs giving out" and feeling very heavy and unsteady. There was no head trauma or loss of consciousness. Her daughter noticed that her gait had become somewhat unsteady during the last several months. Her family also noted a change in her personality at this time. Previously, she had been a very tidy person who took great care with her appearance, who was working as a customer service representative. However, she had become less social and very withdrawn. She had been observed putting on dirty clothes after showering, as well as eating constantly. The patient denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, headaches, vision changes, or tinnitus. She also denied any rashes, muscle pain, or intolerance to heat or cold. There was no history of seizure disorder or depression. Her past medical history was notable only for hypertension and being a passenger in a motor vehicle crash 1 year before admission. She denied any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use, and had no travel history other than coming to the United States, as she was originally from Trinidad. On physical examination, she was a moderately obese African American woman with a flat affect, psychomotor slowing, and alopecia of the scalp. She was alert and oriented to person, place, and time, but had a score of 26 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination. She lost points only for recall; she had no difficulty with serial 7s. Her cranial nerves were intact and her speech was fluent, although sparse, and she did not make any paraphasic errors. Her muscle strength was 5/5 in both the upper and lower extremities. Reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities and 1+ in the lower extremities, and toes were downgoing bilaterally. She had intact sensation to light touch and pinprick, but markedly diminished proprioception of her lower extremities bilaterally. She had a wide-based gait with a positive Romberg sign and was markedly ataxic. Rectal examination yielded a positive guaiac test with brown stool, normal tone, and no masses. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia with a hematocrit of 22.7% and a mean corpuscular volume of 118.2 fL. A peripheral smear that was performed on admission, prior to transfusion, revealed macrocytic red cells and hypersegmented neutrophils.

Motor Development and Function:

Gross motor milestones were mildly to markedly delayed in all subjects and all of ambulatory age have required use of Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFOs). Of the nine subjects over age 5, four learned to walk unassisted and five learned to walk with assistive devices; motor function has generally worsened by adolescence. Subjects VI and X are the least motorically impaired and learned to walk independently without AFOs at 18 months of age. Both are currently able to walk and play sports, but VI cannot walk long distances and X has frequent falls and is now using AFOs. Subject VII learned to walk with AFOs and a walker at age 3; he continues to require support when walking. Subject XI walked with support at age 3 and unassisted at age 6, but motor function worsened with age; he now requires AFOs and a walker for community ambulation. Subject XII is the most motorically impaired; he learned to stand independently at age 3, but has had significant decline in functional mobility and now needs a walker or wheelchair at all times. Subject XIII walked with AFOs at age 3; she is now able to ambulate short distances unsupported, but has frequent falls and prefers a wheelchair in many settings. Subject XIV was able to walk with support until 8 years of age when he underwent foot surgery. Following surgery, he never regained the ability to walk.

Motor Tone and Strength:

Although all 14 subjects were reported at some point to have hypotonia, the five subjects evaluated at NIH were found to have normal axial and appendicular tone with upper limb hypermobility. Subject VII displayed full muscle strength throughout. Subject X had moderate hip girdle weakness. Subjects XI and XII could not cooperate with strength testing; both seemed to have proximal weakness greater in the lower compared to upper limbs, and XII had decreased muscle bulk. Subject XIII had significant hip girdle and lower extremity flexor and extensor weakness, with extensor hallucis longus strength of only 1/5 bilaterally.

Reflexes:

In the four subjects tested, deep tendon reflexes were decreased (XI), increased (XIII) or normal (VII, XII), and the Babinski reflex was positive/extensor with ankle clonus (X, XII, XIII) or negative/flexor (VII). These findings are consistent with the combination of spasticity and peripheral neuropathy.

Case presentation

A 10 years and 6 months old girl, was admitted to hospital due to "epileptic seizures for five months", which manifested as an involuntary nodding movement accompanied by loss of consciousness, with no fever, limb stiffness, cyanosis, salivation and incontinence. During the early period of illness, these symptoms lasted for about 10 s - with a frequency of about 2 episodes per day. Then it gradually increased to 30 s to 1 min before spontaneous cessation, with a frequency of about 4–5 times a day. The patient was treated with "carbamazepine and vitamin B6" but there was no obvious improvement in symptoms or progression of illness. Physical examination done at time of admission: T 36.8 °C, P 89 beats /min, R 19 beats / min, BP 109/68 mmHg. Weight 27 kg, height 125 cm. The patient is positive for special type of facieswitha flat nose, wide-set eyes, micrognathia, deciduous and misaligned teeth, and 9 maxillary and mandibular teeth. Head circumference is 52 cm. The anterior fontanelle is open, approximately 4 × 4 cm size, and soft on palpation. The sagittal and coronal sutures are unclosed. The width of the sagittal suture is about 6 cm. The width of the coronal suture is about 0.5 cm. They are all soft and flat, without tenderness. No résistance was felt in the neck. Defects can be observed in the right clavicle, bilateral shoulders can reach the midline. The thoracic cavity hollows and changes like a funnel. A brown patch which is approximately 2.5 × 1.0 cm in size is visible on the left wrist and a light brown patch of approximately 3.5 × 4.0 cm is visible on the right wrist. The double knee valgus is deformed in an "X" shape with no limitation of activity. There were no abnormalities in the spine and joints, and the muscle strength and muscle tones of the limbs were normal. The pathological reflex were negative (Fig. 1). The child raised his head at 3 months old, crawled and rolled over at 7 months old, walked alone and called daddy and Mommy at 1 year old. At present, she is in the third grade of elementary school, she can answer simple questions but cannot add or subtract within 10. The funnel chest was found a week after birth, and the anterior fontanelle was not closed at 2 years old, none of them were treated. The child has two brothers, both healthy, with no obvious abnormalities in development (Fig. 2). laboratory examination: blood routine: WBC 4.6 × 10 9 /L, N 34.9%, HB 134 g/L, PLT 281 × 10 12 /L; Blood ammonia: 40 umol/L; Vitamin D determination: 12.8 ng/ml; Kidney and kidney function, electrolytes, blood gas analysis, glucose, pyruvate, β - hydroxybutyrate, calcium/phosphate/alkaline phosphatase, urination and defecation were both normal. Electrocardiogram is normal overall. X-ray examination showed: Asymmetry in Bilateral clavicles, a third of the right lateral clavicle is absent. The cranium is higher, the cranial suture are widened, and the anterior fontanelle was not closed. The bone structure of the cranial plate is not completely developed. There are many suture bones in the skull. (Fig. 3). Video EEG: Abnormal: multi-focal sharp wave, sharp and slow wave were frequent issued (Fig. 4). Skull clavicle dysplasia syndrome RUNX2 gene sequencing suggested RUNX2 c.947delA p. (His316fs) heterozygous, pathogenic frameshift mutations (Fig. 5).

### EIF2AK2 missense variants associated with early onset generalized dystonia [^2158fad7]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Clinical Findings in Affected Subjects with EIF2AK2 Variants

In the Canadian patient (C‐II‐1, Family C; see Fig 1C), family and perinatal history were unremarkable. Bilateral hand tremor was noted at the age of 3.5 years, followed by abnormal posturing (inversion) of his left foot. The dystonic posturing worsened and spread to the ipsilateral arm by the age of 4 years, and to the right body side by 4.5 years, more severe in the leg than the arm, and exacerbated with movement. Mild proximal weakness in the lower extremities and dysarthria were also apparent. When the patient was 5 years old, the dystonia had become generalized, with fluctuating severity. He had frequent falls and difficulty with fine motor skills, due to the tremor and dystonia, and often required a wheelchair to move across longer distances. Interestingly, periodic, stepwise deterioration in his dystonia occurred following certain viral infections and/or surgical interventions. At the age of 5.5 years, following an elective hospitalization for a lumbar puncture and muscle biopsy (under general anesthesia), he never regained the ability to walk, due to increased dystonia and muscle weakness in the legs. At the last examination, at 6.5 years old, he had moderate‐to‐severe generalized dystonia (Burke–Fahn–Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale [BFMS] score = 80.5, disability score = 23/30; see Supplementary Video S6), dysarthria, and dysphagia, and was completely dependent on his parents. He also complained of painful spasms in his left limbs, occurring when he moved or during sleep. He communicated with short sentences, but was difficult to understand. Cognitive assessments revealed a moderate/severe language delay and mild cognitive impairment. There was also moderate axial hypotonia and spasticity in the lower extremities, generalized hyperreflexia, ankle clonus, and bilateral Babinski signs. Cranial nerve examination shows saccadic pursuits and mild tremor of the tongue. There was proximal muscle weakness, more severe in the legs (3/5, with decreased muscle mass) than the arms (4/5). Different oral medications were tried (see Ta ble 2), with only mild or no benefit for the dystonia. Extensive diagnostic workup was initially unremarkable. Brain MRI showed abnormal, nonenhancing, focal, symmetric T2‐hyperintense, T1‐hypointense abnormalities at the bulbomedullary junction (Fig 2A–C). MRI of the spine was unremarkable. A cerebral positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed a mild global decrease in cerebral activity, particularly in the basal ganglia.

Clinical case

A previously healthy 2-year and 9-month old boy was brought to the emergency department for a 6-day history of weakness in the legs and frequent falls, rendering him unable to walk 1 day before admission. He did not have pain, dysphagia, bladder dysfunction, or sensory symptoms. There was no history of trauma, but he developed diarrhea 3 days before symptom onset. Family history was negative for consanguinity or neurologic diseases. At examination, he had bilateral leg weakness requiring substantial aid to walk a few steps and was unable to stand up from the floor. He had absent tendon reflexes in the lower extremities and flexor plantar responses. Strength and reflexes in upper extremities and the rest of the examination were normal. CSF showed a protein concentration of 125 mg/dL (NR: 15–45), with normal white blood cell count and glucose concentration. Blood cell count and chemistry were normal, and stool culture was negative. Nerve conduction studies (NCSs) and EMG showed decreased amplitudes in both peroneal nerves (table e-1). The patient was treated with IV immunoglobulins (IVIg) 2 g/kg administered in 3 days. During the next 2 weeks, there was mild improvement in motor strength as he was able to walk and stand up with support (the Guillain-Barré syndrome disability scale [GBSds]score remained 3), and he was discharged home. Two weeks later (4 weeks after symptom onset), he was brought back for worsening weakness in the legs and new onset weakness in the arms. This time, the examination revealed weakness in legs and arms, generalized areflexia, and impossibility to stand up from the floor (GBSds 4). Repeat CSF studies showed a protein concentration of 148 mg/dL and normal white blood cell count and glucose level. No toxic or infectious etiologies were identified, and serum was negative for ganglioside antibodies. NCSs showed prolonged distal motor latencies, conduction slowing, and decreased amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, along with EMG features of chronic denervation, fibrillation, and positive sharp waves (table e-1). Treatment with IVIg was ineffective, but IV methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/d for 5 days) resulted in substantial improvement, leaving the patient with normal strength except for mild distal lower extremity weakness (GBSds 1).

Nutritional rickets and osteomalacia are reemerging in Western societies, particularly in young children and in adolescents of African or Asian descent. Hypocalcemic seizures resulting from vitamin D deficiency are rare in adolescents, whereas fractures caused by seizures without evidence of direct trauma have not yet been reported in this population. We present an unusual case of secondary bilateral femoral fractures caused by hypocalcemic seizures in a 17-year-old boy with primary vitamin D deficiency. We examine the epidemiology and the clinical presentation of rickets and osteomalacia in the adolescent population, the risk of secondary injuries in patients with seizures, and the evaluation and management of hypocalcemic seizures and primary vitamin D deficiency.

### Metabolic concerns associated with antiepileptic medications [^7325994e]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Because treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is often for years or lifelong, physicians should be aware of the metabolic changes that can be associated with AED use and the potential effects of these changes during long-term therapy. Alterations of bone metabolism leading to decreased bone mineral density, associated particularly but not exclusively with the hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs, can worsen the risk for fractures, which is already increased in patients with epilepsy by factors such as seizure-related falls and trauma. Some AEDs are associated with weight gain, an effect that is not only distressing to many patients but may be sufficient to increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and other disorders associated with excessive body weight. The carbonic anhydrase-inhibiting properties of some AEDs can lead to metabolic acidosis. The AEDs that inhibit carbonic anhydrase are also associated with an increase in risk for renal stones, as is the ketogenic diet. Awareness of the potential metabolic disturbances associated with AED use is particularly important because many of them are subtle and may take years to become clinically apparent.

5.8 Hepatic Injury

Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered.

5.9 Hematopoietic Complications

Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs.

5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone

The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines.

5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or Hypoalbuminemia

Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients.

5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria

In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease.

5.8 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs

In patients with or without a history of seizures or epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs, including topiramate, should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential for seizures or increased seizure frequency [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In situations where rapid withdrawal of topiramate is medically required, appropriate monitoring is recommended.

5.9 Decrease in Bone Mineral Density

Results of a one-year active-controlled study in pediatric patients (N = 63) demonstrated negative effects of topiramate monotherapy on bone mineral acquisition via statistically significant decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) measured in lumbar spine and in total body less head [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Twenty-one percent of topiramate-treated patients experienced clinically important reductions in BMD (Z score change from baseline of –0.5 or greater) compared to 0 patients in the control group. Although decreases in BMD occurred across all pediatric age subgroups, patients 6 to 9 years of age were most commonly affected. The sample size and study duration were too small to determine if fracture risk is increased. Decreased BMD in the lumbar spine was correlated with decreased serum bicarbonate, which commonly occurs with topiramate treatment and reflects metabolic acidosis, a known cause of increased bone resorption [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Although small decreases in some markers of bone metabolism (e.g., serum alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) occurred in topiramate-treated patients, more significant decreases in serum parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, hormones involved in bone metabolism, were observed, along with an increased excretion of urinary calcium

Although continued growth was observed in both treatment groups, the topiramate group showed statistically significant reductions in mean annual change from baseline in body weight compared to the control group. A similar trend of attenuation in height velocity and height change from baseline was also observed in the topiramategroup compared to the control group. Negative effects on weight and height were seen across all topiramate age subgroups. Growth (height and weight) of children receiving prolonged topiramate therapy should be carefully monitored

### Extended phenytoin sodium [^699564ea]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

General:

The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity.

A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be due to limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined.

Phenytoin should be discontinued if a skin rash appears (see WARNINGS section regarding drug discontinuation). If the rash is exfoliative, purpuric, or bullous or if lupus erythematosus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis is suspected, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS section.) If the rash is of a milder type (measles-like or scarlatiniform), therapy may be resumed after the rash has completely disappeared. If the rash recurs upon reinstitution of therapy, further phenytoin medication is contraindicated.

Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Additionally, caution should be exercised if using structurally similar compounds (eg, barbiturates, succinimides, oxazolidinediones, and other related compounds) in these same patients.

Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients.

Osteomalacia has been associated with phenytoin therapy and is considered to be due to phenytoin's interference with vitamin D metabolism.

Phenytoin is not indicated for seizures due to hypoglycemic or other metabolic causes. Appropriate diagnostic procedures should be performed as indicated.

Phenytoin is not effective for absence (petit mal) seizures. If tonic-clonic (grand mal) and absence (petit mal) seizures are present, combined drug therapy is needed.

Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the optimal range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, plasma levels are recommended. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if plasma levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended. (See WARNINGS section.)

### Potential effects of valproate and oxcarbazepine on growth velocity and bone metabolism in epileptic children-a medical center experience [^49887c85]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that 1-year survey of VPA and/or OXC therapy among growing epileptic children might be associated with decreased growth velocity. This alteration seems to be mediated through the effect of AEDs on dysregulation of bone metabolism. To monitor growth velocity and bone metabolism, a larger-scale, long-term prospective study considering weight gain effect of AEDs, genetic, hormonal, and nutritional factors is needed to elucidate the true effects of AEDs itself on physical growth.

Materials and methods

Patients

HMFFs were prepared from muscle biopsy specimens. Research use of the material was approved by the regulatory agencies (EA1/203/08, EA2/051/10, EA2/175/17, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin). Informed consent was obtained from the donors or the legal guardians.

Case report of patient with a homozygous PAX7 c.86-1G > A mutation (PAX7null)

The patient was a 5-year-old girl born to fourth degree consanguineous parents (first cousins) of Kurdish origin, with no family history for neuromuscular disorders. Her two younger siblings were healthy. Her mother reported scarce fetal movements during pregnancy. She was born at term and suffered from an amniotic infection syndrome requiring antibiotic treatment and oxygen supply. She had congenital severe bilateral ptosis that required head extension for upward gaze. She was bottle fed owing to poor suction. She had normal spontaneous limb movements and started rolling over at 3–4 months of age. She could not lift her head at ventral position and failed to crawl. She achieved independent sitting at 5–6 months of age and standing position at 10 months. She walked independently at 14 months of age and was able to climb stairs from two years of age onwards. She fell frequently that was likely provoked by an impaired downside field of view as she compensated her ptosis by head extension. In addition, she developed increasing difficulties for stair climbing and required pulling at the ramp and pushing on her upper legs with her arms. However, she could climb walls independently as leisure activity. Walking became more difficult with walking perimeter below one kilometer because of rapid fatigability. She developed an increasing hyperlordosis. At the age of 5 years she developed a respiratory insufficiency requiring short-term invasive assisted ventilation during a respiratory infection. Nocturnal non-invasive-assisted ventilation was started to compensate sleep disordered breathing and nocturnal hypoventilation. She had normal cognitive and speech development and normal sensory abilities. Body length was at 50th percentile (P.) at birth, 75th P. at 4 years and dropped to 25th P. at near 6 years of age. Body weight fall from 15th P. at birth to under 3rd P. at near 6 years of age.

### Phenytoin sodium (Dilantin) [^137bc6d1]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.8 Hepatic Injury

Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with DILANTIN. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, DILANTIN should be immediately discontinued and not readministered.

5.9 Hematopoietic Complications

Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of DILANTIN. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression.

There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs.

5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone

The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines.

5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia

Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients.

5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria

In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^525df74e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical Presentation of Hypophosphatemic Rickets

Rickets is a skeletal abnormality that results from impaired apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes and delayed mineralization of growth plate cartilage. Most rickets remains nutritional in origin (about 85%); however, hypophosphatemic disorders are important to recognize. Children with hypophosphatemic rickets present similarly to nutritional rickets with poor growth, deformities of weight-bearing limbs such as genu varum or valgus, a "rachitic rosary" involving the costochondral junctions, or enlargement of wrist, knees, or ankles. Children may have hypotonia, delayed motor development, myopathy, or bone pain. Gait may waddling with in-toeing. Children with rickets, especially hypophosphatemic rickets, often have short stature with disproportionately short lower extremities, typically after age 1 year. Frontal bossing is common, while some may develop craniosynostosis. Dental abscesses are also common in X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). Family history may lead to detection of genetic forms prior to demonstration of rickets.

In adults, chronic hypophosphatemia causes osteomalacia with musculoskeletal pain and weakness, especially involving the lower extremities and impaired mobility. Bone pain may accompany acute or chronic insufficiency fractures or pseudofractures. Adults with hypophosphatemic osteomalacia may also have fatigue, enthesopathy, osteoarthritis, and dental disease, and are often short with persistence of childhood skeletal deformities.

### Antiseizure medications for adults with epilepsy: a review [^39527286]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Epilepsy affects approximately 65 million people worldwide. Persistent seizures are associated with a 20% to 40% risk of bodily injuries (eg, fractures, burns, concussions) over 12-month follow-up. The primary goal of epilepsy treatment is to eliminate seizures while minimizing adverse effects of antiseizure drugs (ASDs).

Observations

An epileptic seizure is defined as a sudden occurrence of transient signs and symptoms caused by abnormal and excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Focal and generalized epilepsy are the 2 most frequent types of epilepsy; diagnosis is based on the type of seizures. There are 26 US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for epilepsy, of which 24 have similar antiseizure efficacy for focal epilepsy and 9 have similar efficacy for generalized epilepsy. The decision to initiate an ASD should be individualized, but should be strongly considered after 2 unprovoked seizures or after 1 unprovoked seizure that occurred during sleep and/or in the presence of epileptiform activity on an electroencephalogram and/or in the presence of a structural lesion on the brain magnetic resonance imaging. The ASDs must be selected based on the seizure and epilepsy types, the epilepsy syndrome, and the adverse effects associated with the drug. For focal epilepsy, oxcarbazepine and lamotrigine are first-line therapy, while levetiracetam can be also considered if there is no history of psychiatric disorder. For generalized epilepsy, the selection of the ASD is based on the type of epilepsy syndrome and the patient's sex, age, and psychiatric history. Seizure freedom is achieved in approximately 60% to 70% of all patients. A total of 25% to 50% of patients also experience neurologic, psychiatric, cognitive, or medical disorders, such as mood, anxiety, and attention deficit disorders and migraines. For these patients, selecting an ASD should consider the presence of these disorders and concomitant use of medications to treat them. ASDs with cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducing properties (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin) may worsen comorbid coronary and cerebrovascular disease by causing hyperlipidemia and accelerating the metabolism of concomitant drugs used for their treatment. They can also facilitate the development of osteopenia and osteoporosis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Epilepsy affects approximately 65 million people worldwide and is associated with increased rates of bodily injuries and mortality when not optimally treated. For focal and generalized epilepsy, selection of ASDs should consider the seizure and epilepsy types and epilepsy syndrome, as well as the patient's age and sex, comorbidities, and potential drug interactions.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^a40ee02f]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Phenytoin or fosphenytoin dosing in adults with a subtherapeutic serum phenytoin level — therapeutic range and time to target levels are as follows: Most laboratories report a "therapeutic" serum phenytoin level between 10 to 20 mg/L, though the term is misleading because many patients remain seizure free at serum levels less than 10 mg/L and some patients require a serum level greater than 20 mg/L. A serum phenytoin level greater than or equal to 10 mg/L can be achieved by common dosing strategies, including intravenous loading of either phenytoin or fosphenytoin, which usually achieves a serum phenytoin level greater than or equal to 10 mg/L within minutes after completion of the infusion; intramuscular administration, which generally produces a therapeutic serum phenytoin level within 1 hour of administration; oral loading, which has been reported to achieve a therapeutic serum phenytoin level between 3 to 8 hours after the initial ingestion; and oral maintenance dosing without a loading dose, which can achieve a serum phenytoin level greater than or equal to 10 mg/L in 3 to 7 days, although some patients may not achieve this unless the daily maintenance dose is increased. Because these are all effective strategies, serum phenytoin levels do not need to be rechecked before ED discharge, but follow-up and monitoring of serum phenytoin levels on an outpatient basis are important.

### The impact of the use of antiepileptic drugs on the growth of children [^b329981e]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Epilepsy is a chronic condition characterized by recurrent clinical events or epileptic seizures, which occur in the absence of a metabolic or toxic disease or fever. In addition, the diagnosis of epilepsy can possibly be made after only one epileptic seizure if an "endearing predisposition of the brain to future seizures" exists. The World Health Organization (2001) estimates a prevalence of 0.8% in the general population, and the prevalence in Taiwan has been reported to be 0.28%. Epilepsy often requires long-term antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. However, prolonged AED administration is associated with a number of problems such as behavioral and psychiatric disorders, metabolic and endocrine disorders, idiosyncratic reactions, and drug interaction effects. Although some studies suggest that patients with epilepsy treated with AEDs have an increased risk of fractures, low bone mineral density (BMD), and abnormalities in bone metabolism, skeletal diseases associated with long-term AED treatment are seriously unrecognized. In a survey of > 1000 adult and pediatric neurologists designed to assess the awareness of the effects of AED therapy on bone health, only 28% of adult and 41% of pediatric neurologists reported screening their patients for bone diseases. A lack of consensus between physicians concerning the impact of AED therapy on bone may put epilepsy patients at risk, especially children, with regard to bone health or developing bone diseases.

Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines.

5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia

### Bone turnover markers: basic biology to clinical applications [^b6d80c76]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-epileptic drugs

Anti-epileptic drugs (AED) are widely used in clinical practice, and their indications go beyond epilepsy treatment. Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of fractures. Several factors are involved such as reduced BMD, impaired bone quality (due to osteoporosis and/or osteomalacia), increased risk of falls, and the occurrence of traumatic fractures associated with seizures or loss of consciousness. The impact of the trauma during a seizure is important; when seizure-related fractures are excluded, the risk of fractures in epilepsy is only increased by 30%. Epilepsy usually requires long-term treatment with AED. AED use is associated with a decrease in BMD and an increased risk of fractures.

AEDs can be classified according to their ability to induce cytochrome P450 (CYP450). The inductors of CYP450 enzymes are phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and primidone. They accelerate vitamin D metabolism and therefore decrease plasma levels of both 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D. This effect might lead to a secondary increase in PTH. Most studies with carbamazepine have reported normal levels of serum calcium. In contrast, phenytoin and phenobarbital have been associated with hypocalcemia and in vitro studies suggest an inhibition of cellular response to PTH by both anticonvulsants. Oxcarbazepine has a limited effect in inducing CYP450. Conversely, other AEDs do not induce CYP450 enzymes, such as valproate, lamotrigine, clonazepam, gabapentin, and topiramate. Despite no enzymatic induction, valproate has been associated with an increase in bone turnover, but the mechanism is unclear. Lamotrigine has not been associated with changes in BMD or BTMs. Benzodiazepines have been associated with an increased risk of fractures, but there are no data on BTMs. Gabapentin has been associated with a decrease in BMD but changes in BTMs have not been reported. Topiramate has been associated with mild hypocalcemia, lower bicarbonate concentration and an increase in bone turnover. Table 12 summarizes the effect of AED on BTMs.

Phenytoin versus fosphenytoin — safety profile and formulation notes indicate that dose-related adverse effects associated with phenytoin and fosphenytoin include ataxia, nystagmus, tremor, and somnolence. Fosphenytoin, the disodium phosphate ester of phenytoin, is a general phenytoin pro-drug that is rapidly converted to phenytoin by blood and tissue phosphatases after intravenous and intramuscular injection. Many adverse local and systemic effects reported with intravenous phenytoin, including phlebitis, purple glove syndrome, tissue necrosis, impairment of myocardial contractility, dysrhythmias, hypotension, and cardiac arrest, occur much less frequently with intravenous fosphenytoin. Parenteral phenytoin preparations contain propylene glycol (40%) and ethanol (10%) and are adjusted to a pH of 12, whereas fosphenytoin, which is more water soluble, does not contain these diluents; although fosphenytoin appears to have a better safety profile, its acquisition costs are considerably more than those for both intravenous and oral phenytoin preparations.

### Loss of seizure control due to anticonvulsant-induced hypocalcemia [^c7b8614e]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of loss of seizure control due to hypocalcemia resulting from long-term treatment with phenytoin and phenobarbital.

Case Summary

A 32-year-old mentally retarded man presented with a 12-month history of loss of seizure control, after being seizure-free for 5 years on a fixed regimen of phenobarbital and phenytoin. He had been institutionalized at the age of 10 years and had received anticonvulsant drugs since he was diagnosed with tonic-clonic epilepsy 20 years ago. On investigation, serum concentrations of the anticonvulsant drugs were within the therapeutic range, indicating adequate medication dosages. Serum biochemistry was consistent with vitamin D deficiency: hypocalcemia, reduced 25-hydroxyvitamin D, increased alkaline phosphatase, and increased parathormone. Seizure control was regained after serum calcium had been normalized with administration of vitamin D and calcium.

Discussion

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) cause vitamin D deficiency through induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize vitamin D. Institutionalized subjects are more vulnerable because of the added factors of multidrug therapy, poor diet, reduced exposure to sunlight, and physical inactivity. The resulting hypocalcemia can cause reactive seizures, thus offsetting the anticonvulsant action of the drugs. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse reactions of both phenobarbital and phenytoin were probable.

Conclusions

Hypocalcemic seizures are uncommon and underdiagnosed complications of long-term therapy with AEDs. Loss of seizure control in a patient stabilized on AEDs is an indication to check the patient's calcium status. Proper treatment of this complication is vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Prophylactic supplementation with vitamin D is necessary in institutionalized patients treated with AEDs.

Physical Examination

Physical examination identifies the consequences of hypophosphatemia and features guiding the differential diagnosis. Children may have bowing of limbs, waddling gait, in-toeing, enlargement of the wrist, knees, or ankles, frontal bossing, fusion of skull sutures, expansion of the costochondral junctions, or a horizontal groove along the thoracic border. Bone pain evident on palpation, movement, or weight bearing may be secondary to osteomalacia alone, but should prompt consideration of fracture or pseudofracture. Dental abscesses are common in XLH. Muscle weakness and abnormal gait may be present. Enthesopathy often manifests as decreased range of motion at the spine or large joints due to calcification of entheses in adults with XLH. If TIO is considered, a mass may be palpated in any part of body. Skin examination may detect café au lait macules (FD and McCune–Albright syndrome) or abnormal nevi with a variety of morphologies (pink/orange hairless plaques or brown verrucous lesions that are exophytic and friable; nevi on mucous membranes, mouth, or eyes, which could represent linear sebaceous nevi). FD may result in deformities of long bones or facial asymmetry due involved craniofacial bones.

Laboratory

We recommend collecting samples before initiating treatment to avoid confounding the results. If a patient is already receiving treatment, stopping phosphate and calcitriol for a week before testing can clarify the diagnosis. Initial evaluation includes measuring serum calcium, phosphorus, PTH, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. While secondary hyperparathyroidism often accompanies rickets, rickets is not usually caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. Hypocalcemia would suggest abnormal vitamin D stores or vitamin D metabolism or a tubulopathy. Alkaline phosphatase levels are typically elevated in rickets but may be only mildly high. Normal serum phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase values are higher in infants and young children and decrease with age gradually to adulthood; therefore, one must be certain to compare these to age-appropriate normal ranges to ensure appropriate diagnosis. Using an adult normal range for serum phosphorus could result in missing the diagnosis of hypophosphatemia.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^501d911a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Lower-risk brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) — antiepileptic medications: Clinicians Should Not Prescribe Antiepileptic Medications for Potential Neurologic Disorders in Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, Moderate Recommendation). Supporting data include that in a cohort of 471 ALTE patients, most who developed epilepsy had a second event within 1 month of their initial presentation, that there is no evidence of benefit from starting therapy after the first seizure compared with starting therapy after a second seizure in terms of achieving seizure remission, and that sudden unexpected death in epilepsy has a frequency close to 1 in 1000 patient years with risks that include adolescent age and presence of epilepsy for more than 5 years; accordingly, these data do not support prescribing an antiepileptic medicine for a first-time possible seizure because of a concern for SUDEP, the evidence available for ALTEs suggests lack of benefit for starting an antiepileptic medication for a lower-risk BRUE, and recommendations are based on no prospective studies and on only a single retrospective study.

### Nav1.2 channel mutations preventing fast inactivation lead to SCN2A encephalopathy [^0e36c996]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

L1657P has been identified in two patients. The first is a male, born after a normal pregnancy and well at birth. Seizures started from Day 2 of life onwards with frequent daily episodes of tonic seizures, spasms and status epilepticus, with burst-suppression pattern on the EEG (consistent with EIDEE) and normal brain MRI. Treatment with phenobarbital, levetiracetam, vigabatrin or ketogenic diet showed no effect. With phenytoin treatment, seizures and EEG improved, but daily seizures persisted. Addition of valproate, bromide or chloral hydrate had no effect on epilepsy. The child showed a severe global developmental disorder, an extreme severe form of spasticity, had no eye contact and little reaction to stimuli, and was fed with a PEG tube. The child died at age 20 months from pneumonia.

The second is a boy born at term, with onset of electroclinical and electrographic focal seizures on Day 3 of life. The epilepsy syndrome consistent with epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures. On neurologic examination, he was encephalopathic and hypertonic. Seizures were resistant to phenobarbitone, levetiracetam, vigabatrin and lacosamide. An initial reduction in seizure frequency was noted with each of carbamazepine, phenytoin and clobazam, but this was not sustained. At age 4 months, seizures continue at between multiple daily and multiple hourly frequency and are often prolonged.

P1658S, identified through the ClinVar database, has been described as a likely pathogenic variant.

A1659V has been identified in a cohort of Vietnamese DEE patients and reported as pathogenic/likely pathogenic.

M1501T (ClinVar) has been associated with early-infantile DEE.

M1501V identified through the SSDb database, has been reported in a male patient and described as a pathogenic de novo variant associated with early-infantile DEE.

F1651C has been identified as a mosaic de novo mutation in a patient with early-infantile DEE characterized by seizure onset at 6 weeks of age, with seizures classified as clonic and generalized tonic-clonic, showing multifocal spikes and episodes of status epilepticus. At 3 months, the patient became seizure free following phenytoin administration; however, low levels of phenytoin resulted in relapse.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^18230b56]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus refractory after benzodiazepines and phenytoin — evidence on phenytoin-based regimens: The 1998 Treiman et al (VA Cooperative Study) showed a 56% success in terminating status epilepticus using a diazepam/phenytoin combination, and a 1988 study evaluated diazepam and phenytoin in 18 patients compared with 18 patients treated with phenobarbital; other than 1 abstract demonstrating efficacy, there have been no published prospective studies of fosphenytoin in this context. In a case series, of 13 status epilepticus patients who were given high-dose phenytoin (mean dose 24 mg/kg), 5 (38%) did not require pentobarbital therapy.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^ebf38944]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — when to refer and special dosing notes that if radiographic evidence of some healing is not observed with vitamin D and calcium replacement in 3 months, considerations should include malabsorption, liver disease, or a lack of compliance with replacement therapy, and one should also rule out the use of medications that may affect vitamin D levels. For malabsorption, higher doses are required (as much as 4000–10 000 IU/day), usually as an aqueous solution such as Drisdol with oral calcium; a high dose given as an intramuscular injection in oil is effective though availability is variable, and higher dosing is also necessary for children receiving anticonvulsants or glucocorticoids. Indications for considering other causes of rickets include radiologic evidence at < 6 months of age and between 3 and 10 years of age, radiographs with a periosteal reaction and a moth-eaten metaphysis, and laboratory red flags such as similar, normal levels of ALP and 25(OH)-D, very low or very high 1,25(OH)2-D, and a high serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.

### A 15-day-old male infant presenting with jerking movements of the limbs [^8c80c771]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

This 15-day-old Caucasian male infant presented to the clinic with his mother for a well-child visit. During the visit, the mother mentioned that she had observed jerking movements of the limbs, arms more than legs. Various tests were performed and observation in the ward helped determine the characteristics of the seizure-like movements. The infant was born by vaginal delivery with vacuum extraction with a history of possible perinatal asphyxia. After seizures were observed in the ward, the patient was referred to neurology where an EEG was performed. It was normal, excluding epilepsy states. A normal newborn screen excluded most metabolic disorders. After history and examination, investigations and observation, benign sleep myoclonus was diagnosed. Benign sleep myoclonus is a benign disorder that consists of jerking movements of the limbs, usually involving the upper limbs more than the lower limbs and usually occurring during sleep. The seizures spontaneously stopped when the infant was approximately 1.5 months old. This was consistent with the final diagnosis of neonatal sleep myoclonus.

### Remarkable phenytoin sensitivity in 4 children with SCN8A-related epilepsy: a molecular neuropharmacological approach [^bf3c6e58]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Here we describe 4 patients who carry a missense mutation in SCN8A, in which seizure control is achieved by treatment with (high-dose) phenytoin. Although this series of patients is relatively small, the reoccurrence of seizures when serum phenytoin levels were low in patient 1, and the reoccurrence of seizures after multiple attempts to withdraw phenytoin in patients 3 and 4, provide a direct link between the genetic defect in these patients and their drug response.

Phenytoin is a sodium channel blocker and binds at a receptor site in the pore of sodium channels, decreases the sodium influx, and thereby decreases the excitability of the neuron. Given the fact that phenytoin is one of the few sodium channel blockers targeting only the sodium channel and no other molecular targets in the brain, this might explain the extraordinary response to phenytoin treatment in our patients, in contrast with the response to treatment with other sodium channel blockers. Carbamazepine, another frequently used sodium channel blocker in epilepsy, is thought to have a similar working mechanism to phenytoin. However, the affinity of carbamazepine for inactivated sodium channels is around three times lower than that of phenytoin. Phenytoin works in a frequency-dependent way: it is found primarily to inhibit high-frequency firing but not low-frequency firing, which explains the blocking effect of phenytoin on repetitive discharges as seen in epilepsy, while not interfering with normal neuronal firing. Therefore, phenytoin could be an important treatment option in patients with SCN8A -related epilepsy because it is primarily expected to block the increased sodium current through the mutated Nav1.6, but not to affect the function of other VGSC not affected by the SCN8A mutation. Side effects of phenytoin include ataxia, nystagmus, cerebellar atrophy, and gingival hyperplasia. Cardiotoxicity (hypotension, prolonged QT interval, arrhythmias) is rare after oral administration but is an important side effect after rapid phenytoin administration IV. The therapeutic range of total phenytoin is a serum level between 10 and 20 mg/l (free phenytoin 1–2 mg/l). Total serum levels > 20 mg/l may cause nystagmus, ataxia, and tremor, while total serum levels > 40 mg/l can lead to lethargy, confusion, seizures, and coma.
