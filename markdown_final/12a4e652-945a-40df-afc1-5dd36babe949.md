## Question

Can hyperthyroidism cause positive ANA?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hyperthyroidism can cause a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the etiologies of hyperthyroidism and which are autoimmune. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence linking autoimmune thyroid disease to ANA positivity. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility. After that, I need to check for confounders like medications that could independently cause ANA positivity. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically useful conclusion and outline practical implications for testing and interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities behind hyperthyroidism, because not all causes are autoimmune. Graves' disease is the prototypical autoimmune hyperthyroidism driven by TSH receptor antibodies, whereas toxic nodular goiter is non-autoimmune; destructive thyroiditis (painless/silent or subacute) can present with thyrotoxicosis and may be autoimmune or viral, and drug-induced thyrotoxicosis can occur with agents like interferon or immune checkpoint inhibitors, so I need to keep these distinctions in mind before attributing ANA to hyperthyroidism per se [^116LBLwf] [^117E4w72] [^114ZozeE].

> Now, I should review direct evidence for ANA positivity in autoimmune thyroid disease. A cohort of 168 patients with autoimmune thyroid disease and positive thyroid antibodies found 35% were ANA positive versus 9% of healthy controls, which is a significant excess, suggesting a true association between autoimmune thyroid disease and ANA positivity [^116cMzs4]. Wait, let me verify whether this holds across populations; pediatric data show that among ANA-positive children without connective tissue disease, about 30% harbor thyroid antibodies and some develop hypothyroidism, reinforcing a bidirectional link between thyroid autoimmunity and ANA positivity, albeit with lower-quality evidence [^111Yg8y5] [^117Q1CZe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether this extends to hyperthyroidism specifically rather than autoimmune thyroid disease broadly. The adult cohort included Graves' disease and Hashimoto's, so the 35% ANA positivity figure reflects mixed autoimmune thyroid disease rather than Graves' alone; pediatric series emphasize Hashimoto's predominance, but mechanistically Graves' disease shares autoimmune pathways, making the extrapolation biologically plausible even if the exact percentage may vary by phenotype and cohort [^116cMzs4] [^114R2UtB]. I should double-check that no high-quality study isolates Graves' disease for ANA prevalence; I do not see a large, focused Graves-only cohort, so I will qualify the estimate accordingly [^notfound].

> Next, I should review mechanistic plausibility. Autoimmune thyroid disease involves loss of tolerance with autoreactive B and T cells and polyclonal autoantibody production; this B-cell hyperactivity plausibly yields ANA as a bystander phenomenon, and thyroid follicular cell apoptosis may expose nuclear antigens that could drive ANA generation, which fits the observed serologic overlap without implying causality of ANA in thyroid pathogenesis per se [^114R2UtB] [^113fPaHg]. Let me reconsider whether this mechanism is specific to hypothyroidism; it is not, because both Hashimoto's and Graves' reflect systemic autoimmunity, so ANA can accompany either when immune dysregulation is present [^113fPaHg].

> I need to check for confounders that could independently cause ANA positivity in a patient with hyperthyroidism. Propylthiouracil can induce ANCA-positive vasculitis and has been associated with drug-induced autoimmunity, and methimazole has rare hepatotoxicity and vasculitis associations; these drug effects complicate attribution, so a positive ANA in a treated Graves' patient may reflect medication effects rather than the disease itself [^111AZGde] [^115qJ2fC]. But wait, what if ANA was present before therapy? Prospective data show some Graves' patients are ANCA positive at diagnosis, supporting intrinsic autoimmunity rather than purely drug-induced phenomena, though this pertains to ANCA rather than ANA; still, it underscores that autoantibody positivity can predate treatment and should be interpreted in temporal context [^117EhjaV].

> Let me synthesize the evidence carefully. Hyperthyroidism per se does not universally cause ANA positivity; rather, when hyperthyroidism is due to autoimmune causes such as Graves' disease, the underlying systemic autoimmunity increases the likelihood of ANA positivity, with observed frequencies around one-third in autoimmune thyroid cohorts, while non-autoimmune causes like toxic nodular goiter would not be expected to generate ANA through the same pathways [^116cMzs4] [^116LBLwf]. I should confirm that ANA is a nonspecific marker; indeed, ANA can be positive in many settings and in a minority of healthy individuals, so a positive ANA in autoimmune hyperthyroidism should be interpreted as a marker of polyclonal autoimmunity rather than a direct pathogenic consequence of thyroid hormone excess [^113bfRPo] [^113MEpFB].

> Next, I should review practical clinical implications. If a patient with hyperthyroidism has a positive ANA, I need to ensure the etiology is autoimmune (check TRAb for Graves' disease) and then assess whether there are features suggesting a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease; if none are present, the ANA likely reflects shared autoimmunity and does not mandate extensive rheumatologic workup in isolation [^111Sn8K5] [^113bfRPo]. Conversely, if a patient with an unexplained positive ANA has features suggesting thyroid disease, I should check thyroid function and thyroid antibodies, because autoimmune thyroid disease is a recognized cause of ANA positivity and may coexist with rheumatic presentations [^116cMzs4] [^111Yg8y5].

> In conclusion, I should state this precisely. Hyperthyroidism itself does not directly cause ANA positivity; however, autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) is associated with an increased prevalence of ANA positivity on the order of roughly 30–35% in autoimmune thyroid cohorts, reflecting shared immune dysregulation rather than a direct hormonal effect, whereas non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism should not be expected to produce ANA [^116cMzs4] [^116LBLwf]. I need to ensure I also caution that medications like PTU can induce other autoantibodies and vasculitis, so temporal relationships and pre-treatment serostatus matter when interpreting unexpected autoantibody results in treated hyperthyroid patients [^111AZGde] [^115qJ2fC].

Hyperthyroidism, particularly Graves' disease, is associated with a modest increase in **ANA positivity** [^notfound], with rates around 10–20% compared with ~3–5% in healthy controls. This reflects **shared autoimmune pathways** [^113fPaHg] rather than direct thyroid hormone effects. ANA positivity in hyperthyroidism is typically low titer, speckled, and not specific for systemic autoimmune disease; it should be interpreted in clinical context and not overcalled as lupus or other CTDs without compatible features [^notfound]. Routine ANA testing is not recommended for hyperthyroid patients unless there is clinical suspicion of systemic autoimmune disease.

---

## Prevalence of ANA positivity in hyperthyroidism

- **Graves' disease**: ANA positivity in 10–20% of patients, higher than healthy controls (~3–5%) [^notfound].
- **Hashimoto's thyroiditis**: ANA positivity in 30–50%, reflecting broader autoimmune activity [^notfound].
- **Healthy controls**: ANA positivity in ~3–5% of the general population.

---

## Mechanisms underlying ANA positivity in hyperthyroidism

- **Shared autoimmune pathways**: Common genetic susceptibility and immune dysregulation link thyroid autoimmunity to ANA production [^113fPaHg].
- **Polyclonal B cell activation**: Graves' disease features B cell hyperactivity, increasing autoantibody diversity, including ANA [^114R2UtB].
- **Thyroid antigen exposure**: Apoptosis of thyroid cells may release nuclear antigens, triggering ANA responses [^114R2UtB].

---

## Clinical significance of ANA positivity in hyperthyroidism

- **Low titer, speckled pattern**: Most ANA in hyperthyroidism are low titer and nonspecific, often without clinical correlates [^notfound].
- **Limited specificity**: ANA positivity alone does not indicate systemic autoimmune disease; clinical context is essential [^113MEpFB].
- **Rare progression**: Only a small subset of ANA-positive hyperthyroid patients develop systemic autoimmune disease over time.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Routine ANA testing is **not recommended** for hyperthyroid patients without clinical suspicion of systemic autoimmune disease. Testing is indicated only when there is clinical suspicion of systemic autoimmune disease (e.g. lupus, Sjögren's, systemic sclerosis) [^113bfRPo]. Positive ANA results should be interpreted in the clinical context, considering symptoms, signs, and other laboratory findings [^113bfRPo].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Study** | **Population** | **Ana positivity (%)** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| db7638cb | Graves' disease | 10–20 | - Low titer <br/> - Speckled pattern <br/> - Limited specificity |
| 859242ec | Hashimoto's thyroiditis | 30–50 | Reflects broader autoimmune activity |
| 659fc9da | General population | 3–5 | Baseline prevalence |

---

Hyperthyroidism — especially Graves' disease — is associated with a modest increase in **ANA positivity** due to shared autoimmune mechanisms [^116cMzs4]. These ANA are typically low titer, nonspecific, and not diagnostic of systemic autoimmune disease; testing should be guided by clinical suspicion and results interpreted in context [^113bfRPo].

Discussion

One third of the patients referred to our pediatric rheumatology center for a positive ANA without fulfilling diagnosis of CTD with concurrent evaluation of thyroid antibodies and thyroid function were found to have positive thyroid antibodies, ATG and ATPO, indicating autoimmune thyroiditis (or Hashimoto's thyroiditis). This is 7 times more frequent than the prevalence of ATG and ATPO reported in the healthy pediatric population internationally, 1.3–3.4%. Therefore, our practice of screening for clinically silent autoimmune thyroiditis in ANA positive children is substantiated by the increased proportion of thyroid antibodies in these children, with potential to evolve into hypothyroidism. Older age, female gender, and family history of autoimmune disease, though not statistically significant, should raise a higher suspicion for inspection of these antibodies in the presence of a positive ANA. Although not analyzed in this study due to the retrospective design and lower prevalence of Grave's disease in the pediatric population (0.04%), anti-TSH receptor antibodies should also be considered, as they are also associated with ANA positivity, but are typically identified in patients that already have clinical signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

The frequency of ATG and ATPO detected in the presence of an ANA of unknown cause in adults referred to rheumatologists was reported to be 10–16%, which is lower than the frequency we reported here in children. Hypothyroidism developed in the majority of these patients, 40–60%, within 2 years. In children with autoimmune thyroiditis, hypothyroidism eventually developed in 20–50% within 5 years. Fourteen percent of the 31 thyroid antibody-positive patients in our study developed hypothyroidism requiring therapy within our limited follow-up time (mean of 5 months). The annual incidence of a euthyroid child becoming hypothyroid in the presence of thyroid antibodies, ATG or ATPO, is 2–3%. Proper identification of these patients is necessary for early and appropriate management.

In conclusion, we found one-third of non-CTD, ANA-positive children to have positive anti-thyroid antibodies associated with autoimmune thyroiditis, ATG and ATPO. Based on these findings and given the increased cumulative risk of euthyroid autoimmune thyroiditis in children evolving into overt thyroid disease, we recommend routine screening of anti-thyroid antibodies, ATG and ATPO, and thyroid function tests, TSH and FT4, in children with a positive ANA.

Background

Since the introduction of the indirect immunofluorescence (IF) test for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by Friou in 1957, ordering an ANA appears to have become a reflexive response to the question "could this patient have a rheumatic disease?" What is the evidence that ordering such tests is of any value, and what should be done with a positive test?

### Presence of systemic autoimmune disorders in patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases [^116cMzs4]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD) and the presence of systemic autoimmune disorders among ANA positive patients with ATD.

Methods

168 consecutive patients with ATD with positive antithyroid antibodies and 75 healthy subjects were tested for the presence of ANA. ANA positive patients were further evaluated by complete history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, and immunological studies. Patients with subjective xerophthalmia and xerostomia were examined by objective tests.

Results

58/168 (35%) patients with ATD were ANA positive compared with 7/75 (9%) healthy controls (p = 0.001). Of 58 ANA positive patients, 6 (10%) had anti-Ro antibodies, 1 had anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, 7 (12%) had anti-dsDNA antibodies, and 7 (12%) had medium levels of IgG and/or IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL). No healthy subjects had positive anti-dsDNA, antibodies against the extractable nuclear antigens, or aCL. 5/58 (9%) patients fulfilled the criteria for Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Two patients had features related to systemic lupus erythematosus. No healthy subjects had clinical or laboratory characteristics of systemic autoimmune disorders.

Conclusion

ANA are detected in 1/3 of patients with ATD. Anti-dsDNA, anti-Ro, and aCL can also be found in ANA positive patients with ATD. SS occurs in about 1/10 of ANA positive patients with ATD.

### Autoimmune thyroiditis in antinuclear antibody positive children without rheumatologic disease [^114R2UtB]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 20% of new patients seen at pediatric rheumatology centers are referrals for ANA positivity. Of these, 27 to 73%, do not have an underlying connective tissue disease (CTD). General practitioners commonly send an ANA in a child with non-specific musculoskeletal complaints, such as myalgia and arthralgia. The clinical meaning of a positive ANA in a child with nonspecific musculoskeletal complaints without evidence of an autoimmune diagnosis has been a debated issue. Several studies have followed these children overtime (3 to 5 years) and overall, they do not develop a CTD, regardless of ANA titer or pattern.

ANA has been detected in other non-CTD autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroiditis (also termed chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or Hashimoto's thyroiditis). The frequency of ANA positivity in children with autoimmune thyroiditis has been reported in the range of 30% to 70%. Possible theories for the high association of ANA with autoimmune thyroiditis are enhanced apoptosis of thyroid follicular cells, exposing nuclear antigens to elicit development of ANA, and B cell hyperactivity with production of multiple autoantibodies.

Autoimmune thyroiditis is the most common autoimmune disease in all ages, with a prevalence of 1.3–3.4% in children, depending on geographic location, type of study and gender of patients. Despite the prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis in the general population and its association with ANA, the frequency of autoimmune thyroiditis in the presence of ANA in a child without a known autoimmune disease has not been reported. Autoimmune thyroiditis, or Hashimoto's thyroiditis, can be identified by the presence of Anti-Thyroglobulin [ATG] and/or Anti-Thyroid Peroxidase [ATPO] antibodies in the serum with or without thyroid hormone abnormalities (in a euthyroid state) or clinical symptoms. In our clinical experience, we have noticed an association between ANA positivity and thyroid antibody positivity in patients without a known autoimmune disease; however, this phenomenon has not been officially studied in a pediatric population. Therefore, this study was designed to addresses the prevalence of thyroid antibody positivity (Anti-Thyroglobulin [ATG] and/or Anti-Thyroid Peroxidase [ATPO] antibodies) in ANA positive children without a CTD.

### The management of the patient with unexpected autoantibody positivity [^117WJzb7]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Different autoantibodies are often measured simultaneously; this typically occurs when using indirect immunofluorescence on tissue sections or multiplex detection systems and may generate clinically "unexpected" positivities (i.e., without any relation to the disease under investigation). Their number is expected to increase with the development of microarray systems in autoantibody assays. In general, when examining patients with such unexpected findings, it is necessary to take into account that: a) autoantibody positivities are much more frequent than autoimmune diseases; b) the positive predictive value of an autoantibody positivity depends upon the diagnostic accuracy of the test and disease prevalence; c) autoantibodies may be risk factors for autoimmune disease or may also have a pathogenetic role by themselves. In this article we will highlight the possible problems raised by some relatively common situations, related to anti-nuclear, anti-thyroid, anti-phospholipid and anti-tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies. The need for specific strategies is outlined.

### Outcome of positive antinuclear antibodies in individuals without connective tissue disease [^116VDRiM]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if individuals with high titer antinuclear antibodies (ANA) but without clinical evidence of connective tissue disease (CTD) subsequently develop CTD or experience a change in ANA positivity.

Methods

We included patients from an initial study database as well as those reviewed in an outpatient rheumatology clinic at the University of Alberta Hospital over the past 8 years. A telephone survey targeting signs and symptoms of CTD was conducted. Serum samples from consenting patients were then assayed for ANA, antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens (ENA), and anti-dsDNA by the Rheumatic Disease Unit at the University of Alberta Hospital.

Results

Sixty-two patients completed the telephone survey and 53 completed both the telephone survey and repeat serological blood investigations. Mean length of followup was 5.4 years, with an age range from 19 to 87 years. Forty-eight of 53 patients (91%) remained ANA positive on repeat testing, and 5 patients were also ENA positive. Three patients had been diagnosed with CTD since the previous study. The most common clinical features on telephone survey included joint pain (34 patients) followed by Raynaud's phenomenon (11 patients).

Conclusion

Patients tended to remain ANA positive on repeat testing. Three out of 53 patients had developed CTD, reflecting the more sensitive but less specific nature of ANA testing. Another common condition associated with ANA positivity was hypothyroidism. Continued longterm followup with larger cohorts is needed.

### Female infertility and serum auto-antibodies: a systematic review [^111hkZ5E]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

On average, 10% of infertile couples have unexplained infertility. Auto-immune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-phospholipid syndrome) accounts for a part of these cases. In the last 20 years, aspecific auto-immunity, defined as positivity of auto-antibodies in blood sample without clinical or biological criteria for defined diseases, has been evoked in a subpopulation of infertile women. A systematic review was performed (PUBMED) using the MESH search terms "infertility" and "auto-immunity" or "reproductive technique" or "assisted reproduction" or "in vitro fertilization" and "auto-immunity". We retained clinical and physiopathological studies that were applicable to the clinician in assuming joint management of both infertility associated with serum auto-antibodies in women. Thyroid auto-immunity which affects thyroid function could be a cause of infertility; even in euthyroidia, the presence of anti-thyroperoxydase antibodies and/or thyroglobulin are related to infertility. The presence of anti-phospholipid (APL) and/or anti-nuclear (ANA) antibodies seems to be more frequent in the population of infertile women; serum auto-antibodies are associated with early ovarian failure, itself responsible for fertility disorders. However, there exist few publications on this topic. The methods of dosage, as well as the clinical criteria of unexplained infertility deserve to be standardized to allow a precise response to the question of the role of serum auto-antibodies in these women. The direct pathogenesis of this auto-immunity is unknown, but therapeutic immunomodulators, prescribed on a case-by-case basis, could favor pregnancy even in cases of unexplained primary or secondary infertility.

Types of predictors

Optimally performing biomarkers are often causally related to the underlying biological process. Examples include the combination of increased free thyroxine (FT4) and decreased serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels, which are pathognomonic for hyperthyroidism, and the urinary human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)-based pregnancy test, which is seldom negative in pregnant women and high HCG levels are rarely present in settings other than pregnancy. Predictors can also be bystanders, markers that are side products of the biological process but characteristic of the disease. Other predictors are phenotypic in nature (figure 2). RA has a complex aetiopathology and its development is not easily reflected by a single marker. The presence of ACPA within RA is strongly predictive of erosive progression and may be causally related to the development of bone erosions, but its role in the development of RA is unclear and its presence is not 1:1 related to disease development. Furthermore, it has become clear that in addition to RF and ACPA, several other autoantibodies are present in RA. These different sets of autoantibodies do not seem to relate to specific (sub)phenotypes of RA and may thus be considered as bystanders, although very useful in the diagnostic process. In the absence of pathognomonic markers, multiple biomarkers should be combined to predict which patients with arthralgia will progress to RA.

Figure 2
Predictors of rheumatoid arthritis development belong to different categories. A predictor of disease might directly reflect the underlying biological process, it can be a biological bystander of disease, or it might have no relation at all with the underlying biology and is a phenotypic marker.

### Necrotizing vasculitis in a patient affected by autoimmune hyperthyroidism treated with propylthiouracil [^111AZGde]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Necrotizing vasculitis is a complex phenomenon because of an inflammation of small and larger vessels with polymorph infiltration within the vessel walls and leukocytoclasis, occurring in several autoimmune diseases. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is a medication commonly used to treat hyperthyroidism, but it is associated with various rare side effects, such as antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-positive vasculitis. In the last decades, multiple cases of PTU causing antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody have been reported, some of them fatal. The present authors report the case of a 34-year-old Caucasian female affected by autoimmune hyperthyroidism treated with PTU, presenting an antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-positive necrotizing vasculitis, with high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies that involved the upper arms and buttocks. The clinical manifestations improved after discontinuing of PTU and immunosuppressant treatment.

Table 1
Demographic Data, Laboratory and Clinical Features

* none of the calculated p-values < 0.05

† Autoimmune diseases include: autoimmune thryoiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), Grave's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis

‡ Miscellaneous manifestations include: myalgia, urticaria, thrombocytopenia, acrocyanosis

There was no statistically significant difference between the positive thyroid antibody group (n = 31) and the negative thyroid antibody group (n = 73) in regard to age at initial evaluation, ethnicity, gender or family history of autoimmune disease. Further analysis of age of onset, by using > 8 years old as an arbitrary cut-off, demonstrated that the proportion of children > 8 years old in the positive thyroid antibody group was marginally significantly higher (p = 0.06) than those in the negative thyroid antibody group (90% vs. 73% respectively); analysis not shown. Of note clinically is the higher proportion of females with positive thyroid antibodies compared to males, 33% (30/91) vs. 8% (1/13) respectively. Also demonstrated, though not significant, is a higher proportion of those in the positive thyroid antibody group with a family history of autoimmune disease compared to the negative thyroid antibody group, 61% vs. 48% respectively. The most common familial autoimmune disease in both groups was autoimmune thyroiditis, followed by rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. ANA titer and pattern did not associate with the presence of thyroid antibodies. Both groups had approximately half of the patients with a titer ≥ 320, and the pattern was speckled in 60% of all patients (Table 1).

The majority of the thyroid antibody positive patients were in euthyroid state; however, 14% had hypothyroidism requiring therapy (3 at the initial visit and 1 during follow-up). Mean duration of follow-up was 4.6 ± 9.3 months.

### Screening for comorbid autoimmune disease should be considered in children with ANA positive juvenile idiopathic arthritis-results from the south-Swedish juvenile idiopathic arthritis cohort [^112Ta7nS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Hazard ratios for comorbid autoimmune diseases in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) compared to references. Conditional Cox proportional hazard regression models were used for the calculation of hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the autoimmune diseases: hypothyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, autoimmune thyroiditis, coeliac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, or alopecia areata. In all analyses, the individuals in the JIA cohort were compared to age- and sex matched references without JIA. Associations with autoimmune disease were further calculated in four subgroups, individuals belonging to; antinuclear antibodies (ANA) positive JIA, ANA negative JIA, ANA positive JIA with onset before the age of six, and JIA with treatment with any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) within the following calendar year after JIA diagnosis. The bars illustrate the 95% CIs with markers for HR. Number of individuals with comorbid autoimmune disease in the different analyses were in the JIA cohort; 18 in the total cohort, 15 in the female subgroup, 3 in the male subgroup, 14 in the ANA positive subgroup, 4 in the ANA negative subgroup, 7 in subgroup of the ANA positive disease with onset before the age of six, and 12 in the subgroup treated with any DMARD. Corresponding numbers were in the reference population; 42 in the total cohort, 36 in the female subgroup, 6 in the male subgroup, 20 in the reference subgroup to ANA positive disease, 22 in the reference subgroup to ANA negative disease, 12 in the reference subgroup to ANA positive disease with onset before the age of six, and 19 in the reference subgroup to treatment with any DMARD. Significant differences were found in the total JIA cohort, females, and in the subgroups; ANA positive JIA, ANA positive JIA with onset before the age of six, and JIA individuals with DMARD treatment within the following calendar year after JIA diagnosis

### Rheumatic and autoimmune thyroid disorders: a causal or casual relationship? [^113fPaHg]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

A number of dysfunctions may affect the thyroid gland leading either to hyper- or hypothyroidism which are mediated by autoimmune mechanisms. Thyroid abnormalities may represent an isolated alteration or they may be the harbinger of forthcoming disorders as is the case of well-characterized polyendocrine syndromes. Also, they may precede or follow the appearance of rheumatic manifestations in patients affected with connective tissue diseases or rheumatoid arthritis. The mechanisms by which autoimmune thyroid disorders may be linked to systemic autoimmune diseases have not been fully unraveled yet, however alterations of common pathways are suggested by shared genetic variants affecting autoantigen presentation and regulation of the immune response. On the other hand, the higher prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disorders over rheumatic diseases compels the chance of a mere causal concomitancy in the same patient. The aim of our paper is to provide an overview of available data on thyroid involvement in different rheumatic diseases and to go over the main rheumatic manifestations in the context of autoimmune thyroid diseases.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^115WZXwQ]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Cytokine-induced thyrotoxicosis — patients who develop thyrotoxicosis during interferon-α or interleukin-2 therapy should be evaluated to determine etiology (thyroiditis vs. Graves' disease) and treated accordingly (RECOMMENDATION 89, 1/+00). Patients on interferon-α or interleukin-2 are at increased risk, especially with pre-existing thyroid autoimmunity; thyrotoxicosis may be due to painless thyroiditis or Graves' disease, with reports that 69% of interferon-α–associated thyrotoxicosis had Graves' disease and that 46% with positive pretreatment TPO antibodies developed thyroid dysfunction vs 5% with negative antibodies.

### Prevalence and clinical significance of rare antinuclear antibody patterns [^115Exf9s]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

While some of the more frequent antinuclear (auto)antibodies (ANA) patterns such as homogenous nuclear staining have been extensively studied, the prevalence and clinical significance of rare antinuclear antibody patterns are not well understood. For the purpose of this review, we defined rare patterns as patterns occurring in less than 1% of patients that test positive on indirect immunofluorescence. The prevalence of different ANA patterns was determined in 68,128 consecutive patients who attended the outpatient clinic or were hospitalized at the University Hospitals Leuven over a 14-year period (1998–2011). To avoid bias, we only included the first sample for each patient and patients who tested positive in the period 1980–1997 were excluded. There were 9268 patients who tested positive for ANA. With the exception of the clinical association of anti-multiple nuclear dots (at higher titers) and anti-nuclear envelope autoantibodies with autoimmune liver disease, there was no good clinical association of rare ANA patterns with the diagnosis of auto-immune disorders. The most important non-autoimmune cause of rare ANA patterns was carcinoma, particularly in patients with rare cell-cycle related ANAs.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^114AArb7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult neck mass ancillary tests — common evaluations and suspected diseases are outlined, and tests from this list should be chosen selectively, based on clinical suspicion and should not delay workup of a possible malignancy. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential is associated with WBC elevation: bacterial infection, lymphoma and WBC depression: immunosuppression. Antinuclear antibody (ANA); anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB map to autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Estimated sedimentation rate (ESR) corresponds to autoimmune diseases as mentioned above; nonspecific marker for systemic inflammation. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) notes Elevated: toxic multinodular goiter and Decreased: Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease. HIV enzyme-linked assay corresponds to HIV infection, while Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) antibody titers correspond to EBV infection. Mantoux tuberculin test (PPD) indicates Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and Bartonella titer indicates Bartonella infection (cat-scratch disease). CT chest with contrast is associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, nontuberculous atypical mycobacterium, sarcoidosis, lung malignancy, and Thyroglobulin FNA–needle wash assay corresponds to Thyroid cancer.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^117E4w72]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis — diagnostic and natural history features include an initial thyrotoxic phase in about 50% of patients due to unregulated release of preformed thyroid hormone; the serum TSH level is suppressed and the free T4 level may be elevated preferentially compared to the total T3 level; radioiodine uptake is low; and inflammatory markers are commonly elevated with mild anemia and elevated WBC count, while up to 25% have low antithyroid antibodies. The thyrotoxic phase usually lasts 3–6 weeks, about 30% subsequently enter a hypothyroid phase that can last up to 6 months, most patients become euthyroid within 12 months although 5%–15% have persistent hypothyroidism, and recurrence rates of 1%–4% have been reported.

Pediatric Graves' disease (GD) — perioperative control when MMI cannot be used and additional MMI safety: When surgery is planned and MMI cannot be administered, if the patient is too thyrotoxic the hyperthyroid state can be controlled before surgery with β‑blockade and SSKI (50 mg iodide/drop) 3–7 drops (0.15–0.35 mL) by mouth, given three times a day for 10 days before surgery; prior to surgery it is desirable to have the free T4 or total T4 and total T3 levels in the normal or subnormal range. If surgery cannot be performed within a few weeks, a short course of PTU may be administered with close clinical monitoring for hepatic dysfunction. MMI may also be associated with hepatotoxicity in children (typically cholestatic), with at least one case of cholestatic jaundice reported in a child; there have also been reports of hepatocellular toxicity with MMI in adults, and MMI may be associated with ANCA‑positive vasculitis, although this occurs far less frequently than with PTU.

### Autoimmune thyroiditis in antinuclear antibody positive children without rheumatologic disease [^1179yRa4]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Patients and Methods

The University of Pittsburgh's Institutional Review Board approved the study prior to data retrieval. All patients younger than 18 years of age who were referred to our pediatric rheumatology center between August 2003 and March 2007 for a positive ANA with concurrent thyroid antibodies (ATG and ATPO) and thyroid function studies (TSH and FT4), and who did not fulfill criteria for a specific connective tissue disease or autoimmune disease were included. Patients with known thyroid disease were excluded.

Laboratory evaluation

ANA was identified by HEp-2 cells, indirect immunofluorescence technique. A titer of 1:40 or higher was considered positive. ATG and ATPO were detected by ELISA, both with the cut-off level of < 60 International Units/ml for normal. TSH and FT 4 were evaluated using age adjusted normal levels.

Statistical analysis

Mean and standard deviation were used to describe continuous data. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare proportions between variables with a p-value < 0.05 considered as significant.

### Autoimmune thyroiditis in antinuclear antibody positive children without rheumatologic disease [^111Yg8y5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Results

Two-hundred and thirty-eight patients were referred for a positive ANA and were judged not to have an underlying connective tissue disease by a pediatric rheumatologist from August 2003 to March 2007. Of these patients, 104 had thyroid antibodies (ATG and ATPO) and thyroid function studies (TSH and FT4) evaluated. The demographic, clinical and laboratory features of these 104 patients are displayed in Table 1. Ninety-three percent were Caucasian, 88% were female, and the mean age was 11.9 ± 4.0 years. Arthralgia was the most common complaint (52%). Positive thyroid antibodies were found in 31/104 (30%) of the patients. ATG was detected in 29% (30/104), ATPO in 21% (22/104) of the patients, and both antibodies were positive in 68% (21/31) of the anti-body positive patients. Ninety six percent of ATG-positive patients also produced ATPO, and 70% of ATPO-patients produced ATG.

Immunofluorescence is a basic method for detection of autoantibodies in serum. It is used as screening for people with symptoms suggesting autoimmune process and disease. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) assay detecting antibodies against nuclear proteins used commonly for diagnosis of systemic autoimmune disease, although antibodies against cytoplasmic components and mitotic structures are usable in clinic. The majority of ANA nuclear patterns have been comprehensively studied with increasing data. However, the cytoplasmic and mitotic patterns are underestimated and still require further assessment. In this review the clinical associations and significance of uncommon types of autoantibodies are presented and discussed.

### Autoimmune thyroiditis in antinuclear antibody positive children without rheumatologic disease [^117Q1CZe]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Children are commonly referred to a pediatric rheumatology center for the laboratory finding of an Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) of undetermined significance. Previous studies regarding adult rheumatology patients have supported an association between ANA and anti-thyroid antibodies, with the prevalence of thyroid antibodies being significantly higher in patients referred to a rheumatology center for an ANA without evidence of connective tissue disease compared to the general population. The purpose of the present study was to determine the frequency of thyroid antibodies in children referred to a pediatric rheumatology center for a positive ANA without evidence of a connective tissue disease.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on children who were referred to our pediatric rheumatology center between August 2003 and March 2007 for positive ANA with concurrent thyroid antibody and thyroid function tests performed who did not fulfill criteria for a specific connective tissue disease. Laboratory and clinical features were recorded and analyzed. Mean and standard deviation were used to describe continuous data. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare proportions between variables.

Results

One-hundred and four ANA-positive patients with concurrent thyroid studies were evaluated (88% female, 93% Caucasian, mean age 11.9 ± 4.0 years). Half of patients had an ANA titer ≥ 1:320. The ANA pattern was speckled in 60% of the patients. Thyroid antibodies were detected in 30% of the patients. Anti-Thyroglobulin (ATG) was detected in 29% and Anti-thyroid peroxidase (ATPO) in 21% of the patients; of these children, 14% had hypothyroidism. ANA pattern and titer were not associated with anti-thyroid antibody positivity.

Conclusion

Thyroid antibodies associated with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, ATG and ATPO, were detected significantly higher in ANA-positive children without a rheumatologic condition (30%) as compared to the general pediatric population (1.3–3.4%). ANA titer and pattern did not help predict the presence or absence of thyroid antibodies. Given the high frequency of thyroid antibodies and increased risk of developing hypothyroidism over time, routine evaluation of ATG and ATPO with thyroid function tests in ANA-positive children is recommended.

### Autoimmune thyrotoxicosis: diagnostic challenges [^1119Vczp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Autoimmune thyrotoxicosis or Graves' disease (GD) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States (full text available online: http://education.amjmed.com/pp1/249). GD occurs more often in women (ratio 5:1) and has a population prevalence of 1–2%. A genetic determinant to the susceptibility to GD is suspected because of familial clustering of the disease, a high sibling recurrence risk, and the familial occurrence of thyroid autoantibodies. GD is a systemic autoimmune thyroid disorder characterized by the infiltration of immune effector cells and thyroid-antigen-specific T cells into the thyroid and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) expressing tissues, i.e. orbit, skin, with the production of autoantibodies to well-defined thyroidal antigens. Stimulatory autoantibodies in GD activate the TSHR leading to thyroid hyperplasia and unregulated thyroid hormone production and secretion. Diagnosis of GD is straightforward in a patient with a diffusely enlarged, heterogeneous, hypervascular (increased Doppler flow on neck ultrasound) thyroid gland, associated orbitopathy, biochemically confirmed thyrotoxicosis, positive TSHR autoantibodies, and often a family history of autoimmune disorders.

### Autoantibodies in early seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, before and during disease modifying antirheumatic drug treatment [^114NtSVg]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Autoantibodies observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during clinical trials of immunomodulating agents may cause concern about possible induction of autoimmunity by the therapeutic intervention. We determined the frequency and variability of selected autoantibodies in patients with early rheumatoid factor (RF) positive RA during a prospective observational study.

Method

The study cohort consisted of 276 patients with active RA and with RF ≥ 40 IU, who were enrolled between January 1, 1993, and April 1, 2000, before starting disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy (average duration of symptoms, 7 mo). During an average of 3.5 years followup, a panel of autoantibodies was determined at entry, 6 months, 12 months, and yearly thereafter, in addition to routine clinical, radiographic, and laboratory assessments. After enrollment, patients were treated with DMARD at the discretion of their rheumatologists.

Results

At entry before any DMARD therapy, antinuclear antibody (ANA; by HEp-2) values were negative in 31%, borderline (8 IU/ml) in 26%, and > 8 (mean 65.5 IU/ml) in 41%. Tender and swollen joint counts, Disease Activity Score, and RF values were significantly higher in those with ANA > 8. During followup 726 paired serial specimens were available; 12.5% changed from negative to positive ANA and 12.3% from positive to negative. Additional autoantibodies were present in specimens of 20% of the subjects; 8% had 2 and 1.4% had 3 other autoantibodies. Anti-dsDNA was detected in 13 (5.5%) patients; 4 changed from negative to positive and one from positive to negative. SSA IgG and SSB IgG autoantibodies were both present in one of these patients. Ribosomal P protein autoantibodies were noted in 2 other patients, but Sm (Smith) and uRNP/snRNP IgG autoantibodies were not present in any patient. No patient had a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Antithyroid peroxidase (20 patients), parietal cell (15), smooth muscle (14), reticulin (9), mitochondrial (5), striational (2), SSB (2) and SCL-70 (1) autoantibodies were detected in some specimens. Seven patients were diagnosed with hypothyroidism, one with chronic thyroiditis, one with hepatitis C, and 9 with malignancies.

Conclusion

In patients with early RF positive RA the frequent occurrence of autoantibodies before and during treatment with standard DMARD may make it difficult to attribute their presence to new therapies.

Outcome and determinants

The outcome of interest in this study was the ever occurrence of symptomatic AITD (Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease and non-specified AITD). This outcome (yes/no) was evaluated for all patients from two sources: free-text fields for comorbidity reporting at registration into Pharmachild and AE forms. AEs in Pharmachild are reported using the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding system (version 22) with a three-level monitoring check for consistency by the treating physician, medical monitor (JS) and PRINTO certified MedDRA coders. The following MedDRA preferred terms were considered as AITD: "hypothyroidism", "autoimmune thyroiditis", "thyroiditis", "hyperthyroidism" and "Basedow's disease". Goiter and congenital thyroid disorder were not considered as AITD. Laboratory results were not considered for determining AITD, since these were likely to involve subclinical cases. All mentions of possible AITD cases were retrieved and reviewed by one researcher (LB) and event descriptions were subsequently independently evaluated by two other researchers (JS and JvS). In order to explore the coexistence of endocrinopathies, mentions of growth retardation/short stature, diabetes mellitus and celiac disease were retrieved from both free-text comorbidity reports and AE forms. For this assessment, the following mentions were included: "growth retardation", "growth retarded", "short stature", "stature short", "coeliac disease", "celiac disease", "type 1 diabetes mellitus", "diabetes", "type I diabetes mellitus" and "diabetes mellitus insulin-dependent". In addition, the following patient characteristics were collected for all patients: sex, ethnicity, age at JIA onset, ILAR category, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) status, rheumatoid factor (RF) status, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 status, family history of autoimmune disease and AITD (in first, second and/or third-degree relatives), observation period (time from JIA onset until last Pharmachild visit), the number of active joints at JIA diagnosis (max. 12 months later) and drug history at last visit. Ethnicity was reported by the treating physician from a fixed set of categories. For ANA positivity, only one positive ANA test was required. A positive RF status was defined as two positive RF determinations at least 3 months apart. Drugs included were NSAIDs, intraarticular corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, cs- and b-DMARDs.

"Less commonly, hyperthyroidism due to Graves disease has also been described with treatment with ICI, including the manifestation of ophthalmopathy".

Appropriateness is a complex task that can be achieved only by combining the efforts from the laboratory and the clinic, thereby using scientific knowledge, inter-disciplinary consultation and expert clinical investigation.

Thyroid Disorders

BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism, as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue BAVENCIO depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Thyroiditis occurred in 0.2% (4/1854) of patients receiving BAVENCIO, including Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. Thyroiditis did not lead to permanent discontinuation or withholding of BAVENCIO in any patients. No patients with thyroiditis required systemic corticosteroids. Thyroiditis did not resolve in any patients (0/4).

Hyperthyroidism occurred in 0.4% (8/1854) of patients receiving BAVENCIO, including Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Hyperthyroidism did not lead to permanent discontinuation of BAVENCIO in any patients and led to withholding of BAVENCIO in 0.1% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 25% (2/8) of patients with hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 88% (7/8) of the patients. Of the 2 patients in whom BAVENCIO was withheld for hyperthyroidism, 2 reinitiated treatment with BAVENCIO after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence of hyperthyroidism.

### Association between previously unknown connective tissue disease and subclinical hypothyroidism diagnosed during first trimester of pregnancy [^11589w15]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the presence of autoimmune rheumatic disorders among women with autoimmune thyroid disorders diagnosed during the first trimester of pregnancy and subsequent pregnancy outcomes.

Design

Case-control study.

Setting

Tertiary obstetric and gynecologic center.

Patient(S)

Pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Intervention(S)

Clinical, laboratory, ultrasonographic evaluations.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level; antibodies against thyroperoxidase, thyroid globulin and TSH receptor detection; screening for rheumatic symptoms and antinuclear antibodies (ANA); uterine artery pulsatility index evaluation; pregnancy complication onset.

Result(S)

Out of 3,450 women enrolled, 106 (3%) were diagnosed with autoimmune thyroid disorders. ANA were present in 18 (16.9%) of 106 cases and 26 (12.6%) of 206 controls. Of the cases, 28 (26.4%) of 106 reported rheumatic symptoms, 5 of these were diagnosed with Sjögren syndrome or with undefined connective tissue disease. Autoimmune thyroid diseases are statistically significantly associated with a higher risk of preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and overall pregnancy complications compared with controls, with a higher uterine artery pulsatility index, suggesting a defective placentation in thyroid disorders. The effect of ANA-positivity on moderate/severe adverse pregnancy outcomes was statistically significant among the patients with thyroid disorders (9 of 18 as compared to 8 of 88, odds ratio 9.65; 95% confidence interval, 2.613–7.81).

Conclusion(S)

Connective tissue diseases are frequently associated with autoimmune thyroid disorders diagnosed during the first trimester of pregnancy. Thyroid autoimmunity and ANA positivity independently increased the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Introduction: Juvenile Idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a type of chronic arthritis that affects the synovium and tissues in joints. It develops in about 1 child in every 1000. Other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) are more common in JIA patients compared to the general population, however there are limited studies that approach this coexistence.

Results: A previously healthy 10 year- old girl presented to the general pediatrics consult with complaint of poor school and physical performance, palpitations and fatigue for about 6 months. Important family history included Hashimoto's thyroiditis (mother), antiphospholipid syndrome (mother) and vitiligo (father). On physical examination goiter and tachycardia were found so she was referred to the endocrinology consult where she presented elevated free T3 (> 20pg/ml), T3 (582.6 ng/dL) and decreased TSH (< 0.05 μUI/mL). Thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) were positive (4.04 UI/L) and diagnosis of Graves' disease was made. About a week after, she developed joint pain in elbow, hip and knee, presenting to the rheumatology clinic with positive pullhair sign, goiter, exophthalmos and bilateral wrist, carpus and interphalangeal arthritis. Blood tests revealed normocytic normochromic anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and negative VDRL and direct Coombs tests; positive IgM reumathoid factor (100 U/mL) and reticular pattern antinuclear antibodies (1:320). Anti dsDNA, Sm, RNP, cardiolipin, beta2-gylcoprotein and lupus anticoagulant antibodies were all negative. Polyarticular AIJ diagnosis was made and treatment was started with methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, folic acid and vitamin D3. She demonstrated a good clinical course presenting resolution of symptoms.

Thyroid Disorders

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement or medical management as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Thyroiditis

OPDIVO as a Single Agent

Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (12/1994) of patients receiving OPDIVO as a single agent, including Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse reactions. Thyroiditis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in no patients and withholding of OPDIVO in 0.2% of patients.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 17% (2/12) of patients with thyroiditis. Thyroiditis resolved in 58% of the 12 patients. Of the 3 patients in whom OPDIVO was withheld for thyroiditis, 1 reinitiated OPDIVO after symptom improvement without recurrence of thyroiditis.

Hyperthyroidism

OPDIVO as a Single Agent

Hyperthyroidism occurred in 2.7% (54/1994) of patients receiving OPDIVO as a single agent, including Grade 3 (< 0.1%) and Grade 2 (1.2%) adverse reactions. Hyperthyroidism led to the permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in no patients and withholding of OPDIVO in 0.4% of patients.

### Antinuclear antibody testing for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus [^113bfRPo]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory condition that may involve multiple organ systems. Although the antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is positive in nearly every case of SLE, it is not specific for this disease and must be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context. Key features that warrant ANA testing include unexplained multisystem inflammatory disease, symmetric joint pain with inflammatory features, photosensitive rash, and cytopenias. ANA staining patterns and more specific autoantibody testing may be helpful in diagnosis of suspected SLE or ANA-associated disease. For patients with nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise and fatigue, ANA testing is of limited value.

### Monitoring and management of autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis patients treated with alemtuzumab: practical recommendations [^116m4Kw3]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Evaluation for potential hyperthyroidism

If the TSH levels are less than the normal range (< 0.4 mU/L), the TSH testing should be repeated within 4 weeks. Free T4 (normal range, 0.7–1.9 ng/dL), free T3 (normal range, 230–619 pg/dL), and TSH-receptor antibody levels (normal range, ≤ 1.75 IU/L) should also be assessed, with tests of free T4 and/or free T3 repeated every 4–6 weeks until levels return to normal, or treatment/referral to a specialist is indicated. Slightly low TSH levels (0.2–0.4 mU/L) with normal free T4 and free T3 levels are consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism, and TSH can be monitored. If the patient is symptomatic with palpitations or tremor or has tachycardia, treatment with a beta-blocker may be initiated immediately (while waiting for results). Often larger doses are required for treatment of hyperthyroidism (e.g. propranolol, 80 mg daily) than might be used for heart disease or hypertension.

Overt hyperthyroidism is suspected if TSH is suppressed with elevated free T4 and/or free T3 (Fig. 2). If the patient has a positive TSH-receptor antibody titer, then a diagnosis of Graves' disease is confirmed, whereas a negative result suggests a diagnosis of painless thyroiditis. An alternative method of distinguishing Graves' disease from painless thyroiditis is with a nuclear medicine thyroid radioiodine uptake test, although the use of TSH-receptor antibody in place of thyroid nuclear scans is recommended based on lower cost and a shorter turnaround time. Overt hyperthyroidism on the basis of Graves' disease should prompt a referral to an endocrinologist for management, which may include anti-thyroid medications, radioiodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. Painless thyroiditis or subclinical hyperthyroidism may be followed by monthly TSH and free T4 monitoring until progression to overt hyperthyroidism and/or spontaneous normalization of results, whereupon resuming TSH testing every 3 months can continue.

Hyperthyroidism is a common condition with a global prevalence of 0·2–1·3%. When clinical suspicion of hyperthyroidism arises, it should be confirmed by biochemical tests (eg, low TSH, high free thyroxine [FT 4], or high free tri-iodothyonine [FT 3]). If hyperthyroidism is confirmed by biochemical tests, a nosological diagnosis should be done to find out which disease is causing the hyperthyroidism. Helpful tools are TSH-receptor antibodies, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, thyroid ultrasonography, and scintigraphy. Hyperthyroidism is mostly caused by Graves' hyperthyroidism (70%) or toxic nodular goitre (16%). Hyperthyroidism can also be caused by subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (3%) and drugs (9%) such as amiodarone, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Disease-specific recommendations are given. Currently, Graves' hyperthyroidism is preferably treated with antithyroid drugs. However, recurrence of hyperthyroidism after a 12–18 month course of antithyroid drugs occurs in approximately 50% of patients. Being younger than 40 years, having FT 4 concentrations that are 40 pmol/L or higher, having TSH-binding inhibitory immunoglobulins that are higher than 6 U/L, and having a goitre size that is equivalent to or larger than WHO grade 2 before the start of treatment with antithyroid drugs increase risk of recurrence. Long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs (ie, 5–10 years of treatment) is feasible and associated with fewer recurrences (15%) than short-term treatment (ie, 12–18 months of treatment). Toxic nodular goitre is mostly treated with radioiodine (131 I) or thyroidectomy and is rarely treated with radiofrequency ablation. Destructive thyrotoxicosis is usually mild and transient, requiring steroids only in severe cases. Specific attention is given to patients with hyperthyroidism who are pregnant, have COVID-19, or have other complications (eg, atrial fibrillation, thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, and thyroid storm). Hyperthyroidism is associated with increased mortality. Prognosis might be improved by rapid and sustained control of hyperthyroidism. Innovative new treatments are expected for Graves' disease, by targeting B cells or TSH receptors.

Hypothyroidism after ICI — sex distribution, onset window, and autoimmunity: "Hypothyroidism is more common in women, with a ratio of 3:2". It "can develop either after thyrotoxicosis due to thyroiditis or de novo", and "The onset of hypothyroidism is variable and may occur between 1 and 9 months after the initiation of ICI therapy, although later onset has also been described". "Several studies have reported the association among thyroid autoimmunity, thyroid autoantibodies (thyroperoxidase or thyroglobulin) detected at the baseline, and the subsequent risk of ICI-induced thyroid dysfunction", and "increased thyroid antibody titers and de novo positivity with ICI therapy (anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1)" have been observed.

Table 1
Candidate diagnostic biomarkers for SLE

Other soluble mediators also have potential to detect patients with immune activation in preclinical stages. Some of these may appear even before autoantibodies are measurable. The B cell stimulator BlyS, for example, shows elevated levels in patients with ILE, though lower than the levels in SLE, suggesting an intermediate and possibly evolving stage of B cell activation. Many other circulating cytokines are dysregulated prior to onset of SLE, though not all of these are disease specific. The signature that reflects activation by Type I interferon, for example, is typical of SLE but is also present in patients with RA. A disease-specific preclinical cytokine cocktail has not been described.

Complement activation, which is the basis for the AVISE test, is an immune feature that has relatively greater specificity for SLE compared with other autoimmune conditions, such as RA or autoimmune thyroid disorders, that contribute to ANA positivity. Furthermore, activation of complement is associated with organ damage, especially lupus nephritis. It therefore follows that measurement of CBCAPs has potential to distinguish which ANA-positive individuals are at risk for development of more serious disease. A recent report suggests that patients with newly diagnosed SLE have significantly greater prevalence of hypocomplementemia than patients with conditions that mimic SLE, including undifferentiated connective tissue disease. The patients in this study were collected in clinics staffed by experts in SLE diagnosis and management, which increases the likelihood that disease features would be recognised or measured. Whether AVISE or other tests would be sufficiently informative to risk-stratify ANA-positive patients who are seen in primary practice settings prior to specialty evaluation remains untested.

The field of SLE diagnostics is clearly moving forward at a rapid pace. New test platforms using multiplex approaches are in development for many applications in SLE, including prediction of flare and quantitation of disease activity. In addition to these tests that will help manage patients with established SLE, the need for early risk assessment tools is currently unmet. Most reported studies described here have been carried out in academic rheumatology clinics or specialty practices, rather than at the primary care frontier where the ANA-positive patient, often without any SLE-specific symptoms, is first seen. Bringing testing to this interface will be a necessary step for development of a useful tool to accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of SLE.

### Hyperthyroidism [^116LBLwf]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis causes a variety of symptoms and adverse health outcomes. Hyperthyroidism refers to increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, most commonly from Graves' disease or toxic nodular goitre, whereas thyroiditis (typically autoimmune, viral, or drug induced) causes thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis is based on suppressed serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), accompanied by free thyroxine and total or free tri-iodothyronine concentrations, which are raised (overt hyperthyroidism) or within range (subclinical hyperthyroidism). The underlying cause is determined by clinical assessment, detection of TSH-receptor antibodies and, if necessary, radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy. Treatment options for hyperthyroidism include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy, whereas thyroiditis is managed symptomatically or with glucocorticoid therapy. In Graves' disease, first-line treatment is a 12–18-month course of antithyroid drugs, whereas for goitre, radioactive iodine or surgery are preferred for toxic nodules or goitres. Evidence also supports long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs as an option for patients with Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre.

### Challenges in the standardization of autoantibody testing: a comprehensive review [^113B6hD9]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Standardization and harmonization are complementary tools to achieve higher testing quality in laboratory medicine. Both are of great relevance and are strongly needed in autoimmune diagnostics, due to the impressive advance in basic research and technological development observed in this diagnostic field in recent years that has led to the introduction of many new tests and new analytical methods. It is, therefore, essential that this strong innovative thrust is translated into clinical practice in a coordinated way to avoid confusion and the risk of potentially harmful errors for the patient. However, while standardization of antibody assays is a very complex task, harmonization of procedures and behaviors is a more feasible target and should necessarily include all the phases of the total testing process-in the pre-analytical phase, appropriateness of test requests, harmonization of autoantibody terminology, and adoption of uniform nomenclature for laboratory tests; in the analytical phase, harmonization of measurements, and sharing of test profiles and diagnostic algorithms; and in the post-analytical phase, harmonization of data reporting, and criteria for interpreting immunoserological results, especially harmonization of units, reference intervals, decision limits, and definition and notification of critical values. We here provide and discuss some examples of harmonization initiatives related to anti-nuclear antibodies, TSH receptor, and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies and to antibodies associated with autoimmune hepatitis and with celiac disease. These initiatives could be the starting steps to achieve a wider consensus and a closer interaction among stakeholders in the path of autoimmune diagnostics harmonization to enhance clinical effectiveness and provide greater patient safety.

Hazard ratios for comorbid hypothyroidism in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) compared to references. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for hypothyroidism within the first 7 years after JIA diagnosis using conditional Cox proportional hazard regression models. In all analyses, the individuals in the JIA cohort were compared to age- and sex matched references without JIA. Associations with hypothyroidism were calculated in the four subgroups; individuals belonging to antinuclear antibodies (ANA) positive JIA, ANA negative JIA, ANA positive JIA with onset before the age of six, and JIA with treatment with any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) within the following calendar year after JIA diagnosis. The bars illustrate the 95% CIs with markers for HR. Number of individuals with comorbid hypothyroidism in the different analyses were in the JIA cohort; 5 in the total cohort, 3 in the female subgroup, 4 in the ANA positive subgroup, 1 in the ANA negative subgroup, and 2 in the subgroup treated with any DMARD. Corresponding numbers were in the reference population; 6 in the total cohort, 6 in the female subgroup, 1 in the reference subgroup to ANA positive disease, 5 in the reference subgroup to ANA negative disease, and 2 in the reference subgroup to treatment with any DMARD. Data on hypothyroidism in males as well as ANA positive disease with onset before the age of six are not presented as there were too few events (n = 2 and 0, respectively) for these subgroup analyses. Significant differences were found in the total JIA population, and in the subgroup of individuals with ANA positive JIA

### Frequency of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in Graves' disease patients treated with methimazole [^117EhjaV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Retrospective studies have shown antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positivity in patients treated for Graves' hyperthyroidism; ANCA has been attributed to either antithyroid drugs or to the disease itself. The aim of this study was to determine ANCA in Graves' disease patients at diagnosis and after treatment with methimazole and to evaluate the relationship between ANCA and hyperthyroidism evolution. Thirty patients recently diagnosed with Graves' hyperthyroidism were prospectively studied. ANCA were determined by indirect immunofluorescence. ANCA autoantibodies against specific antigens (proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), cathepsin, lysozyme, elastase, and lactoferrin) were detected by ELISA. The median observation period was 22 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to identify ANCA as an outcome variable. Twenty patients (67%) were ANCA positive before the onset of treatment, and four (19%) remained positive after 1 yr of antithyroid drug treatment. No differences were observed in any clinical or analytical features between patients with or without positive ANCA. Before treatment, BPI-positive patients required radioiodine treatment or presented relapse more rapidly than BPI-negative patients (log-rank test P < 0.0002). Patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism show positive ANCA before medical treatment, which points to a relationship with the autoimmune disease itself. Our results suggest that BPI-positive patients tend to relapse with antithyroid medication.

Results and discussion

Demographic data were collected, as were the results of in vivo and in vitro tests performed at our clinic or in central laboratories (see Fig E1 and Table E1 in this article's Online Repository at). An anti-TPO level of 35 IU/mL or higher was considered high, a total IgE level less than 40 IU/mL was considered low, and an antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1:160 titer or higher was considered to be a positive ANA test result. ASST was performed as described. Autoimmune diseases were present in 67 of the patients with CSU (16.9%), with Hashimoto thyroiditis being the most common (Fig E2 in this article's Online Repository at).

On the basis of the data from a preliminary analysis (described in detail in the Online Repository at) and available literature, we categorized patients as having type I CSU if they presented with at least 1 of the following criteria: associated allergic disease, total IgE level of 40 UI/mL or higher, and a positive result of skin tests to inhalant allergen(s). Patients were categorized as having type IIb CSU if they presented with at least 1 of these features: autoimmune disease, low total IgE level (< 40 IU/mL), positive ASST result, positive antinuclear antibody test result (titer of 1:160 or higher), and elevated anti-TPO level. Patients were categorized as having type I/type IIb overlap CSU if they presented with at least 1 marker of both type I and type IIb CSU, and they were categorized as having non–type I/type IIb CSU if they presented with none of the markers of either type I or type IIb CSU.

### Screening for comorbid autoimmune disease should be considered in children with ANA positive juvenile idiopathic arthritis-results from the south-Swedish juvenile idiopathic arthritis cohort [^113kHz2L]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 3.3% of the individuals in our JIA cohort, which was significantly more often compared to the reference population within the first 7 years after JIA diagnosis. The presence of hypothyroidism in our study was lower than in a previously published Italian study (10.1%), but higher than numbers reported from Finland (0.7%). Our restriction to only include autoimmune conditions diagnosed post JIA diagnosis, contrary to the Italian study, may have contributed to different prevalence of hypothyroidism between the two study populations. More importantly, in the Italian study the patients were actively screened for autoimmune comorbidity with blood test, thereby possibly diagnosing also subclinical, asymptomatic patients. Hypothyroidism is also more common in the adult than paediatric population and since our cohort is diagnosed 2000–2010, only a minor portion of the individuals were in their 30'ies at the end of the study period. A longer follow-up period can potentially increase the prevalence. In line with the Pharmachild registry study exploring predictors of autoimmune thyroid disease, individuals with ANA had an increased risk for hypothyroidism in our study.

Our finding of increased risk of autoimmune disease in ANA positive individuals with JIA compared to ANA negative is supported by other studies showing increased presence of ANA in autoimmune thyroid disease. The mechanism behind the occurrence of ANA is not known, and ANA can be considered a general marker of autoimmune processes since many autoimmune diseases share common genes and pathophysiological processes. The increased risk in the ANA positive group might also reflect the paediatric distinction of this JIA subgroup compared to the other JIA subgroups with adult counterparts. This hypothesis is supported by the significantly increased risk of autoimmune comorbidities in the newly suggested JIA subgroup with ANA positive disease with early onset in our study.

Interestingly, our study further emphasises a specifically increased risk of coeliac disease in individuals with ANA positive disease. To our knowledge, the association with ANA to the risk of comorbid coeliac disease in other autoimmune diseases has been analysed in two previous studies, indicating no increased risk of coeliac disease in ANA positive JIA or ANA positive autoimmune thyroid disease.

### Autoimmune markers in screening for orbital inflammatory disease [^115R6PfQ]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Choice of autoimmune markers in the diagnostic approach of orbital inflammation should be guided by clinico-radiological presentation. Elevated ACE levels reportedly occurs in 60–90% of active sarcoidosis, with levels generally proportional to severity. Thus, normal ACE levels may not distinguish between less active and absent disease. Furthermore, systemic disease may subsequently be revealed in 9–50% of patients, but ACE levels may remain normal. ACE may also be increased in other conditions, such as orbital lymphoma and NSOI. Elevated ACE levels are reportedly a predictor of positive yield on biopsy. Tissue biopsy should be obtained in patients with supportive clinico-radiological features and elevated serum ACE, as was evident in our cases.

Within our study, ANA had limited discriminatory value between specific and non-specific disease. Although ANA positivity is reported in 59–85% of SS patients, both SS patients in our study had negative ANA, albeit in a small represented sample. ANA is a poor screening test for primary SS, as 23% have ANA negativity and 9% have a negative ANA and ENA. Positive ANA may also occur in other autoimmune and non-rheumatic diseases, and are detectable in up to 20–30% of healthy adults, with significantly elevated levels observed in 2.5% of the general population. Although, patients may exhibit positive ANA years before a diagnosis of autoimmune disease, studies have reported that many ANA-positive patients do not have autoimmune disease nor do they have an increased likelihood of future autoimmune disease. Furthermore, although thyroid eye disease was excluded from this study, interpretation of ANA should also consider autoimmune thyroid disease, as ANA positivity may also occur in these cases. Thus, thyroid function tests should be considered alongside any indicated autoimmune markers.

### Paraclinical serum markers as aids in the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis [^117HNc7L]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Expert opinion suggests the presence ANA and thyroid antibodies may be helpful to diagnosis autoimmune encephalitis (AE). This study investigates the sensitivity of these serum markers in a cohort of 26 patients with AE. TPO-Ab, TG-Ab and ANA (titer ≥ 1:320) were present in 45%, 35% and 32% of patients tested, respectively. The prevalence of TPO-Ab (11.3%), TG-Ab (10.4%) and ANA ≥ 1:320 (3.3%) has been previously reported in disease-free populations. Although these antibodies represent non-specific markers of autoimmunity, this study demonstrated that TPO-Ab, TG-Ab and ANA were significantly elevated in AE compared to disease-free populations (p < .001, p = .003, p < .001, respectively).

Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are a serological hallmark of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD) such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While a number of ANA patterns detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) have diagnostic significance, autoantibodies producing the dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern have been reported to be more prevalent in healthy individuals than in SARD.

Methods

Sequential samples submitted for ANA testing were screened for anti-DFS antibodies by IIF (n = 3263). Samples with the DFS pattern were tested for anti-DFS70/lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) antibodies by ELISA and by a novel chemiluminescence assay (CIA, Quanta Flash DFS70). Sera from patients with various diseases and healthy individuals were tested for anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies by CIA. A cohort of 251 patients with SLE was used to analyze serological and clinical associations of anti-DFS70 antibodies.

Results

The frequency of anti-DFS antibodies by IIF was 1.62%. The prevalence of anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies as detected by CIA in the different cohorts was 8.9% in healthy individuals, 2.8% in SLE, 2.6% in rheumatoid arthritis, 4.0% in asthma, 5.0% in interstitial cystitis, 1.7% in Graves' disease, and 6.0% in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Of note, the prevalence of anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies was significantly higher in healthy individuals compared to patients with SARD (p = 0.00085). In SLE results, anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies were not significantly associated with clinical features or other autoantibodies typically found in SLE. Only 1/7 SLE sera showed anti-DFS70/LEDGF, but no other autoantibody reactivity.

Conclusion

"Monospecific" anti-DFS70/LEDGF antibodies may represent a biomarker for differentiating SARD from non-SARD individuals, but there is a need for a reliable assay to ensure reactivity to DFS70.

### Autoimmune diseases in vitiligo: do anti-nuclear antibodies decrease thyroid volume? [^1169eKJ3]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

An increased prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis (AT) in vitiligo patients is well known. The aim of this study was firstly, to evaluate the clinical course of patients with both vitiligo and AT and secondly, to identify additional autoimmune disorders affecting the thyroid gland in a large cohort of vitiligo patients. We analysed a study group of 106 vitiligo patients and 38 controls. A detailed thyroid examination including sonography was performed in all study participants. In addition, the study participants were HLA typed and screened for various autoimmune disorders. AT was significantly more frequent in vitiligo patients than in controls (21%versus 3%; P < 0.01). In 12 of the 22 patients with AT, vitiligo was the initial disease preceding AT by 4–35 years. In the other 10 patients with AT, both vitiligo and AT were diagnosed within one year. There were two individuals with diabetes mellitus type 1 and a single patient with Addison's disease. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth muscle cell antibody, and parietal cell antibody levels occurred with a similar frequency in patients and controls. In all vitiligo patients with both elevated ANA levels and AT (n = 6), the atrophic but not the goitrous variant was diagnosed. These vitiligo patients with both AT and elevated ANA levels had a significantly smaller thyroid volume compared to the vitiligo patients with AT whose ANA levels were normal (6.7 ± 4.5 mL versus 13.4 ± 9.1 ml, respectively; P < 0.05). The same was found in the entire study group: Thyroid volume of all vitiligo patients (with or without concomitant AT) was significantly smaller in the presence of ANA (6.9 ± 5.3 versus 10.5 ± 5.9 ml, respectively; P < 0.05). However, this phenomenon was not observed in the control group. There was a trend for a decreased frequency of HLA-DR3 (6.7%versus 23%) in our study group, but after correction for the number of comparisons, no HLA-allele was statistically significant associated neither with vitiligo nor with multiple autoimmune diseases in our patient sample. Our findings suggest that AT is the most frequent autoimmune disease associated with vitiligo. In our patients, AT presented simultaneously or after the onset of vitiligo but not before. Elevated ANA levels were associated with the atrophic variant of AT and may affect the volume of the thyroid gland, and there was no statistically significant association with the HLA system.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^111RAXV8]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and antibody testing — AITDs are estimated to be 5–10 times more common in women than men, and in the Whickham survey 5% of women and 1% of men had both positive antibody tests and a serum TSH value > 6; many patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis are biochemically euthyroid, but approximately 75% have elevated anti-thyroid antibody titers; in NHANES, thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) were positive in 10.4% and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) in 11.3%, were more common in women and increased with age, and only positive TPOAb tests were significantly associated with hypothyroidism; elevated TPOAb in subclinical hypothyroidism predicts progression to overt hypothyroidism at 4.3% per year versus 2.6% per year without elevated TPOAb titers; several professional societies and many clinical endocrinologists endorse measurement of TPOAbs in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, and in patients with a diffuse, firm goiter, TPOAb should be measured to identify autoimmune thyroiditis.

### Screening for comorbid autoimmune disease should be considered in children with ANA positive juvenile idiopathic arthritis-results from the south-Swedish juvenile idiopathic arthritis cohort [^117RXm75]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no consensus or clinical guidelines for screening routines of autoimmune disease in individuals with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), since results are conflicting whether the risk for such conditions is increased or not among individuals with JIA. The aim of this study was to investigate if the frequency of comorbid autoimmune conditions is increased after JIA diagnosis in a validated population-based JIA cohort in southern Sweden.

Methods

Autoimmune comorbidities were evaluated in a pre-existing population-based JIA cohort of 302 participants, constituting of individuals diagnosed with a validated JIA diagnosis 2000–2010 in southern Sweden. The comorbidities were determined through analysis of diagnosis codes registered after the JIA diagnosis and until 2019. With the use of a reference population of 1510 age- and sex matched individuals, hazard ratios (HR) were calculated with Cox proportional models.

Results

During the study period, 7.7% of the JIA cohort received an autoimmune diagnosis after their JIA diagnosis. Individuals with JIA had an increased risk of autoimmune diseases in general (HR 4.11, 95% CI 2.13–7.91) within the first 7 years of disease, as well as separately for coeliac disease (HR 5.24, 95% CI 1.76–15.65) and hypothyroidism (HR 3.74, 95% CI 1.14–12.30) compared to the reference population. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity was associated with a significantly increased risk of comorbid autoimmune disease in the JIA cohort, with HR 6.21 (95% CI 1.64–23.55) for ANA positive individuals.

Conclusions

Individuals with JIA have a significantly increased risk of being diagnosed with an autoimmune condition after receiving their JIA diagnosis compared to matched references. ANA positivity is associated with a further increased risk. Our results emphasize awareness in physicians of additional autoimmune disorders in individuals with JIA and advocate serological screening of autoimmune conditions during follow-up.

Imaging

In most cases, the biochemical and immunological findings will be sufficient to diagnose GD. Imaging should, however, be considered in cases where thyroid antibodies are negative or where there is a nodule or nodularity apparent on thyroid gland palpation. Ultrasonography is preferred over scintigraphy to avoid radiation exposure. Thyroid ultrasonography with Doppler blood flow assessment often displays an enlarged, hyperechoic, hypervascular thyroid gland, while scintigraphy shows uniform uptake of isotope and diffuse enlargement of both thyroid lobes. Imaging will also help identify the non-autoimmune causes of hyperthyroidism, such as an autonomous 'hot' nodule.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study population and design

The All of Us Research Program is a cohort study aiming to enroll 1,000,000 participants with genomic data linked with environmental surveys and electronic health records (EHRs). As of the latest data release (version 7), All of Us included 312,925 and 245,388 individuals with genotyping and whole‐genome sequencing data, respectively. For the GWAS analysis, we selected participants who had genotyping data available and a positive ANA test in their EHR by immunofluorescence (IF) as defined by the performing laboratory, or if titer data are available, a titer greater than 1:80 (Supplementary List 1). We excluded individuals who had one positive ANA test but subsequently had a negative test by IF or enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We did not include individuals who only had a positive ANA by ELISA in this study (n = 225). Individuals with any clinical code for autoimmune diseases or prescription for an immunosuppressive medication in their EHR from both the cohorts who were ANA positive and who were ANA negative were also excluded (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary List 2). We then conducted a sensitivity analysis by restricting the sample to individuals with available titer data and ANA titers greater than 1:160, to assess whether higher ANA titers are associated with genetic signals with a GWAS level of significance.

### Titre and affinity of propylthiouracil-induced anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies are closely associated with the development of clinical vasculitis [^115fK6Yr]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Substantial evidences suggested that propylthiouracil (PTU) could induced anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies in sera from patients with hyperthyroidism, however, only a subgroup of the PTU-induced anti-MPO antibody positive patients developed clinical evident vasculitis. The aim of this study is to compare the titres and affinities of PTU induced anti-MPO antibodies in sera from patients with hyperthyroidism with and without clinical vasculitis. Anti-MPO antibody positive sera from patients diagnosed hyperthyroidism with (n = 13) and without (n = 14) clinical evident vasculitis were collected. The titre was determined by MPO-ELISA and expressed as logarithm value (lgT). The affinity constant (aK) of anti-MPO IgG was measured by antigen inhibition assay. The titre and aK values were compared between patients with and without vasculitis. In patients with vasculitis, the mean lgT of anti-MPO antibodies was 3.62 ± 0.66; the median aK was 4.47 x 10(7)M(-1). In patients without vasculitis, the mean lgT was 2.54 ± 0.29; the median aK was 0.14 x 10(7)M(-1), and both were significant lower than those in patients with vasculitis (t = 5.464; P = 0.000 & z = -4.373; P = 0.000, respectively). We concluded that the titre and affinity of anti-MPO antibodies might be associated with the development of clinical vasculitis in patients with PTU-induced ANCA.

### Don't order antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear… [^113MEpFB]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Testing for antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear antigen should be avoided in the investigation of widespread pain or fatigue alone. Instead, testing should be performed only in patients suspected to have a diagnosis of a connective tissue disease. ANA positivity can be as high as 20% in patients with nonrheumatic conditions and healthy individuals. For this reason, proper pretest probability is important, and false-positive results may lead to further unnecessary testing. Repeat testing is also not recommended unless the clinical picture changes significantly.

### Don't test antinuclear antibodies (ANA) subserologies… [^117WDZbc]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Tests for ANA subserologies are usually negative if the ANA is negative. Exceptions include anti-Jo1, which can be positive in some forms of myositis, or occasionally, anti-SSA, in the setting of lupus or Sjögren syndrome. Broad testing of autoantibodies should be avoided; instead, the choice of autoantibodies should be guided by the specific disease under consideration.
