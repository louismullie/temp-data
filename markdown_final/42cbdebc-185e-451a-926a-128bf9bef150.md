## Question

I have a genital lesion — should it be tested with a blood test or a swab?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to test a genital lesion, specifically clarifying when to use a lesion swab, when to use a blood test, and when both are needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical differential based on lesion morphology and epidemiology. Then, I should verify which pathogens are best detected by direct lesion testing versus serology. Next, I will delineate scenarios where both lesion and blood tests should be obtained concurrently. After that, I need to check nuances of testing algorithms and timing, including when to repeat tests if early disease is suspected. Finally, I will consider special situations like mpox, chancroid, and warts, and emphasize technique and follow-up serology where applicable [^114zB7Pg] [^115nEEUF].

> Let me first confirm the initial frame: morphology guides the focused differential. Painful clustered vesicles or ulcers point toward HSV; a single indurated, painless chancre suggests primary syphilis; deep painful ulcers with tender inguinal nodes raise chancroid; proctitis or beefy fissuring may suggest LGV; and verrucous, cauliflower-like growths are usually HPV warts, which are typically diagnosed clinically rather than by laboratory tests. Hold on, I should verify that chancroid remains a clinical diagnosis requiring exclusion of syphilis and HSV with appropriate tests and that LGV workup prioritizes lesion or site-specific swabs, which it does per CDC and EADV guidance [^116gVNFj] [^11257c3A] [^1163zDE3] [^114CHrs2].

> For active vesicular or ulcerative lesions suggestive of HSV, I need to ensure I prioritize a lesion swab NAAT as the first-line diagnostic test, because HSV PCR from the lesion is the most sensitive and allows typing. Wait, let me verify the preferred specimen and test: AAFP 2024 confirms that type-specific viral PCR from lesions is the preferred confirmatory test, and broader lab reviews agree that nucleic acid–based tests outperform culture and cytology. So, swab the lesion base vigorously and send for HSV-1/2 PCR with typing; this is the right first move when herpes is on the differential [^116zd5PJ] [^11569rZ7] [^117K7Udo].

> Now, for suspected primary syphilis, I should confirm whether a lesion swab for Treponema pallidum is recommended in addition to serology. The BASHH 2024 guideline explicitly recommends molecular testing on lesions where T. pallidum may be present, and dark-ground microscopy can be added where available. Wait, I initially thought blood PCR might be helpful, but I need to double-check that — data show poor sensitivity for blood PCR in early syphilis, whereas lesion swab PCR aligns far better with clinical diagnosis. So, lesion-based direct detection is preferred over blood PCR for syphilis at the primary lesion stage, supplemented by serology for staging and follow-up [^116WcRNP] [^117WW5ap] [^117E4Pms].

> I should now outline when blood testing is essential. For syphilis, serologic testing is central: follow an algorithm that uses both a treponemal assay and a quantitative non-treponemal test, with reflex confirmation for discordant results. Hold on, I should verify specifics: IUSTI notes suboptimal specificity of chemiluminescence or EIAs in low-prevalence settings and advises confirmatory TPPA/TPHA, and they recommend reflex quantitative RPR/VDRL when screening starts with a treponemal assay. WHO 2024 supports dual treponemal/non-treponemal rapid diagnostics as an additional approach. For follow-up, IUSTI recommends serology at 1, 3, and every 6 months thereafter using the same non-treponemal test, and BMJ reminds that RPR trajectory serves as the best practical marker for response since no direct test-of-cure exists. I will now examine how to integrate these into an actionable flow [^114mWtrJ] [^111mVdU3] [^112Ba4FA] [^112PYVeN] [^1179fBnf] [^112dRLSz].

> When should I use both a lesion swab and blood tests together for syphilis suspicion? If there is a typical chancre or high suspicion of very early disease, I should obtain lesion direct detection (PCR or dark-ground microscopy if available) plus serum treponemal and quantitative non-treponemal tests at baseline. Wait, I should double-check early-window guidance: if initial serology is negative but the clinical picture fits syphilis and lesion PCR/DGM is negative, repeat serology after 2 weeks; if treponemal-positive but non-treponemal-negative without signs of very early disease, repeat both at 1 month and ensure a quantitative non-treponemal is done if not initially obtained. This combined approach balances early detection and algorithmic confirmation [^116WcRNP] [^117WW5ap] [^113ALSqd] [^1175xqBw] [^111mVdU3].

> For HSV, when do I add blood testing to a lesion swab? Let me think about edge cases. If PCR from the lesion is negative but clinical suspicion remains, or if lesions are atypical or recurrent without a clear diagnosis, type-specific HSV-2 serology can help, particularly in patients with HIV, frequent recurrences, or high risk. Hold on, let me verify test performance nuances: laboratory reviews highlight variability and potential false positives with some automated assays; thus, results need careful interpretation alongside clinical context and, when possible, confirmation strategies at experienced labs. So, lesion PCR first; add serology selectively when the swab is negative or the presentation is atypical or recurrent [^116D33iw] [^11569rZ7] [^112166oi].

> What about mpox suspected from umbilicated or pseudopustular lesions in the proper epidemiologic context? I should confirm best specimen practice. WHO interim guidance recommends vigorous lesion swabbing and even collecting both dry and VTM swabs to optimize DNA yield; blood is not the primary diagnostic specimen for routine mpox diagnosis. Wait, I should verify that the emphasis remains on lesion-based NAATs, which it does per WHO guidance, so swab the lesion rather than rely on blood for diagnosis in this scenario [^114EkGwY].

> Chancroid is tricky because laboratory capacity is limited in many settings. I need to ensure that a probable diagnosis requires excluding syphilis and HSV with appropriate lesion and serologic testing. CDC criteria specify one or more painful genital ulcers, compatible clinical appearance with tender suppurative nodes if present, negative tests for syphilis (by DFM/NAAT on ulcer exudate or serology after 7–14 days) and negative HSV NAAT or culture from the ulcer. Thus, swab testing is crucial to rule out HSV, and blood plus lesion-based testing are important to exclude syphilis before labeling chancroid as probable [^11257c3A] [^116gVNFj].

> For LGV, I need to check which samples to obtain when ulceration or proctitis is suspected. EADV guidance supports swabs from the ulcer base or rectal mucosa, bubo aspirates if lymphadenopathy is prominent, and first-catch urine or urethral swab as adjuncts. Blood testing is not the primary diagnostic modality for LGV; pathogen detection relies on NAATs from the involved site, so I should prioritize lesion or site-directed swabs rather than serum in this context [^1163zDE3].

> For exophytic warts presumed due to HPV, I should remember that diagnosis is usually clinical and that routine HPV testing of the lesion is not recommended for management; biopsy is reserved for atypical, pigmented, indurated, bleeding, affixed, or ulcerated lesions, or lack of response to therapy. Wait, I almost suggested swabbing for HPV typing, but that would not change management for typical warts; instead, reserve biopsy and histopathology for uncertainty or red flags, consistent with AAFP guidance and the broader HPV laboratory testing literature which is oriented to screening, not lesion diagnosis [^114CHrs2] [^114gA4cc].

> I need to ensure proper specimen technique and practicalities. For any lesion-based NAAT, swab the base after unroofing or gently debriding crust if appropriate, as vigorous sampling increases diagnostic yield; this is explicitly emphasized for mpox and aligns with general molecular testing principles. Let me reconsider self-collection: although self-collection improves access and uptake for several STIs, lesion sampling is typically clinician-collected; still, programmatic evidence shows self-collection can expand testing overall, which may complement comprehensive STI care around a lesion visit, but I should keep lesion swabs clinician-collected for accuracy when feasible [^114EkGwY] [^1159CjLA].

> Putting it together, here is the decision flow I will use: if the lesion is vesicular or ulcerative, obtain a lesion swab NAAT for HSV and consider mpox NAAT if epidemiology and morphology fit; if syphilis is in the differential, do both a lesion direct test for T. pallidum (PCR or DGM where available) and serum treponemal plus quantitative non-treponemal tests at baseline, with scheduled serologic follow-up and repeats if early infection is suspected; if chancroid is possible, ensure HSV and syphilis have been appropriately excluded by lesion and serologic testing before a probable diagnosis; if the lesion is a typical wart, make a clinical diagnosis and reserve biopsy for atypical or refractory cases. Hold on, I should verify the repeat-testing intervals for suspected early syphilis: repeat serology after 2 weeks if an early chancre is suspected with initial negative tests, and repeat discordant treponemal/non-treponemal pairs at 1 month, then follow standard longitudinal serology thereafter. This integrated approach ensures I use a lesion swab when direct detection excels, a blood test when systemic serology is essential, and both when early window periods or confirmatory algorithms demand it [^116zd5PJ] [^116WcRNP] [^117WW5ap] [^113ALSqd] [^1175xqBw] [^1179fBnf] [^114EkGwY] [^114CHrs2] [^11257c3A].

For a genital lesion, **swab the lesion for PCR** to detect HSV [^116zd5PJ], syphilis [^116WcRNP], or mpox [^114EkGwY], as this is the most sensitive and specific method for active infection [^11569rZ7]. Blood testing is not for acute lesions [^11569rZ7] but is used for **serologic confirmation** [^116WcRNP], staging, and follow-up, especially in syphilis [^1179fBnf] [^112dRLSz]. Use lesion swabs for chlamydia/gonorrhea NAAT if discharge is present; reserve blood for HIV, hepatitis B/C, and syphilis serology [^112PYVeN] as part of comprehensive STI screening [^114zB7Pg]. Swab first for acute lesions [^11569rZ7], then add blood tests for confirmation and broader STI assessment [^114zB7Pg].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Initial evaluation

During the initial evaluation, **clinical assessment** should include a thorough history and physical examination to characterize the lesion (e.g. ulcer, vesicle, papule, wart) and assess systemic symptoms and risk factors [^114zB7Pg]. Additionally, collect a **lesion swab** for PCR testing — the most sensitive and specific method for detecting active infections such as HSV [^116zd5PJ], syphilis [^116WcRNP], and mpox [^114EkGwY] [^11569rZ7].

---

### Specific pathogens and recommended tests

| **Pathogen** | **Recommended test** | **Specimen type** | **Clinical indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| HSV | PCR (preferred) | Lesion swab | Vesicular or ulcerative lesions [^116zd5PJ] |
| Syphilis | PCR (preferred) | Lesion swab | Ulcerative lesions (chancre) [^116WcRNP] |
| Mpox | PCR | Lesion swab | Vesicular or pustular lesions [^114EkGwY] |
| Chlamydia/Gonorrhea | NAAT | Lesion swab or discharge | Purulent discharge or urethritis |
| HIV, Hepatitis B/C, Syphilis | Serology | Blood | Comprehensive STI screening [^114zB7Pg] |

---

### Role of blood testing

Blood testing is **not the primary diagnostic method** for acute genital lesions but is essential for [^11569rZ7]:

- **Serologic confirmation** of infections such as syphilis [^111msfK7], HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C [^114zB7Pg].
- **Staging and follow-up**, particularly for syphilis [^111msfK7], to monitor treatment response and disease progression [^112Ba4FA] [^1179fBnf].

---

### Situations requiring both swab and blood testing

Situations requiring both swab and blood testing include **syphilis**, for which a lesion swab PCR provides direct detection [^116WcRNP], while serologic testing (treponemal and non-treponemal) supports confirmation [^111msfK7], staging, and follow-up [^112Ba4FA]. They also include **comprehensive STI screening** [^114zB7Pg], which combines blood tests for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis serology [^112PYVeN] with lesion swabs for direct pathogen detection.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Primary diagnostic method**: Swab the lesion for PCR testing to detect active infections (HSV [^116zd5PJ], syphilis [^116WcRNP], mpox [^114EkGwY]).

- **Secondary diagnostic method**: Use blood testing for serologic confirmation, staging, and follow-up, particularly in syphilis [^111msfK7] and comprehensive STI screening [^114zB7Pg].

- **Comprehensive approach**: Combine swab and blood testing when multiple pathogens are suspected or for complete STI evaluation [^114zB7Pg].

---

Swab the lesion for PCR [^11569rZ7] as the **primary diagnostic method** for acute genital lesions, while blood testing is used for serologic confirmation, staging, and follow-up [^1179fBnf].

### Treponema pallidum detection in lesion and non-lesion sites in men who have sex with men with early syphilis: a prospective, cross-sectional study [^112QcnWU]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Syphilis transmission is increasing, and the precise mechanism by which Treponema pallidum is transmitted sexually from person to person remains unclear. We aimed to determine the frequency of T. pallidum shedding from potentially asymptomatic sites and identify the stage of infection at which shedding is most frequent in men who have sex with men (MSM), a group disproportionately affected by syphilis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study in MSM recruited from the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Men were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, reported sex with men during the past 12 months, and had laboratory-confirmed primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis, in accordance with Australian definitions. Primary and secondary syphilis lesions were swabbed, and non-lesion samples were collected via oral rinse, oral cavity swab, anal canal swab, urine, and semen. Samples were tested for T. pallidum using PCR assays targeting the polA gene (for lesion and non-lesion samples) and the 47 kDa gene (for non-lesion samples only). The primary outcome was the proportion of men with T. pallidum detected from potentially asymptomatic sites, namely the mouth, anus, urethra, and semen.

- **Findings**: Between November 30, 2015, and May 23, 2019, 246 MSM were screened for inclusion. Of these, 200 had serologically confirmed early syphilis and were included in the study: 54 (27%) of 200 had primary syphilis, 93 (47%) had secondary syphilis, and 53 (27%) had early latent syphilis. T. pallidum DNA was detected in 48 (24%; 95% CI 18.3–30.5) of 200 men via oral rinse or oral lesion swab.

### Which algorithm should be used to screen for syphilis [^116KA5EF]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

A growing number of laboratories have implemented a reverse screening algorithm for syphilis testing, which has created confusion among many healthcare providers. This review focuses on recent data addressing the clinical and economical impact of reverse screening and discusses the advantages and limitations of the traditional and contemporary algorithms.

- **Recent findings**: Screening for syphilis using a treponemal assay detects a higher number of patients with reactive results compared to traditional screening by rapid plasma reagin (RPR). Furthermore, a significant percentage of patients who are reactive by a treponemal screening assay are nonreactive by RPR. These discordant results may occur in patients with past treated or untreated syphilis, early syphilis, or no syphilis. Recent reports suggest that the reverse screening algorithm may result in increased patient follow-ups, overtreatment, and potentially higher cost. However, other data suggest that reverse screening facilitates the detection of latent and early syphilis while offering an objective and automated screening approach.

- **Summary**: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends syphilis screening with a nontreponemal test. However, as laboratories continue to implement the reverse screening algorithm, it is important that samples with discordant screen-reactive, RPR-nonreactive results be tested by a second treponemal assay to assist in the interpretation of results.

### Self-collection of samples as an additional approach to deliver testing services for sexually transmitted infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UPhTB]. BMJ Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

We conducted a comprehensive search using PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and Embase up until July 18, 2018, with no restrictions on publication year, study location, or language. Secondary reference searches were also conducted on all studies included in the review and three relevant systematic reviews. Experts in the field were contacted to identify articles not found through other search methods. We searched for ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on clinicaltrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, and the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Search terms for STIs and self-sampling were developed, and the full search strategy is available in online supplementary file 1.

After the initial screening of titles, abstracts, citation information, and descriptor terms, records were independently screened in duplicate by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved through consensus. Full-text articles of all selected records were obtained, and three reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of these full-text articles for final study selection, resolving differences via consensus.

For each study, the following information was compiled through independent double-data extraction: study citation, objectives, location, population characteristics, and description of the type of STI sampling.

### Accuracy of human papillomavirus testing on self-collected versus clinician-collected samples: a meta-analysis [^117SigRC]. The Lancet Oncology (2014). High credibility.

Screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is more effective in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer than screening using Pap smears. Moreover, HPV testing can be done on a vaginal sample self-taken by a woman, which offers an opportunity to improve screening coverage. However, the clinical accuracy of HPV testing on self-samples is not well-known. We assessed whether HPV testing on self-collected samples is equivalent to HPV testing on samples collected by clinicians.

- **Methods**: We identified relevant studies through a search of PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they fulfilled all of the following selection criteria: a cervical cell sample was self-collected by a woman followed by a sample taken by a clinician; a high-risk HPV test was done on the self-sample (index test), and HPV-testing or cytological interpretation was done on the specimen collected by the clinician (comparator tests). The presence or absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) or worse was verified by colposcopy and biopsy in all enrolled women or in women with one or more positive tests. The absolute accuracy for finding CIN2 or worse, or CIN grade 3 (CIN3) or worse of the index and comparator tests as well as the relative accuracy of the index versus the comparator tests were pooled using bivariate normal models and random effect models.

- **Findings**: We included data from 36 studies, which altogether enrolled 154,556 women. The absolute accuracy varied by clinical setting. In the context of screening, HPV testing on self-samples…

### Fingerprick versus oral swab: Acceptability of blood-based testing increases if other STIs can be detected [^114kLu9h]. AIDS and Behavior (2017). Low credibility.

Self-testing has untapped potential as a strategy to improve access to HIV testing and to increase testing frequency. User acceptability of self-administered oral swab HIV tests is consistently high in both hypothetical and actual-use studies. We explored preferences for oral versus fingerprick HIV self-tests among men who have sex with men with a high-risk profile. Participants indicated a greater likelihood of using an oral swab over a blood-based test, notwithstanding the lower price or quicker results from the latter. However, the likelihood of using an HIV fingerprick test substantially increased if it also offered information on other sexually transmitted infections.

### State of the art for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [^112iwPBi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge among reproductive-age women and is linked to several adverse health outcomes, including an increased risk of acquiring HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as well as adverse birth outcomes. Although BV is recognized as a vaginal dysbiosis marked by a shift in the vaginal microbiota from protective Lactobacillus species to an increase in facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria, its exact etiology remains unknown. This minireview aims to provide an updated overview of the range of tests currently used for the diagnosis of BV in both clinical and research settings.

- **Traditional BV diagnostics**: The article is divided into primary sections covering traditional BV diagnostics and molecular diagnostics.

- **Molecular diagnostics**: Molecular diagnostic assays, particularly 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are specifically highlighted. Additionally, the increasing use of multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in clinical practice and research studies related to the vaginal microbiota and BV pathogenesis is noted.

We also offer a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of BV diagnostic tests and explore future challenges in this field of research.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: a retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^113Qnqn5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by *Treponema pallidum* subsp. *pallidum*. In 2019, the estimated global prevalence of syphilis was 49.7 million, marking a 61% increase from 1990. Rates of syphilis have risen significantly in many high- and middle-income countries over the past decade. In England, notifications more than doubled between 2013 and 2022 (6.2–15.4 per 100,000), while they more than tripled in Australia and the United States (7.6–24.3 per 100,000 and 5.5–17.7 per 100,000, respectively). Rates of congenital syphilis have also surged, with a 755% increase reported in the US between 2012 and 2021. Syphilis can present with numerous symptoms and lead to severe conditions including neurosyphilis. In pregnancy, syphilis infection can be transmitted vertically, causing neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Serological testing is the primary method for diagnosing syphilis, involving multiple tests to screen, confirm, and stage the infection. The reverse screening algorithm is commonly used in high-volume laboratories. This algorithm begins with a sensitive treponemal antibody immunoassay. If this assay is positive, it is followed by non-treponemal antibody tests. If the treponemal and non-treponemal results are discordant, a second confirmatory treponemal test is performed. In the United Kingdom and Australia, if the screening treponemal antibody result is positive, national guidelines recommend confirming the performance of non-treponemal and treponemal tests. The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay is considered the preferred method for confirmation.

### High-risk human papillomavirus infection involving multiple anatomic sites of the female lower genital tract: a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction-based study [^1131Xiex]. Human Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is usually observed at one anatomic site in an individual. However, it is rare to encounter infection at multiple sites of the female lower genital tract in the same individual, either simultaneously or at a later date. The study identifies the various subtypes of high-risk HPV infection in these scenarios and analyzes the potential significance of these findings.

High-risk HPV infection involving 22 anatomic sites from 7 individuals was identified after institutional review board approval. Residual paraffin-embedded tissue samples were retrieved, and all 15 high-risk HPV types were identified, with viral load quantified using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction-based method. Multiple high-risk HPV subtypes were identified in 32% of the samples, with as many as 5 different subtypes detected in a single anatomic site.

In general, each anatomic site had a unique combination of viral subtypes, although one individual showed overlapping subtypes in the vagina, cervix, and vulvar samples. Higher viral load and rare subtypes were more frequent in younger patients and in cases of dysplasia compared with carcinoma. Follow-up, ranging from 3 to 84 months, revealed persistent high-risk HPV infection in 60% of cases.

### Genital warts: Rapid evidence review [^114CHrs2]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for anogenital warts, specifically with respect to biopsy, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend diagnosing genital warts based on clinical assessment. Perform a biopsy in cases of uncertain diagnosis, lack of response to standard therapy, worsening of the condition during therapy, or presence of atypical lesions such as pigmented, indurated, affixed to underlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated lesions.

### Screening recommendations for chlamydia and gonorrhea [^113Rnb2r]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Dermatologists diagnose and treat sexually transmitted infections with varying frequency and have an opportunity to monitor at-risk individuals for chlamydia and gonorrhea. What are the recommended screening guidelines for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men and women in the United States?

While the evidence for screening men for chlamydia and gonorrhea remains insufficient at this time, all sexually active females younger than 25 years and all older women at risk for infection should be screened for both chlamydia and gonorrhea.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^115FgtVo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

A second cohort consisted of serum specimens from persons with genital lesions PCR- or culture-positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2, followed by the UW Virology Research Clinic, who provided written informed consent approved by the UW Institutional Review Board (IRB). We selected one serum specimen each from 1,074 HIV-negative persons who tested positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 by PCR and/or culture and were confirmed seropositive for the corresponding HSV type by WB. Samples were collected at least 6 months following a person's initial episode of genital herpes. Some persons with HSV-2 positive genital lesions had both HSV-2 and HSV-1 antibodies when tested with WB, resulting in 131 samples positive for HSV-1 only with both viral and WB testing, 566 samples positive for HSV-2 only with both viral and WB testing, and 320 samples positive for HSV-2 with viral testing and both HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies on WB. Virological data on shedding rates in genital herpes infections (measured as percent of swabs positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 by non-type-specific PCR over total number of swabs) were also available from 315 of 1,017 persons in the Virology Research Clinic (VRC) cohort [shedding rates available in Supplemental Data file].

### Testing for human papillomaviruses in urine, blood, and oral specimens: an update for the laboratory [^115HaYXR]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Low credibility.

While HPV testing is relevant for population-based screening of the healthy population, increasing evidence suggests it may be relevant for individual prognostication in the patient population. To serve both healthy and patient populations, a range of biological specimens (biospecimens) and HPV tests with different performance characteristics are required. The characteristics of HPV tests used and the required specimen types differ considerably depending on whether the application serves a screening, diagnostic, epidemiological, or research objective.

In routine clinical laboratory settings, testing for hrHPV is used most frequently as a screening tool in HPV-based primary cervical cancer screening programs. For this purpose, HPV testing must be performed using validated molecular tests with clinical sensitivity and specificity calibrated to the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions rather than minute quantities of virus. Until recently, this testing was performed almost exclusively using cervical samples collected by a trained health care worker.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^111JhmdE]. MMWR, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). High credibility.

A test-of-cure is unnecessary for persons with uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with any of the recommended or alternative regimens. However, for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea, a test-of-cure is recommended using culture or nucleic acid amplification tests 7–14 days after initial treatment, regardless of the treatment regimen. Because reinfection within 12 months ranges from 7% to 12% among persons previously treated for gonorrhea, persons who have been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest within 12 months after initial treatment.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^1114fkEy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from 1960 to 30 June 2017. Following the consultation in November 2017, we subsequently updated the literature search from July 2017 to September 2018 using the following search terms: (Treponema pallidum OR Neurosyphilis OR Syphilis) AND (sero-diagnos* OR serodiagnos* OR (serolog* AND (test* OR exam* OR assay* OR screen* OR lab* OR diagnos* OR nontreponemal OR treponemal OR algorithm* OR antibody titer) OR serofast)). The search was limited to human studies published in English.

The initial search yielded n = 4851 non-duplicated abstracts. We excluded n = 4504 abstracts that were not relevant to the key question: studies of nontreponemal testing only, animal studies, direct detection studies, review articles, guidelines, letters to the editor, and other publications that were not primary research studies. We reviewed 347 abstracts and further excluded n = 230 studies that described obsolete tests only, tests not approved by the FDA, those that used a gold standard based exclusively on non-FDA approved tests, studies of prevalence or laboratory technique only (no test performance), any duplicate publications, and abstracts without a full manuscript. After exclusions, 117 full papers were reviewed for potential inclusion. 81 studies with either descriptive data on the use of treponemal tests or actual test performance data were abstracted into tables of evidence (Supplementary Table).

Studies with test performance data were prioritized according to their relevance to the key question (Supplementary Table).

### The traditional or reverse algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis: Pros and cons [^113yZW16]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question: "What diagnostic considerations should be taken into account when screening for syphilis using the traditional or reverse algorithm?" Improved laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is an important element in efforts to reduce syphilis rates. Screening for syphilis is performed using either a nontreponemal or treponemal test, which are part of the traditional or reverse algorithm, respectively. Both syphilis algorithms are used by laboratories. However, there are limited data on the performance and cost-effectiveness of these algorithms. An expert panel generated "key questions" in the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis. This paper pertains to the key factors that should be considered when deciding whether to screen for syphilis using either the traditional or the reverse algorithm. A systematic literature review was performed and tables of evidence were created to address this question.

### Concordance of human papillomavirus types detected on the surface and in the tissue of genital lesions in men [^111wCaXS]. Journal of Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Swabbing the surface of a genital lesion to obtain a sample for HPV DNA testing is less invasive than a biopsy but may not represent HPV types present in the lesion tissue. The objective of this study was to examine the concordance of HPV types detected in swab and biopsy samples from 165 genital lesions from men aged 18–70.

- **Lesion types**: The lesions included 90 condyloma, 10 penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN), 23 non-condyloma with known histology, and 42 lesions with undetermined histology.
- **Sampling methods**: All lesions were sampled by swabbing the surface with a pre-wetted Dacron swab and taking a shave biopsy.
- **HPV genotyping**: HPV genotyping was performed using Linear Array for swab samples and INNO-LiPA for biopsy samples.
- **Statistical analysis**: The kappa and McNemar statistics were used to compare the concordance of detecting HPV types in swab and biopsy samples.

Both sampling methods showed high agreement for the detection of HPV DNA in condyloma (87.8% agreement) and PeIN (100% agreement). There was also high concordance for detecting HPV16 (kappa = 1.00) and HPV18 (kappa = 1.00) in PeIN; however, agreement was low to moderate for detecting HPV6 (kappa = 0.31) and HPV11 (kappa = 0.56) in condyloma. Low to moderate agreement was also observed between sampling methods for detecting individual HPV types in non-condyloma and lesions with indefinite histology.

These results suggest that obtaining a biopsy in addition to swabbing the surface of a lesion may provide additional information about specific HPV types associated with male genital lesions.

### Assessment of self taken swabs versus clinician taken swab cultures for diagnosing gonorrhoea in women: Single centre, diagnostic accuracy study [^117S6CUv]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs), gonorrhoea is the second most common in the United Kingdom. In women, the infection frequently remains asymptomatic and can ascend the cervical canal, causing pelvic inflammatory disease and potentially leading to infertility. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis can infect either the urethra, the endocervix, or both.

Currently, the recommended method for detecting gonorrhoea in women in the UK involves the culture of N. gonorrhoeae from urethral and endocervical samples. This method necessitates a speculum examination, which many women find embarrassing and uncomfortable, and it requires a clinic visit, use of an examination room, a sterilizable or disposable vaginal speculum, and a trained clinician. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) offer alternative diagnostic methods and are the mainstay of testing for C. trachomatis infection. NAATs for C. trachomatis are significantly more sensitive than previous tests, and non-invasively obtained samples are as accurate as those obtained from the urethra and endocervix.

Non-invasive samples eliminate some of the barriers to screening for chlamydia and gonorrhoea, as they do not necessitate an examination and are clearly preferred by patients. The non-invasive tests used in women include first catch urine or self-taken vulvovaginal swabs. The optimal diagnostic sample must effectively detect the maximum number of infected individuals. Evidence suggests that self-taken vulvovaginal swabs have better sensitivity than first catch urine, likely because the swabs collect more material from two potential sites.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pooling urine, anorectal, and oropharyngeal specimens for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Y554W]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There are several potential limitations to multisite pooled testing. The lack of anatomic-site-specific results was a common concern in the studies reviewed and suggests the need to retest those with positive results. Although some guidelines have differences in the treatment recommended for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) depending on the site of infection, the WHO guidelines recommend the same first-line treatment for infections regardless of anatomic site.

Using pooled testing may impair epidemiological data collection for reporting CT/NG infections, as the site of infection would not be known without testing individual sites. While it has been demonstrated to reduce the total costs of testing, pooled testing may still not be affordable in resource-constrained settings without established STI testing infrastructure or without adopting molecular point-of-care testing for STIs or other infections such as tuberculosis or to measure HIV viral load.

Pooled testing requires access to nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) and laboratory processes for combining samples before testing. Considerations include the transport and handling of samples, mixing of samples, the amount of diluent used, potential contamination of samples, laboratory staff training, and the storage of individual samples for re-testing if required. Finally, with a lower bacterial load in the oropharynx compared to the genital and anorectal sites, there is a potential for pooled testing to miss oropharyngeal infections. Future studies should investigate how to further optimize the detection of oropharyngeal infections.

### Serological testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2 infection [^116izgFD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Serological tests for herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can accurately distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 are now commercially available. These tests detect antibodies to HSV glycoproteins G-1 and G-2, which evoke a type-specific antibody response. Focus Technologies produces the HerpeSelect-1 and HerpeSelect-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests and the HSV-1 and HSV-2 HerpeSelect1/2 Immunoblot. Diagnology has marketed POCkit-HSV-2, a point-of-care test for HSV-2 that allows blood from a finger stick to be tested in a clinic.

These tests can be used to confirm a genital herpes diagnosis, establish diagnosis of HSV infection in patients with atypical complaints, identify asymptomatic carriers, and identify persons at risk for acquiring HSV. Potential settings for use of these tests include sexually transmitted disease clinics, prenatal clinics, and clinics that care for patients with human immunodeficiency virus. Patient interest in HSV serological tests appears high.

### USPSTF recommendations for STI screening [^111rDgcU]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Since 2000, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has issued eight clinical recommendation statements on screening for sexually transmitted infections. This article, written on behalf of the USPSTF, provides an overview of these recommendations.

- **High-risk individuals**: The USPSTF recommends that women at increased risk of infection be screened for chlamydia, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis. Similarly, men at increased risk should be screened for human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis.
- **Pregnant women**: All pregnant women should be screened for hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis. Pregnant women at increased risk should also be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea.
- **Routine screening**: Nonpregnant women and men not at increased risk do not require routine screening for sexually transmitted infections. Engaging in high-risk sexual behavior places individuals at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.
- **Young women**: The USPSTF recommends that all sexually active women younger than 25 years be considered at increased risk of chlamydia and gonorrhea.
- **Community considerations**: Since not all communities present the same risk of sexually transmitted infections, the USPSTF encourages physicians to consider expanding or limiting the routine sexually transmitted infection screening they provide based on the community and populations they serve.

### Light microscopy, culture, molecular, and serologic methods for detection of herpes simplex virus [^11569rZ7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) cause a variety of human diseases, ranging from acute to chronic and mild to severe. The absence of curative therapy results in lifelong carriage marked by recurrent outbreaks and allows transmission of the virus to uninfected individuals. Nonspecific lesions, variable presentation, and chronic carriage necessitate the use of different laboratory testing methods appropriate for each presentation. A thorough understanding of the performance characteristics and limitations of available tests is critical for selection of the appropriate test and interpretation of results. Clinical sensitivity, specificity, and selection of the appropriate methodology are paramount to avoid misdiagnosis and guide therapy.

In this article, we review the different methods for detection and typing of HSV, including light microscopy, culture, serology, and nucleic acid-based tests. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each method for diagnosing HSV infection, cite performance characteristics, and review appropriate clinical uses.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syphilis, specifically in confirmatory testing, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend acknowledging that chemiluminescence immunoassays and treponemal enzyme immunoassays have suboptimal specificity, which results in a low positive predictive value in low-prevalence populations. It is advised to obtain additional reflex confirmatory testing by employing the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test or the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test if these assays are used.

### Detection of COVID-19 in a vulvar lesion [^115prUd6]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Low credibility.

As new information about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly discovered, clinicians are better equipped to make informed decisions for their patients. Research suggests COVID-19 viral antigen is not found in vaginal secretions; however, its detectability in the female lower genital tract may have clinical implications for obstetric and gynecologic care for women. We present a case of a woman at 31 weeks' gestation with simultaneous upper respiratory symptoms and vulvovaginitis. She was found to have a vulvar lesion positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-COVID by viral swab. This case shows that COVID-19 is detectable in the vulva, which may have implications for health care workers' exposure and personal protective equipment needs. While vertical transmission has largely not been reported, the presence of detectable virus in the female lower genital tract makes this a continued possibility and area of study.

- **Key points**:
	- COVID-19 is detectable in the female lower genital tract.
	- The detection of COVID-19 in the vulva may have implications for personal protective equipment use.
	- The detection of COVID-19 in vulvovaginal lesions makes vertical transmission a continued possibility.

### Testing for human papillomaviruses in urine, blood, and oral specimens: an update for the laboratory [^114gA4cc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have a remarkably stable DNA genome and are classified by the homology of their genome into five genera: Alphapapillomavirus, Betapapillomavirus, Gammapapillomavirus, Mupapillomavirus, and Nupapillomavirus, as well as several species and numerous genotypes. Genotypes are numbered chronologically in order of characterization, and 223 distinct HPV genotypes were officially recognized as of the end of June 2023. The 12 HPV genotypes from the Alphapapillomavirus genus with the highest oncogenic potential are often referred to as high-risk HPV genotypes (hrHPVs) and include HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, and -59.

Most hrHPV infections follow a subclinical course, but some persistent infections are etiologically linked with benign and malignant lesions of the epithelia. Human cancers attributable to hrHPVs represent 4.5% of all cancers worldwide (8.8% of all cancers in women and 0.9% in men), with approximately 690,000 new cancer cases identified each year. HrHPVs cause virtually all cervical and anal cancers, a substantial proportion of vaginal cancers, and a component of oropharyngeal, penile, and vulvar cancer. Consequently, laboratory detection of HPV to support screening for — and management of — associated diseases has been the subject of research and development since the 1980s, some of which has translated into large-scale screening practice. Furthermore, general improvements in the precision of molecular testing and our understanding of the natural history of HPV infection have ensured that the laboratory detection of HPV remains a highly relevant field of study.

### Performance of point-of-care tests for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111BE3YA]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 127.2 million new cases of CT occur globally every year, with most cases originating from resource-limited countries. Untreated CT infection in women can lead to serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. In men, CT infection is associated with non-gonococcal urethritis and epididymitis. CT infection in pregnant women can contribute to adverse obstetric outcomes such as preterm birth and low birthweight. Additionally, genital CT infection significantly increases the risk of HIV transmission and human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical carcinoma development.

Because over 70% of CT infections in women and 50% in men are asymptomatic, effective control of the infections often relies on screening for CT followed by treatment of the infected cases. The benefits of CT screening in women include a reduction in rates of PID and the prevention of adverse obstetric outcomes among pregnant women. Screening for CT largely depends on the availability and accessibility of tests to the target populations. Laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) provide a highly accurate diagnosis but are usually neither affordable nor accessible in developing countries due to the requirement for laboratory infrastructure, trained personnel, and the high costs involved. Additionally, there is often a delay in reporting test results.

### Point-of-care testing for sexually transmitted infections: Recent advances and implications for disease control [^11766PzQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain a major global public health issue, with more than 448 million incident bacterial infections each year. This review explores recent advances in STI point-of-care (POC) testing and their implications for STI prevention and control.

- **Recent findings**: Accurate immunochromatographic assays to detect HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and syphilis antibodies have made home or supervised self-testing possible. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility and excellent test characteristics of HIV, HCV, and syphilis POC tests. Rapid oral HIV tests are now available for purchase at retail sites across the United States. Combined HIV and syphilis tests using a single finger prick blood sample are under evaluation.

- **Summary**: Oral POC STI tests with comparable performance to blood-based POC tests are available for self-testing. These tests can expand screening, improve syndromic management, and reduce loss to follow-up. They have the potential to facilitate prompt treatment and partner services. POC STI tests create opportunities for new social and financial models of community-based testing services. Increasing equity and access to testing will create challenges in linkage to care, quality assurance, partner services, and surveillance. These important developments warrant research to understand appropriate contexts for implementation.

### Self-collection of samples as an additional approach to deliver testing services for sexually transmitted infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1117NVJm]. BMJ Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We assessed self-collection of samples for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Treponema pallidum (syphilis), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). This is in line with ongoing multicountry evaluations of promising point-of-care testing (POCT) interventions to detect these four curable STIs, as well as the goal of the WHO STI POCT initiative to achieve universal access to reliable and affordable STI testing.

- **Definition**: There are numerous types of self-collected samples for different STIs, including urine (mainly among men, but also women and youth) for NG, CT, and TV; vulvovaginal swabs for NG, CT, and TV; and pharyngeal and anorectal swabs for NG and CT. Rapid dual tests for HIV/syphilis have been developed and evaluated, but only one so far has been prequalified by the WHO, though others are in the process.

### Managing patients with genital herpes and their sexual partners [^115B7f2x]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

There is increasing recognition of the growing size and significance of the genital herpes epidemic. Recent developments in the wide-scale availability of type-specific herpes simplex virus (HSV) serologic assays mean that many previously undiagnosed mild, atypical, and subclinical infections may now be diagnosed with some degree of confidence without the use of Western blots. The value of such diagnostics is controversial. However, the importance of HSV, with its facilitation of HIV transmission and acquisition, the availability of various preventative strategies for limiting vertical HSV transmission, and the growing evidence that condoms, some educational and counseling interventions, and antiviral therapies may limit sexual transmission, have challenged many of the arguments against wider testing of the population.

### Sexually acquired syphilis: Laboratory diagnosis, management, and prevention [^115B3dvk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

The methods used for the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis include direct detection of *Treponema pallidum* subspecies pallidum and serologic testing. Serologic testing relies on both nontreponemal and treponemal tests. In newly developed reverse-sequence screening algorithms, treponemal tests are performed before nontreponemal tests. The management of syphilis requires appropriate staging, treatment, and follow-up of patients, along with the prompt reporting of infections to public health authorities to assist with prevention and control efforts. Benzathine penicillin G remains the treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis. Screening of populations at higher risk for syphilis is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Preventive Services Task Force, and the World Health Organization. The second article in this continuing medical education series reviews the testing for and the management of sexually acquired syphilis.

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^111WQvTK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

**Methods**: The participant had positive results of a type-specific HSV immunoblot assay. Swab specimens were collected every weekday for four weeks using a spatial grid of the female genital tract, as previously described. An aliquot of each swab specimen was used for column-based DNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis to detect HSV-1 genomes. The participant also experienced symptomatic genital HSV-1 recurrences before and after the swabbing study; specimens from associated lesions were collected for HSV-1 culture. This individual's virus is referred to hereafter as "v.29". The University of Washington Human Subjects Division approved the study, and the participant provided informed consent.

### Screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infections: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^117UiPzo]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

The 2014 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement supported the effectiveness of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in asymptomatic, sexually active women 24 years or younger and in older women at increased risk for infection, although evidence for screening in men was insufficient.

- **Objective**: To update the 2014 USPSTF review on screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infection in adults and adolescents, including those who are pregnant.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Ovid MEDLINE (January 1, 2014, through May 28, 2020), with surveillance through May 21, 2021.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials and observational studies of screening effectiveness, accuracy of risk stratification, alternative screening methods, accuracy of tests, and screening harms.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: One investigator abstracted data while a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Complications of infection; infection transmission or acquisition; diagnostic accuracy of anatomical site-specific testing and collection methods; screening harms.

- **Results**: Twenty-seven studies were included (N = 179,515). Chlamydia screening compared with no screening was significantly associated with a reduced risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in 2 of 4 trials and with reduced hospital-diagnosed PID (0.24% vs. 0.38%; relative risk, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.4–1.0]), but not clinic-diagnosed PID or epididymitis, in the largest trial.

### Herpes simplex virus shedding rate: Surrogate outcome for genital herpes recurrence frequency and lesion rates, and phase 2 clinical trials end point for evaluating efficacy of antivirals [^113sgWpF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

We tested whether genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) shedding is an appropriate surrogate outcome for the clinical outcome of genital herpes lesions in studies of HSV-2 antiviral interventions.

- **Methods**: We analyzed prospective data from natural history studies and clinical trials of antiviral agents for HSV-2 in which HSV-2-seropositive participants provided self-collected anogenital swab specimens daily over ≥ 25 days for HSV DNA quantitation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genital recurrences were self-reported.

- **Results**: Among 674 participants, genital HSV shedding was detected on 17% of days, and genital lesions were reported on 10% of days. Within the same session, HSV shedding rates were strongly correlated with lesion rates (ρ = 0.61, P < .0001). The relative reduction in the recurrence rate was 72% (P = 0.041) for recipients of the antiviral agent pritelivir compared to recipients of placebo, but it decreased to 21% (P = 0.75) after adjustment for HSV shedding rate. When evaluating valacyclovir and acyclovir, adjustment for the HSV shedding rate also led to a reduced association of these antivirals with the recurrence rate. Overall, 40%-82% of the antiviral effect on recurrences was explained by its effect on HSV shedding.

- **Conclusion**: HSV genital shedding measured by PCR analysis in swab specimens self-collected daily is an appropriate surrogate outcome for genital herpes lesions because it is in the causal pathway to recurrences.

### Performance of point-of-care tests for the detection of chlamydia trachomatis infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112V4TYS]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is one of the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) globally but has been inadequately detected for intervention. The introduction of point-of-care tests (POCTs) for CT is critical for filling the intervention gaps. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the diagnostic performance of POCTs for CT to assist in guiding the application of these assays in CT screening and detection.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed/Medline and Embase databases from January 2004 to May 2021 for studies reporting the performance of POCTs for identifying CT using specimens collected from urethral, vaginal, cervical, anorectal, or pharyngeal sites or urine. Two investigators independently screened and extracted data to control the quality of data extraction. Any discrepancies in study selection and data extraction were resolved through consensus. We only included studies with sufficient data to estimate sensitivity and specificity and used laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) as the reference standard. The main outcomes were pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Summary estimates were calculated using a random-effects model, and summary receiver operator curves (SROCs) were generated using the Moses-Littenberg method. STATA 14.0 and Meta-DiSc 1.4 were used for statistical analysis. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019140544.

- **Findings**: Of 3,038 records identified, 39 studies (42,336 specimens).

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112166oi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

To further examine automated HSV serology assay performance, we took advantage of a unique cohort of 1,017 persons with genital HSV infection confirmed by PCR or culture through genital herpes studies at the UW VRC from 1981 to 2019. For this study, we included samples from persons with genital herpes with PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV infection who had serological testing using the WB at least 6 months (median 5.8 years, range 6 months to 50 years) after the initial episode of genital herpes. Given the focus on genital herpes, 886 (87%) people in this cohort had PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV-2 infections, and 131 (13%) people had PCR- or culture-confirmed genital HSV-1 infections. WB results were 100% concordant with the PCR or culture results. Of the 886 people with confirmed HSV-2 genital infections, 320 (36%) also had HSV-1 antibodies detected on the WB, most likely from prior HSV-1 infection.

The VRC cohort was composed of 669 women (65.8%) and 348 men (34.2%) who provided samples between 1981 and 2019 (median 1989). Most people were white (86.3%), and the overall median age was 34.3 (range: 16–88 years, Table S2; Fig. S2).

### Testing for human papillomaviruses in urine, blood, and oral specimens: an update for the laboratory [^11582aK9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

HPV testing in urine has become an important focus in HPV research and public health initiatives. Self-sampling plays a crucial role in improving equitable access to screening. In many cervical cancer screening programs or projects, women now have the option to provide a self-collected sample. Self-taken samples for HPV testing have similar accuracy to clinician-collected samples for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions when a validated PCR-based assay is used. Typically, self-sampling involves inserting a swab, brush, or more complex collection device into the vagina to collect cervicovaginal secretions, which contain exfoliated epithelial cells and debris of disintegrated cells, either by turning, rubbing, washing, or lavage. However, urine presents a less invasive self-collected sample with strong potential for use in self-sampling exercises for screening and epidemiological applications.

Our understanding regarding the use of urine as a valid specimen for HPV testing has evolved substantially in the last decade. In the early days of investigation, several technical and interpretational challenges were identified, and suboptimal analytical and clinical sensitivity were observed, particularly when comparing urine with clinician-collected cervical samples. The mechanism by which HPV DNA "contaminated" urine was poorly understood and posed a major limitation to the advancement of the field. An initial review on the performance of urine as a biospecimen for HPV testing demonstrated that conflicting results in early studies were largely due to a lack of uniform protocols and standardizations.

### Type-specific identification of anogenital herpes simplex virus infections by use of a commercially available nucleic acid amplification test [^117K7Udo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes infections are among the most common sexually transmitted infections (STI), but diagnostic methods for genital herpes have not kept pace with the movement toward molecular testing. Here, we describe an FDA-approved molecular assay that identifies and types herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections for use in routine clinical settings. Paired samples from anogenital lesions were tested using the BD ProbeTec HSV Q(x) (HSVQ(x)) system, HSV culture, and a laboratory-developed PCR assay. Family planning, obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN), or sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in the United States served as recruitment sites.

Sensitivity and specificity estimates, head-to-head comparisons, measures of agreement, and latent-class analyses were performed to provide robust estimates of performance. A total of 508 participants (174 men and 334 women) with anogenital lesions were included; 260 HSV-2 and 73 HSV-1 infections were identified. No differences in test performance based on gender, clinic type, location of the lesion, or type of lesion were observed. The sensitivity of HSV-2 detection ranged from 98.4% to 100% depending on the analytical approach, while the specificity ranged from 80.6% (compared to the less sensitive culture method) to 97.0% (compared to PCR). For HSV-1, the sensitivity and specificity ranges were 96.7% to 100% and 95.1% to 99.4%, respectively. This assay may improve our ability to accurately diagnose anogenital lesions due to herpes infection.

### Genital herpes: Insights into sexually transmitted infectious disease [^111dH5pm]. Microbial Cell (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on genital herpes:

- **Definition**: Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted viral infection characterized by primary and recurring genital inflammation and lesions.

- **Pathophysiology**: Genital herpes is mostly caused by HSV-2 and HSV-1, transmitted through sexual contact.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of genital herpes in North America is estimated to range from 5,000 to 24,000 per 100,000 people per year.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include lesions of mucous membrane presenting as bilateral clusters of macules, papules, followed by vesicles, pustules, and ulcers on the external genitalia with symptoms of pain, itching, burning, dysuria, lymphadenopathy, fever, cervicitis in women, and proctitis in homosexual men. Complications in women include aseptic meningitis and urinary retention. Recurrences may show prodromal symptoms of paresthesia and pains in the area of lumbosacral dermatomes. Asymptomatic genital shedding without any clinical symptoms is quite frequent. The disease increases psychological stress with frequent recurrences.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Untreated pregnancy-related genital herpes is associated with a mortality of 0.062 per 1,000 births in neonates.

### Genital shedding of herpes simplex virus among symptomatic and asymptomatic persons with HSV-2 infection [^113XbwAr]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

Since herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) antibody tests have become commercially available, an increasing number of persons have learned that they have genital herpes through serologic testing. The course of the natural history of HSV-2 in asymptomatic, seropositive persons is uncertain. The objective was to evaluate the virologic and clinical course of HSV genital shedding among individuals with symptomatic and asymptomatic HSV-2 infection.

Participants were drawn from a cohort of 498 immunocompetent HSV-2-seropositive persons enrolled in prospective studies of genital HSV shedding at the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic in Seattle and Westover Heights Clinic in Portland, Oregon, between March 1992 and April 2008. Each participant obtained daily self-collected swabs of genital secretions for at least 30 days.

The main outcome measure was the rate of viral shedding measured by quantitative real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction for HSV DNA from genital swabs. Herpes simplex virus type 2 was detected on 4753 of 23,683 days (20.1%; 95% confidence interval, 18.3%-22.0%) in 410 persons with symptomatic genital HSV-2 infection compared with 519 of 5070 days (10.2%; 95% CI, 7.7%-13.6%) in 88 persons with asymptomatic infection (P < .001). Subclinical shedding rates were higher in persons with symptomatic infection compared with asymptomatic infection (2708 of 20,735 days [13.1%; 95% CI, 11.5%-14.6%]) vs 434 of 4929 days [8.8%; 95% CI, 6.3%-11.5%]) (P < .001). However, the amount of HSV detected during subclinical shedding episodes was similar.

The 2019 EADV guidelines provide recommendations for diagnostic investigations of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), specifically focusing on specimen selection. The following specimens are recommended for the diagnosis of LGV:

- **Swab of ulcer base**: Includes exudate from primary anogenital lesions.
- **Rectal mucosal specimens**: Swabs or biopsies ideally collected from the mucosal lining under proctoscopic vision, though self-collected rectal swabs may be used in asymptomatic men who have sex with men (MSM).
- **Lymph node or bubo aspirates**: Use a 21-gauge needle after topical disinfection if LGV is suspected.
- **Urethral swab or first-catch urine specimen**: To be considered if LGV is suspected.
- **Pharyngeal swabs**: Recommended for MSM and women exposed at those sites.

### Identifying a consensus sample type to test for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis and human papillomavirus [^117HQSQo]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a global cause of acute illness. Early detection plays a crucial role in interrupting transmission and preventing complications. However, the accessibility of STI testing is hindered by the lack of an overall preferred sample type. By means of a prospective study in female sex workers (FSW), we compared the sensitivity of samples from different anatomical sites in detecting Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and human papillomavirus. Additionally, we documented the prevalence of each STI in this high-risk population.

- **Methods**: We selected 303 FSW and tested them for each STI through nucleic acid amplification testing on two vaginal and cervical swabs from different manufacturers, cervical smear, and first-void urine. The sensitivity of each sample type was compared for each infectious agent in order to identify a consensus sample type.

- **Results**: Vaginal swabs were superior to all other sample types, with an overall sensitivity of 86%. The sensitivity was the lowest for first-void urine, detecting only 63% of positive cases. The prevalence was 3.3% (10/299) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 9.0% (27/299) for Chlamydia trachomatis; 7.4% (22/298) for Trichomonas vaginalis; 10.8% (32/296) for Mycoplasma genitalium; and 55.6% (158/284) for human papillomavirus.

- **Conclusions**: When testing for STIs, vaginal swabs are the sample of choice, and first-void urine should be avoided. Designating self-sampled vaginal swabs as a consensus sample type enables the harmonization of STI testing.

### Diagnosis and management of genital herpes: Key questions and review of the evidence for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^115NZFPM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Genital herpes, caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or type 2, is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI). Given that HSV is an incurable infection, there are important concerns about the appropriate use of diagnostic tools, management of infection, prevention of transmission to sexual partners, and appropriate counseling. In preparation for updating the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STI treatment guidelines, key questions for the management of genital herpes infection were developed with a panel of experts. To answer these questions, a systematic literature review was performed, with tables of evidence including articles that would change guidance assembled. These data were used to inform recommendations in the 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^116G6uaa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

As women are seen in different clinical settings for symptoms indicative of vaginitis, it is important for treating clinicians to be aware that women with symptoms of vaginitis could be at an increased risk for an STI. The increased risk of some STIs in women who are positive for BV or Candida spp provides a strong impetus for comprehensive testing for STI. Integration of molecular testing for vaginitis and STI would establish consistent, objective, and sensitive testing methods, regardless of clinic type, to accurately identify and treat patients for these conditions.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chancroid, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend making a probable diagnosis of chancroid if all of the following four criteria are met:

- **≥ 1 painful genital ulcers**: The presence of one or more painful genital ulcers.

- **Typical clinical presentation**: Appearance of genital ulcers, and regional lymphadenopathy, if present.

- **No evidence of Treponema pallidum infection**: This should be assessed by darkfield examination or NAAT (ulcer exudate or serous fluid), or by serologic tests for syphilis performed at least 7–14 days after onset of ulcers.

- **Negative HSV-1 or HSV-2 NAAT or HSV culture**: This should be obtained on the ulcer exudate or fluid.

### The traditional or reverse algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis: Pros and cons [^112gTG3m]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What diagnostic considerations should be taken into account when screening for syphilis using the traditional or reverse algorithm?" Improved laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is an important element of the effort to reduce syphilis rates. Screening for syphilis is performed using either a nontreponemal or treponemal test, which are part of the traditional or reverse algorithm, respectively. Both syphilis algorithms are used by laboratories; however, there are limited data on the performance and cost-effectiveness of these algorithms. An expert panel generated "key questions" in the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis. This paper pertains to the key factors that should be considered when deciding whether to screen for syphilis using either the traditional or the reverse algorithm. A systematic literature review was performed, and tables of evidence were created to address this question.

### Assessment of best single sample for finding chlamydia in women with and without symptoms: A diagnostic test study [^114DvkNs]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Diagnostic accuracy of tests in women with and without symptoms

At least one symptom suggestive of a bacterial sexually transmitted infection was reported by 1634 (42%) of the participants with complete paired results. Of these, 213 (13%) women were infected with chlamydia. The sensitivities of clinician-taken endocervical swabs and self-taken vulvovaginal swabs were 88% (187/213) and 97% (206/213), respectively (P = 0.0008).

There were 2233 (58%) women who did not have symptoms suggestive of a bacterial sexually transmitted infection, 183 (8%) of whom were infected with chlamydia. The sensitivities of clinician-taken endocervical swabs and self-taken vulvovaginal swabs were 89% (163/183) and 97% (178/183), respectively (P = 0.0025).

There were 1347 women (35%) who would have been suitable for an "asymptomatic screen" — that is, they did not have any symptoms suggestive of a bacterial sexually transmitted infection and did not require examination for any other reason (such as symptoms of genital skin pathology). Of these, 76 (5.6%) had chlamydia infection. The sensitivities of clinician-taken endocervical swabs and self-taken vulvovaginal swabs were 89% (68/76) and 95% (72/76), respectively (P = 0.27).

### Diagnostic accuracy of pooling urine, anorectal, and oropharyngeal specimens for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1139qMZG]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

To control STIs, earlier detection and treatment are needed. Yet, a significant challenge is that most STIs are asymptomatic and require testing to identify infection. Undiagnosed and untreated STIs can lead to onward transmission and morbidity, such as reproductive organs inflammation, reproductive morbidity and infertility, and vertical transmission to neonates. Viral and bacterial STIs can increase the risk of acquiring HIV, as increased viral loads of HIV can be found in genital tracts during STI coinfection. Furthermore, inappropriate management of gonococcal infection may accelerate the emergence of multidrug-resistant NG, underscoring the need for aetiological diagnosis to optimize STI management.

An aetiological diagnosis that tests all appropriate anatomic sites is needed. Evaluation for CT/NG at extragenital sites is critical for some population groups (e.g. MSM, SW, TG), as a significant proportion of infections would be missed if only genital testing were undertaken. Studies have demonstrated that up to two-thirds of NG cases would be missed if only urethral or urine samples were tested in MSM. CT and NG are highly transmissible and often asymptomatic, and early detection relies on regular and comprehensive testing of multiple anatomic sites for those at higher risk. Since 2010, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have recommended using NAAT to test for extragenital CT and NG, as molecular testing improved sensitivity compared to culture. The Australian STI management guidelines recommend that pharyngeal, anorectal, and urethral testing is essential.

### Rapid diagnostic methods in sexually transmitted infections [^114MysGB]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common throughout both the developed and developing world. It is estimated that there are 1 million new cases per day of curable bacterial STIs worldwide. As part of the World Health Organization's 2001 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Diagnostics Initiative, the organization explored the need for simple, affordable, point-of-care STI testing for curable bacterial STIs. This article reviews the evidence supporting the implementation of currently available rapid tests for five common STIs: syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, and herpes.

### Advances in diagnostics of sexually transmitted infections [^114zB7Pg]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). High credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are caused by various pathogens, many of which have common symptoms. Diagnostic tests are critical to supporting clinical evaluations in making patient management decisions. Molecular diagnostics are the preferred test type when available, especially in asymptomatic patients for many STIs. However, for some infections, serology offers the best insight into infectious status. Clinicians should be aware of the performance characteristics of the available STI diagnostic tests and understand how to use them. Point-of-care tests are helpful to implement rapid and accurate treatment responses, which are particularly beneficial in certain at-risk populations.

### Self-collection of samples as an additional approach to deliver testing services for sexually transmitted infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159CjLA]. BMJ Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

Self-collection of samples for diagnostic testing offers advantages such as patient autonomy, confidentiality, and convenience. Despite data showing their feasibility and accuracy, there is a need to better understand how to implement such interventions for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To support WHO guidelines on self-care interventions, we conducted a systematic review to investigate whether self-collection of samples should be made available as an additional approach to deliver STI testing services.

- **Methods**: Peer-reviewed studies were included if they compared individuals who self-collected samples for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and/or trichomonas testing to individuals who had samples collected by clinicians on the following outcomes: uptake/frequency of STI testing, social harms/adverse events, positive yield (case finding), linkage to clinical assessment/treatment, and reported sexual risk behavior. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS, and EMBASE for articles published through July 2018. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Evidence Project tool for non-RCTs. Meta-analysis was conducted using random effects models to generate pooled estimates of relative risk (RR).

- **Results**: Eleven studies, including five RCTs and six observational studies with a total of 202,745 participants, met inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted in Australia, Denmark, and the United States. Meta-analysis found that programs offering self-collection of samples increased overall uptake of STI testing services (RR: 2.9).

### Recommendations for the selective use of herpes simplex virus type 2 serological tests [^11595pSj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-specific serological tests are now widely available, but indications for their use have not been well defined. The California Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Controllers Association convened a committee of clinicians and researchers to make recommendations for the use of type-specific HSV type 2 (HSV-2) serological tests.

- **Methods**: By means of a systematic review of the literature, evidence to support screening in selected high-risk groups was compiled. Screening recommendations were developed by applying standard screening criteria to each specific population.

- **Results**: The committee concluded that, in addition to serological testing for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms, screening of asymptomatic patients is likely to be beneficial among the following groups: those at high risk for STDs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are motivated to reduce their sexual risk behavior, HIV-infected patients, and patients with sex partners with genital herpes. In contrast, universal screening for HSV-2 infection in pregnant women is unlikely to be beneficial.

- **Conclusions**: The targeted use of HSV-2 serological tests for specific diagnostic situations and selected populations should benefit patients, providers, and the community. Until more data become available, these recommendations provide justification for selective diagnostic and screening uses of HSV-2 serological tests.

### Evaluation of a PCR test for detection of Treponema pallidum in swabs and blood [^117E4Pms]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Syphilis diagnosis is based on clinical observation, serological analysis, and dark-field microscopy (DFM) detection of *Treponema pallidum* subsp. *pallidum*, the etiological agent of syphilis, in skin ulcers. We performed a nested PCR (nPCR) assay specifically amplifying the tpp47 gene of *T. pallidum* from swab and blood specimens. We studied a cohort of 294 patients with suspected syphilis and 35 healthy volunteers.

Eighty-seven of the 294 patients had primary syphilis, 103 had secondary syphilis, 40 had latent syphilis, and 64 were found not to have syphilis. The *T. pallidum* nPCR results for swab specimens were highly concordant with syphilis diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 95%. Reasonable agreement was observed between the results obtained with the nPCR and DFM methods (kappa = 0.53).

No agreement was found between the nPCR detection of *T. pallidum* in blood and the diagnosis of syphilis, with sensitivities of 29, 18, 14.7, and 24% and specificities of 96, 92, 93, and 97% for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), plasma, serum, and whole-blood fractions, respectively.

HIV status did not affect the frequency of *T. pallidum* detection in any of the specimens tested. Swab specimens from mucosal or skin lesions seemed to be more useful than blood for the efficient detection of the *T. pallidum* genome and, thus, for the diagnosis of syphilis.

### Testing for human papillomaviruses in urine, blood, and oral specimens: An update for the laboratory [^111Gm1bj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

Twelve high-risk alpha human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes cause approximately 690,000 cancer cases annually, with cervical and oropharyngeal cancer being the two most prominent types. HPV testing is performed in laboratory settings for various applications of a clinical, epidemiological, and research nature using a range of clinical specimens collected by clinicians or by individuals (self-collected specimens). Here, we reflect on the importance and justification of using the right test for the right application and provide practical updates for laboratories either participating in or anticipating involvement in HPV testing in three specimen types, namely, urine, blood, and oral specimens, which are considered "alternative" specimens by many.

In addition to clinician-collected cervical samples and self-collected cervicovaginal samples, first-void urine is emerging as a credible specimen for HPV-based cervical cancer screening, triage of HPV screen-positive women, monitoring HPV vaccine impact, and HPV testing in groups for which a less invasive sample is preferred. Detection of cell-free DNA (including HPV DNA) in blood holds great promise for the early detection of HPV-attributable oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-AOC) and potentially other HPV-driven cancers. It also serves as an adjunct prognostic marker in long-term tumor surveillance, including treatment response.

The moderate sensitivity of HPV testing in oral rinses or swabs at HPV-AOC diagnosis prevents its use in HPV-AOC secondary prevention; however, it represents a promising prognostic tool in HPV-AOC tertiary prevention.
