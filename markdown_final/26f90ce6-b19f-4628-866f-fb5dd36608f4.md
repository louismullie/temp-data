## Question

Homozygous A1298C mthfr

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the MTHFR A1298C homozygous (CC) genotype, specifically its biochemical effects, population prevalence, and the strength of evidence for disease associations, as well as practical counseling and management recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the enzyme biology and how A1298C differs from C677T. Then, I should verify the magnitude of activity reduction and whether it meaningfully alters homocysteine. Next, I will review population frequency and linkage with C677T. After that, I need to examine disease associations by domain — pregnancy, cardiovascular disease, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, cancer therapeutics, and thrombosis — while checking for confounding and effect modification. Finally, I will consider special situations like compound heterozygosity and outline counseling and management, including when testing is or isn't useful and what supplements may help if homocysteine is elevated.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical basics. MTHFR catalyzes the reduction of 5,10-methylene-THF to 5-methyl-THF, enabling remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. A1298C (Glu429Ala) is in exon 7 and, unlike C677T, is not associated with classic thermolability or marked cofactor loss, so its functional impact is milder, which I should keep in mind as I interpret outcomes data [^113D4LVv] [^116LRG1j].

> I should double-check the magnitude of enzyme impairment. Multiple sources converge on approximately 61% of wild-type activity for A1298C homozygotes, compared with roughly 25% for C677T homozygotes, and this smaller reduction typically does not raise homocysteine substantially unless compounded by other variants or low folate/B12 status. Wait, let me verify that claim against population data — yes, several cohorts show no independent homocysteine effect for A1298C alone, reinforcing that its clinical impact is modest in isolation [^116LRG1j] [^113JpCui] [^117Y7jTr].

> Next, I should review population genetics. Globally, the 1298C allele is common, with homozygous CC frequencies around 7–9% in many Caucasian cohorts and lower in East Asian populations. Importantly, 1298C almost always co-occurs on a 677C background, so compound heterozygosity (677T with 1298C) is uncommon, which limits the frequency of dual hits that could amplify biochemical effects [^116dHJjq] [^1165zXsy] [^111CX31n].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pregnancy outcomes. Large pooled analyses consistently show no significant association between maternal A1298C and preterm birth overall, whereas C677T shows population-specific risk signals, particularly in Asian cohorts. I initially thought A1298C might track with recurrent pregnancy loss, but wait, I should verify — some studies suggest associations in specific subgroups or with combined genotypes, yet high-quality meta-analyses and guidelines do not support routine MTHFR testing for RPL or thrombophilia, so I should correct that impression and emphasize that evidence is mixed and not practice-changing [^114e3t3T] [^114mixLQ] [^116T3q6Z] [^116YKCrL].

> I will now examine cardiovascular disease. Case-control studies generally fail to show an independent association between A1298C and coronary artery disease after adjustment for traditional risk factors, and pooled thrombophilia data do not support a venous thromboembolism signal for A1298C. But wait, what if there is a stroke link — meta-analyses of ischemic stroke primarily implicate C677T rather than A1298C, so I should be cautious not to over-attribute vascular risk to A1298C alone [^115pqhTt] [^117Y7jTr] [^112Moiv1] [^113q2PZz].

> Let me consider neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Meta-analyses repeatedly associate C677T with autism spectrum disorder risk, whereas A1298C shows no consistent association overall; that said, some subgroup analyses in populations without folate fortification suggest possible signals for A1298C, so I need to acknowledge heterogeneity and potential gene–environment interplay without implying causality [^1144sKMm] [^114ww8QJ] [^1111xVTX].

> Next, I should review cancer therapeutics. Preclinical cell-line data suggest that A1298C variants may increase sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil, plausibly via altered folate pools, but clinical meta-analyses have not confirmed a consistent association of A1298C with fluoropyrimidine response or toxicity; I should therefore frame this as hypothesis-generating rather than a basis for routine genotyping in oncology [^115xabbQ] [^111QX9zW].

> I need to check thrombotic disease more broadly. While isolated A1298C is not a strong independent risk factor for VTE, case reports and small series describe severe neonatal thrombosis when A1298C coexists with other prothrombotic variants such as PAI-1 4G/5G. This pattern supports a cumulative prothrombotic phenotype in compound states rather than a standalone effect of A1298C, so counseling should be individualized when multiple variants are present [^1115wR5c] [^112osrUQ] [^112Moiv1].

> But wait, what about special situations like compound heterozygosity. When A1298C is paired with C677T, MTHFR activity can drop toward 50–60% of normal, and homocysteine may rise meaningfully, especially with suboptimal folate or B12 status. In such cases, targeted B-vitamin strategies can lower homocysteine, and riboflavin may help specifically in C677T carriers, though the strongest intervention evidence exists for C677T rather than isolated A1298C [^112KGLbw] [^115LKASd] [^111Qe4KE].

> I should confirm when testing is actually useful. Professional guidelines advise against routine MTHFR testing for thrombophilia, RPL, or general health screening because results rarely change management. Exceptions include specific research contexts, persistent unexplained hyperhomocysteinemia despite repletion, or scenarios where compound thrombophilia is suspected and results would alter anticoagulation decisions, in which case a limited panel may be reasonable [^116YKCrL] [^115gkgpp].

> Let me translate this into practical counseling. For a patient with A1298C homozygosity, I would explain the modest enzyme reduction, the lack of consistent independent disease associations, and the importance of ensuring adequate folate, B12, and riboflavin intake. If homocysteine is elevated, I would first optimize diet and B-vitamin status, consider methylfolate rather than high-dose folic acid in select contexts, and reserve further workup for persistent elevations or compelling clinical indications, avoiding overinterpretation of a single polymorphism [^115CL2Bs] [^115LKASd].

> Finally, I should double-check the bottom line. A1298C homozygosity reduces MTHFR activity to about 60% of normal but, in isolation, does not reliably elevate homocysteine or independently increase risks for major outcomes. Effects are context dependent and often neutral or modest, so management should focus on optimizing nutrition and addressing global risk rather than genotype-specific interventions, with testing reserved for select scenarios where results would change care [^116LRG1j] [^113JpCui] [^116YKCrL].

The MTHFR A1298C homozygous (CC) genotype reduces MTHFR activity to about **60% of normal** [^116LRG1j] and typically causes only a modest homocysteine rise [^112KGLbw]; it is **not a strong independent risk factor** for cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism, or adverse pregnancy outcomes [^115gkgpp] [^116iyEhA] [^114e3t3T]. Clinical management should focus on ensuring adequate folate, B12, and B6 intake; testing homocysteine only if clinically indicated; and **avoiding routine MTHFR testing** unless there is a specific indication [^116YKCrL]. Supplementation with active folate (L-methylfolate) may be considered if homocysteine is elevated or if there is a specific clinical context (e.g. pregnancy planning, neuropsychiatric symptoms) [^115CL2Bs] [^114QWBJn].

---

## Biochemical implications

- **Enzyme activity**: The A1298C variant reduces MTHFR activity to ~60% of normal in homozygotes (CC) [^116LRG1j], less than the ~25% seen with C677T homozygotes [^116LRG1j].

- **Homocysteine levels**: Typically shows only a modest increase (~10–20%) and is strongly influenced by diet and B-vitamin status [^113JpCui] [^1113zMDS].

- **Folate metabolism**: May mildly impair one-carbon metabolism, but clinically significant folate deficiency is uncommon with adequate intake [^115CL2Bs].

---

## Clinical associations and risks

### Cardiovascular disease

Evidence linking A1298C to cardiovascular disease is **weak and inconsistent**; most large studies show no independent association with coronary artery disease or ischemic stroke [^115pqhTt] [^117Y7jTr]. Regarding thrombosis, A1298C homozygosity is **not a strong independent risk factor** for venous thromboembolism; routine testing is not recommended [^115gkgpp] [^112Moiv1].

---

### Pregnancy outcomes

Evidence for increased risk of neural tube defects is **limited and weaker than for C677T**; A1298C may confer a modest risk, especially in combination with C677T or low folate status [^113G3LrZ]. Associations with recurrent pregnancy loss are **inconsistent**, and routine MTHFR testing is not recommended for RPL evaluation [^116YKCrL]. Evidence for preterm birth is likewise inconsistent; **no strong association** has been demonstrated [^114e3t3T] [^114mixLQ].

---

### Neuropsychiatric disorders

Evidence for autism spectrum disorder is **limited and inconsistent**; some studies suggest a weak association, but overall evidence is inconclusive [^1144sKMm] [^1111xVTX]. Evidence for depression and schizophrenia is similarly limited; **no strong, consistent associations** have been established [^117RJhFn].

---

## Clinical management and recommendations

### Nutritional supplementation

- **Folate**: Ensure adequate intake of folate (400–800 mcg/day); L-methylfolate may be preferred if homocysteine is elevated or if there is a specific clinical context (e.g. pregnancy planning, neuropsychiatric symptoms) [^notfound].

- **Vitamin B12**: Maintain normal B12 levels; consider supplementation if deficient [^114QWBJn].

- **Vitamin B6**: Supportive supplementation may help optimize homocysteine metabolism [^112c7guA].

---

### Monitoring and testing

Monitoring should be **guided by clinical context**; check homocysteine only if there is a specific indication (e.g. cardiovascular risk assessment, pregnancy planning) [^notfound]. Routine MTHFR testing is not recommended; **genotyping should be reserved for specific clinical scenarios** or research purposes [^115gkgpp].

## Clinical implications of MTHFR A1298C homozygous genotype

| **Clinical domain** | **Evidence strength** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Cardiovascular disease | Weak | No routine testing or specific management |
| Venous thromboembolism | Weak | No routine testing or specific management |
| Neural tube defects | Moderate | Folate supplementation recommended |
| Recurrent pregnancy loss | Weak | No routine MTHFR testing |
| Preterm birth | Weak | No strong association |
| Neuropsychiatric disorders | Weak | No routine testing or specific management |

---

The MTHFR A1298C homozygous genotype causes a modest reduction in enzyme activity and has limited clinical impact; management should focus on **adequate folate and B-vitamin intake** and **clinical context–driven monitoring** rather than routine genetic testing.

Discussion

MTHFR is a pivotal gene for folate metabolism and is essential for human reproduction. MTHFR genetic mutation is linked to various reproduction-related diseases. MTHFR C677T is one of the most investigated polymorphisms of MTHFR. Therefore, testing of MTHFR C677T polymorphism could be of great clinical value. However, the role of MTHFR C677T polymorphism on outcomes following IVF/ICSI was indefinite. Zeng et.al reported that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is associated with a poor prognosis of COH oocytes. Pavlik et.al reported that MTHFR 677TT homozygous mutation is associated with a significantly lower number of oocytes than was expected based on the AMH concentrations. Evidence also supports that maternal variant in MTHFR C677T polymorphism is associated with poorer quality of oocytes and lower viability of embryos. Moreover, accumulating studies prove that paternal MTHFR 677TT homozygous mutation is significantly associated with male infertility. Parent MTHFR genotypes were shown to affect the production of aneuploid embryos. While supplementation of folic acid for 3 months could improve the seminal parameters and decrease seminal MDA and sperm DNA fragmentation index in patients with MTHFR 677TT genotype as well as tend to decrease the spontaneous pregnancy rate and increase the live birth rate. Though the current evidence indicates that the MTHFR 677TT genotype affects the ovarian response during ovarian stimulation and quality of gametes/embryos, however, the effect of the MTHFR 677TT genotype on pregnancy outcomes following IVF/ICSI-ET was not supported by the previous studies. A total of six studies investigated the role of maternal MTHFR C677T polymorphism on pregnancy outcomes following IVF/ICSI-ET, five of them reported no significant associations between maternal MTHFR 677TT genotype with pregnancy outcomes concerning clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, or live birth rate.

MTHFR C677T: In a study investigating the association of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism with PTB, significant findings were reported for various genetic models across different populations. Pooled results demonstrated a significant association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and PTB under five genetic models: allele (C vs. T; OR = 1.303, 95% CI 1.151–1.475, p ≤ 0.001), homozygote (CC vs. AA; OR = 1.494, 95% CI 1.212–1.842, p ≤ 0.001), heterozygote (CT vs. AA; OR = 1.303, 95% CI 1.119–1.516, p = 0.001), dominant (CC + CT vs. AA; OR = 1.341, 95% CI 1.161–1.548, p ≤ 0.001), and recessive (CC vs. CT + AA; OR = 1.340, 95% CI 1.119–1.604, p = 0.001) Figure e 2 shows Forest plots illustrating the link between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and PTB risk globally across various genetic models. In Asian populations, the allele model yielded an OR of 1.501 (95% CI 1.238–1.820, p ≤ 0.001), with homozygote (CC vs. AA) showing an OR of 1.744 (95% CI 1.279–2.378, p ≤ 0.001) and heterozygote (CA vs. AA) an OR of 1.555 (95% CI 1.230–1.967, p ≤ 0.001). In contrast, Caucasian populations showed no significant associations, as indicated by an allele model OR of 1.015 (95% CI 0.944–1.092, p = 0.682). Notably, significant associations were found in China (allele model OR = 1.424, p = 0.001) and India (allele model OR = 2.189, p ≤ 0.001), while no significant associations were observed in Austria. These findings suggest a population-dependent association of the MTHFR polymorphism with PTB, particularly pronounced in Asian and Indian cohorts.

### TPMT and MTHFR genotype is not associated with altered risk of thioguanine-related sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the children's oncology group [^1173cj6M]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is a complication of therapy for pediatric ALL and may be modified by thiopurine methyltransferase activity as well as by MTHFR genotype. We assessed TPMT *3A, *3B, *3C, and MTHFR C677T and A1298C germline genetic polymorphisms among 351 patients enrolled in the thioguanine treatment arm of CCG-1952 clinical trial. TPMT and MTHFR C677T genotypes were not associated with SOS risk. The combination of MTHFR and TPMT variant genotypes was not associated with SOS risk. These suggest that germline genetic variation in TPMT and MTHFR do not significantly alter SOS risk in patients exposed to thioguanine.

### ACMG practice guideline: lack of evidence for MTHFR polymorphism testing [^116YKCrL]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for recurrent pregnancy loss, more specifically with respect to thrombophilia evaluation, inherited causes, ACMG 2013 guidelines recommend to do not obtain MTHFR polymorphism genotyping as part of the clinical evaluation for RPL.

### The association of MTHFR C677T variant with increased risk of ischemic stroke in the elderly population: a meta-analysis of observational studies [^115RGhtq]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

This meta-analysis showed that MTHFR C677T variant may be associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in the elderly, specifically a significant difference among the Chinese population and a similar trend among the non-Chinese population as the non-Chinese subset is smaller than the Chinese subset which can be explained by a difference in power. However, we agree that this meta-analysis has several potential limitations. First, the study was based on secondary study-level data. All the included studies in our meta-analysis met the required mean (median) age of ≥ 65 years for study subjects, but this is not to say that each subject from the included studies was aged > 65 years. Second, the homocysteine concentration was measured only in two of the included studies, which makes it impossible for us to analyse it as an independent factor in this meta-analysis. Third, A1298C is a second common variant of MTHFR which clearly reduces MTHFR activity, albeit to a lesser extent than the C677T mutation, which effect on homocysteine levels is also attenuated and may only be significant when an individual carries both mutations and/or has poor nutrient status. The association between MTHFR A1298C variant and the risk of ischemic stroke was investigated only in two of the included studies, which makes it impossible for us to analyse it as an independent factor in this meta-analysis. Moreover, some fluctuations of population characteristics were observed, which could be a major source of heterogeneity, although the analysis of heterogeneity did not show any significance. Nonetheless, the findings of this meta-analysis which were based on case-control studies alone, should be interpreted with caution.

### Influence of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms on efficacy and toxicity of methotrexate in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^112QrRG2]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the relationship of C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene to toxicity and efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Methods

Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the MTHFR gene were investigated by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme analysis of DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells. The fasting plasma homocysteine concentration was analyzed by enzyme immunoassay. Clinical data of 58 patients with JIA treated with MTX were analyzed retrospectively.

Results

The 1298A/A genotype was present in 31 patients, 1298C/C in 4 patients, and 21 patients were heterozygous. The 677C/C genotype was present in 29 patients, 677 T/T in 3 patients, and 26 patients were heterozygous. In patients who presented the C allele of the A1298C polymorphism, improvement with respect to the number of swollen joints, the number of tender joints, and a decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels occurred more frequently than in 1298 A/A homozygous patients (p < 0.05 for ESR, p < 0.01 for CRP, chi-square test). There was no relationship between the C677T polymorphism and the efficacy of MTX treatment. Forty-two adverse events were noted in 26 patients; gastrointestinal symptoms were most common (n = 20), followed by elevated serum levels of transaminases (n = 19) and hair loss (n = 3). There was no cytopenia. Patients with the heterozygous genotype 677C/T exhibited adverse events more frequently than patients with the homozygous C/C genotype (65% vs 31%; p < 0.05, chi-square test). The A1298C polymorphism, however, was not associated with occurrence of adverse events. Plasma homocysteine was elevated in 6 patients with up to 16.9 mmol/l. No association was found to a specific genotype or to adverse events.

Conclusion

These preliminary data suggest an association of the MTHFR 677C/C polymorphism to a higher tolerability of MTX, and of the 1298A/A to lower clinical efficacy of MTX therapy in JIA.

### Genetic polymorphisms associated with acute pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis [^112Moiv1]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Frequently an inherited predisposition to thrombosis remains clinically silent until an additional environmental factor intervenes. The present study aimed to assess distribution of inherited risk factors of venous thrombosis in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). The prevalences of factor V Leiden (FV Leiden), prothrombin factor II G20210A (FII G20210A), C677T and A1298C of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutations were studied in 149 VTE patients and 100 controls. The following key risks were established: previous deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (23.5%), bed rest (34.2%), immobilisation of lower limb (10.1%), hospitalisation (30.9%) and obesity (28.9%). In 29 (19%) patients and in three (3%) controls FV Leiden was found. A significant association between VTE and FV Leiden was established. There were six (4%) carriers of the FII G20210A among VTE patients and one in the controls. No associations between VTE and MTHFR polymorphisms (C677T, A1298C) were found. In three of 149 patients both FV Leiden and FII G20210A polymorphisms were observed. The mean protein C activity was slightly, though nonsignificantly, smaller in VTE patients. In conclusion, there was a positive association between venous thromboembolism and factor V Leiden. Only a weak trend favouring a relationship between prothrombin factor II G20210A and venous thrombolism was present. No associations between common polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and venous thromboembolism were found.

### Thymidylate synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene polymorphisms: relationships with 5-fluorouracil sensitivity [^113D4LVv]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The intracellular CH₂FH₄ concentration is mainly controlled by the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme (MTHFR, EC 1.5.1.20), which irreversibly converts CH₂FH₄ into 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (Figure 1). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is located at a major metabolic crossroad, directing the folate pool towards remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (and subsequent DNA methylation) at the expense of DNA synthesis (Figure 1). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene is located on chromosome 1p, and is subject to several polymorphisms. Among them, the C677T (exon 4) and A1298C (exon 7) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the two most commonly linked with altered phenotypes, both associated with lower enzyme activity. The frequency of the mutated 677 TT genotype is around 10–15% in Caucasians, and only a few percent in Afro-Americans. The 677C > T mutation enhances the thermolability of the enzyme. The mutated 677 TT genotype is associated with elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations, as well as DNA hypomethylation that is involved in carcinogenesis processes. The influence of C677T polymorphism on disease risk is closely related to the nutritional folate status. In case of folate intake deficiency, 677 TT genotype is related to increased risk of congenital neural tube defect and to colorectal cancer. The A1298C genotype has been less extensively studied and the frequency of the mutated 1298 CC genotype reported in Japanese patients is around 3%. Interestingly, recently reported that the mutated 677 TT genotype was associated with greater methotrexate toxicity, whereas the mutated 1298 CC genotype was linked with better methotrexate efficacy. Since MTHFR enzymatic deficiency may theoretically favour thymidine synthesis via an increase of CH₂FH₄, one can hypothesise that tumours exhibiting mutated MTHFR genotypes linked to enzymatic deficiency may be more sensitive to FU cytotoxicity than wild-type (wt) MTHFR genotype tumours. Such a possible impact of MTHFR genotype may also affect normal host tissues. So far, the influence of C677T and A1298C polymorphisms on fluoropyrimidine sensitivity and/or toxicity remains unknown.

### Mutations in the MTHFR gene are not associated with methotrexate intolerance in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^112b2y8T]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Methotrexate (MTX) intolerance is a frequent problem of long-term treatment in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Mutations in the methylentetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene may increase toxicity of MTX, potentially constituting an initial stimulus for this conditioned response. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship of common MTHFR gene mutations and occurrence of MTX intolerance in pediatric patients with JIA treated with MTX.

Methods

Consecutive JIA patients on at least 3 months of MTX treatment were included in this study. Intolerance to MTX was determined using the Methotrexate Intolerance Severity Score (MISS) questionnaire, and MTX intolerance was defined as MISS values of ≥ 6. Presence of the two most common mutations in the MTHFR gene (C677T and A1298C) was tested using a PCR assay. Results were analyzed using descriptive and non-parametric statistics.

Results

196 patients were included (73% female). Of those, 93 (46%) showed MTX intolerance. 168 patients were genotyped for C677T and A1298C. MTX intolerance was not found to be significantly more frequent among patients with hetero- and homozygous or homozygous mutations C677T or A1298C compared to wild type or heterozygous mutations. Analysis of the correlation between numbers of mutations in these two loci to the MISS score did not yield a statistically significant correlation.

Conclusion

Mutations in the MTHFR gene were not found to be significantly more frequent in JIA patients intolerant to MTX. Toxicity associated with the MTHFR gene seems to result from mechanisms different to those involved in clinical MTX intolerance.

### Systematic review of genetic association studies involving histologically confirmed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^114LFWoR]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

MTHFR

The enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyses 5′10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reduction, producing 5′ methyltetrahydrofolate, which is further involved in the formation of methionine from homocysteine. Methionine is an important methyl donor utilised during the epigenetic process of DNA methylation, and mutations in MTHFR have been associated with a number of disease processes.

Serin et al evaluated the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in 53 Turkish patients with NAFLD, with 23 patients with NASH, defined by a NASof ≥ 5. The distribution of the polymorphism was found not to be significant between controls (n = 282) and NAFLD, or between NAFLD and NASH. Sazci et al also investigated the relationship between polymorphisms of MTHFR and NASH in a Turkish population. The two SNPs investigated — C677T and A1928C — were compared between 57 patients with histological NASH, with 324 healthy population controls. Results indicated A1298C was significantly associated with NASH, with the wild type AA being protective against NASH, but there was no significant association between NASH and 677T. The study also looked at compound genotypes and observed that the CC/AC in men and CC/CC genotypes in women were associated with NASH.

Assy et al evaluated thrombotic risk factors, including prothrombin, factor V Leiden and MTHFR mutations. Comparisons were made between 15 patients with fatty liver, 15 with NASH and 15 with chronic viral hepatitis. No significant differences were observed; however, only one variant allele was found within the groups studied.

KLF6

The Kruppel-like factor 6 encoded by KLF6 on chromosome 10 is a zinc finger transcription factor which functions as a tumour suppressor, and polymorphisms have been implicated in various cancer types. Miele et al investigated the Kruppel-like factor 6 rs37508611 IVSI-27 G > A polymorphism on two cohorts of 306 UK and 109 Italian patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. In the combined and UK cohorts, a significant reduction in fibrosis score was seen in heterozygous patients compared with homozygous wild type, but results did not reach statistical significance in the Italian cohort, possibly due to the reduced sample size. Logistic regression analysis showed the wild type genotype was a significant independent risk fact for the presence of fibrosis, with (OR 2.76, CI 1.295 to 5.908). This study also investigated inheritance patterns in 71 Italian family trios, which indicated a preferential transmission of the wild type allele.

### Thymidylate synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene polymorphisms: relationships with 5-fluorouracil sensitivity [^111QX9zW]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The relationship of thymidylate synthase (TS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphisms on 5-fluorouracil (FU) sensitivity was tested on 19 human cancer cell lines (head and neck, breast, digestive tract) in the absence and presence of folinic acid (FA) supplementation. Thymidylate synthase polymorphisms in the 5′ promoter region (double or triple tandem repeats) and 3′ untranslated region (6-bp deletion) were analysed by PCR. The C677T and A1298C MTHFR polymorphisms were determined by melting curve analyses (LightCycler). Thymidylate synthase activity and intracellular concentration of the reduced folate 5–10 methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH₂FH₄) were measured (biochemical assays). Thymidylate synthase activity was significantly different according to 5′ TS genotype, heterozygous cell lines (2R/3R) exhibiting higher TS activities than homozygous ones (P = 0.05). However, whether in the absence or presence of FA, FU sensitivity was not statistically associated with either 5′ or 3′ TS polymorphism. Basal CH₂FH₄ cellular concentrations were lowest in C677T homozygous wild-type (wt) (C/C) cell lines. FU sensitivity was not linked to C677T polymorphism. In contrast, there was a marked trend for a greater FU efficacy in mutated A1298C variants (C/C+A/C) as compared to wt homozygous cell lines (A/A) (P = 0.055 and 0.085 without and with FA supplementation, respectively). These results suggest for the first time a potential role of A1298C MTHFR polymorphism on fluoropyrimidine sensitivity.

### Global and population-specific association of MTHFR polymorphisms with preterm birth risk: a consolidated analysis of 44 studies [^111Ssbah]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the association between the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and the risk of PTB. This analysis evaluated how the OR changed with the exclusion of specific studies or datasets. For the MTHFR C677T polymorphism, the overall random model OR of 1.303 (95% CI: 1.151–1.475) indicated an increased risk of PTB. Notably, substantial heterogeneity was observed (I² = 79.21%), suggesting variability among study results. Excluding studies with high heterogeneity — characterized by wide CIs or smaller sample sizes — led to variations in the OR, which could enhance consistency across findings. In contrast, the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism exhibited a random model OR of 1.039 (95% CI: 0.902–1.197), indicating no significant association with PTB and also showed considerable heterogeneity (I² = 83.18%). Sensitivity analyses that removed studies not adhering to HWE or those suspected of bias were crucial in determining the stability of the association. Significant variations in the OR from these removals, while still retaining statistical significance, pointed to the influential role of certain studies on the overall findings. This underscores the necessity for careful interpretation of the associations of these polymorphisms in the context of predicting PTB risk.

### The association of MTHFR C677T variant with increased risk of ischemic stroke in the elderly population: a meta-analysis of observational studies [^113q2PZz]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis to focus on a specific elderly population to assess the risk of ischemic stroke and MTHFR C677T variant. The large-sample pooled analysis of nine homogeneous case-control studies demonstrated an association between MTHFR C677T variant and increased risk of ischemic stroke as follows: a 23% (95% CI 6–43%) higher risk of ischemic stroke was observed in the MTHFR C677T mutation group than in the control group with no mutation, and up to 32% (95% CI 9–59%) higher risk was observed specifically in the Chinese subgroup.

Hyperhomocysteinaemia is emerging as a potential risk factor of cardiovascular diseases, including cerebral stroke, and is considered modifiable. Both genetics and environmental factors (e.g. dietary intake of folic acid and B vitamins) affect homocysteine level. As one of the most extensively studied gene variants, MTHFR C677T was shown to contribute to ischemic stroke susceptibility, but the results seem inconsistent. In one genetic meta-analysis of 111 studies conducted by Casas JP et.al, individuals homozygous for the T allele of the MTHFR C677T variant have higher plasma homocysteine concentrations than those with the CC genotype. the TT genotype associated with a predisposition to increased plasma homocysteine levels may represent a genetic risk factor for CAD. However, in recent years, contradictory results have also been reported. Pramukarso DT et al. observed 71 patients with post-ischemic stroke and found that the MTHFR 677T allele polymorphism is not associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been associated with mutations of the MTHFR gene, mainly the C677T and A1298C mutations. A. A. D. Gayathri UpekshaAmarakoon et al. mentioned that a conclusive result was given, as the C677T genotype in its homozygous wild type condition, renders the individual at no risk, regardless of the genetic condition at the 1298 position. Similarly, the homozygous mutant of C677T renders the individual at risk and does not depend on the 1298 position genotype. C677T variant is generally accepted to contribute to decreased enzyme activity and ultimately confers increased susceptibility to ischemic stroke. C677T variant is generally accepted to contribute to decreased enzyme activity and ultimately confers increased susceptibility to ischemic stroke. This meta-study is consistent with previous study of meta-analysis, which might support that the MTHFR C677T mutation is likely to be a direct genetic risk factor of ischemic stroke and TT genotype would become a promising biomarker for the early detection and prediction of the prognosis of ischemic stroke as well as regarding to safely conducting future prospects of research in the elderly population.

### Thymidylate synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene polymorphisms: relationships with 5-fluorouracil sensitivity [^114Up3KU]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In the context of cancer treatment, pharmacogenetic exploration may result, in the future, in the replacement of tedious and heavy phenotypic explorations either at blood level (pharmacokinetics) or at tumour level (prognostic/predictive markers) by genetic analyses performed on easily obtainable DNA samples from normal cells (blood or oral cavity brushing for instance). The observation that pharmacogenetic status faithfully reflects phenotypic changes at the target level is a prerequisite of clinical pharmacogenetic applications. In fact, from a theoretical point of view, genetic polymorphisms are identical in all tissues. However, the possibility of a clonal selection emerging from a heterozygous subject during the process of carcinogenesis cannot be ruled out. This strengthens the need to examine the impact of cancer-treatment-related gene polymorphisms at the tumoral target itself.

The aim of the present study was thus to analyse the impact at tumoral target level of polymorphisms of two major genes related to DNA synthesis, namely TS and MTHFR polymorphisms, which may influence FU cytotoxicity. To our knowledge, the present experimental study is the first one designed for this purpose. Moreover, the present model was specially controlled for reduced folate status (folate-free medium supplemented with physiological-compatible CH 2 FH 4 concentrations) and experiments were conducted both in the absence and presence of optimal FA concentrations, in order to mimic the two opposite situations regarding FA supplementation in FU-based treated patients. To this end, we closely explored a panel of 19 cancer cell lines expressing spontaneous FU sensitivity and covering the major fluoropyrimidine-treated localisations (digestive tract, breast, head and neck). The 5′ TS and C677T MTHFR genotype frequencies were in the range of those reported in Caucasian populations, strengthening the relevance of the present model. The 3′TS and A1298C MTHFR polymorphisms have been less extensively studied in Caucasian populations, thus frequency comparisons with published data were difficult to perform. The chosen experimental approach did not allow allelotype analyses to be performed, since such analyses require large population studies.

### Dual mutation (MTHFR A1298C with PAI (4G) mutation) manifesting with bilateral lower limb gangrene in a neonate [^1115wR5c]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Neonates are at highest risk of thrombosis among paediatric patients. The relative prothrombotic state in a well neonate is compensated by other factors preventing spontaneous thrombosis; however, in a neonate with genetic predisposition, the balance is tilted predisposing them to a life-threatening thrombotic episode. We describe a rare case of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase A1298C (homozygous) mutation along with plasminogen activator inhibitor (4G) mutation in a neonate who developed bilateral lower limb gangrene following thrombosis of the iliac vessels without any triggering factor. The neonate underwent thrombectomy as debulking measure along with thrombolytic therapy followed by unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin which is still being continued along with oral aspirin. The neonate had to undergo amputation of both the involved lower limbs in view of dry gangrene. This case highlights that the dual mutations causing the prothrombotic state predispose the individual to the spontaneous life-threatening thrombotic episode as compared with the single mutation.

### MTHFR gene mutations: a potential marker of late-onset Alzheimer's disease? [^113DLosB]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Recent epigenome-wide association studies have confirmed the importance of epigenetic effects mediated by DNA methylation in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Metabolic folate pathways and methyl donor reactions facilitated by B-group vitamins may be critical in the pathogenesis of LOAD. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations were studied in consecutive Alzheimer's Disease & Memory Clinic patients up to December 2014. DNA analyses of MTHFR-C667T and - A1298C homozygous and heterozygous polymorphisms in 93 consecutive elderly patients revealed high prevalence of MTHFR mutations (92.5%). Findings require confirmation in a larger series, but MTHFR mutations may become a LOAD marker, opening novel possibilities for prevention and treatment.

### Mutations in the MTHFR gene are not associated with methotrexate intolerance in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^115Wxfbe]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Demographic data of the 196 patients included in the study as shown in Table 1. There were 90 (90/196 = 46%) patients who were considered MTX intolerant (MISS: median 11, range 6–32). Table 2 shows univariate analysis of demographic and clinical factors on presence of MTX intolerance. Disease duration was significantly associated with occurrence of MTX intolerance. No other factors showed any significant correlation, although there were non-significant correlations with age, duration of MTX treatment and folic acid supplementation. Higher doses of MTX were non-significantly correlated with a lower frequency of MTX intolerance (p = 0.026); there was an inverse correlation between age and MTX dose/m² BSA (r² = 0.788, p < 0.001)

DNA analyses were done in 168 patients to determine C677T and A1298C genotypes. Demographic and clinical factors were also analyzed on these patients alone, with similar results (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4). Among these, 40% of patients were heterozygous, and 8% homozygous for the C677T mutation of the MTHFR gene, 48% of patients were heterozygous, and 14% homozygous for the A1298C mutation; these allele frequencies are comparable to published data.

Compared to the homozygous wild type, MTX intolerance was not found significantly more frequently in patients with hetero- and homozygous (46% vs. 54%, p = 0.285) or homozygous (9% vs. 8%, p = 1.000) C677T mutations, nor in patients with hetero- and homozygous (64% vs.58%, p = 0.436) or homozygous (16% vs. 11%, p = 0.386) A1298C mutations. Compound heterozygous mutations for C677T and A1298C were also not significantly more frequent in patients with MTX intolerance (15% vs. 17%, p = 0.845) (Fig. 1). Analysis of the correlation between number of mutations to the MISS score did not yield a statistically significant correlation (p = 0.441) (Fig. 2).

### Homocysteine levels are associated with MTHFR A1298C polymorphism in Indian population [^112j17QB]. Journal of Human Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

An elevated level of homocysteine is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and is associated with other complex disorders. Homocysteine levels can be elevated due to dietary and/or genetic factors. A majority of Indian population have a low level of vitamin B12 (presumably due to vegetarian diet) — a critical nutritional factor, deficiency of which results in hyperhomocysteinemia. Hence, polymorphisms in the genes responsible for homocysteine metabolism can be perceived to have a greater impact in relation to hyperhomocysteinemia in Indian population. For this reason, the effects of diet and/or methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism were assessed in 200 individuals having varying homocysteine levels. Homocysteine levels were significantly elevated in individuals adhering to a vegetarian diet (P = 0.019) or having MTHFR A1298C polymorphism (P = 0.006). The minor allele frequency (MAF) of MTHFR C677T and A1298C was 0.15 and 0.44 respectively in this cohort. Since the MAF of these polymorphisms differed considerably from Caucasian and other Asian populations, frequencies of these polymorphisms were also determined in more than 400 individuals from different ethnic populations, selected from the entire country based on their geographical location and linguistic lineage, and was found to be similar to that of our cohort. The fact that MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is significantly associated with homocysteine levels, and that the CC genotype is present at a higher frequency in the Indian population, makes it extremely relevant in terms of its potential impact on hyperhomocysteinemia.

### Allelic distribution of genes for apolipoprotein E and MTHFR in patients with Alzheimer's disease and their epistatic interaction [^1165zXsy]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The second gene of interest was the MTHFR gene encoding the MTHFR enzyme. We confirmed that there is a high frequency of C677T (41.8% CT, 7.3% TT) and A1298C polymorphisms (41.8% AC, 8.8% CC) in Slovak seniors without cognitive deficit (control group). This finding is consistent with a larger study conducted by Petrovič et al. where similar allele and genotype frequencies were found on a sample of 1180 people –C677T (44.3% CT, 11.0% TT) and A1298C (41.9% AC, 8.0% CC) (unpublished data). Interestingly, similar frequencies of CC genotype of A1298C (9.4%) in Caucasians were reported by Kummar et al. However, among different ethnic groups, different results in the frequencies of the CC genotype of A1298C have been reported: a rate of 16.8% reported for India is much higher than that observed among the Chinese (3.3%) and Japanese (1.6%) populations. Likewise, there is no consensus in the literature about the effect of A1298C polymorphism in the development of AD. In the Mansouri's study, CC genotype of A1298C polymorphism significantly increased the risk for the development of AD, while in the Liu 's study, there was no significant association between A1298C polymorphism and increased risk of AD.

The frequency of variant alleles T of C677T polymorphism and C of A1298C polymorphism, as well as the frequency of the CT genotype of C677T (polymorphism in heterozygous state), was significantly higher in the AD group compared with the control group. However, a more critical result is the significantly higher frequency of both polymorphisms in the homozygous state in patients with AD versus the controls (TT genotype C677T 14.2% versus 7.3%, and CC genotype A1298C 13.5% versus 8.8%). The presence of the TT genotype in C677T increased the OR to 2.5, and that of the CC genotype in A1298C polymorphism increased the OR to 1.8. Regression analysis confirmed ɛ 4 allele of APOE as strongest risk factor for AD followed by TT genotype of rs1801133 and CC genotype of rs1801131. The OR for AD of homozygous carriers of both polymorphisms was slightly higher compared to those of previous studies, e.g. Mansoori et al.

### Different roles of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in colorectal adenoma and colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis [^113BYVcz]. Journal of Human Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

Association studies on the MTHFR polymorphisms (C677T and A1298C) in colorectal cancer (CRC) and colorectal adenoma have shown conflicting results. We performed a meta-analysis to better assess the purported associations. Overall, the 677T allele (10,131 patients and 15,362 controls) showed a small but significant protective effect against CRC compared to the 677C allele [P = 0.0003, odds ratio (OR) = 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89–0.98, P = 0.22 (for heterogeneity)] for a worldwide population. Meta-analyses of other genetic contrasts suggested that the 677T allele is more likely to affect CRC in a recessive genetic model worldwide (P < 0.0001, OR = 0.86; 95% CI 0.76–0.96, P = 0.06) and in Asians (P = 0.0005, OR = 0.75; 95% CI 0.64–0.88, P = 0.71). Similarly, we found a significantly decreased risk of CRC for 1298C polymorphism (4,764 CRC patients and 6,592 controls) for a recessive genetic model worldwide (P = 0.005, OR = 0.81; 95% CI 0.70–0.94, P = 0.40) and in Caucasians (P = 0.04, OR = 0.75 95% CI 0.57–0.99, P = 0.35). No evidence of association of C677T (4,616 patients and 6,338 controls) and A1298C (1,272 patients and 1,684 controls) with colorectal adenoma were found. The evidence accumulated suggests that MTHFR may represent a low-penetrance susceptible gene for CRC, and that the two polymorphisms might protect against colorectal adenoma developing into cancer. A larger single study is required to further evaluate gene-gene and gene-environment interactions for MTHFR polymorphisms and the cancer risk in a specific population.

### A meta-analysis of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children [^1113x31p]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C polymorphisms have been implicated in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk, but previously published studies were inconsistent and recent meta-analyses were not adequate.

Procedures

In a meta-analysis of 21 publications with 4,706 cases and 7,414 controls, we used more stringent inclusion method and summarized data on associations between MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and childhood ALL risk.

Results

We found an overall association between 677T variant genotypes and reduced childhood ALL risk. Specifically, in the dominant genetic model, an association was found in a fixed-effect (TT+CT vs. CC: OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.85–0.99) but not random-effect model, whereas such an association was observed in both homozygote genetic model (TT vs. CC: OR = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.70–0.93 by fixed effects and OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.65–0.93 by random effects) and recessive genetic model (TT vs. CC+CT: OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.72–0.95 by fixed effects and OR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.73–0.97 by random effects). These associations were also observed in subgroups by ethnicity: for Asians in all models except for the dominant genetic model by random effect and for Caucasians in all models except for the recessive genetic model. However, the A1298C polymorphism did not appear to have an effect on childhood ALL risk.

Conclusions

These results suggest that the MTHFR C677T, but not A1298C, polymorphism is a potential biomarker for childhood ALL risk.

### Effect of the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms on survival in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD: a prospective study [^115WFxjU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Abnormalities in the gene regulating methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) are associated with increased homocysteine levels and increased mortality in normal and chronic kidney disease (CKD) populations.

Study Design

Gene association study.

Setting & Participants

This was a substudy of 677 patients from 21 Veterans Affairs medical centers participating in a randomized clinical trial (Homocysteinemia in Kidney and End-Stage Renal Disease [HOST]) of the effect on all-cause mortality of vitamin-induced lowering of plasma homocysteine levels. Of 677 patients, 213 (31%) were treated by using dialysis (end-stage renal disease [ESRD]) and 464 (69%) had a Cockcroft-Gault estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min (advanced CKD).

Predictor

Polymorphisms C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) of the MTHFR gene.

Outcomes

Unadjusted and adjusted all-cause mortality.

Measurements

DNA was extracted from blood samples and amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction.

Results

The adjusted hazard ratio in a recessive model of the relationship between the C677T polymorphism and all-cause mortality in all patients was 1.47 (95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 2.16; P = 0.05). In patients with ESRD with the mutant TT genotype, the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in all patients was 2.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 4.84; P = 0.03); patients with advanced CKD showed a similar, although not significant, trend. The risk of myocardial infarction (P = 0.05) and composite risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, lower-extremity amputation, and mortality (P = 0.02) were greater in patients with ESRD with the mutant T allele at nucleotide 677. The overall relationship between the A1298C polymorphism and mortality was not significant (P = 0.6).

Limitations

Participants were 98% men; DNA samples were not obtained at enrollment in HOST; linkage disequilibrium with another causal polymorphism is a potential confounding factor; and power was reduced by the limited number of participants.

Conclusions

These findings provide additional support for the hypothesis that the mutant TT genotype at nucleotide 677 of the gene regulating MTHFR activity may increase the mortality risk in patients with ESRD.

### Association between MTHFR C677T / A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis [^116ibnLN]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Relevant and up to date literature published prior to January 26, 2020 were selected for examining the correlation between MTHFR polymorphism (C677T and A1298C) and ASD risk in this meta-analysis. The findings of this study exhibit that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is a susceptibility factor of ASD, but MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is not linked with ASD susceptibility.

Several meta-analytic studies on the correlation between C677T polymorphism of MTHFR and ASD risk have been conducted. Frustaci et al. studied six articles, which consisted of 877 cases and 939 controls, mainly Caucasians, and found a remarkable correlation between C677T polymorphism of MTHFR and ASD risk. Pu et al. investigated eight articles involving 1672 cases and 6760 controls, also mainly Caucasians, evidenced a significant risk on the T allele mutation of MTHFR C677T in ASD. Rai et al. investigated 1978 cases and 7257 controls (Caucasians: 1355 cases and 6460 controls; Asians: 623 cases and 797 controls) in 13 studies and found that C677T polymorphism of MTHFR is a risk factor for ASD susceptibility as well. Similarly, the current meta-analysis enrolled 2609 cases and 7496 controls (Caucasian: 1786 cases and 6499 controls, Asian: 823 cases and 997 controls) from 15 selected literature, further confirmed the association between C677T polymorphism of MTHFR and ASD susceptibility.

A previous meta-analysis, conducted on the correlation between A1298C polymorphism of MTHFR and ASD risk (included five literatures; 1470 cases and 1060 controls; Caucasians: 1332 cases and 922 controls, Asians: 138 cases and 138 controls, respectively) reported that A1298C polymorphism of MTHFR is remarkably linked to reduced ASD risk but only in the recessive model.

In the present meta-analysis, eight of the selected articles had enrolled 1961 cases and 1652 controls (Caucasians: 1387 cases and 991 controls, Asians: 574 cases and 661 controls), and it was recognized that A1298C polymorphism of MTHFR was not correlated with ASD susceptibility. However, Khalil et al. (42 cases and 48 controls) and El-Baz et al. (31 cases and 39 controls) revealed that MTHFR A1298C polymorphism represented a risk factor in association with ASD. This disagreement may be caused by small samples in the study.

### ACMG practice guideline: lack of evidence for MTHFR polymorphism testing [^115gkgpp]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

MTHFR polymorphism testing is frequently ordered by physicians as part of the clinical evaluation for thrombophilia. It was previously hypothesized that reduced enzyme activity of MTHFR led to mild hyperhomocysteinemia which led to an increased risk for venous thromboembolism, coronary heart disease, and recurrent pregnancy loss. Recent meta-analyses have disproven an association between hyperhomocysteinemia and risk for coronary heart disease and between MTHFR polymorphism status and risk for venous t-hromboembolism. There is growing evidence that MTHFR polymorphism testing has minimal clinical utility and, therefore should not be ordered as a part of a routine evaluation for thrombophilia.

### Global and population-specific association of MTHFR polymorphisms with preterm birth risk: a consolidated analysis of 44 studies [^114mixLQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our pooled data show a significant association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and PTB, especially in Asian and Indian populations, while no such association was found in Caucasian cohorts. Conversely, the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism did not correlate with PTB risk, indicating its genetic influence is likely minimal. These findings highlight the importance of considering population-specific factors in the genetic epidemiology of PTB, as genetic influences can vary significantly between populations. This underscores the necessity of incorporating genetic backgrounds in research and clinical efforts to understand and manage PTB risks.

### Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and psychiatric diseases [^111SKzmV]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Studies of sex differences in MTHFR polymorphism might provide some insights for the divergent results from various studies of psychiatric disorders. A strong association between 677T allele and male patients with schizophrenia compared female patients suggest that 677T allele might represent different liability in genders. While little is known on the sex differences in MTHFR polymorphisms, sex hormones, such as estrogen is known to play a protective effect in female patients with schizophrenia as for the impact of neurodevelopment and social maturation. On the other hand, testosterone may increase male vulnerability to an adverse illness course compared to estrogen, attributed to its narrower and sometimes unfavorable neuroprotection and neurotransmitter modulation profile. Furthermore, progesterone is reported to benefit neurocognition though enhancement of dopamine release in human males and may also have relevance in male physical and mental health while enhancing the benefits of estrogen through potentiation of estrogen-primed effects on dopamine receptors in male schizophrenic patients.

Except for the C677T, there is another site of MTHFR polymorphisms associated with psychiatric disorders. A study with patients of schizophrenia and control subjects showed an association between the A1298C allele and schizophrenia. Another research including 111 families, demonstrated that deficient MTHFR enzyme activity in pregnant women was related to the A1298C variant, which was associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia in the offsprings.

Studies of individual with both SNPs (C677T and A1298C) showed that subjects with heterozygosity for both mutations resulted in an even lower MTHFR activity than heterozygosity for single MTHFR mutations, while no subjects carry both homozygote for MTHFR mutations regardless which SNPsFurthermore, There were studies of multiple polymorphisms of one-carbon metabolism and schizophrenia symptoms showed an increase negative symptoms severity with increase of risk alleles, suggesting a cumulative effects of risk SNPs in one-carbon metabolism.

### An evidence-based approach to globally assess the covariate-dependent effect of the MTHFR single nucleotide polymorphism rs1801133 on blood homocysteine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1113zMDS]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The single nucleotide polymorphism of the gene 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T (or rs1801133) is the most established genetic factor that increases plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and consequently results in hyperhomocysteinemia. Yet, given the limited penetrance of this genetic variant, it is necessary to individually predict the risk of hyperhomocysteinemia for an rs1801133 carrier.

Objective

We hypothesized that variability in this genetic risk is largely due to the presence of factors (covariates) that serve as effect modifiers, confounders, or both, such as folic acid (FA) intake, and aimed to assess this risk in the complex context of these covariates.

Design

We systematically extracted from published studies the data on tHcy, rs1801133, and any previously reported rs1801133 covariates. The resulting metadata set was first used to analyze the covariates' modifying effect by meta-regression and other statistical means. Subsequently, we controlled for this modifying effect by genotype-stratifying tHcy data and analyzed the variability in the risk resulting from the confounding of covariates.

Results

The data set contains data on 36 rs1801133 covariates that were collected from 114,799 participants and 256 qualified studies, among which 6 covariates (sex, age, race, FA intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption) are the most frequently informed and therefore included for statistical analysis. The effect of rs1801133 on tHcy exhibits significant variability that can be attributed to effect modification as well as confounding by these covariates. Via statistical modeling, we predicted the covariate-dependent risk of tHcy elevation and hyperhomocysteinemia in a systematic manner.

Conclusions

We showed an evidence-based approach that globally assesses the covariate-dependent effect of rs1801133 on tHcy. The results should assist clinicians in interpreting the rs1801133 data from genetic testing for their patients. Such information is also important for the public, who increasingly receive genetic data from commercial services without interpretation of its clinical relevance. This study was registered at Research Registry with the registration number reviewregistry328.

### Mutations in the MTHFR gene are not associated with methotrexate intolerance in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^114qdm6C]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

MTX is rapidly metabolized and in low-dose therapy reaches levels of less than 5 μmol/l within 24 h. Mutations in the MTHFR gene cause elevated levels of MTX in children with high-dose therapy, and in consequence, a higher and more prolonged exposure to MTX. The most frequent mutations in the MTHFR gene, C677T and especially A1298 C, are associated with a higher toxicity in children and adults treated with high-dose MTX therapy. Influence of MTHFR on toxicity in patients treated with low-dose MTX treatment (10–15 mg/m²/week) is reported in some populations, but a recent meta-analysis found no clear correlation. The C677T and A1298C mutations in the MTHFR gene also lead to higher plasma homocysteine levels, and homocysteine plasma levels have been shown to increase according to the number of mutations in an individual. However, the lack of association between mutations in the MTHFR gene and MTX intolerance in this study render elevated levels of MTX and homocysteine unlikely candidates as an unconditioned stimulus in MTX intolerance.

Patients frequently receive antiemetics and a variety of home remedies in conjunction with MTX intake which might have confounded the results of this study. However, an analysis of the same patients published elsewhere showed no significant effect of these countermeasures. C677T and A1298C are only two mutations in the MTX metabolism pathway, although they are by far the most common. It is possible that other genetic mutations in the pathway might be associated with MTX intolerance; a variety of mutations have been tested on a similar, but smaller population with no association. The complete lack of association of the two most common mutations shown in this study renders a significant contribution to MTX intolerance by less frequent mutations unlikely. The overall strength of this study is the prospective investigation of a large population of JIA patients, allowing confidence in ruling out possible associations between these two loci and MTX intolerance.

In conclusion, mutations in the MTHFR gene, and by extension levels of MTX and homocysteine, do not play a role in the genesis of MTX intolerance. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the unconditioned stimulus underlying the conditioned response to MTX that affects a large proportion of JIA patients on this medication.

### Global and population-specific association of MTHFR polymorphisms with preterm birth risk: a consolidated analysis of 44 studies [^111CX31n]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

MTHFR polymorphisms, particularly C677T, are significantly linked to PTB in Asian populations, whereas the A1298C variant does not show the same effect. This difference can be attributed to factors like genetic prevalence, metabolic implications, and study methodologies. The C677T variant is more prevalent in Asians, and research demonstrates that individuals with the TT or CT genotypes face a higher risk of PTB compared to those with the CC genotype. Research confirms that the maternal MTHFR C677T polymorphism is associated with a higher risk of PTB across various genetic models. The mechanism is believed to involve the C677T variant, which reduces MTHFR enzyme stability and activity, thereby raising homocysteine levels in the body. High homocysteine concentrations are associated with vascular complications during pregnancy, potentially impairing placental function and increasing PTB likelihood. In contrast, the A1298C polymorphism is less prevalent in Asian populations, with allele frequencies between 1% and 4%, which likely diminishes its impact on pregnancy outcomes. Investigations into the A1298C variant have generally shown weak correlations with PTB or other adverse pregnancy outcomes, indicating that its effects are overshadowed by those of C677T. Additionally, geographical distribution plays a significant role, as the C677T variant exhibits considerable variability across regions like China, correlating with differences in pregnancy complications, while the A1298C polymorphism remains relatively stable across populations. These findings have important public health and genetic counseling implications, as understanding the MTHFR C677T polymorphism's association with PTB can enhance risk assessment and management strategies for pregnant women in Asian populations, whereas the A1298C variant appears less relevant in this context.

### Genetic polymorphisms in venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after total hip arthroplasty: a pilot study [^113tMSPp]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) after major orthopaedic surgery is a substantial concern. We asked whether the single or combined presence of thrombophilic genetic polymorphisms might further increase the already high risk for venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE) after THA. We therefore compared the prevalence of factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 4G/5G polymorphisms between 50 patients with symptomatic DVT within 3 weeks after elective THA and an asymptomatic control group of 85 patients. We found no major difference for the presence of a single mutation between the groups. Factor V Leiden and homozygous MTHFR C667T mutations were of borderline significance with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 3.73 (0.89–15.63) and 2.93 (0.92–9.29), respectively. Patients with homozygous or combined heterozygous status of MTHFR C677T and A1298C mutation had a higher frequency of DVT after elective THA (odds ratio, 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.32–6.35) than those with wild-type. The presence of a single mutation may not further increase the already high risk for symptomatic DVT after THA, whereas combinations of mutations of distinct polymorphisms might be important. However, prospective studies with a larger number of patients are needed before we would recommend preoperative screening.

### Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene, homocysteine and coronary artery disease: the A1298C polymorphism does matter. inferences from a case study (madeira, Portugal) [^113GGUxF]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Elevated levels of plasma homocysteine, an independent risk factor and a strong predictor of mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), can result from nutritional deficiencies or genetic errors, including methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C polymorphisms. The contribution of these polymorphisms in the development of CAD remains controversial. We analysed the impact of MTHFR C677T and A1298C on fasting homocysteine and CAD in 298 CAD patients proved by angiography and 510 control subjects from the Island of Madeira (Portugal). After adjustment for other risk factors, plasma homocysteine remained independently correlated with CAD. Serum homocysteine was significantly higher in individuals with 677TT and 1298AA genotypes. There was no difference in the distribution of MTHFR677 genotypes between cases and controls but a significant increase in 1298AA prevalence was found in CAD patients. In spite of the clear effect of C677T mutation on elevated homocysteine levels we only found an association between 1298AA genotype and CAD in this population. The simultaneous presence of 677CT and 1298AA genotypes provides a significant risk of developing the disease, while the 1298AC genotype, combined with 677CC, shows a significant trend towards a decrease in CAD occurrence. The data shows an independent association between elevated levels of homocysteine and CAD. Both MTHFR polymorphisms are associated with increased fasting homocysteine (677TT and 1298AA genotypes), but only the 1298AA variant shows an increased prevalence in CAD group. Odds ratio seem to indicate that individuals with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype and the 677CT/1298AA compound genotype had a 1.6-fold increased risk for developing CAD suggesting a possible association of MTHFR polymorphisms with the risk of CAD in Madeira population.

### Association between MTHFR C677T / A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis [^112siibm]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and identification of studies

Scientific literature published before January 26, 2020, in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, WanFang datebase, and CNKI database were searched using specific search terms (Supplement file 1). The equivalent Chinese terms were used in the Chinese databases. Moreover, we retrieved related articles from the selected literature references to replenish data that had not been identified in the initial search. All full-text literature were scrutinized to determine whether the papers to be included.

Selection criteria

The following criteria had to be satisfied by the studies to be incorporated in this meta-analysis: (1) Original studies on the correlation between MTHFR polymorphism (C677T/A1298C) and ASD; (2) Cohort or case-control designs; (3) All genotype frequency information is available; (4) Diagnostic criteria of ASD described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th or 5th edition), and/or Childhood Autism Rating Scale. Certain earlier papers referred to the Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd edition). The exclusion criteria comprised the following: (1) Researches on the correlation between MTHFR polymorphism (C677T/A1298C) and ASD that are not original; (2) Studies that lack data and complete information; (3) Replicated studies; (4) Review studies.

Data extraction

Two investigators, namely, Yan Li and Shuang Qiu, extracted all the relevant data with the help of a standardized protocol and data collection form. From every qualified study, data such as the name of the first author, year of publication, country, study population (ethnicity), study design, the definition of ASD, sample size of cases and controls, genotyping method, genotype information, and allele frequencies were gathered and documented. Disparities in the study selection were resolved through discussion or consensus with the third investigator (Yawen Liu). The corresponding authors of articles with missing data were emailed for the required data.

### Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism A1298C (glu429Ala) predicts decline in renal function over time in the African-American study of kidney disease and hypertension (AASK) trial and veterans affairs hypertension cohort (VAHC) [^1159qxRD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with increased venous thrombosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mutations in the human methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene have been associated with increased homocysteine levels and risks of CVD in various populations including those with kidney disease. Here, we evaluated the influence of MTHFR variants on progressive loss of kidney function.

Methods

We analyzed 821 subjects with hypertensive nephrosclerosis from the longitudinal National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Trial to determine whether decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over ∼4.2 years was predicted by common genetic variation within MTHFR at non-synonymous positions C677T (Ala222Val) and A1298C (Glu429Ala) or by MTHFR haplotypes. The effect on GFR decline was then supported by a study of 1333 subjects from the San Diego Veterans Affairs Hypertension Cohort (VAHC), followed over ∼4.5 years. Linear effect models were utilized to determine both genotype [single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)] and genotype (SNP)-by-time interactions.

Results

In AASK, the polymorphism at A1298C predicted the rate of GFR decline: A1298/A1298 major allele homozygosity resulted in a less pronounced decline of GFR, with a significant SNP-by-time interaction. An independent follow-up study in the San Diego VAHC subjects supports that A1298/A1298 homozygotes have the greatest estimated GFR throughout the study. Haplotype analysis with C677T yielded concurring results.

Conclusion

We conclude that the MTHFR-coding polymorphism at A1298C is associated with renal decline in African-Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis and is supported by a veteran cohort with a primary care diagnosis of hypertension. Further investigation is needed to confirm such findings and to determine what molecular mechanism may contribute to this association.

### Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene C677T and A1298C polymorphisms, plasma homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12 levels and the extent of coronary artery disease [^115pqhTt]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The question of whether mild hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) has long been debated and is still unclear. We investigated whether there is a link between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T and A1298C polymorphisms or plasma homocysteine and CAD. This is a case-control study that included 2,121 consecutive patients (cases) with angiographically proved CAD and 617 patients without CAD (controls). MTHFR gene C677T and A1298C polymorphisms, plasma homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B(12) concentrations were determined and coronary angiography was performed in all subjects. The distribution of MTHFR gene C677T genotypes in patients (or controls) was: CC-genotype in 915 cases, 43.1% (266 controls, 43.1%); CT-genotype in 955 cases, 45.0%, (283 controls, 45.9%); and TT-genotype in 251 cases, 11.9% (68 controls, 11.0%) (p = 0.84). The distribution of MTHFR gene A1298C genotypes in patients (or controls) was: AA-genotype in 973 cases, 45.9% (281 controls, 45.5%); AC-genotype in 905 cases, 42.7% (284 controls, 46.0%); and CC-genotype in 243 cases, 11.4% (52 controls, 8.5%) (p = 0.07). Patients with CAD had higher levels of plasma homocysteine (12.9 ± 5.1 vs 11.9 ± 4.5 micromol/L, p < 0.001) and lower levels of folate (9.5 ± 3.1 vs 9.9 ± 3.8 ng/ml, p = 0.008) than controls. After adjustment for other risk factors for CAD, plasma homocysteine (p = 0.89), MTHFR gene C677T (p = 0.38), or A1298C polymorphisms (p = 0.13) were not independent correlates of CAD. This study demonstrated that MTHFR gene C677T or A1298C polymorphisms are not associated with the presence of angiographic CAD. Although there is an apparent association between elevated levels of homocysteine and CAD, this association is not independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors.

MTHFR

MTHFR gene

In humans, the MTHFR resides on chromosome 1 location p36.3 and was originally described as containing 12 exons as shown in Fig. 1. Human MTHFR transcripts are respectively at 2.2 kb, 7.5 kb, and 9.5 kb. The cDNA of 2.2 kb-fragment sequence codes for a 656 residue and 70–77 kDa protein. The cDNA of 7.5 kb and 9.5 kb sequence code a second isoform of 77 kDa protein. Among the exons of MTHFR, the first one is noncoding. Apart from the coding region, variable 5' and 3' noncoding regions (UTR) were identified, resulting in transcript heterogeneity. The 5' and 3' termini of the MTHFR cDNA overlap with the 5' terminus of a chloride ion channel gene and the 3' terminus of an unidentified gene, respectively. The MTHFR gene has multiple promoters and several polyadenylation sites creating 3'UTR lengths of 0.2 kb ± 5.0 kb or 0.6 kb ± 4.0 kb in human. The MTHFR gene has been identified to possess 14 common or rare single nucleotide polymorphism that are associated with enzymatic deficiency. Among them rs1801133(C677T) and rs1801131(A1298C) are most reported that may reduce the MTHFR activity in various degrees. For C677T, the enzyme activity of heterozygous and homozygous mutant individuals are respectively 67 and 25% of the wild-type ones. And for A1298C, the enzyme activity of heterozygous and homozygous mutant individuals are respectively 83 and 61% of the wild-type subjects, as shown in Fig. 1.

### Effects of ocufolin on retinal microvasculature in patients with mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy carrying polymorphisms of the MTHFR gene [^116xFU7N]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Results

Study population and baseline clinical characteristics

Sixteen eyes of eight patients with DR+MTHFRP and 15 eyes of 15 NC subjects were imaged. The majority of patients were male (n = 6) with well-controlled hypertension (n = 5). The mean HbA1c in DR+MTHFRP patients was 7.6% ± 0.9% (range 6.9–8.1). The mean diabetic duration was 15 ± 7 years (range 5–25). Four patients carried C677T mutation. Two patients carried the A1298C mutation, and two patients carried both C677T/A1298C (compound heterozygous mutations) (table 2).

Clinical parameters (BCVA)

Significant progressive improvement of BCVA was observed at 4M and 6M in all patients receiving Ocufolin compared with baseline values. At 6M, BCVA approached but did not reach that of non-diabetic NC (all p < 0.05; figure 4). The average BCVA (LogMAR) at baseline, 4M, and 6M is 0.14 ± 0.08, 0.10 ± 0.09, and 0.09 ± 0.09, respectively. Table 3 shows the BCVA Snellen and logMAR values for each patient at baseline, 4 months, and 6 months.

### MTHFR polymorphisms in autoimmune diseases: mechanistic and clinical perspectives [^113bq6eA]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene encodes a crucial enzyme in folate metabolism, serving as a central regulator of homocysteine homeostasis and one‑carbon metabolic pathways. This review synthesizes current evidence on the mechanistic and clinical implications of two common MTHFR polymorphisms, C677T and A1298C, in autoimmune pathogenesis. We critically examine their contributions to inflammatory responses, endothelial dysfunction, immune imbalance, and epigenetic modifications. Furthermore, we analyze population-specific associations between these variants and susceptibility to eight autoimmune disorders, genotype-phenotype correlations related to clinical manifestations and comorbidities, as well as pharmacogenomic interactions influencing response to methotrexate therapy. By integrating genetic, molecular, and clinical insights, this review highlights the translational potential of MTHFR genotyping for improving risk stratification and personalized treatment strategies in autoimmune and immune-mediated inflammatory conditions.

### Effects of ocufolin on retinal microvasculature in patients with mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy carrying polymorphisms of the MTHFR gene [^115YVkKA]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

There appears to be a difference in the performance of Ocufolin between C667T and A1298C variants. C677T has been well documented to increase hypertension, homocysteine, and microangiopathy. The effects of A1298C are less well understood. A1298C is associated with decreased HDL cholesterol, miscarriage, and infertility. There is some evidence that having the C677T plus A1298C variant is associated with thromboembolism. Fekih-Mrissa et al studied 160 type 2 diabetics and found that patients having either C677T or A1298C variant were at higher risk for retinopathy than genetically normal diabetics. They found that patients with the C677T variant did not show an increase in complications, but those with A1298C did have a higher complication rate, and those having the C677T+A1298C genotype were at the highest risk for at least one complication of DR. This may support the finding that Ocufolin appeared more effective in patients who carried the A1298C variant and was clearly more effective for the C677T+A1298C genotype. The L-methylfolate component of Ocufolin is thought to offset the MTHFR reduced ability to synthesize L-methylfolate, thus lowering homocysteine and perhaps increasing HDL. This may be of therapeutic significance. A larger sample size is needed for confirmation.

### The effect of the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene on homocysteine levels in elderly men and women from the British regional heart study [^113JpCui]. Atherosclerosis (2001). Low credibility.

Total blood levels of homocysteine (tHcy) have been shown to depend on both environmental and genetic factors, and to be associated with the risk of developing atherosclerosis with its complications of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. In this study, 408 men and 346 women from two towns, Dewsbury and Maidstone were examined for tHcy levels and genotyped for the C677T and the A1298C polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. Blood tHcy was significantly higher in men from the CHD high risk town of Dewsbury (12.7 micromol/l) than in the low CHD risk town of Maidstone (11.5 micromol/l) P < 0.001, but not in women (10.7 vs. 10.5 micromol/l), with women in both towns, thus, showing significantly lower tHcy than men. There was no difference between towns in folate or vitamin B12 levels but the conventional inverse relationship with tHcy was seen. Smoking men and women from both towns had significantly higher tHcy and lower folate levels than non-smoking individuals (P < 0.001). The frequency of the 677T allele in Dewsbury was 0.35 (95% CI; 0.32–0.39) compared with 0.29 (95% CI; 0.26–0.32) in Maidstone (P < 0.01). Similar frequency difference of borderline statistical significance was seen both for men (P = 0.054) and women (P = 0.048) in both the towns, suggesting a true regional frequency difference. The effect of the 677T on tHcy was highly significant in the group as a whole with the most profound effect seen in men (12.0 micromol/l for CC vs. 14.1 micromol/l for TT, P < 0.001). By contrast, there was no significant effect of the A1298C polymorphism on tHcy, folate or vitamin B12 levels, with no evidence for an interaction with the C677T genotype. The regional differences in tHcy levels were still present after the adjustment for folate and vitamin B12 levels, smoking and the effect of the C677T polymorphism. This suggests that there may be other unidentified factors, either environmental or genetic, affecting tHcy levels, and thus potentially having an impact on the risk of developing hyperhomocysteinaemia and CHD. These observations may have a bearing on regional differences in tHcy levels and the variation in CHD risk between regions in the UK.

Overall results

Upon literature search and critical screening, about 15 studies from 125 articles were included in this meta-analysis, as already discussed in the Methods section (Fig. 1). A total of 2609 cases and 7496 controls were enrolled from the 15 articles published on the correlation between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and ASD susceptibility. Of those, only nine articles that included 1961 cases and 1652 controls qualified for the evaluation of the link between MTHFR A1298C and ASD as per the selection criteria. The characteristics of each primary study are summarized and presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and ASD

Random effect model (P h < 0.05 or I 2 > 50%) was used, and MTHFR C677T polymorphism was found to be remarkably linked to ASD susceptibility in allelic (T vs C: OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.30–2.05, p < 0.05), heterozygote (CT vs CC: OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.31–2.11, p < 0.05), homozygote (TT vs CC: OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.33–3.09, p < 0.05), dominant (TT + CT vs CC: OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.39–2.37, p < 0.05), and recessive models (TT vs CT + CC: OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.14–2.22, p < 0.05; Table 3, Fig. 2 a).

### The association between MTHFR 677C > T genotype and folate status and genomic and gene-specific DNA methylation in the colon of individuals without colorectal neoplasia [^114vrn9R]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Of the 3112 patients screened, 295 did not consent to participate and 2466 did not meet the inclusion criteria, leaving a total of 351 eligible subjects. Of these, 4 had no blood biochemistry results and 11 had abnormal liver function tests; this left a total of 336 participants for analysis (96% of those eligible). Of these, 185 (55%) were homozygous for the wild-type allele (CC) of the MTHFR 677C > T genotype, 119 (35%) carried one mutant allele (CT) and 32 (10%) were homozygous for the mutant allele (TT). Subject characteristics are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences in age, BMI, folate or alcohol intakes, or the distribution of sex, smoking, and supplement use between genotypes. The distribution of white and black subjects differed between genotypes (white: 50% CC, 39% CT, and 11% TT; black: 72% CC, 23% CT, and 4% TT). Only 60 subjects (18%) returned the food-frequency questionnaire, hence dietary folate intakes were only available for these individuals.

### Riboflavin lowers blood pressure in cardiovascular disease patients homozygous for the 677C – > T polymorphism in MTHFR [^111Qe4KE]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose was to examine the effect of intervention with riboflavin (a cofactor for MTHFR) on blood pressure in patients homozygous (TT genotype) for the common 677C→T polymorphism in MTHFR.

Methods

We investigated 197 premature cardiovascular disease patients, prescreened for the MTHFR 677C→T polymorphism, from an original cohort of 404 to select those with the TT genotype (n = 60) and a similar number with heterozygous (CT; n = 85) or wild-type (CC; n = 75) genotypes. Of these, 181 completed an intervention in which participants were randomized within each genotype group to receive 1.6 mg per day riboflavin or placebo for 16 weeks.

Results

Among patients taking one or more antihypertensive drugs at recruitment (82%), we observed that target blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg) had been achieved in only 37% patients with the TT genotype compared with 59% with the CT and 64% with the CC genotype (P < 0.001). Riboflavin intervention reduced mean blood pressure specifically in those with the TT genotype (from 144/87 to 131/80 mmHg; P < 0.05 systolic; P < 0.05 diastolic), with no response observed in the other genotype groups.

Conclusion

Riboflavin is effective in reducing blood pressure specifically in patients with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype. The findings, if confirmed, may have important implications for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.

### Genetics of ischemic stroke functional outcome [^111uSrsy]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Further negative findings outside of those encompassed in the meta-analysis include additional studies reporting no association between APOE4 and RS, or APOE4 and mRS. Interestingly, APOE4 decreases age of ischemic stroke onset, and specific cognitive testing has shown that APOE4 delays the recovery of verbal memory functioning 1-year poststroke. In addition, ε4 homozygosity leads to poststroke dementia. Nonetheless, underwhelming evidence exists regarding the effects of APOE4 and ISFO.

APOE2 is less studied in the context of stroke outcome. Broderick et al. found that ε2 carriers treated with t-PA had better 3-month outcomes (mRS); however, a general effect on poststroke recovery has not been shown, only a sex-specific association whereby male carriers of the ε2 allele experienced increased disability (3-month mRS).

MTHFR

Homocysteine is a member of the sulfur-containing amino acid metabolic pathway. Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) regenerates N⁵-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, so homocysteine can be used to replenish methionine, an essential amino acid (Fig. 3). Alterations to MTHFR efficiency can cause homocysteine buildup resulting in a multitude of pathologic effects including endothelial dysfunction, ROS generation, DNA repair suppression, and increased apoptosis. Two well-studied variants, C667T and A1298C, reduce enzyme activity by 75% and 39%, respectively in homozygous carriers. Both mutations increase ischemic stroke risk but have no known associations with poststroke recovery. He et al. examined rs868014, a SNP in the 3'-UTR, and reported increased miR-1203 binding leading to decreased MTHFR expression, heightened serum homocysteine, increased stroke incidence and severity, as well as worse functional outcomes (3-month ΔNIHSS). Interestingly, rs868014 was linked to A1298C.

### Genotype and haplotype distributions of MTHFR677C > T and 1298A > C single nucleotide polymorphisms: a meta-analysis [^116dHJjq]. Journal of Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; 677C > T and 1298A > C) in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) decrease the activity of the enzyme, leading to hyperhomocysteinemia, particularly in folate-deficient states. We calculate herein the haplotype frequencies of the MTHFR 677 and 1298 polymorphisms in pooled general populations derived from published data. We selected 16 articles that provided reliable data on combined MTHFR genotypes in general populations (n = 5389). The combined data comprised the following totals for each genotype at nucleotide positions 677 and 1298: 838 CC/AA (i.e., 677CC/1298AA), 1225 CC/AC, 489 CC/CC, 1120 CT/AA, 1093 CT/AC, 8 CT/CC, 606 TT/AA, 10 TT/AC, and 0 TT/CC. The estimated haplotype frequencies, and the fractional contribution of each, were 677C/1298A, 0.37; 677C/1298C, 0.31; 677T/1298A, 0.32; and 677T/1298C, 0.0023 to 0.0034. Thus, a vast majority of 677T alleles and 1298C alleles are associated with 1298A alleles and 677C alleles, respectively. There may be an increased frequency of the very rare cis 677T/1298C haplotype in some parts of the United Kingdom and Canada, possibly due to a founder effect. Further studies on both SNPs are needed to determine their exact role in various clinical settings.

### Assessment of genetic variants linked to susceptibility to mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis [^117YNe2a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) is a critical and life-threatening condition driven by multifactorial etiologies, including genetic predispositions. The study was designed as a single-center retrospective manner. Echocardiographic features and genetic test including factor II/prothrombin (G20210A), factor V Leiden (G1691A), factor V R2 (A4070G), apolipoprotein (Apo) B-100 (G10708A), ApoE (C112R), ApoE (R158C), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, MTHFR A1298C, factor XIII G103T (V34L), β-fibrinogen (455G > A), PAI-1 4G/5G, and HPA-1 GPIIIa (T196C) genotyping variations were assessed. We performed genetic tests on 175 patients with PVT (biologically women [n = 124, 70.9%], with a mean age of 49.8 ± 13.1 years) and 101 patients (biologically women [n = 57, 56.4%], with a mean age of 54.7 ± 13.6 years) without thrombus formation. The thrombosis group was significantly younger compared with controls (p = 0.004). The percentage of patients with mechanical aortic valves was significantly lower in the thrombosis group compared with controls (22.3% vs 34.7%, p = 0.025). A significant difference was observed between the thrombosis and control groups regarding the genotype ratios of factor II/prothrombin (G20210A) (heterozygous, 6.8% vs 1%, p = 0.043) and HPA-1 GPIIIa (T196C) (homozygous mutant, 7.8% vs 0%, p = 0.034). In addition, there was a significant association of heterozygous MTHFR (A1298C) variation with obstructive thrombosis compared with nonobstructive thrombosis (46.9% vs 29.2%, p = 0.046). In conclusion, this is the first study to report a potential association between genetic variants, including HPA-1 GPIIIa (T196C), factor II/prothrombin (G20210A), MTHFR (A1298C), and PVT, necessitating extensive further research and additional clinical consideration.

### Metabolic and genetic risk factors for migraine in children [^1142ThSd]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

Migraine can induce ischaemic stroke, and is considered an independent risk factor for stroke in the young. To date, the nature of the link between migraine and stroke is essentially unknown. Forty-five children were studied. Homocysteine levels (fasting and post methionine load), vitamin B12 and plasma folate levels, factor V Leiden, factor II G20210A, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C mutations were examined. Compared with controls, patients with migraine had higher levels of post-methionine load homocysteine values (19.5 ± 4.9 vs. 16.9 ± 1.9; P = 0.025) and significantly lower folate levels (5.8 ± 2.6 vs. 7.5 ± 2.1; P = 0.002). We found a trend toward an increased risk of migraine in subjects carrying a homozygous mutant genotype for MTHFR C677T and MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms. Genetic prothrombotic conditions do not seem to be related to migraine in the young, whereas the biochemical differences between migrainous patients and controls are an appealing topic for further investigation.

### Inherited thrombophilia polymorphisms and pregnancy outcomes in nulliparous women [^116T3q6Z]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the association between five commonly inherited thrombophilia polymorphisms and adverse pregnancy outcomes in women who had no prior history of adverse pregnancy outcomes or personal or family history of venous thromboembolism.

Methods

Healthy nulliparous women (n = 2,034) were recruited to this prospective cohort study before 22 weeks of gestation. Genotyping for factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme (MTHFR) C677T, MTHFR A1298C, and thrombomodulin polymorphism was performed. Clinicians caring for women were blinded to the results of thrombophilia tests. The primary composite outcome was the development of severe preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, stillbirth, or neonatal death.

Results

Complete molecular results and pregnancy outcome data were available in 1,707 women. These complications were experienced by 136 women (8.0%). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated two statistically significant findings. Women who carried the prothrombin gene mutation had an odds ratio of 3.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20–10.61, P = 0.02) for the development of the composite primary outcome. Homozygous carriers of the MTHFR 1298 polymorphism had an odds ratio of 0.26 (95% CI 0.08–0.86, P = 0.03). None of the other polymorphisms studied showed a significant association with the development of the primary outcome in this cohort of women.

Conclusion

Prothrombin gene mutation confers an increased risk for the development of adverse pregnancy outcomes in otherwise asymptomatic, nulliparous women, whereas homozygosity for MTHFR 1298 may protect against these complications. The majority of asymptomatic women who carry an inherited thrombophilia polymorphism have a successful pregnancy outcome.

### Association between MTHFR C677T / A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis [^112KGLbw]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the complex neurodevelopmental disorders, which has been increasingly recognized as a public health issue. It affects 9‰ of the entire population of children, and the estimated ratio between male and female (M:F) children is 4:1. The prevalence rates of ASD in terms of percentages are approximately 1.52‰ in the Middle East, 14.7‰ in the USA, 1.66‰ in China, and 6‰ in Australia.

The distinguishing features of ASD include a set of behavioral phenotypes such as social communication deficits, restrictive and repetitive behaviors, and worsened quality of life and family functioning for children with ASD and their parents. Brain and nervous system dysfunctions are indicated in ASD, which occur as a result of pathophysiological and environmental factors. Folate/homocysteine (Hcy) levels act as a risk factor in ASD, indicating the involvement of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) in ASD. Therefore, MTHFR has been the focal point of investigation on ASD, as inheritance validates the pathophysiological mechanism of ASD.

MTHFR locus has been mapped to chromosome1 (1p36.3). Conversion of 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate is performed by MTHFR, which regulates the intracellular levels of folate and Hcy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (C677T and A1298C) are associated with the decline in MTHFR activity, which is, in turn, correlated with Folate/Hcy levels. Homocysteinemia and low plasma folate are found in individuals with C677T and A1298C alleles. A reduction of approximately 50% ~ 60% in the MTHFR activity is correlated with compound heterozygosity for both C677T and A1298C. A decline in the enzymatic activity to 35% ~ 70% in homozygotes T is linked to C677T polymorphism in MTHFR. Generally, when compared to C677T mutation, A1298C mutation feebly affects MTHFR activity and Hcy and folate levels.

### Influence of nitrous oxide anesthesia, B-vitamins, and MTHFR gene polymorphisms on perioperative cardiac events: the vitamins in nitrous oxide (VINO) randomized trial [^112c7guA]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nitrous oxide causes an acute increase in plasma homocysteine that is more pronounced in patients with the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T or A1298C gene variant. In this randomized controlled trial, the authors sought to determine whether patients carrying the MTHFR C677T or A1298C variant had a higher risk for perioperative cardiac events after nitrous oxide anesthesia and whether this risk could be mitigated by B-vitamins.

Methods

The authors randomized adult patients with cardiac risk factors undergoing noncardiac surgery, to receive nitrous oxide plus intravenous B-vitamins before and after surgery, or to nitrous oxide and placebo. Serial cardiac biomarkers and 12-lead electrocardiograms were obtained. The primary study endpoint was the incidence of myocardial injury, as defined by cardiac troponin I increase within the first 72 h after surgery.

Results

A total of 500 patients completed the trial. Patients who were homozygous for either MTHFR C677T, or A1298C gene variant (n = 98; 19.6%) had no increased rate of postoperative cardiac troponin I increase compared with wild-type and heterozygous patients (11.2 vs. 14.0%; relative risk 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85–1.07; P = 0.48). B-vitamins blunted the rise in homocysteine, but had no effect on cardiac troponin I increase compared with patients receiving placebo (13.2 vs. 13.6%; relative risk 1.02; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.32; P = 0.91).

Conclusions

Neither MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene variant, nor acute homocysteine increase are associated with perioperative cardiac troponin increase after nitrous oxide anesthesia. B-vitamins blunt nitrous oxide-induced homocysteine increase but have no effect on cardiac troponin I increase.

Association between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and ASD

Random effect model (P h < 0.05 or I 2 ≥ 50%) was utilized, and no significant correlation between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and ASD susceptibility in the five genetic models was identified (allelic, dominant, recessive, heterozygote, and homozygote; all p > 0.05; Table 4, Fig. 2 b). As per the subgroup analyses, MTHFR A1298C polymorphism was found to be associated with ASD susceptibility among the states without mandatory fortification of folate: allelic model (C vs. A: OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.08–3.14, p < 0.05) and dominant model (CC + AC vs. AA: OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.16–5.15, p < 0.05). No significant correlation between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and ASD susceptibility under the other genetic models in any subgroup was found (all p > 0.05) (Table 4).

### The rs4846049 polymorphism in the 3' UTR region of thegene increases the migraine susceptibility in an Iranian population [^114yMKLv]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a painful complex neurovascular disease characterized by recurrent moderate-to-severe headaches. Increased level of homocysteine is related to dilation of cerebral vessels and endothelial injury that could trigger migraine attacks. Functional polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene affect homocysteine metabolism and, therefore, play an important role in the etiology of the disease.

Objectives

We aimed to investigate the possible association between MTHFR gene rs4846049, C677T, and A1298C polymorphisms and the risk of migraine in Iranian population.

Methods

In this genetic association study, 498 individuals were enrolled, including 223 migraine patients and 275 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using tetra-primer ARMS-PCR for rs4846049 and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism for C677T and A1298C polymorphisms.

Results

The association between rs4846049 and C677T polymorphisms and migraine was observed. For the rs4846049 polymorphism, the association was detected under a dominant model (P = 0.007; odds ratio [OR] = 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41–0.87), and for the C677T polymorphism, the TT genotype frequency was significantly different in the studied groups (P = 0.009; OR = 2.48; 95% CI, 1.25–4.92). No significant differences in the genotype or allele frequencies were found for the A1298C polymorphism between the migraineurs and controls.

Conclusion

Present data provide evidence for the association of rs4846049 and C677T polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene and migraine. Further studies are required to validate the significance of the studied genetic variations in diverse ethnic populations.

### Shifting landscapes of human MTHFR missense-variant effects [^115CL2Bs]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Here, we examine the human gene MTHFR, encoding 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, a key enzyme in the one-carbon metabolism pathway that includes the essential folate and methionine cycles. Severe MTHFR deficiency (MIM:), the most common inherited disorder of folate metabolism, has been described in more than 200 individuals, most of whom were diagnosed in infancy. Primarily a disease of the central nervous system, it can also result in thromboembolism or eye disease. In older individuals, ataxic gait, psychiatric disorders, and symptoms related to cerebrovascular events have been reported. Biochemically, severe MTHFR deficiency is associated with massive accumulation of homocysteine in the blood (hyperhomocysteinemia), i.e. plasma homocysteine elevated up to 60–320 μM; reference range typically 5–15 μM) together with low or low-normal plasma methionine. In contrast to severe deficiency, some variants in MTHFR yield mild hyperhomocysteinemia (15–30 μM), which increases the risk of neural-tube birth defects and has been reported to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, although the latter association is controversial, and of neural-tube birth defects. Dietary supplementation with folinate can remediate symptoms for mild hyperhomocysteinemia cases.

MTHFR is most widely known because of the common variant p. Ala222Val, which is carried by roughly half of all humans (global allele frequency 31%, gnomAD). This variant, which corresponds to c.665C > T (sometimes noted as "c.677C > T" on the basis of outdated coding sequence annotation), decreases MTHFR's thermostability and affinity to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and yields reduced enzyme activity at low substrate availability. The modestly increased plasma homocysteine levels associated with p. Ala222Val are readily ameliorated by increased dietary folate. Although pregnant women who are homozygous for c.665C > T (p. Ala222Val) are advised to follow a high-folate diet to avoid neural-tube birth defects, this advice is commonly given to all pregnant women irrespective of p. Ala222Val status, and whether there are broader health effects of the p. Ala222Val variant remains controversial. However, approximately one-third of rare or private variants in MTHFR occur in cis with p. Ala222Val, and the extent to which p. Ala222Val modulates the effects of other MTHFR variants or their responsiveness to folinate supplementation is unclear, further complicating MTHFR variant interpretation.

### Effects of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase () polymorphisms on retinal tissue perfusion in mild diabetic retinopathy patients receiving the medical food, ocufolin [^114Pm6H5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

This may be viewed in the context of a study of Tunisian patients with type 2 diabetes and MTHFR variants demonstrating that either variant increased the risk of DR. Double heterozygotes (A1298CC, C677TT, or A1298C/C677T) had the greatest risk for DR and complications. MTHFR gene mutations are common in the US, with the MTHFR C677T polymorphism prevalence alone being greater than 40%. These MTHFR polymorphisms cause reduced enzyme activity and reduced synthesis of L-methylfolate, leading to a deficiency in the methylation process and resulting in elevated plasma homocysteine. It appears that different MTHFR mutations may have different effects on disease onset, progression, and intervention efficacy. Riboflavin insufficiency further impairs methylation, driving up plasma homocysteine. Biochemically the C677T polymorphism requires a higher level of riboflavin to recycle tetrahydrofolate into L-methylfolate, an effect magnified by riboflavin insufficiency. Horigan et aldemonstrated that in patients with the common MTHFR polymorphism C677T, there is an increase in difficult-to-treat hypertension, which responds to the administration of riboflavin. This is clinically very significant for patients with DR because DR is very sensitive to the degree of hypertension. Elias and Brown recommend the medical food as a supplemental way to address resistant hypertension because of the blood pressure-lowering benefits of riboflavin, L-methylfolate, and n-acetylcysteine.

Hyperhomocysteinemia and MTHFR C677T in pregnancy — hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased risk of VTE in nonpregnant women, but homozygosity for MTHFR C677T alone does not appear to increase VTE risk in pregnant women.

### Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and psychiatric diseases [^115GmtQN]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

In terms of the relationship between MTHFR and ADHA, only very few studies have been reported, even with controversial findings. For example, studies demonstrated that A1298C genotype appeared to be the predominant linkage to the inattentive symptoms, leading to a 7.4-fold increase in ADHD, compared with a 1.3-fold increase for the C677T genotype, individuals with ADHD seem to be related to A1298C polymorphisms. However, a research with ADHD and healthy controls reported no association between C677T or A1298C polymorphism and ADHD in Turkish children. Further studies with large sample size or better controls are needed.

In conclusion, MTHFR polymorphism not only increase risks for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and various cancers, but also increase the risk for various psychiatric diseases. For example, as we described above that MTHFR polymorphism is associated with early onset of schizophrenia and the severity of depressive symptoms in MDD. This is important since neurotransmitter imbalances hypotheses are still the main streams for schizophrenia and MDD. Understanding alternative mechanisms of psychiatric diseases will not only provide potential biomarkers for specific psychiatric diseases, but also new targets for antipsychotic drug development. Due to significant controversial findings in MTHFR mutation and DNA methylation in both healthy populations and psychiatric patients, investigation of MTHFR activity in peripheral samples might be important. As yet, the relationships between enzymatic activity and mutation of MTHFR have been reported in general healthy and mental retardation populations as well as in animals, no studies have been found in clinical test of MTHFR activity in psychiatric patients –. In addition, there are still some shortages on MTHFR mutation and psychiatric disease studies. Except for C677T and A1298C, there were little studies on other SNPs as well as the effect of multiple SNPs on the diseases which may also affect MTHFR activity.

### Association between MTHFR C677T / A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis [^1127JRYh]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations for this study. First, the subgroup analyses of environmental risk factors, sex, and gene-environment interactions were not performed owing to insufficient information. Second, this meta-analysis was mainly focused on Caucasians and Asians, thus limiting the generalization of the findings to other ethnicities. Third, in agreement with the findings of Frustaci et al. Pu et al. and Rai et al. heterogeneity exists in this exploration. Fourth, publication bias was found in the association between MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms and ASD risk.

### Global and population-specific association of MTHFR polymorphisms with preterm birth risk: a consolidated analysis of 44 studies [^111oKbL8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Between 2016 and 2018, three meta-analyses examined the relationship between MTHFR variants and PTB, yet significant gaps remain in the literature regarding the overall impact of these genetic factors on PTB risk. This lack of clarity may stem from the heterogeneity of the included studies, which differed in sample size, population characteristics, and methodologies, leading to conflicting results that obscure meaningful associations. Moreover, many studies failed to stratify results by ethnicity or geographical location, despite known differences in allele frequencies and prevalence of MTHFR variants across diverse populations. This meta-analysis aimed to quantitatively evaluate the existing research to clarify these associations and understand the underlying mechanisms, seeking to address previous discrepancies. It hypothesized that MTHFR polymorphisms significantly contribute to increased PTB risk, emphasizing the importance of this research for both filling knowledge gaps and potential clinical implications. By assessing the strength and consistency of the relationship across various populations and identifying moderating factors, the study's findings can help guide healthcare strategies and improve identification of at-risk populations, ultimately contributing to better outcomes in maternal-fetal medicine for both mothers and infants.

MTHFR polymorphism

MTHFR polymorphisms and enzymatic activity

There are several sites of MTHFR polymorphism that have been reported including 2 enzyme activity associated locuses C677T and A1298C and 6 enzyme activity unassociated locuses. As shown in Table 1, with regard to the association of MTHFR gene and its enzyme products, some of the studies revealed severe enzymatic deficiency. The encoding of MTHFR appears to be polymorphic such as the gene site C677T, one of the most studied and clinically important variant in exon 4. The C677T variant results from a single nucleotide substitution at this position, in which cytosine is replaced by thymine resulting a conversion of alanine to valine residue. The substitution lowers the affinity of MTHFR and its cofactor, which promotes the thermolability and diminishes the enzyme activity. Comparing with wild genotype (CC), the heterozygote (CT) and mutation homozygote (TT) lead to the decline of enzyme activity by about 34 and 75%, and increased thermolability in lymphocyte extracts. In 2001, the Ala222Val mutation was created in human MTHFR, and the mutant protein was successfully purified and its properties were determined. Different from the former studies, the Ala222Val variant exhibits identical catalytic properties as the wild-type enzyme, but it is thermolabile.

Another common polymorphism is A1298C, in which adenine is replaced by cytosine resulting a conversion of glutamate to alanine at 429 residue, which also diminishes the enzyme activity. Lymphocyte extracts from homozygous 1298CC individuals showed 61% of wild-type enzyme activity. The Ala177Val was established in the MTHFR of E. coli to study the biochemical phenotype of the Ala222Val variant. Then literatures reported the Ala177Val mutation has no influence on the kinetic parameters of bacterial MTHFR, but rather reduces enzyme stability and affinity for cofactor, and thus increases the tendency to form inactive enzyme via flavin dissociation, compared to the wild-type enzyme.

Association between MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) polymorphism and ASD susceptibility

To further clarify the link between MTHFR polymorphisms and the risk of ASD, subgroup analysis was carried out. Firstly, no significant deviation of the correlation among the states with mandatory fortification of folate was recorded. MTHFR C677T polymorphism was not found to be linked to ASD susceptibility: allelic (T vs C: OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.00–1.75, p > 0.05), homozygote (TT vs CC: OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.94–2.94, p > 0.05), and recessive models (TT vs CT + CC: OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 0.93–2.00, p > 0.05). Nonetheless, it was observed to be associated with ASD susceptibility among the states without mandatory fortification of folate: allelic (T vs C: OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.40–3.08, p < 0.05), heterozygote (CT vs CC: OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.34–2.82, p < 0.05), homozygote (TT vs CC: OR = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.35–5.73, p < 0.05), dominant (TT + CT vs CC: OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.46–3.36, p < 0.05), and recessive models (TT vs CT + CC: OR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.13–4.38, p < 0.05). Secondly, MTHFR C677T polymorphism was recorded to be correlated with ASD susceptibility in Caucasian population: allelic (T vs C: OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.17–1.95, p < 0.05), heterozygote (CT vs CC: OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.20–2.18, p < 0.05), homozygote (TT vs CC: OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.16–3.16, p < 0.05), and dominant models (TT + CT vs CC: OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.25–2.41, p < 0.05). Nonetheless, MTHFR C677T polymorphism was not found to be linked to ASD susceptibility among Asians: homozygote model (TT vs. CC: OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 0.95–6.31, p > 0.05). Thirdly, a hospital-based and population-based sample was adopted for this study. MTHFR C677T polymorphism was found to be linked with ASD susceptibility under five genetic models in hospital- and population-based samples, respectively (all p < 0.05). Fourthly, our results showed that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was consistent/inconsistent with HWE; however, it was significantly associated with ASD susceptibility under five genetic models (all p < 0.05) (Table 3).

### Associations between fetal inherited thrombophilia and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^1164xbai]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between fetal inherited thrombophilia and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders (PIHD), antepartum hemorrhage (APH), small-for-gestational age < 10th percentile (SGA), and preterm birth (PTB).

Study Design

Seven hundred and seventeen cases and 609 controls were genotyped for Factor V Leiden (FVL, G1691A), Prothrombin gene mutation (PGM, G20210A), and Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and MTHFR A1298C using DNA from newborn screening cards.

Results

For babies born < 28 weeks' gestation, PGM was associated with an increased risk of SGA (OR 6.40, 95%CI 1.66–24.71) and APH with SGA (OR 6.35, 95%CI 1.63–24.75). Homozygous MTHFR A1298C was associated with an increased risk of SGA for babies born 28–31 weeks gestation (OR 4.00, 95%CI 1.04–15.37), and with APH and SGA for babies born < 32 weeks' gestation (OR 3.57, 95%CI 1.09–11.66). Homozygous MTHFR C677T was associated with a reduced risk of PTB and SGA (OR 0.52, 95%CI 0.28–0.96) for babies born 32 to 36 weeks' gestation. Homozygous FVL decreased the risk of PTB < 32 weeks' gestation (OR 0.55, 95%CI 0.31–0.98).

Conclusion

Fetal thrombophilic polymorphisms may be related to adverse pregnancy outcomes, in particular SGA.

### Polymorphisms in ERCC1, GSTs, TS and MTHFR predict clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients treated with platinum / 5-Fu-based chemotherapy: a systematic review [^1127kCVs]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

MTHFR is another central enzyme for maintaining DNA integrity and stability by regulating the folate pool. Studies found that MTHFR C677T single-nucleotide polymorphism (alanine to valine substitution at codon 222) was associated with reduced enzymatic activity. Theoretically, decreased MTHFR activity confers a more effective TS inhibition and resultant increased 5-Fu efficacy. And this was confirmed by previous studies, which reported the highest clinical RR to 5-Fu in subjects with TT mutant homozygous. However, our meta-analysis showed that there was no correlation between MTHFR C677T single-nucleotide polymorphism and clinical outcomes of 5-Fu-based chemotherapy, whether RR [(CT+TT)/CC: OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.49–2.55] or OS (CT/CC: HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.67–1.79; TT/CC: HR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.65–1.37). Considering chemotherapy purpose and the variation of allele frequency in different ethnicity (TT is 1% or less among Blacks from Africa or the United States, and 10% in Caucasians), we conducted subgroup-analysis but failed to reveal significant association (Table 3). As was discussed for TS polymorphism, the discrepant results may be ascribed to other gene polymorphism regulating MTHFR activity, such as A1298C single-nucleotide polymorphism.

### Intermediate hyperhomocysteinaemia and compound heterozygosity for the common variant C.677C > T and a MTHFR gene mutation [^115gvdPM]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key enzyme in the regulation of plasma homocysteine levels. MTHFR deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, results in homocystinuria and hypomethioninaemia and presents with highly variable symptoms affecting many organs but predominantly the central nervous system. The common polymorphism of the MTHFR gene, c.677C > T, a known risk factor for elevated plasma homocysteine levels, occurs frequently in the caucasian population. In this study we investigated three subjects with moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia (total plasma homocysteine 72 micromol/L in case 1 and 90 micromol/L in case 3, total non-protein-bound homocysteine 144–186 micromol/L in case 2) but different clinical presentation with no symptoms in case 1, muscle weakness at 17 years of age in case 2, and syncopes and cerebral convulsions at 18 years of age in case 3. Each subject was compound heterozygous for the c.677C > T polymorphism and a novel mutation of the MTHFR gene (case 1: c.883G > A [p.D291N]; case 2: c.1552_c.1553delGA [p.E514fsX536]; case 3: c.616C > T [p.P202S]). Moderately decreased fibroblast MTHFR activity was associated with severely reduced affinity for NADPH and increased sensitivity to inhibition by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in case 2, and with mild FAD responsiveness in case 3. In case 1, fibroblast MTHFR activity was normal but the sensitivity to inhibition by AdoMet was slightly reduced. This study indicates that the sequence alteration c.677C > T combined with severe MTHFR mutations in compound heterozygous state may lead to moderate biochemical and clinical abnormalities exceeding those attributed to the c.677TT genotype and might require in addition to folate substitution further therapy to normalize homocysteine levels.

### MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms are risk factors for Down's syndrome in Indian mothers [^112RiajU]. Journal of Human Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

Down's syndrome (DS), a chromosomal disorder due to trisomy 21, results mostly from nondisjunction in maternal meiosis. The present case-control study examined the association of genetic polymorphisms with predisposition to nondisjunction. Two common polymorphisms (SNPs), C677T and A1298C, in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene involved in folate metabolism, are known to lower the activity of this enzyme. Three hundred and fourteen mothers (with DS children and controls), mostly from the eastern states of India, were genotyped for the two above-mentioned SNPs. Significant association with both of these SNPs were detected, more specifically, in the mothers of DS children homozygous for the polymorphic alleles 677 T and 1298 C. The relative risk of T (C677T) and C (A1298C) homozygosity in mothers for DS-affected pregnancy was 7 (OR 7.67, 95% CI 1.67–35.08, P = 0.003) and 4 (OR 4.40, 95% CI 1.45–13.26, P = 0.008), respectively. Moreover, all 677TT mothers studied were less than 31 years of age, whereas no correlation with maternal age was observed for A1298C genotypes. Interestingly, all of the young 677TT mothers had either a first- or secondborn child with DS. Thus, this study reports that young Indian mothers with TT genotypes are genetically predisposed to nondisjunction due to abnormal folate metabolism.

### MTHFR and risk of metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia [^112qeMgo]. Schizophrenia Research (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Meta-analyses have implicated polymorphisms in MTHFR, encoding a critical enzyme in folate and homocysteine metabolism, in both schizophrenia and CVD.

Method

A possible association between the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of the MTHFR gene on the one hand, and metabolic syndrome on the other, was examined in a naturalistic cohort of 518 patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder screened for metabolic disturbances at the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium.

Results

MTHFR A1298C, but not C677T, was associated with the metabolic syndrome, C/C genotypes having a 2.4 times higher risk compared to A/A genotypes (95% CI 1.25–4.76, p = 0.009). Haplotype analysis revealed similar findings, showing greater risk for metabolic syndrome associated with the 677C/1298C haplotype compared to the reference 677C/1298A haplotype (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.24–2.39, p = 0.001). These associations were not explained by circulating folate levels. Differences between A1298C genotype groups were considerably greater in the subsample treated with clozapine or olanzapine (OR C/C versus A/A 3.87, 95% CI 1.51–9.96) than in subsample treated with any of the other antipsychotics (OR C/C versus A/A 1.30, 95% CI 0.47–3.74), although this did not formally reach statistical significance in the current cross-sectional study (gene-by-group interaction chi(2) = 3.0, df = 1, p = 0.08).

Conclusion

These data provide evidence supporting an association between MTHFR and risk of metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia. Prospective studies evaluating the course of metabolic outcomes after initiation of antipsychotic medication are needed to evaluate possible gene-by-treatment interaction more specifically.

### Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene mutations as risk factors for sudden hearing loss [^113zJJY1]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2005). Low credibility.

Sudden hearing loss (SHL) can be caused by vascular disorders favoring impaired cochlear perfusion. Several inherited prothrombotic risk factors have been considered in the pathogenesis of vascular impairment, and the possible role of genetic alterations has recently been suggested. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations at nucleotides 677 and 1298 cause reduced MTHFR enzyme activity, which leads to increased homocysteine and reduced serum folate levels that are known to be involved in vascular impairment. We studied the relationship between SHL and MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms in 67 patients with SHL and 134 controls. Wild-type MTHFR CC677/AA1298 was significantly more frequent in the controls (P = 0.05), and gene mutations were significantly more frequent in the patients (P = 0.001; p = 0.001 for trend). Fifty-three patients (79.1%) and 56 controls (41.8%) (P = 0.012) had a double mutation (homozygosis 677TT or 1298CC; compound heterozygosis for both polymorphisms). Homocysteine levels were significantly higher and serum folate levels significantly lower in the patients than in the controls (P < .0001). These data suggest that MTHFR gene polymorphisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of SHL.

### Thymidylate synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene polymorphisms: relationships with 5-fluorouracil sensitivity [^115xabbQ]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is a key enzyme of the folate metabolic pathway (Figure 1). Two SNPs (C677T and A1298C) associated with altered phenotypes have been described for this enzyme. The mutated forms of these variants (i.e. 677TT and 1298CC) exhibit significantly lower enzymatic activity, and should theoretically lead to an accumulation of intracellular CH₂FH₄ concentrations as compared to wt forms. Consequently, C677T and A1298C MTHFR polymorphisms may influence the pharmacodynamics of fluoropyrimidines since they control the intracellular concentration of the specific reduced folate required for optimal TS inhibition. This hypothesis is supported by preclinical and clinical data demonstrating the impact of CH₂FH₄ intratumoral concentrations on FU cytotoxicity. Recent clinical studies have suggested that MTHFR polymorphisms may be associated with methotrexate pharmacodynamics. However, no study has so far reported their impact on fluoropyrimidine sensitivity. First of all, the present data closely concord with the theoretical impact of C677T and A1298C polymorphisms on CH₂FH₄ intracellular pool: five out of six homozygous wt C677 variants and seven out of 10 homozygous wt A1298 variants exhibited nondetectable CH 2 FH 4 concentrations, in contrast to six out of 13 T/T or C/T 677 variants, and four out of nine C/C or A/C 1298 variants (Figure 5, Tables 1 and 2). These data agree with those ofwho recently reported relationships between MTHFR genotypes and tumoral-reduced folates in gastrointestinal cancer.

The C677T genotype did not significantly influence FU cytotoxicity, whether in the absence or presence of optimal FA supplementation (Figure 6). However, FU sensitivity was related to A1298C MTHFR genotype: homozygous mutated cell lines (C/C) were the more sensitive, homozygous wt (A/A) were the more resistant, heterozygous cell lines (A/C) exhibiting intermediary sensitivity (Figure 7, Tables 1 and 2). The influence of A1298C MTHFR polymorphism on FU sensitivity was observed irrespective of the absence or presence of optimal FA supplementation. These stimulating results show a trend close to statistical significance (P = 0.055 and 0.085 in the absence and presence of FA, respectively) and are thus consistent with the initial hypothesis that MTHFR genotypes associated with altered enzymatic activity may be more FU sensitive.

### A study of the MTHFR gene polymorphism C677T in colorectal cancer [^114E9zEp]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to examine the clinical significance of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism C677T in colorectal cancer (CRC). The hypothesis was that the genotype could affect the risk of cancer development and the results of cancer treatment.

Patients and Methods

Genotyping was made for a random 30% (n = 544) of all patients treated for CRC at our unit from 1999 to 2006 (n = 1812). Basic clinical and pathologic factors were analyzed by genotype group and also compared with those of the entire cohort. Tolerability of chemotherapy and possible side effects were analyzed by genotype. Survival was analyzed by genotype for all stages for patients treated between 1999 and 2003. The genotype prevalence was also compared with a control material of healthy blood donors.

Results

No genotype was associated with an increased risk of CRC or higher cancer stage. The patients with CT/TT genotype had significantly greater risk of suffering side effects from fluoropyrimidine (5-fluorouracil) treatment (P < .05). In stage III colon cancer, the patients with CT/TT genotype had a poorer prognosis than those with the CC genotype. The difference was significant in univariate (P < .003) and multivariate (P < .040) analysis. Though the genotype-associated side effect risks remained in stage IV, the effect on survival was not significant (P < .1).

Conclusion

The MTHFR polymorphism C677T does, in our material, not affect the risk of CRC; however, it can affect the sensitivity to chemotherapy and the risk of side-effects and therefore survival in stage III and possibly stage IV colon cancer. It could be a future predictive factor in the choice of a treatment regimen.

### Association between MTHFR C677T / A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis [^112Y2ovp]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is becoming increasingly prevalent of late. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) has a significant role in folate metabolism. Owing to the inconsistencies and inconclusiveness on the association between MTHFR single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and ASD susceptibilities, a meta-analysis was conducted to settle the inconsistencies.

Methods

For this meta-analysis, a total of 15 manuscripts published up to January 26, 2020, were selected from PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, WangFang, and CNKI databases using search terms "MTHFR" OR "methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase" AND "ASD" OR "Autism Spectrum Disorders" OR "Autism" AND "polymorphism" OR "susceptibility" OR "C677T" OR "A1298C".

Results

The findings of the meta-analysis indicated that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is remarkably associated with ASD in the five genetic models, viz. allelic, dominant, recessive, heterozygote, and homozygote. However, the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism was not found to be significantly related to ASD in the five genetic models. Subgroup analyses revealed significant associations of ASD with the MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) polymorphism. Sensitivity analysis showed that this meta-analysis was stable and reliable. No publication bias was identified in the associations between MTHFR C677T polymorphisms and ASD in the five genetic models, except for the one with regard to the associations between MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms and ASD in the five genetic models.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis showed that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is a susceptibility factor for ASD, and MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is not associated with ASD susceptibility.

### Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, MTHFR polymorphisms, and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women from south China: a retrospective cohort study [^111poD48]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

MTHFR C667T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) are two of the most investigated SNPs. MTHFR C677T mutation causes the conversion of alanine to valine at position 677, leading to decreased MTHFR enzymatic activity. Similarly, the A1298C polymorphism encodes glutamate to alanine substitution, leading to a decrease in enzyme activity, but to a lesser extent. Emerging evidences suggested that MTHFR activity affected body fat storage, folate metabolism, and homocysteine methylation, which play important roles in human reproduction. For example, a Chinese study showed that the MTHFR C677T TT genotype had a higher homocysteine level, and the recessive model of MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism was associated with preeclampsia renal function impairment. The prevalence of CT and TT genotypes in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension was higher than that in the control group, but no correlation was found with MTHFR A1298C mutations. The maternal MTHFR A1298C CC genotype was associated with an increased risk of PE (OR = 1.80) compared to the AA genotype, while the paternal MTHFR C677T CT genotype was associated with an increased risk of GHT (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.08–2.39). However, no associations were observed between MTHFR gene polymorphisms and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the present study. These inconsistent findings might be due to the small difference in homozygous mutations for MTHFR C677T and A1298C; 22 cases were A128C CC genotype and 43 cases were C677T TT genotype in overweight plus obesity group in our study. The small difference in homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations among the MTHFR genetic variations might be another reason. Only a slighter increasing of Hcy levels was found in C677T homozygous mutated subjects compared to CC and CT genetic subjects (TT: 7.07 ± 1.19 µmol/L vs. CT: 7.00 ± 1.23 µmol/L vs. CC:6.86 ± 1.27 µmol/L), and we failed to show significant promotions of Hcy concentrations among MTHFR A1298C genotypes.

### Association between MTHFR C677T / A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis [^1144sKMm]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To conclude, this meta-analysis confirms that C677T polymorphism of MTHFR is remarkably linked with ASD risk. Nevertheless, the findings agree that the A1298C polymorphism of MTHFR is not significantly correlated with ASD. Exploring gene-gene and gene-environment interactions could throw more light on the genetic link between MTHFR variants and ASD risk.

### Thymidylate synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene polymorphisms: relationships with 5-fluorouracil sensitivity [^111uFXEZ]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

C677T and A1298C MTHFR polymorphisms

Distribution of C677T genotype was 31.6% C/C (n = 6), 52.6% C/T (n = 10), 15.8% T/T (n = 3) and that of A1298C was 52.6% A/A (n = 10), 36.8% A/C (n = 7) and 10.5% C/C (n = 2) (Table 2).

From Tables 1 and 2, it appears that basal CH 2 FH 4 concentrations were not detectable in 5/6 homozygous wt (C/C) 677 genotype, whereas detectable concentrations were observed in 7/13 mut (T/T and C/T) 677 genotype. Also, basal CH 2 FH 4 concentrations were below detection limit in 7/10 homozygous wt (A/A) 1298 genotype, in contrast with detectable concentrations observed in 5/9 mut (C/C and A/C) 1298 genotype. The above observations, which did not reach statistical significance, are depicted in Figure 5

### MTHFR: addressing genetic counseling dilemmas using evidence-based literature [^113zJd1J]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2016). Low credibility.

The 5, 10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme is a catalyst in the folate metabolism pathway, the byproducts of which are involved in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Methionine is a precursor for a major DNA methyl donor and is important for DNA methylation and gene regulation. Rare mutations in the MTHFR gene have been associated with autosomal recessive MTHFR deficiency leading to homocystinuria. In addition, two polymorphic variants in this gene (C677T and A1298C) have been implicated in a mild form of MTHFR deficiency associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia has been previously implicated as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Further, the presence of these variants, with and without mildly elevated levels of homocysteine, has been studied in relation to several multifactorial disorders including recurrent pregnancy loss, neural tube defects and congenital anomalies, cancer, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Given this wide spectrum of purported clinical implications and the prevalence of these polymorphisms, genetic counselors may encounter questions regarding the significance of MTHFR polymorphisms in a variety of settings. Here we present a brief background of the MTHFR polymorphisms, review of the literature regarding clinical considerations, and discussion of relevant genetic counseling aspects through case vignettes. Educational resources for patients and providers are also included.

### Allelic distribution of genes for apolipoprotein E and MTHFR in patients with Alzheimer's disease and their epistatic interaction [^112K9LEE]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Currently, there is a trend to shift the pathogenesis of AD to the genetic and epigenetic levels. In the pathogenesis of AD, multiple genes are involved, where each gene may individually have only a slight effect. Therefore, it is essential to study gene epistasis to achieve a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, because a gene does not function by itself but instead acts with other genes, similar to a choreography built up by a functional orchestra. It is also known that this epistasis exhibits a more significant effect than the effect of polymorphism at any individual locus. The findings of this study strongly support this fact. The APOE4 isoform is a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Its pathophysiological activity involves the activation of multiple pathological pathways that is disadvantageous to neurons. The result is increased amyloid-β production, its decreased clearance, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, deterioration of synaptic plasticity, and the disruption of regenerative processes. Increased homocysteine causes an indirect (via endothelial dysfunction) and direct neurotoxic effect. APOE4 and MTHFR polymorphisms in homozygous state can probably synergize in their ability to activate multiple proinflammatory pathways which finally increases the risk for neurodegeneration. This risk, as has been mentioned several times in the preceding text, may not be the same for all individuals. The interaction of multiple polymorphisms in a particular individual is likely to create an individual pattern of susceptibility which may combine with other epigenetic factors to trigger a pathological process. These processes are likely to include multiple levels of complexity that requires detailed elucidation. Genetic-epigenetic interactions are probably the common denominator of these processes. Epistasis (gene interaction) as a part of epigenetics (factors affecting gene expression) helps to explain the inter-individual differences in patients with AD (such as age of disease onset, progression rate, and clinical picture). Currently, the study of epigenetics is rapidly progressing. New markers and disease determinants are continually being sought. The gene interaction of susceptible genes, which undoubtedly includes APOE and MTHFR, is one of the main subjects of the study on epigenetics on AD. Our study, though on a relatively limited set of patients, adds to the body of knowledge in this research direction.

Study limitations

The calculation of the odds ratio is always loaded with errors due to the abundance of a given trait in patients and controls. The frequency of a given trait or combination of traits, although reflecting the actual incidence in the affected or control population, is not necessarily for the pathological manifestation in each patient. Accordingly, an individual risk assessment of the particular trait is required for each particular patient in a complex context.

### Global and population-specific association of MTHFR polymorphisms with preterm birth risk: a consolidated analysis of 44 studies [^1147RPA4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

The pooled data on MTHFR polymorphisms and their association with PTB reveals significant clinical implications for managing pregnancy risks. Notably, the MTHFR C677T variant shows strong associations in populations such as Asians and Indians, suggesting that genetic screening for this polymorphism could help identify women at higher risk for PTB. This targeted approach enables the development of personalized prenatal care strategies, allowing healthcare providers to implement preventive measures or closer monitoring for at-risk groups. Conversely, the lack of significant associations for the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism across various populations indicates that routine screening for this variant may not be necessary. Furthermore, the variations in associations among different populations highlight the importance of culturally sensitive healthcare interventions that address genetic diversity. However, the cost-effectiveness of widespread genetic screening, particularly in developing countries, presents a significant challenge. Although such screening could facilitate targeted interventions, the financial implications must be carefully considered, especially in regions with limited healthcare resources. The economic burden of genetic testing may exceed potential savings from preventing PTB-related complications, which can incur substantial medical costs and long-term care needs for affected infants. For genetic screening to be warranted in developing countries, it must be paired with effective preventive strategies that provide a clear return on investment. Moreover, the necessary infrastructure for implementing genetic testing, including trained healthcare professionals and accessible counseling, may be insufficient in many areas. This situation raises important questions about the practicality of such initiatives, necessitating significant investment in public health initiatives to ensure equitable access. Ultimately, while the potential benefits of personalized prenatal care through genetic screening are considerable, a thorough evaluation of cost-effectiveness and feasibility is essential before widespread clinical adoption can be considered viable, encouraging a more nuanced understanding of genetic factors in PTB and paving the way for improved healthcare outcomes.

### Riboflavin lowers homocysteine in individuals homozygous for the MTHFR 677C- > T polymorphism [^115LKASd]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Meta-analyses predict that a 25% lowering of plasma homocysteine would reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by 11% to 16% and stroke by 19% to 24%. Individuals homozygous for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C→T polymorphism have reduced MTHFR enzyme activity resulting from the inappropriate loss of the riboflavin cofactor, but it is unknown whether their typically high homocysteine levels are responsive to improved riboflavin status.

Methods and Results

From a register of 680 healthy adults 18 to 65 years of age of known MTHFR 677C→T genotype, we identified 35 with the homozygous (TT) genotype and age-matched individuals with heterozygous (CT, n = 26) or wild-type (CC, n = 28) genotypes to participate in an intervention in which participants were randomized by genotype group to receive 1.6 mg/d riboflavin or placebo for a 12-week period. Supplementation increased riboflavin status to the same extent in all genotype groups (8% to 12% response in erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient; P < 0.01 in each case). However, homocysteine responded only in the TT group, with levels decreasing by as much as 22% overall (from 16.1 ± 1.5 to 12.5 ± 0.8 micromol/L; P = 0.003; n = 32) and markedly so (by 40%) in those with lower riboflavin status at baseline (from 22.0 ± 2.9 and 13.2 ± 1.0 micromol/L; P = 0.010; n = 16). No homocysteine response was observed in the CC or CT groups despite being preselected for suboptimal riboflavin status.

Conclusions

Although previously overlooked, homocysteine is highly responsive to riboflavin, specifically in individuals with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype. Our findings might explain why this common polymorphism carries an increased risk of coronary heart disease in Europe but not in North America, where riboflavin fortification has existed for > 50 years.

### Global and population-specific association of MTHFR polymorphisms with preterm birth risk: a consolidated analysis of 44 studies [^114e3t3T]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The MTHFR A1298C variant has been studied for its potential effects on pregnancy outcomes due to its role in folate metabolism, essential for DNA synthesis and repair during pregnancy. Several studies indicate significant improvements in live birth rates among women with the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms post-treatment, increasing from 9.4% pre-treatment to 68.7% post-treatment, while abortion rates decreased from 81.2 to 32.1%. Additionally, younger maternal age was linked to a 3.76-fold increase in live births among those with the A1298C heterozygous genotype, suggesting better outcomes for younger women. However, pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction were noted in about 18.3% of patients, and the A1298C polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of recurrent pregnancy loss and gestational hypertension. Literature shows mixed results on the link between this polymorphism and adverse pregnancy outcomes, suggesting that environmental factors like folate intake play a significant role. Dietary interventions, particularly a methionine-poor diet al.ongside medical treatment, may enhance pregnancy outcomes for women with MTHFR polymorphisms, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive approach to managing these genetic variations. Our pooled analysis of 15 studies with 2,399 cases and 22,634 controls found no significant link between the MTHFR A1298C variant and PTB risk, indicating minimal genetic impact. A 2018 meta-analysis by Javaheri et al. also found no significant link between the MTHFR A1298C variant and PTB risk across various genetic models. Some studies suggest a potential link between elevated homocysteine levels associated with the MTHFR A1298C variant and PTB; however, larger population-based studies, including one with Croatian and Slovenian women, have not consistently validated this association. Ethnic variations in the data indicate that while overall findings show no significant risk, stratified analyses reveal a significant association in Asian populations, where the allele C appears to offer a protective effect against PTB, unlike in Caucasian populations. Some studies indicate that the CC genotype of the A1298C polymorphism may offer protection against preterm delivery, as evidenced by its lower frequency in such cases. Although the A1298C variant does not significantly impair enzymatic activity, it could influence folate metabolism — critical during pregnancy — leading to potential adverse effects if folate intake is low. Clinically, these findings suggest that routine genetic testing for MTHFR A1298C in pregnant women may not effectively predict PTB risk. Researchers generally agree that while ensuring adequate folate levels is essential for pregnancy health, the presence of MTHFR polymorphisms alone does not warrant changes in clinical management or interventions aimed at preventing PTB.

### MTHFR 677TT is associated with decreased number of embryos and cumulative live birth rate in patients undergoing GnRHa short protocol: a retrospective study [^1175GboW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

It is worth noting that the clinical outcomes at the first ET cycle were not significantly different between the groups under both protocols. We think it is largely because that the patients included in the study are all transferred with 1 or 2 good-quality embryos at the first ET cycle. The reason we exclude the patients who do not transfer with a good embryo is to control the influence of embryo factors on reproductive outcomes of the first ET cycle. Thus, the clinical difference could not be detected due to the control of embryo factor as well as the baseline characteristics including age, BMI, stimulation protocol infertility cause, and infertility type. The clinical outcomes at the first ET cycle of our study are similar to most of the previous studies. However, in the subsequent transfers without controlling the embryo factors, we observed a significantly decreased cumulative live birth rate in patients with homozygous mutation under GnRHa short protocol. Although this difference was only observed in the GnRHa short protocol. Combined with the results that homozygous mutation of MTHFR 677TT, significantly reduced the number of good-quality embryos, we speculated that MTHFR 677TT mutation may affect pregnancy outcomes mainly by decreasing embryo quality. Besides, increasing evidence indicates that the T allele of the C677T MTHFR polymorphism is associated with hyperhomocysteinemia, vitamin D concentrations and natural killer cell cytotoxicity, all of these factors could affect reproductive outcomes.

### Effects of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase () polymorphisms on retinal tissue perfusion in mild diabetic retinopathy patients receiving the medical food, ocufolin [^1158mqAX]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

DR is a multifactorial disease that leads to irreversible retinal damage without timely and effective treatment. As an early event, endothelial dysfunction plays a significant role in the development of vascular diseases, including DR. Attacking the risk factors and drivers for DR to slow its progression during the earliest stages may lessen the burden and preserve vision in diabetic patients. Risk factors for DR include longer duration of diabetes, higher HbA1c level, chronic hyperglycemia, elevated systolic blood pressure, hyperhomocysteinemia (Hcy), hyperlipidemia, and impaired enzymatic activity, which in turn result in increased vascular permeability, impaired autonomic vasoregulation, and capillary loss.,

Reduced function methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms play a role in vascular disease progression in DR. The MTHFR gene codes for the synthesis of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, an enzyme for adding a methyl group to tetrahydrofolate. MTHFR mutations impair folate methylation and cause increased homocysteine, a high-risk factor for DR incidence and progression. Two common MTHFR polymorphisms have been reported: a mutation at nucleotide 677 (C677T) and another at nucleotide 1298 (A1298C). Close to 70% of several significant populations have at least one of these reduced function variants. This is common in patients of Amerindian, European, Latino, and Chinese heritage. The most severe homozygous variant state of MTHFR C677TT is present in 25% and 57%, respectively, of Latino and Amerindian populations studied, possibly accounting for their higher risks of hypertensive and diabetic disease. In Chinese population studies, C677T is present in 62% of the population, and the A1298C mutation is present in 25%. European populations carry the MTHFR C677T heterozygously in 24–64% of groups surveyed, and MTHFR A1298C in 10–20% of studied populations. This is particularly important for patients with diabetic retinopathy because studies show that nutritional intervention reduces hypertension and other variant driven vasculopathies. Although both genes are reported to be associated with increased vascular and neurological diseases, the significance of the MTHFR A1298C variant is still controversial. Most population studies have focused on the MTHFR C677T, however there are some data associating A1298C mutations with thrombotic disease, diabetic vasculopathy, and stroke. The relatively common compound heterozygous state, MTHFR C677T/A1298C, is noted to be associated with increased serum homocysteine and neural tube defects. This impairment of the folate cycle is also associated with increased homocysteine, reduced nitric oxide synthesis, and vascular endothelial injury. The resultant endothelial injury is associated with small vessel disease and reduced perfusion of the eye and brain tissue beds. Perfusion impairments and ischemia are especially problematic for the retina and the visual cortex of the brain, which have the highest requirement for antioxidants, glucose, and oxygen in the body.

### Allelic distribution of genes for apolipoprotein E and MTHFR in patients with Alzheimer's disease and their epistatic interaction [^115Ag3mK]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, the ɛ 4 allele of APOE is the most significant genetic risk factor for the development of late-onset AD (OR 31.9 for homozygotes, 15.6 for homozygotes + heterozygotes, 14.4 for heterozygotes). The presence of homozygous polymorphisms of MTHFR without the APOE ɛ 4 allele represents a significantly lower risk factor for the development of AD (OR 2.5 for genotype TT C677T, OR 1.8 for genotype CC A1298C). The combination of the ɛ 4 allele of APOE and MTHFR polymorphisms increased the risk for AD in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the most risky was the combination of APOE 4/X and 4/4 + TT C677T, which increased the OR to 22.4.

Our findings could be explained by a synergistic and potentiating mechanism for the presence of APOE4 and homozygous MTHFR polymorphisms as an AD-promoting factor. In addition to the mechanisms outlined in the introduction, disease-associated microglia (DAM) is likely to play a role. APOE4, in the context of the aging process, affects the microglia and promotes its conversion to DAM. DAM possesses specific-disease signatures, which are characterized by the downregulation of homeostatic genes and the upregulation of proinflammatory genes. APOE4 has proinflammatory potential, and there is an ongoing debate regarding its potential in promoting the development of DAM. Homocysteine also has a pro-inflammatory potential by increasing the secretion of inflammatory mediators, especially NF- κ -B and interleukins IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. Elevated levels of homocysteine also increase the gene expression of IL-6, which subsequently up-regulates the APP and tau protein genes. Furthermore, homocysteine affects DNA repair, increase beta-amyloid formation, and sensitizes neurons to amyloid toxicity. Therefore, the common denominator of the two disadvantageous variants (APOE4 and homozygous MTHFR variants carriers) would be: the activation of pro-inflammatory processes, including DAM, the promotion of beta amyloid deposition, and the promotion of neurodegeneration.

### Identification of six methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotypes resulting from common polymorphisms: impact on plasma homocysteine levels and development of coronary artery disease [^117Y7jTr]. Atherosclerosis (2001). Low credibility.

Although three common MTHFR polymorphisms (C677T, A1298C, T1317C) have been reported, only polymorphism C677T has been investigated intensively as a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated polymorphism frequencies, allelic associations and the effect of the resulting MTHFR genotypes on total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) levels and on coronary risk in a case-control study with 1000 angiographically confirmed Middle-European CAD patients and 1000 matched controls. Three out of four theoretically possible MTHFR haplotypes were detected: *1 (677C, 1298A), *2 (677T, 1298A), and *3 (677C, 1298C). The frequencies were *1: 36.4 and 34.4%; *2: 30.8 and 32.3%; and *3: 32.8 and 33.3%, in cases and controls, respectively. Only one patient was heterozygous for 1317C. None of the six resulting genotypes showed significant influence on tHcy levels. Moreover, there was no significant association with CAD risk or with disease severity or early disease manifestation. In the subgroup presenting with acute coronary syndromes, MTHFR genotypes *2/*3 and *3/*3 were surprisingly underrepresented (relative risk of *3/*3, 0.40; 95% confidence interval 0.20–0.79, P = 0.009). We conclude from our genotype-based analysis that, in this well-fed Middle-European population, the observed common allelic variants of the MTHFR gene have no significant influence on tHcy levels or on the chronic process of CAD development.

### Factor V Leiden, prothrombin, MTHFR, and PAI-1 gene polymorphisms in patients with arterial disease: a comprehensive systematic-review and meta-analysis [^114xeaR5]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The role of inherited thrombophilia in arterial disease is uncertain. We performed a systematic-review and meta-analysis of inherited thrombophilia in cerebrovascular (CVD), coronary heart (CHD), and peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients.

Materials and Methods

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched up to February 2022. Pooled prevalences (PPs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated in a random-effects model. Factor V Leiden (G1691A), prothrombin (G20210A), MTHFR C677T/A1298C and PAI-1 4G/5G were evaluated.

Results

377 studies for 98,186 patients (32,791 CVD, 62,266 CHD, 3129 PAD) and 108,569 controls were included. Overall, 37,249 patients had G1691A, 32,254 G20210A, 42,546 MTHFR C677T, 8889 MTHFR A1298C, and 19,861 PAI-1 4G/5G gene polymorphisms. In CVD patients, PPs were 6.5% for G1691A, 3.9% for G20210A, 56.4% for MTHFR C677T, 51.9% for MTHFR A1298C, and 77.6% for PAI-1. In CHD, corresponding PPs were 7.2%, 3.8%, 52.3%, 53.9%, and 76.4%. In PAD, PPs were 6.9%, 4.7%, 55.1%, 52.1%, and 75.0%, respectively. Strongest ORs in CVD were for homozygous G1691A (2.76; 95%CI, 1.83–4.18) and for homozygous G20210A (3.96; 95%CI, 2.05–7.64). Strongest ORs in CHD were for homozygous G1691A (OR 1.68; 95%CI, 1.02–2.77) and G20210A (heterozygous 1.49 95%CI, 1.22–1.82; homozygous 1.54 95%CI, 0.79–2.99). The OR for PAI-1 4G/4G in PAD was 5.44 (95%CI, 1.80–16.43). Specific subgroups with higher PPs and ORs were identified according to age and region.

Conclusions

Patients with arterial disease have an increased prevalence and odds of having some inherited thrombophilia. Some thrombophilia testing may be considered in specific subgroups of patients.

### Increased frequency of combined methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T and A1298C mutated alleles in spontaneously aborted embryos [^115n2pYd]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of spontaneous abortion is complex, presumably involving the interaction of several genetic and environmental factors. The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T and A1298C polymorphisms are commonly associated with defects in folate dependent homocysteine metabolism and have been implicated as risk factors for recurrent embryo loss in early pregnancy. In the present study we have determined the prevalence of combined MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in DNA samples from spontaneously aborted embryos (foetal death between sixth and twentieth week after conception) and adult controls using solid-phase minisequencing technique. There was a significant odds ratio of 14.2 (95% CI 1.78–113) in spontaneously aborted embryos comparing the prevalence of one or more 677T and 1298C alleles vs the wild type combined genotype (677CC/1298AA), indicating that the MTHFR polymorphisms may have a major impact on foetal survival. Combined 677CT/1298CC, 677TT/1298AC or 677TT/1298CC genotypes, which contain three or four mutant alleles, were not detected in any of the groups, suggesting complete linkage disequilibrium between the two polymorphisms. The present finding of high prevalence of mutated MTHFR genotypes in spontaneously aborted embryos emphasises the potential protective role of periconceptional folic acid supplementation.

### MTHFR polymorphism and the risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis of case-control studies [^116tTAsq]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms implicated in the cancer development, but the published studies had yielded inconsistent results.

Methods

Pubmed was searched for all published case-control studies about MTHFR polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk.

Results

In all, 13 studies including 5872 cases and 6255 controls described C677T genotypes, among which 9 articles, containing 2847 cases and 3657 controls described A1298C genotypes, were involved in our meta-analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to assess the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk, heterogeneity, publication bias and sensitivity were also calculated. Overall, meta-analysis indicated that the 677T allele was more likely to exert protective effect on prostate cancer risk (random-effects pooled OR, 0.78 (0.64–0.96); P = 0.016 (P = 0.033 for heterogeneity studies)) in a recessive genetic model, no associations were found in other genetic models or in comparing a/a versus A/A homozygous. Neither did we find any difference in effects on high or low aggressive prostate cancer. No evidence of an association of MTHFR A1298C polymorphism with prostate cancer was found.

Conclusions

C677T of the MTHFR gene may provide protective effects on susceptibility to prostate cancer risk.

### Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and psychiatric diseases [^117RJhFn]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Increasing evidence demonstrated that MTHFR polymorphism including C677T and A1298C is associated with psychiatric diseases. The MTHFR gene polymorphism is linked to onset, clinical symptoms, prevalence as well as response to treatments. The influence of MTHFR on psychiatric diseases is mainly through reduction of MTHFR activity which results in elevation of homocysteine, reduction of DNA methylation-dependent methyl donor, finally induces hypomethylation, and then active disease-related genes. However, some age- and cell type-specific methylation seems independent from MTHFR polymorphism. MTHFR mutation also can increase environmental risks for psychiatric disorders, such as MDD through interaction between genetic and epigenetic factors. Investigation of MTHFR in psychiatric diseases has important clinical implications, such as identification role of MTHFR and its genotypes in the psychiatric patients who respond or not respond to traditional pharmacological treatment for personalized treatment management of psychiatric diseases.

### Association between MTHFR C677T / A1298C and susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders: a meta-analysis [^113K2jpL]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were deduced to analyse how strongly MTHFR (C677T/A1298C) polymorphism and the risk of ASD were correlated in the five genetic models, viz. allelic, dominant, recessive, heterozygote, and homozygote. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed through Q -test and I 2. Random effects model (DerSimonian-Laird methods) was selected to pool data and in case of substantial heterogeneity (Ph < 0.05 and I 2 > 50%); else, fixed effect model (Mantel-Haenszel methods) was chosen. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were stratified according to the state with mandatory fortification of folate, population, sample source, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The included studies were tested for HWE in the control group utilizing Chi-square tests. Besides, the stability of the results was tested by performing a sensitivity analysis with the sequential omission of each study. To evaluate the potential publication bias in this meta-analysis, Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test were conducted. Stata version 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) was used to evaluate all analyses, and p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

### MTHFR gene polymorphisms and outcome of methotrexate treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: analysis of key polymorphisms and meta-analysis of C677T and A1298C polymorphisms [^116Nnogp]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Association of two key variants mapping to the MTHFR gene (C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131)) with response to methotrexate (MTX) remains controversial. We investigated these and other markers spanning the gene as predictors of MTX efficacy and adverse events in a UK rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patient cohort and performed a meta-analysis of the two key variants using all published data. The tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 309 patients with well-defined outcomes to MTX treatment and 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. No association of the SNPs tested was detected with MTX efficacy or toxicity in our UK cohort. After combining our data with previous studies by meta-analysis, the random effects pooled odds ratios (OR) for both C677T and A1298C showed no association with efficacy or toxicity for either of the SNPs (efficacy: OR = 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83–1.32) and OR = 0.81 (95% CI 0.53–1.24), respectively; toxicity: OR = 1.38 (95% CI 0.90–2.12) and OR = 1.19 (95% CI 0.80–1.78), respectively). The available evidence suggests that the MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms are not reliable predictors of response to MTX treatment in RA patients.

### Global and population-specific association of MTHFR polymorphisms with preterm birth risk: a consolidated analysis of 44 studies [^116x4nXC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is essential for folate metabolism, which is critical for DNA synthesis, repair, and neurotransmitter production. This gene's role becomes particularly significant during pregnancy, as adequate folate levels are vital for fetal development and maternal health, especially concerning hyperhomocysteinemia. Variants in the MTHFR gene can impair enzymatic function, leading to altered folate levels and potential adverse outcomes, such as PTB, preeclampsia, and recurrent pregnancy loss. Common polymorphisms, notably C677T and A1298C, have been extensively studied, with the C677T variant being particularly impactful on enzymatic activity. Individuals with the TT genotype typically exhibit reduced enzyme activity, resulting in elevated homocysteine and decreased folate levels. However, research on the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and PTB has produced mixed results. While some studies suggest a significant correlation between the MTHFR C677T variant and increased PTB risk, others report inconsistent outcomes, often due to small sample sizes and diverse populations. These inconsistencies can arise from variations in study design, population genetics, environmental factors, and gene-environment interactions. Methodological differences, such as demographic variations and sample sizes, can produce divergent findings, especially among ethnic groups; for instance, the A1298C polymorphism is significantly linked to PTB risk in Asian populations but not elsewhere. The prevalence of MTHFR variants varies between populations, affecting risk assessments. Furthermore, environmental factors like nutrition and lifestyle may interact with genetic predispositions, complicating outcomes. Many studies have small sample sizes, limiting statistical power and highlighting the need for larger, well-structured studies to clarify these associations and account for confounding variables. Additionally, some research may inadequately evaluate the interactions between genetic and environmental factors, potentially underestimating genetic effects on PTB risk.

### Study of MTHFR and MS polymorphisms as risk factors for NTD in the Italian population [^113G3LrZ]. Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

Homozygosity for the C677T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is a risk factor for neural tube defects (NTDs) in many populations, including Italians. Another common mutation on the MTHFR gene, A1298C, has also been described as a risk mutation. Furthermore, several studies have suggested that a defective methionine synthase (MS) enzyme could be a critical defect in folate-related NTDs. An A-to-G transition at bp 2756 on the MS gene has also been reported. In this case-control study, we studied the frequencies of these two polymorphisms in 203 Italian probands with non-syndromic NTDs: 98 mothers, 67 fathers, and 210 control individuals. Although the A1298C polymorphism is common in the Italian population (0.25), the allelic frequency was significantly higher among NTD cases and their parents. Heterozygous patients and mothers have an odds ratio (OR) of 1.98 and 2.11, respectively. The risk associated with the 1298CC genotype was higher for cases (OR = 3.67), for fathers (OR = 3.28), and, above all, for mothers (OR = 6.23). The prevalence of the A2756G polymorphism of the MS gene was determined (0.15). No increased prevalence of the mutated G allele was found in NTD families. This study shows that the MTHFRA1298C polymorphism is a genetic determinant for NTD risk in Italy. No association between the MSA2756G and NTD susceptibility was found.

### The frequent 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism is associated with a common haplotype in whites, Japanese, and Africans [^1151T8r7]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

The common 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism causes decreased activity of this enzyme and can be associated with mild-to-moderate hyperhomocysteinemia in homozygotes, particularly when there is folic acid deficiency, as well as with vascular dementia, arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, neural-tube defects, and fetal loss. When folic acid intake is sufficient, homozygotes for MTHFR 677T appear to be protected against colon cancer and acute lymphatic leukemia, and fetuses bearing this genotype have an augmented survival. The distribution of MTHFR 677T is worldwide, but its frequency in different populations varies extensively. In the present study, we addressed the question of whether the MTHFR 677T alteration has an ancestral origin or has occurred repeatedly. We analyzed the frequency distribution of the previously described polymorphism A1298C in exon 7 and of three intronic dimorphisms, in white Israelis (Jews and Arabs), Japanese, and Ghanaian Africans. The 677T allele was, remarkably, associated with one haplotype, G-T-A-C, in white and Japanese homozygotes. Among the Africans, analysis of maximum likelihood also disclosed an association with the G-T-A-C haplotype, although none of the 174 subjects examined was homozygous for MTHFR 677T. These results suggest that the MTHFR 677T alteration occurred on a founder haplotype that may have had a selective advantage.
