## Question

Kidney cysts found on ultrasound. What to do next?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do next after kidney cysts are found on ultrasound, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial ultrasound characterization and the Bosniak classification. Then, I should verify how patient demographics and clinical context modify risk and next steps. Next, I will consider the optimal advanced imaging modality for indeterminate lesions. After that, I need to outline management pathways by Bosniak category, including when to surveil, biopsy, or intervene. Finally, I should confirm follow-up intervals, special populations such as children and those with reduced kidney function, and documentation and counseling requirements, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the basics from the ultrasound report, because management hinges on accurate initial characterization; I need to check size, location, number, wall/septal thickness, calcifications, internal debris, and any solid or enhancing components, and I should ensure the report explicitly assigns a Bosniak category if possible, since that drives downstream decisions and follow-up intensity [^1168SdTT] [^114YzxbN].

> Wait, let me verify the Bosniak classification framework before I proceed; Bosniak I and II are typically benign and generally require no follow-up, Bosniak IIF warrants surveillance, Bosniak III carries intermediate malignancy risk around 40–60%, and Bosniak IV has a high risk around 75–90% and is usually managed as malignant, though I should double-check that the imaging modality used to assign the category is stated because technique affects reliability [^111SnzSu] [^1111fp1i].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; patient age matters because simple cysts are common in older adults and often benign, whereas multiple cysts in children are uncommon and raise concern for hereditary cystic disease, so I need to check age, family history, and whether there are bilateral or numerous cysts before deciding on surveillance versus expedited workup [^114xDMKL] [^112ajxKq].

> I should confirm the clinical context next; symptoms such as flank pain, hematuria, or infection, comorbidities that affect renal function or surgical risk, and prior imaging to assess stability all influence whether I escalate to cross-sectional imaging, biopsy, or intervention, so I need to review these carefully before committing to a plan [^117SuV8e] [^1115BZm5].

> Next, I will examine whether the ultrasound fully characterized the lesion; if the lesion is indeterminate or the category is uncertain, I should obtain contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging, with CT or MRI preferred depending on contrast tolerance and lesion size, and I need to remember that MRI may better characterize small renal masses and that CEUS can be a useful problem-solver when iodinated or gadolinium contrast is contraindicated or when immediate characterization is needed [^111Wem6C] [^111SnzSu] [^115fEHdb] [^1112DznR].

> Let me think about Bosniak I and II lesions; if the ultrasound clearly shows a simple cyst with thin walls, no septa, no calcifications, and no solid components, I should reassure the patient and generally require no further follow-up, but wait, I should verify stability if prior imaging exists and ensure there are no atypical features before discharging them [^114GU1du].

> For Bosniak IIF, I should confirm a surveillance plan; typically that means cross-sectional imaging at 6–12 months to assess stability, then annually for several years if unchanged, and I need to ensure the patient understands that the risk is low but nonzero and that progression, while uncommon, warrants reclassification and possible intervention [^notfound].

> Now, Bosniak III lesions require nuanced decision-making; I should confirm size and patient risk, consider active surveillance as a reasonable option especially if ≤ 2 cm and the patient has competing risks, and I should discuss renal mass biopsy if the risk–benefit for surgery is equivocal or if surveillance is chosen, while remembering that many centers still manage Bosniak III similarly to localized RCC or offer surveillance depending on patient factors and preferences [^1178bHNw] [^111VcH95] [^113DaMXp] [^112ZfDAv].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "biopsy is mandatory" for Bosniak III; let me reconsider because guidelines frame biopsy as a consideration rather than a requirement, particularly when management would change with more information, and I should also note that growth kinetics and interval change at 3–6 months often guide whether to continue surveillance or proceed to surgery [^111VcH95] [^112sV67R].

> For Bosniak IV, I should confirm that the default recommendation is surgical excision given the high malignancy risk, but hold on, I should verify whether active surveillance could be appropriate in select patients with substantial competing risks; in such cases, biopsy of a solid component can refine risk, and if surveillance is chosen, close interval imaging and counseling are essential [^111SnzSu] [^116r1MYk] [^111VcH95].

> I need to ensure I address special populations; in children, multiple cysts are uncommon and strongly suggest hereditary disease, so I should check for ADPKD family history, screen parents with ultrasound, monitor blood pressure and urine protein, and avoid over-imaging because a normal ultrasound does not exclude ADPKD and repeated scans can cause anxiety; genetic testing is reserved for atypical or progressive presentations or when results will change management [^112ajxKq] [^116VukVy] [^114tunEu].

> But wait, what if the patient has reduced kidney function or contrast contraindications; I should double-check that MRI without gadolinium or CEUS can substitute for contrast-enhanced CT in many scenarios, and I must remember that second-generation gadolinium agents are considered safe at any eGFR for renal mass characterization, which helps when MRI is otherwise preferred [^115fEHdb] [^111SnzSu].

> Next, I should review follow-up cadence and modality; for small renal masses or complex cysts under active surveillance, repeating cross-sectional imaging in 3–6 months to assess growth and then spacing to 6–12 months if stable is reasonable, with ultrasound sometimes substituted after initial stability is established, though I need to caution that measurements across modalities can differ and should be interpreted carefully [^116fLQzw] [^117SuV8e].

> I will now examine triggers to escalate care; interval growth exceeding about 0.5 cm/year, upgrade in Bosniak category, development of new solid or enhancing components, or new symptoms should prompt reconsideration of biopsy or intervention, and I should confirm that these thresholds are communicated during shared decision-making [^111VcH95] [^112sV67R].

> Hold on, I should verify that documentation and counseling are not overlooked; I need to record the Bosniak category, imaging modality used to assign it, rationale for surveillance versus intervention, and the follow-up plan, and I should counsel patients on tumor biology, individualized risk, competing comorbidities, and the trade-offs between immediate treatment and surveillance, ideally within a multidisciplinary framework for complex cases [^1111fp1i] [^1126pS4v] [^114u1Ekt].

> Let me summarize to ensure internal consistency; start with precise ultrasound characterization and Bosniak assignment, integrate patient age and comorbidities, use contrast-enhanced CT or MRI or CEUS when ultrasound is indeterminate, manage Bosniak I–II with reassurance or minimal surveillance, Bosniak IIF with scheduled imaging, Bosniak III with surveillance or intervention based on size and patient risk with selective biopsy, and Bosniak IV with surgical excision or carefully selected surveillance, all anchored in shared decision-making and guideline-concordant follow-up intervals [^111Wem6C] [^11681uYN] [^1178bHNw] [^111SnzSu].

Kidney cysts on ultrasound are common and usually benign, but management depends on **Bosniak classification** and patient factors [^114NeYvU]. Simple cysts (Bosniak I/II) require **no follow-up** unless symptomatic, whereas complex cysts (Bosniak III/IV) need **contrast-enhanced CT or MRI** for further characterization and urology referral for possible surgery or biopsy [^114XmAJa] [^111Wem6C]. Bosniak IIF cysts warrant **surveillance imaging at 6–12 months** [^notfound]. Evaluate for ADPKD if there are multiple bilateral cysts or a family history, and refer to nephrology if there is CKD or hypertension [^112ajxKq] [^115u6Lb5]. Always correlate with clinical context and use shared decision-making for management [^1115BZm5].

---

## Initial evaluation and characterization

During initial evaluation, **confirm cyst features** — assess size, location, number, wall thickness, septations, calcifications, and solid components [^112Efj8L]. Then, **apply the Bosniak classification** to stratify malignancy risk and guide management [^114YzxbN].

| **Bosniak category** | **Description** | **Malignancy risk** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|-|
| I | Simple cyst | < 1% | No follow-up |
| II | Minimally complex | 1–5% | No follow-up |
| IIF | Mildly complex | 5–10% | Surveillance at 6–12 months |
| III | Complex | 40–60% | Surgical excision or active surveillance |
| IV | Solid components | 80–90% | Surgical excision |

## Management based on Bosniak classification

### Bosniak I and II cysts

For Bosniak I and II cysts, **no routine follow-up** is needed; provide reassurance and patient education [^114GU1du]. Consider follow-up only if the cyst is **symptomatic** (pain, hematuria, infection) or if the patient prefers it [^notfound].

---

### Bosniak IIF cysts

For Bosniak IIF cysts, **surveillance imaging** with ultrasound or MRI at 6–12 months is recommended [^notfound]. Escalate care if there is **interval growth**, new solid components, or other concerning features.

---

### Bosniak III and IV cysts

For Bosniak III and IV cysts, obtain **contrast-enhanced CT or MRI** for definitive characterization and staging [^111SnzSu]. Refer to urology for **surgical excision**, biopsy, or active surveillance based on patient factors and shared decision-making [^113DaMXp] [^1178bHNw].

---

## Indications for further imaging or intervention

- **Complex features**: Thickened walls, septations, calcifications, or solid components [^111SnzSu].
- **Growth**: Rapid interval growth (> 0.5 cm/year) [^114ebDuH].
- **Symptoms**: Pain, hematuria, infection, or hypertension [^1174Gxeo].
- **Patient factors**: Age, comorbidities, and patient preference [^1115BZm5].

---

## Special considerations

- **ADPKD**: Multiple bilateral cysts or family history warrant genetic counseling and nephrology referral [^1127fwXY].
- **CKD**: Refer to nephrology if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or proteinuria [^115u6Lb5].
- **Contrast**: Use MRI or ultrasound if contrast is contraindicated [^115fEHdb].

---

## Patient counseling and education

Explain cyst type, **malignancy risk**, and **management plan** [^1126pS4v]. Discuss **follow-up**, potential complications, and when to seek care [^116tYyQD]. Engage patients in **shared decision-making**, especially for complex cysts or surgery [^117SuV8e].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Bosniak I/II**: No routine follow-up unless symptomatic.
- **Bosniak IIF**: Surveillance at 6–12 months.
- **Bosniak III/IV**: Contrast-enhanced CT/MRI and urology referral.
- **ADPKD**: Genetic counseling and nephrology referral.
- **CKD**: Nephrology referral if indicated [^115u6Lb5].

---

Kidney cysts on ultrasound are usually benign; management should follow the **Bosniak classification**, patient factors, and shared decision-making.

Box 2 Radiological diagnosis

Recommendation 2.1

Ultrasonography is the current radiological method of choice to screen for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in children (evidence level B; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 2.2

In a child under 15 years with a positive family history of ADPKD, sonographic detection of one or more kidney cysts is highly suggestive of ADPKD (evidence level B, recommendation level moderate). In a fetus or neonate with a positive family history of ADPKD, hyperechogenic and/or enlarged kidneys (> 2 s.d.) on ultrasonography are suggestive of ADPKD (evidence level C; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 2.3

If kidney ultrasonography is normal in an at-risk child, this finding does not exclude ADPKD. However, if making a diagnosis based on ultrasonography is requested, it is not necessary to rescreen at intervals shorter than 3 years (evidence level C; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 2.4

Multiple cysts with negative family history require clinical work-up for cystic kidney diseases (evidence level B, recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 2.5

Detection of a solitary cyst in childhood requires follow-up imaging (evidence level C; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 2.6

There are no established MRI-based diagnostic criteria for ADPKD in children younger than 15 years (evidence level B–C; recommendation level moderate).

### Management of incidental pancreatic cysts: a white paper of the ACR incidental findings committee [^113dKJNr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The ACR Incidental Findings Committee (IFC) presents recommendations for managing pancreatic cysts that are incidentally detected on CT or MRI. These recommendations represent an update from the pancreatic component of the JACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. The Pancreas Subcommittee-which included abdominal radiologists, a gastroenterologist, and a pancreatic surgeon-developed this algorithm. The recommendations draw from published evidence and expert opinion, and were finalized by informal iterative consensus. Algorithm branches successively categorize pancreatic cysts based on patient characteristics and imaging features. They terminate with an ascertainment of benignity and/or indolence (sufficient to discontinue follow-up), or a management recommendation. The algorithm addresses most, but not all, pathologies and clinical scenarios. Our goal is to improve quality of care by providing guidance on how to manage incidentally detected pancreatic cysts.

### KDIGO 2025 ADPKD guideline: a commentary on diagnosis and management of hepatopancreatic manifestations by the ERA working group genes&kidney [^114UTKYk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2025 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation, Management, and Treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a long-awaited development and the first KDIGO guideline addressing a genetic kidney disease. The approval of tolvaptan as targeted therapy for ADPKD in 2015, marked a pivotal advancement, and galvanized towards a structured approach in research and clinical care. Considering the systemic nature of ADPKD guidance for the management of extrarenal manifestations is of special importance for nephrologists and requires interdisciplinary collaboration. In this regard, cysts in other organs, particularly the liver, are the most common extrarenal finding. While most liver cysts are incidental findings on routine imaging, both cyst infections and severe polycystic liver disease accompanying ADPKD come with a high disease burden and challenges in management. In contrast, pancreatic cysts in ADPKD are usually completely asymptomatic, but raise questions about the need for follow-up. This commentary provides an overview of the most important recommendations and practice points on hepatopancreatic cysts provided by the KDIGO guideline with the aim to contribute to implementation and to highlight remaining gaps in guidance, clinical care and research.

### The incidental renal mass-update on characterization and management [^114Jozz5]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Renal masses are commonly encountered on cross-sectional imaging examinations performed for nonrenal indications. Although most can be dismissed as benign cysts, a subset will be either indeterminate or suspicious; in many cases, imaging cannot be used to reliably differentiate between benign and malignant masses. On-going research in defining characteristics of common renal masses on advanced imaging shows promise in offering solutions to this issue. A recent update of the Bosniak classification (used to categorize cystic renal masses) was proposed with the goals of decreasing imaging follow-up in likely benign cystic masses, and therefore avoiding unnecessary surgical resection of such masses.

### Imaging features, follow-up, and management of incidentally detected renal lesions [^114WBTXb]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Incidental renal masses are common findings on cross-sectional imaging. Most will be readily identified as simple cysts, but with an inexorable rise in abdominal imaging, [particularly computed tomography (CT)], coupled with a rise in the incidence of renal cancer, the likelihood of detecting a malignant mass is increasing. This review informs the radiologist which lesions can be safely ignored, which will require further imaging for accurate categorization, and which require referral for consideration of treatment. For the small proportion of lesions that are indeterminate, careful attention to imaging technique, and the use of unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in all but a few specific instances will accurately characterize such lesions. The figures have been chosen to illustrate specific imaging features of common renal lesions. Management options for malignant, or presumed malignant, renal masses include active surveillance, percutaneous ablation, laparoscopic or open, partial or total nephrectomy. Biopsy has a role in determining the nature of masses that remain indeterminate on cross-sectional imaging, prior to definitive treatment. Common pitfalls in assessing incidental renal lesions are emphasized; some of these are due to sub-optimal imaging techniques and others to errors in interpretation.

### Active surveillance of small renal masses [^114GU1du]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal masses: contraindications for active surveillance

AS should not be carried out in the following:
Benign renal masses reliably diagnosed by imaging or biopsy
Renal masses with irregular borders
Non-localized renal tumors (i.e. locally, lymphatically, or hematogenously disseminated)
When the oncologic benefits of intervention outweigh the risks of treatment and competing risks of death
When the patient refuses to be included in AS

Most renal masses incidentally found by cross-sectional imaging are cysts which, according to the Bosniak renal cyst classification system, do not require follow-up. In 2017, the Incidental Findings Committee (IFC) of the American College of Radiology (ACR) updated its recommendations on the management of incidental renal masses by computed tomography (CT). This excellent guideline describes the different scenarios of the management of incidental renal masses. It is of note that in these guidelines, the following renal masses presumed to be non-complicated cysts and considered benign by imaging techniques do not require follow-up or treatment (Fig. 3).
Homogeneous well-defined, too small to be characterized renal masses (TSTC) supposed to be cysts. Too small to characterize renal masses occur when the lesion size is less than twice the reconstructed slice thickness (Fig. 3 a).
Homogeneous well-defined renal masses with attenuation − 10 to 20 Hounsfield units (HU) by CT are likely benign cysts (Fig. 3 b).
Homogeneous well-defined renal masses with attenuation ≥ 70 HU on non-contrast CT consistent with hemorrhagic cysts (Fig. 3 c).
Completely characterized Bosniak I cysts diagnosed by ultrasound (US), CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. 3 d).
Completely characterized Bosniak II cysts diagnosed by US, CT, or MRI (Fig. 3 e).

### Dysplastic and polycystic kidneys: diagnosis, associations and management [^114HA1JK]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2001). Low credibility.

Cystic and bright kidneys can pose a significant diagnostic dilemma when discovered as an incidental finding at the time of a routine fetal ultrasound scan. There are diverse aetiologies with equally variable implications for the prognosis in the affected fetus, and for future pregnancies. Accurate antenatal diagnosis in the absence of any positive family history is often not possible and a team approach to management (to include the fetal medicine specialist, paediatric nephrologist or urologist, geneticists and in some cases, pathologist) is essential. In this review we will attempt to describe the embryology and aetiology of these conditions and suggest an approach to management.

### European ADPKD forum multidisciplinary position statement on autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease care: European ADPKD forum and multispecialist roundtable participants [^1127fwXY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS

A diagnosis of ADPKD can have important lifelong effects on patients, including psychosocial and financial consequences. The advantages and disadvantages of offering screening to a patient's family members should be carefully discussed. The offer of screening should be provided with appropriate counselling on the implications of a diagnosis for adults and children. Routine pre-symptomatic screening of ADPKD is not recommended for at-risk children, while it is usually thought that the benefits outweigh the risks in adults. Ultrasound imaging is recommended for parents of children or adolescents in whom ADPKD is suspected and who have no previous family history of ADPKD.

ADPKD is diagnosed in adults and children mainly by ultrasound imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Both can be used for prognostic assessment. Specialist consultation is recommended for paediatric patients with renal cysts, as genetic testing is often required to confirm the diagnosis when clinical findings are equivocal. A detailed examination and additional investigations should be performed to identify extra-renal manifestations if appropriate.

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in children and young people [^111aurf7]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

These recommendations were systematically developed on behalf of the Network for Early Onset Cystic Kidney Disease (NEOCYST) by an international group of experts in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) from paediatric and adult nephrology, human genetics, paediatric radiology and ethics specialties together with patient representatives. They have been endorsed by the International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA) and the European Society of Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN). For asymptomatic minors at risk of ADPKD, ongoing surveillance (repeated screening for treatable disease manifestations without diagnostic testing) or immediate diagnostic screening are equally valid clinical approaches. Ultrasonography is the current radiological method of choice for screening. Sonographic detection of one or more cysts in an at-risk child is highly suggestive of ADPKD, but a negative scan cannot rule out ADPKD in childhood. Genetic testing is recommended for infants with very-early-onset symptomatic disease and for children with a negative family history and progressive disease. Children with a positive family history and either confirmed or unknown disease status should be monitored for hypertension (preferably by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) and albuminuria. Currently, vasopressin antagonists should not be offered routinely but off-label use can be considered in selected children. No consensus was reached on the use of statins, but mTOR inhibitors and somatostatin analogues are not recommended. Children with ADPKD should be strongly encouraged to achieve the low dietary salt intake that is recommended for all children.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^117SuV8e]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Active surveillance (AS) criteria, risk stratification, and follow-up: For patients with a solid renal mass < 2cm, or those that are complex but predominantly cystic, clinicians may elect AS with potential for delayed intervention for initial management (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass, clinicians should prioritize AS/expectant management when the anticipated risk of intervention or competing risks of death outweigh the potential oncologic benefits of active treatment; in asymptomatic patients, the panel recommends periodic clinical surveillance and/or imaging based on shared decision making (Clinical Principle). For patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass in whom the risk/benefit analysis is equivocal and who prefer AS, clinicians should consider RMB (if the mass is solid or has solid components) for further oncologic risk stratification, and repeat cross-sectional imaging should be obtained approximately 3–6 months later to assess for interval growth; subsequent surveillance can be based on growth rate and shared decision-making, with intervention recommended if substantial interval growth is observed or if other clinical/imaging findings suggest that the risk/benefit analysis is no longer equivocal or favorable for continued AS (Expert Opinion). For patients in whom the anticipated oncologic benefits of intervention outweigh the risks of treatment and competing risks of death, clinicians should recommend intervention; AS with potential for delayed intervention may be pursued only if the patient understands and is willing to accept the associated oncologic risks, clinicians should encourage RMB (if the mass is predominantly solid), and if AS is chosen then close clinical and cross-sectional imaging surveillance with periodic reassessment and counselling should be recommended (Moderate Recommendation).

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^116fLQzw]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Active surveillance (AS) imaging — frequency, modalities, and biopsy: Patients with no prior imaging should have surveillance imaging initially every 3 to 6 months to assess for interval growth and other changes in a small renal mass. The preferred modality is not well established, but initial imaging should preferably consist of contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging, after which subsequent imaging may include the same or when appropriate an abdominal ultrasound (US) can be substituted. Abdominal US (as opposed to retroperitoneal US) may have the additional benefit of a survey of the intraabdominal organs for progression, and differences in tumor dimension measurements between these different modalities may be significant and should be interpreted with caution when making treatment decisions. For risk stratification during AS, renal mass biopsy (RMB) can be considered for additional risk stratification for patients with solid masses on AS, whereas for patients with predominantly cystic lesions, RMB should be avoided.

### Perinatal diagnosis, management, and follow-up of cystic renal diseases: a clinical practice recommendation with systematic literature reviews [^113KQgUR]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Prenatal and neonatal cystic kidney diseases are a group of rare disorders manifesting as single, multiple unilateral, or bilateral cysts or with increased echogenicity of the renal cortex without macroscopic cysts. They may be accompanied by grossly enlarged kidneys, renal oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, extrarenal abnormalities, and neonatal kidney failure. The prognosis is extremely variable from trivial to very severe or even uniformly fatal, which poses significant challenges to prenatal counseling and management.

Objective

To provide a clinical practice recommendation for fetal medicine specialists, obstetricians, neonatologists, pediatric nephrologists, pediatricians, and human geneticists by aggregating current evidence and consensus expert opinion on current management of cystic nephropathies before and after birth.

Methods

After 8 systematic literature reviews on clinically relevant questions were prepared (including 90 studies up to mid-2016), recommendations were formulated and formally graded at a consensus meeting that included experts from all relevant specialties. After further discussion, the final version was voted on by all members using the Delphi method. The recommendations were reviewed and endorsed by the working groups on inherited renal disorders of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) and European Society for Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN); the German Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (DGGG), German Society of Perinatal Medicine (DGPM), and German Society of Ultrasound in Medicine (DEGUM); and the alliance of patient organizations, PKD International.

Recommendations

The group makes a number of recommendations on prenatal and postnatal imaging by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, genetic testing, prenatal counseling, in utero therapeutic interventions, and postnatal management of prenatal and neonatal cystic kidney diseases, including provision of renal replacement therapy in neonates. In addition to detailed knowledge about possible etiologies and their prognosis, physicians need to be aware of recent improvements and remaining challenges of childhood chronic kidney disease, neonatal renal replacement therapy, and intensive pulmonary care to manage these cases and to empower parents for informed decision making.

Radiological diagnosis

Renal ultrasonography

The current gold standard for radiological diagnosis of ADPKD is renal ultrasonography (Box 2). Ultrasonography is an inexpensive and non-invasive method of examination that is particularly suitable for children because of their smaller body size and the fact that the procedure does not require sedation or ionizing radiation. Diagnostic ultrasonography criteria for ADPKD have been established only for adults; however, in children, there is usually no clinical need to make a genetic diagnosis regardless of the ultrasonography findings or to perform more sensitive diagnosis using MRI (which may require sedation) if the renal ultrasonography scan is normal as cyst burden correlates with the risk of the main complications such as hypertension. In line with clinical practice guidelines for adults –, we recommend reserving genetic testing to selected situations (see below). We have provided detailed guidance on the prenatal and postnatal imaging of single and multiple kidney cysts and their differential diagnosis in separate statements.

Diagnostic specificity and sensitivity

In a PKD1 gene linkage analysis study, the diagnostic specificity of one or more cysts on ultrasonography in at-risk children was 89% in those younger than 5 years of age and 100% in those older than 5 years of age. Failure to confirm cysts on follow-up has been reported rarely with single but not with multiple cysts – and may be due, for example, to a mistaken dilated calyx, mistaken prominent medullary pyramid or technical difficulties in obese children. For young adults, established imaging diagnostic criteria require at least three renal cysts on ultrasonography, or ten on MRI. However, the studies on which these criteria are based did not include patients younger than 15 years of age. Numerous studies have shown that, owing to the gradual appearance of cysts, children with ADPKD usually have a much lower number of cysts than adults, and young children may not yet have detectable cysts on ultrasonography, especially in families with a mild phenotype –. Diagnostic sensitivity is therefore better in older than in younger children and with the use of high-resolution versus lower-resolution ultrasonography. Parents should be counselled that the negative predictive value of a normal ultrasonography scan in childhood is limited and that later appearance of cysts may be due to a milder underlying genetic alteration (for example, PKD2 or GANAB (glucosidase-α neutral AB form) mutations) or variability of the individual clinical course. As cysts develop slowly and children with fewer cysts have later onset of hypertension and proteinuria. children with a normal ultrasonography scan should not be subjected to frequent repeat scans.

NCCN Kidney Cancer — active surveillance is an option for the initial management of clinical stage T1 renal lesions, including that it is an option for renal masses < 2 cm given the high rates of benign tumors and low metastatic potential of these masses, active surveillance of patients with T1a tumors (≤ 4 cm) that have a predominantly cystic component is recommended, and it is an option for patients with clinical stage T1 masses and significant competing risks of death or morbidity from intervention. Active surveillance entails serial abdomen imaging with timely intervention should the mass demonstrate changes (eg, increasing tumor size, growth rate, infiltrative pattern) indicative of increasing metastatic potential, and active surveillance should include periodic metastatic survey including blood work and chest imaging, particularly if the mass demonstrates growth.

Screening in at-risk minors

The question of whether to screen at-risk children of parents affected by ADPKD is a regularly encountered but often contentious clinical issue. Both genetic testing and ultrasonography screening should be considered diagnostic and require prior counselling (Box 1).

Counselling

Uncertainty about a child's disease status causes a high psychological burden for many families. Parents of at-risk children should be informed about the possibilities, limits and consequences of genetic and clinical testing of their children by appropriately skilled personnel. They should understand that screening examinations do not always yield definitive results and importantly that a normal kidney ultrasonography scan has a low negative predictive value in children. Offering diagnostic screening does not imply that this screening is advised but provides parents with the opportunity to make an informed choice. As time for non-directional genetic counselling may be limited in general practice and adult nephrological care, referral to a geneticist or specialized ADPKD clinic may be required. In the case of a child being presented to a paediatric nephrology clinic for testing, adequate parental understanding of the ethical issues should be confirmed before screening. Reliable external information, such as patient support groups, can also help in decision-making.

### Management of incidental liver lesions on CT: a white paper of the ACR incidental findings committee [^114YMWFD]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The ACR Committee on Incidental Findings presents recommendations for managing liver lesions that are incidentally detected on CT. These recommendations represent an update from the liver component of the ACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and liver. The Liver Subcommittee-which included five abdominal radiologists, one hepatologist, and one hepatobiliary surgeon-developed this algorithm. The recommendations draw from published evidence and expert opinion and were finalized by informal iterative consensus. Algorithm branches categorize liver lesions on the basis of patient characteristics and imaging features. They terminate with an assessment of benignity or a specific follow-up recommendation. The algorithm addresses most, but not all, pathologies and clinical scenarios. The goal is to improve the quality of care by providing guidance on how to manage incidentally detected liver lesions.

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in children and young people [^114CBkky]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Routine monitoring of cyst growth

In asymptomatic children, routine monitoring of cyst growth should not be performed too frequently as ultrasonography findings are very unlikely to influence clinical management decisions and the psychological burden of regular 'cyst counting' should be considered. Cyst number and TKV correlate with hypertension. but ultrasonography cannot replace direct measurement of blood pressure, which remains essential in clinical practice. Although children with very-early-onset ADPKD have poorer outcomes, no studies have examined whether the prediction of 'rapid progressors' by repeated imaging in children is feasible and clinically helpful. Our recommendation (Box 6) would change in the future if paediatric studies show a predictive value of kidney imaging on later progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD; as has been shown in adults) and a treatment to slow disease progression is licensed specifically for children who are at risk of early progression to ESRD.

As discussed below, ultrasonography examination is an essential tool in the investigation of symptomatic children, for example, when investigating urinary tract infections (UTIs), cyst haemorrhage, gross haematuria, renal stones or cyst infections. Before transition from paediatric to adult care, ultrasonography findings may also provide some guidance as to whether to refer the patient to a general practitioner or directly to a nephrologist.

Box 6 Routine monitoring of cyst growth

Recommendation 6.1

In asymptomatic children with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the clinical value of repeated ultrasonography is unclear. Depending on the clinical course and the age of the patient, ultrasonography may provide insights into the dynamics of disease progression but, in routine clinical care of classical ADPKD, we suggest that monitoring intervals shorter than 3 years are unnecessary (evidence level X, recommendation level weak).

### Commentary: tolvaptan for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)-an update [^111h1iG5]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Practical guide for prescribing tolvaptan

The following steps outline the essential considerations and processes for safely prescribing tolvaptan in the management of ADPKD. These steps have been adjusted from a practical guide published by Chebib et al.

A. Ensure a confirmed diagnosis of ADPKD.
B. Confirm eligibility for tolvaptan.
C. Confirm evidence of rapidly progressive disease or high risk of progression.
D. Confirm that there are no exclusions.
E. Consider potential drug interactions.
F. Initiate and titrate Tolvaptan.
G. Establish monitoring plan.
H. Manage side effects and adverse effects associated with tolvaptan.

Ensure a confirmed diagnosis of ADPKD

Recommendation 1: We recommend that all people with ADPKD being considered for tolvaptan should have an established diagnosis of ADPKD through diagnostic imaging and/or genetic testing.

Diagnostic imaging

In atypical cases or when ultrasound findings don't align with clinical symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) offer greater sensitivity for detecting small cysts (< 5 mm). In the absence of family history, detecting ≥ 10 cysts per kidney with any imaging modality can be considered diagnostic for ADPKD, in the presence of bilaterally enlarged kidneys and the exclusion of other forms of cystic kidney diseases.

Genetic testing

Whole genome sequencing is available through the National Health Service (NHS) Genomic Medicine Service in England, the Scottish Strategic Network for Genomic Medicine in Scotland, the All Wales Medical Genomics Service in Wales and Belfast City Hospital Clinical Genetics Department in Northern Ireland. Identifying a monoallelic pathogenic variant in a cystic kidney disease gene (most commonly PKD1 or PKD2) can confirm a diagnosis of ADPKD. This is particularly useful in the context of atypical disease or those without a family history (~ 30%). A genetic diagnosis has several clinical applications including risk assessment, family planning, and confirming kidney donor suitability.

### Clinical practice guideline monitoring children and young people with, or at risk of developing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^113pj2RK]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

No relevant studies were identified for this review question; however, NICE guidance on patient experience in adult NHS services recommends that patients should be provided with information, and the support they need to promote their active participation in care and self-management. This should include information about relevant treatment options and services that they are entitled to, even if these are not provided locally. There was 100% agreement with this recommendation in the Delphi consensus process. Health professionals should be aware of the anxiety suffered by families relating to uncertainty of diagnosis as well as at times of testing for ADPKD.

Health professionals should discuss the limitations of testing modalities for ADPKD. Renal ultrasound cannot effectively exclude ADPKD in children. In a retrospective cohort study of ultrasound assessment in children and young people under the age of 15 at risk of ADPKD, 193/420 CYP were diagnosed with cysts at baseline visit (mean age 8.6 +/− 4.2 years) with 227 having no cysts (8.0 ± 4.1 years). In follow up to age fifteen, 18/77 (23%) of the latter group who underwent repeat ultrasound developed cysts. In other words, 23% of CYP with no cysts visible on initial renal ultrasound who received a further ultrasound, were diagnosed with ADPKD. No standardised criteria for renal ultrasound diagnosis of ADPKD exist for children under the age of 15 years, and even below the age of 30, there is a significant false negative rate. This is particularly so in families carrying a PKD2 mutation, which is typically associated with milder disease. In these families, 16.5% of patients between the ages of 15–29, with no cysts on initial ultrasound scan, go on to a diagnosis of ADPKD later in life. While genetic testing is more definitive, it is most likely to be informative in families of known genotype, as around 10% of families phenotypically affected by ADPKD do not carry a pathogenic mutation of PKD1 or PKD2 that is detected by current technologies. Health professionals (generally nephrologists, geneticists or paediatricians with interest in nephrology) providing information on testing should have a good understanding of these issues.

Box 3 Molecular diagnosis

Recommendation 3.1

We recommend offering genetic testing for cystic kidney disease genes to infants and children with very-early-onset (VEO) symptomatic disease independent of family history and to those with progressive disease (increasing cyst number or kidney volume) and a negative family history (evidence level B; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 3.2

In patients with a positive family history and unusually severe clinical course, genetic testing may be beneficial (evidence level D; recommendation level weak).

Recommendation 3.3

We do not recommend genetic testing in patients with a single cyst, no extrarenal findings and a negative family history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (evidence level B–C; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 3.4

For genetic testing in children with VEO polycystic kidney disease or unusually progressive disease with a negative family history, we suggest using a multigene panel, including cystic kidney disease genes with a protocol adequately covering PKD1 rather than testing single ADPKD genes (evidence level C; recommendation level weak).

### Common incidental findings on MDCT: survey of radiologist recommendations for patient management [^116PjvP1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to evaluate for agreement with respect to how radiologists report incidental findings encountered on CT.

Methods

A multiple-choice survey was designed to query radiologists about how they handle 12 incidental findings on body CT, assuming the patient is a 45-year-old woman with no history of malignancy. Included were a 1-cm thyroid nodule, a 5-mm noncalcified lung nodule, coronary artery calcification, a 2-cm adrenal nodule, a 2-cm pancreatic cyst, a 1-cm enhancing liver lesion, a 2-cm high-density renal cyst, short-segment small bowel intussusception, a 1-cm splenic cyst, focal gallbladder wall calcification, and a 3-cm ovarian cyst in both a premenopausal woman and a postmenopausal woman. Choices ranged from "do not report" to advising interventional procedures tailored to the organ. Surveys were administered to body CT attending radiologists at 3 academic institutions.

Results

Twenty-seven radiologists completed the survey. The mean experience level was 15.7 years after training. Seventy percent or greater agreement on interpretation was identified for only 6 findings: recommend ultrasound for a 1-cm thyroid nodule, recommend ultrasound for a 3-cm cyst in postmenopausal woman, follow Fleischner Society recommendations for a 5-mm lung nodule, describe only coronary calcification, and describe as likely benign both short-segment small bowel intussusception and a 1-cm splenic cyst.

Conclusions

Agreement is lacking, both across institutions and within departments, for the management of 6 commonly encountered incidental findings on body CT. Individual departments should develop internal guidelines to ensure consistent recommendations based on existing evidence.

### Clinical practice guideline monitoring children and young people with, or at risk of developing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^115HWYYa]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5

We suggest that, if asymptomatic children at risk of ADPKD do not have cysts on ultrasound, further ultrasound testing should be deferred until adolescence (15–18 years), or later if preferred by the young person (2D).

Audit Measure 5: Proportion of asymptomatic children at risk of ADPKD who do not have cysts on ultrasound, having repeated ultrasound testing prior to adolescence (15–18 years).

Rationale

No relevant studies assessing outcomes in asymptomatic children at risk of ADPKD undergoing repeated ultrasound testing for ADPKD, compared with those not undergoing repeated ultrasound testing, were identified for this review question. There was 70% agreement with this recommendation (statement) by the Delphi panellists, i.e. consensus not reached. Areas for disagreement largely related to the age of the child at the time of the first negative ultrasound scan and a preference to perform more regular ultrasound scans if requested by parents. There may also be concern by health professionals about the risk of missing very early onset ADPKD, however, these children comprise less than 1% of cases and are likely to be genetically distinct from typical ADPKD, perhaps with multiple compound mutations combining to generate such an aggressive phenotype. This recommendation does not apply to these children, who undergo diagnostic testing for symptomatic disease (e.g. severe renal enlargement, hypertension) and are found to have radiological abnormalities at presentation.

Repeated ultrasound testing is not routinely undertaken in adults with ADPKD where significant progression usually occurs over decades. In the absence of evidence of benefit of repeated ultrasound testing in asymptomatic CYP, together with its resource implications, and the importance of considering the wishes of the young person in the decision making process where possible, the committee was of the view that a recommendation for repeated ultrasound testing prior to adolescence could not be made. The committee considered whether repeated ultrasound testing might help to alleviate parental anxiety, but noted in their experience that repeated ultrasound testing may also add to the psychological burden for families.

The committee also noted that, although not reaching consensus, the majority (70%) of panellists supported deferring further ultrasound testing until adolescence (15–18 years, or later if preferred by the young person) in asymptomatic children at risk of ADPKD who do not have cysts on initial ultrasound. The committee therefore agreed to make a weaker 'we suggest' recommendation.

Management of complications

Abdominal pain

Abdominal pain is reported in 10–20% of children with ADPKD. As abdominal and back pain are very common symptoms among children and adolescents in general, further investigations and treatment need to be guided by acuity, intensity and associated findings(Box 9). Even in the early stages of ADPKD, episodes of nonspecific abdominal pain are frequently reported by adults and tend to be underestimated by physicians. However, patients might have a biased perception of pain, especially if investigations for abdominal pain led to their incidental diagnosis of ADPKD. Chronic pain requires a multidisciplinary approach to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment and to improve self-management. Chronic and/or high-dose use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) should be avoided because of potential renal adverse effects.

Urinary tract and cyst infections

Cohort studies suggest an increased incidence of UTIs in children with ADPKD (up to 15–25%). These studies may be biased as imaging for UTI may have prompted the diagnosis of ADPKD. As no studies have suggested an increased incidence of complicated or prolonged infections in children with ADPKD, local standards for the diagnosis and treatment of UTI in otherwise healthy children should be applied.

Suspicion of upper UTI in children with ADPKD should lead to examination of urine (and blood) cultures, as well as renal ultrasonography, much the same as in otherwise healthy children. Cyst infection is a very rare complication of childhood ADPKD. If suspected clinically or on ultrasonography imaging, experience in adults suggests that 18 F-FDG–PET/computed tomography (CT) is superior to contrast CT or MRI to confirm the diagnosis and localize the infected cyst, but this approach can produce false-negative results. Treatment of cyst infection has a high failure rate and requires long-term use of antibiotics. Precise localization of an infected cyst can be extremely difficult in patients with many cysts but is necessary only for refractory infection when cyst drainage may be required.

Multiple cysts

The incidence of simple cysts in children is very low. Multiple kidney cysts in childhood are therefore highly suggestive of ADPKD or another cystic nephropathy (such as cystic dysplasia or multicystic-dysplastic kidney) and should be investigated. Clinical work-up will include inquiry about (related) symptoms, detailed history and physical examination and may require further investigations of other organ systems. Parental examination may reveal previously undetected ADPKD.

Solitary cysts

In children with a positive family history, a solitary cyst is a very likely sign of ADPKD, but in rare cases the cyst may not be confirmed on follow-up –. In children with a negative family history, ultrasonography of the parents should be performed and, if the results are normal, further work-up or follow-up of the child is needed to exclude the appearance of multiple cysts or the development of a complex cyst.

MRI

In adults and probably also teenage children, MRI is more sensitive than ultrasonography for detection of kidney cysts in ADPKD. In neonates and infants, high-resolution ultrasonography can detect even small cysts, but no studies have defined a gold standard for imaging kidney cysts in this age group. As MRI usually requires sedation in children younger than 6 years and is more expensive than ultrasonography imaging, it is not the diagnostic method of choice for paediatric ADPKD.

### Active surveillance of small renal masses [^11198QE2]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Most renal masses incidentally detected by cross-sectional images are benign, being mainly cysts, and if they are malignant, they are indolent in nature with limited metastatic potential. Enhanced renal masses less than 4 cm in size are known as small renal masses (SRMs), and their growth rate (GR) and the possibility of developing metastasis are extremely low. Delayed intervention of SRMs by closed and routine imaging follow-up known as active surveillance (AS) is now an option according to urological guidelines. Radiologists have a key position in AS management of SRMs even unifocal and multifocal (sporadic or associated with genetic syndromes) and also in the follow-up of complex renal cysts by Bosniak cyst classification system. Radiologists play a key role in the AS of both unifocal and multifocal (sporadic or associated with genetic syndromes) SRMs as well as in the follow-up of complex renal cysts using the Bosniak cyst classification system. Indeed, radiologists must determine which patients with SRMs or complex renal cysts can be included in AS, establish the follow-up radiological test algorithm to be used in different scenarios, perform measurements in follow-up tests, and decide when AS should be discontinued. The purpose of this article is to review the indications and management of AS in SRMs, especially focused on specific scenarios, such as complex renal cysts and multifocal renal tumors (sporadic or hereditary). In this work, the authors aimed to provide a thorough review of imaging in the context of active surveillance of renal masses.

### Management of complex renal cysts in Canada: results of a survey study [^114v9prP]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study supports that, despite the lack of high-quality evidence, many Canadian urologists offer active surveillance as an option to patients with complex renal cysts, especially if they have a Bosniak III cyst. However, the lack of sufficient data or guidelines on safety seems to prevent widespread adoption of active surveillance. Prospective studies should be conducted to provide evidence on the oncologic safety, benefits, harms, cost, eligibility criteria, and guidelines for the discontinuation of active surveillance in the management of Bosniak III and IV cysts.

### Incidental renal cysts found by point-of-care ultrasound: a retrospective chart review [^114xDMKL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Incidental findings are unrelated to a patient's complaint, found on diagnostic imaging, such as point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Incidental findings represent potential harms to patients and may lead to increased patient anxiety and health care costs related to downstream testing and surveillance.

Study Objectives

In this study, we aimed to calculate the rate of incidental renal cysts found by POCUS. Further, we hoped to describe how emergency physicians relay the findings to patients. Lastly, we hoped to examine if patients suffered harms in the 12 months following identification of an incidental renal cyst.

Methods

From our single-center, academic emergency department (ED), we reviewed renal POCUS images from 1000 consecutive adult ED patients to determine if there was a renal cyst. Next, we performed manual chart review to determine if patients were informed of the incidental renal cyst or suffered any patient harms.

Results

We found the prevalence of renal cysts to be 6.5% (95% confidence interval: 4.9%-8.4%). Those with cysts were more likely to be older compared to those without (63 ± 14 vs. 49 ± 15 years of age). Only 8% of patients had evidence that they were informed of their incidental renal cyst. No patients received a biopsy or were diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma or polycystic kidney disease.

Conclusion

Incidental renal cysts are common and are more likely to be found in older adults. In our study, physicians infrequently informed patients of their incidental finding.

### New modalities for evaluation and surveillance of complex renal cysts [^113aWMtz]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The increased use of abdominal imaging has led to more frequent detection of incidental renal cysts. Since the inception of the Bosniak classification system, management of Bosniak I, III and IV cysts has been clearly defined, while evaluation and management of Bosniak II and IIF cysts have remained a clinical dilemma. Discussions of new imaging modalities are becoming increasingly prevalent in the radiological literature. In this context we performed a comprehensive review of the recent literature on complex renal cysts focusing on new imaging modalities, surveillance strategies and biopsy.

Materials and Methods

We performed a comprehensive literature review of articles published from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2013 via MEDLINE(®), EMBASE and the Cochrane Collection using a predetermined search strategy. All studies included were performed in humans older than 18 years, were written in English and had an abstract available for review. We grouped studies into 1 of 5 categories, ie computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, biopsy and surveillance.

Results

While computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast enhancement remain the gold standard to evaluate cystic lesions of the kidney, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and contrast enhanced ultrasound have surfaced as new tools for assessment of complex cysts. Comparative effectiveness studies on these new imaging modalities are limited. Image guided biopsy has increasingly been shown to be useful for evaluation of intermediate (Bosniak II and IIF) complex cysts. We found few studies providing guidance on the duration and/or intensity of surveillance required for intermediate complex renal cysts.

Conclusions

Although new and enhanced techniques are in development and may be useful in the future management of complex renal cysts, there is a paucity of data regarding the value of these new techniques. Future research should focus on surveillance of intermediate complex renal cysts, particularly on the ideal frequency and type of imaging required.

Obtain repeat cross-sectional imaging approximately 3–6 months later to assess for interval growth. Consider deciding on periodic clinical/imaging surveillance based on growth rate and shared decision-making with offering intervention if substantial interval growth is observed or if other clinical/imaging findings suggest that the risk/benefit analysis is no longer equivocal or favorable for continued active surveillance.

### Management of a simple renal cyst in a complex patient [^113KkAGE]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Renal cysts are generally classified as simple or complex and are further characterised under the Bosniak classification system. Most simple cysts are benign, asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. However, over time, these simple cysts can enlarge, become symptomatic and develop complications, requiring intervention. We present a case of a 70-year-old man with multiple comorbidities who presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and haematuria. An abdominal CT scan revealed a large, 26 cm exophytic cyst with high attenuation areas, septations and haemorrhage. Given the patient's tenuous condition and poor functional status, an interventional radiology-guided renal cyst aspiration was performed, resulting in successful reduction of size and symptom resolution. A follow-up ultrasound at 6 months showed no evidence of recurrence. Primary care providers should be aware of the prevalence of renal cysts and their complications, especially haemorrhage, particularly in high risk and elderly patients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy.

### Controversies in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS): pregnancy, paediatric, abdominal trauma, complex renal cysts, and endovascular aortic repair follow-up [^1112DznR]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Contraindications to the use of CEUS, inadequate visualisation of the target area and the lack of expertise are the main limitations.

Future perspectives

When US visualisation is adequate and local expertise is available, immediate characterisation of incidentally found features and effective follow-up may be accomplished. CEUS permits characterisation of indeterminate lesions at CT or MR imaging, can be used in patients who cannot tolerate CT and MR imaging or when kidney insufficiency is present; CEUS is the most cost-effective technique. The role of CECT in complex renal cyst evaluation and follow-up should diminish.

This raises important questions for the radiologist. Why should predominantly benign cysts be repeatedly examined by CECT over a period of years, using a radiation-intensive procedure, while this is also possible using a less expensive procedure with fewer side effects? MR imaging can be used for Bosniak III cysts and is recommended in Bosniak IV before surgery. CT imaging is better applied for staging malignancies prior to surgery (Fig. 4).

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in children and young people [^1176VG11]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic disease in adults, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 500–2,500 (refs –). Cyst development starts early in life, and macroscopic cysts can become detectable in childhood. Substantial disease burden with massively enlarged kidneys or decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) usually does not occur until adulthood; however, approximately 3% of children who carry ADPKD-causing mutations have either very-early-onset or unusually rapid progressive disease –. Thus, the absolute incidence of symptomatic ADPKD in childhood is thought to be higher than that of other severe paediatric kidney diseases such as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (~1 in 20,000), nephrotic syndrome (~1 in 50,000)or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (~1 in 100,000 children).

The past 25 years have seen remarkable progress in knowledge of ADPKD. Advances have been made in unravelling the genetic origins of the disease, in non-invasive monitoring and in predicting disease progression; multiple large-scale clinical trials have been conducted; and the first pharmacological treatment for slowing disease progression — the vasopressin antagonist tolvaptan — has been licensed in the United States, Europe and Japan. However, most ADPKD studies have been performed in adults, and their results are not always easily transferable to children.

Children with ADPKD constitute a mixed cohort of healthy individuals who may not require treatment for decades (referred to here as asymptomatic patients) and individuals who have disease manifestations, such as hypertension, and will benefit from treatment started as early as possible. Few children suffer from symptomatic disease manifestations such as pain, enuresis, haematuria or urinary tract or cyst infections. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic children are likely to be confronted with the effects of ADPKD in older relatives and to have questions or anxieties about their own future health. In addition, many children with an affected parent are unaware of their own disease status (referred to here as at-risk children), either because diagnostic testing has not been performed or because a negative ultrasonography scan does not exclude ADPKD in childhood. An important dilemma in the medical care of children with ADPKD is the balance between not medicalizing currently healthy individuals and not missing treatable disease manifestations in those affected at an early age. Medical professionals from different backgrounds, nurses, affected parents and at-risk children naturally have different views on where this balance lies.

### What to Do with renal cysts in children? [^113sEbK3]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore the current practice patterns for the management of renal cysts internationally among pediatric urologists and nephrologists.

Materials and Methods

A survey composed of 21 questions and 4 clinical scenarios was distributed to pediatric urologists and nephrologists. Survey questions evaluated optimal imaging modality, management, and follow-up period. Interspecialty comparisons were made using chi-square analysis where appropriate.

Results

A total of 183 respondents completed the survey (128 pediatric urologists, 37 pediatric nephrologists, and 19 other specialists). Most (57%) respondents agreed or strongly agreed with using an ultrasound based Bosniak classification to categorize renal cysts in children. The most commonly used follow-up intervals were 6–12 months for pediatric urologists and 1–2 years for pediatric nephrologists. Symptomatic mass effect (80.9%), gross hematuria (79.2%), or family history were the most common reasons for escalating surveillance. Pediatric nephrologists were more likely to increase follow-up with development of bilateral simple renal cysts (P = 0.008) or chronic kidney disease (P = 0.027) when compared to pediatric urologists. Laparoscopic marsupialization (39.4%) was the most common treatment for a simple renal cyst in a symptomatic child. Modified Bosniak III cysts had more heterogeneity in treatment based on the physician responses.

Conclusion

There is currently no consensus on the optimal protocol for the surveillance, imaging, or treatment of renal cysts in children. Most respondents agree that using an ultrasound-based Bosniak classification is reasonable. A call to action is therefore necessary for the development of registries and guidelines on the management of pediatric renal cysts and their associated malignancies.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part II [^111ifB2D]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This AUA Guideline focuses on active surveillance (AS) and follow-up after intervention for adult patients with clinically-localized renal masses suspicious for cancer, including solid enhancing tumors and Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic lesions.

Materials and Methods

In January 2021, the Renal Mass and Localized Renal Cancer guideline underwent additional amendment based on a current literature-search. This literature search retrieved additional studies published between July 2016 to October 2020 using the same Key Questions and search criteria from the Renal Mass and Localized Renal Cancer guideline. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned strength-rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1[Table: see text]).

Results

AS with potential delayed intervention should be considered for patients with solid, enhancing renal masses < 2cm or Bosniak 3–4 lesions that are predominantly-cystic. Shared decision-making about AS should consider risks of intervention/competing mortality versus the potential oncologic benefits of intervention. Recommendations for renal mass biopsy and considerations for periodic clinical/imaging-based surveillance are discussed. After intervention, risk-based surveillance protocols are defined incorporating clinical/laboratory evaluation and abdominal/chest imaging designed to detect local/systemic recurrences and possible treatment-related sequelae, such as progressive renal-insufficiency.

Conclusion

AS is a potential management strategy for some patients with clinically-localized renal masses that requires careful risk-assessment, shared decision-making and periodic-reassessment. Follow-up after intervention is designed to identify local/systemic recurrences and potential treatment-related sequelae. A risk-based approach should be prioritized with selective use of laboratory/imaging resources.

### Reporting on renal masses, recommendations for terminology, and sample templates [^112Efj8L]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the incidence of small renal masses, from benign cysts to malignancy, most radiologists encounter these lesions multiple times during their career. Radiologists have an opportunity to provide critical data that will further refine the understanding of the impact of these masses on patient outcomes. This article summarizes and describes recent updates and understanding of the critical observations and descriptors of renal masses. The templates and glossary of terms presented in this review article facilitate the radiology reporting of such data elements, giving radiologists the opportunity to improve diagnostic accuracy and influence management of small renal masses.

### Management of incidental adrenal masses: a white paper of the ACR incidental findings committee [^111PrJUK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The ACR Incidental Findings Committee presents recommendations for managing adrenal masses that are incidentally detected on CT or MRI. These recommendations represent an update to the adrenal component of the JACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. The Adrenal Subcommittee, constituted by abdominal radiologists and an endocrine surgeon, developed this algorithm. The algorithm draws from published evidence coupled with expert subspecialist opinion and was finalized by a process of iterative consensus. Algorithm branches categorize incidental adrenal masses on the basis of patient characteristics and imaging features. For each specified combination, the algorithm concludes with characterization of benignity or indolence (sufficient to discontinue follow-up) and/or a subsequent management recommendation. The algorithm addresses many, but not all, possible pathologies and clinical scenarios. Our goal is to improve the quality of patient care by providing guidance on how to manage incidentally detected adrenal masses.

Regarding specific circumstances for renal cell carcinoma, more specifically with respect to patients with Bosniak III-IV cysts, watchful waiting, AUA 2021 guidelines recommend to offer interventional treatment in patients with a Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass if the anticipated oncologic benefits of intervention outweigh the risks of treatment and competing risks of death. Consider offering active surveillance with the potential for delayed intervention only if the patient understands and is willing to accept the associated oncologic risks. Perform renal mass biopsy for additional risk stratification. Obtain close clinical and cross-sectional imaging surveillance with periodic reassessment and counseling if the patient continues to prefer active surveillance.

### Spanish guidelines for the management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^115Qhxms]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most frequent cause of genetic renal disease and accounts for 6–10% of patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT). Very few prospective, randomized trials or clinical studies address the diagnosis and management of this relatively frequent disorder. No clinical guidelines are available to date. This is a consensus statement presenting the recommendations of the Spanish Working Group on Inherited Kidney Diseases, which were agreed to following a literature search and discussions. Levels of evidence found were C and D according to the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (University of Oxford). The recommendations relate to, among other topics, the use of imaging and genetic diagnosis, management of hypertension, pain, cyst infections and bleeding, extra-renal involvement including polycystic liver disease and cranial aneurysms, management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and RRT and management of children with ADPKD. Recommendations on specific ADPKD therapies are not provided since no drug has regulatory approval for this indication.

### Diagnosis and management of acquired cystic kidney disease and renal tumors in ESRD patients [^114SKQtr]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

The incidence of renal malignancies is markedly increased in end-stage renal disease and appears to be related to the development of acquired cystic kidney disease. Identification and evaluation of simple cysts, complex cysts, and solid masses in these patients rely on imaging studies, including ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. While there are no published data to support screening of ESRD patients, this seems appropriate in at least some patients, based on patient characteristics and the presence or absence of acquired cystic kidney disease. The optimal frequency and modality remain to be determined.

### Management of complex renal cysts in Canada: results of a survey study [^117Hfxb7]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Up to one third of individuals over 60 years of age will be diagnosed with a renal cyst following abdominal imaging. Renal cysts are classified according to the Bosniak classification, which categorizes the cysts according to their degree of complexity and risk of malignancy. Cystic renal cell carcinoma represents approximately 5–10% of all renal malignancies. Bosniak III and IV cysts have a high risk of malignancy (40–60% and 80–90%, respectively) and have traditionally been managed with surgical excision. However, similar to small non-cystic renal masses, there is growing evidence suggesting that most of these cysts are indolent and unlikely to metastasize. Thus, active surveillance has been proposed as an alternative to surgery.

Recent observational data has provided support for the use of active surveillance among patients with complex renal cysts. However, the adoption of this treatment strategy for the management of complex cysts in Canada and the criteria used by urologists as triggers for discontinuation of surveillance and intervention have yet to be defined.

The objectives of this survey study were to characterize the use of active surveillance in the management of complex renal cysts in Canada and to elicit the perceived barriers to adoption. We also aimed to characterize patient and disease factors associated with use of active surveillance and triggers used as criteria for intervention.

### Extra-renal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD): considerations for routine screening and management [^1114k6is]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a systemic disease, marked by progressive increase of bilateral renal cysts, resulting in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and often leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Apart from renal cysts, patients often have extra-renal disease, involving the liver, heart and vasculature. Other less common but equally important extra-renal manifestations of ADPKD include diverticular disease, hernias, male infertility and pain. Extra-renal disease burden is often asymptomatic, but may result in increased morbidity and mortality. If the disease burden is significant, screening may prove beneficial. We review the rationale for current screening recommendations and propose some guidelines for screening and management of ADPKD patients.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^1115BZm5]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Counseling for solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass — clinical principle — states that clinicians must review the most common and serious urologic and non-urologic morbidities of each treatment pathway and emphasize patient age, comorbidities, frailty, and life expectancy; each management strategy for the solid or complex cystic mass has a unique profile of renal functional outcomes, perioperative outcomes, potential harms, and health-related quality of life, and cancer-specific survival is primarily determined by tumor characteristics while overall survival is determined by patient age and competing cardiovascular comorbidity in clinically localized renal cancer.

### The incidental renal mass [^116m5aTj]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Incidental renal masses are extremely common. Although most represent benign renal cysts, not all incidental renal masses are benign. Most renal cell carcinomas are discovered incidentally when an imaging examination is performed to evaluate a nonrenal complaint. Therefore, differentiating incidental benign renal masses from those that are potentially malignant is important. There are well-established, time-tested, image-based criteria that can be used to diagnose most renal masses definitively. However, some renal masses remain indeterminate even after a thorough evaluation with imaging. This article discusses the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment options of the incidental renal mass.

### The diagnosis and management of complex renal cysts [^111WzZs5]. Current Opinion in Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cystic renal disease is very common and the detection of complex cystic masses in the kidney has increased dramatically over the last few decades with increased cross-sectional imaging. Cystic renal cell carcinoma represents 5–7% of all renal tumours. The ability to differentiate between those who are benign from those malignant represents a major challenge. The controversy and difficulty lies in those complex cystic renal masses that lie between Bosniak II and III. This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of complex renal cysts, examining the evidence for biopsy and looks at novel diagnostic techniques.

Recent Findings

There are varying results in interpretation of complex cysts and this is heavily dependent on interobserver variability. Bosniak classification is a valuable tool for the clinician. Computed tomography remains the gold standard, however, newer diagnostic imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced ultrasonography is demonstrating promising results. Percutaneous biopsy of these complex lesions would appear to be well tolerated and adequate for diagnosis.

Summary

The ability to accurately identify complex renal cysts that are malignant remains a major challenge to the clinician. Regularly there is no other way to identify malignant features than to biopsy or continue surveillance. Recent literature would suggest that percutaneous biopsy has a good yield and is accurate in the majority of cases. Current apprehension with regard to iatrogenic complications from percutaneous renal biopsy may be exaggerated, as complication rates are higher in patients with intrinsic real disease rather than this cohort of patients. The overlap in diagnosing Bosniak IIf versus III is heavily influenced by interobserver variability and this needs to be a significant factor in making any decision.

### Risk assessment of incidentally detected complex renal cysts in children: potential role for a modification of the bosniak classification [^112tGkiP]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Incidentally detected complex renal cysts in children are a rare but worrisome occurrence due to the perceived potential risk of malignancy. We examined the natural history of such cysts in a cohort of children.

Materials and Methods

We obtained access to a database containing all radiology reports generated at a single institution from 1996 to 2004. We used key words to limit our search, subsequently reviewing charts and images to confirm the diagnosis of a complex renal cyst and to collect clinical data. Cases were categorized according to a modification of the Bosniak classification, using ultrasound in most patients and computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging when available.

Results

Complex renal cysts were identified in 39 children. Mean patient age at presentation was 7 years. Mean cyst size was 1.6 cm. A total of 18 cases diagnosed by ultrasound only were observed with serial imaging. Additional contrast enhanced computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 21 of 39 patients (54%). Surgical resection was performed in 5 patients and pathological evaluation revealed benign cyst in 3 (modified Bosniak class II in 2 patients and class III in 1) and renal cell carcinoma in 2 (III in 1 and IV in 1). All other patients had modified Bosniak class II cysts, which remained essentially unchanged during a mean followup of 26.8 months (range 9 to 70).

Conclusions

While not validated in children, our data suggest the modified Bosniak classification appears useful as a guideline to direct the management of complex renal cysts in the pediatric population.

### The prevalence, clinicodemographics, and outcomes of incidental and symptomatic renal cysts in a pediatric cohort undergoing ultrasonography [^117SytHP]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The growing availability of modern-day imaging has resulted in an increase in the number of renal cysts detected in the pediatric population. Few publications have reported outcomes of these childhood cysts. In this study we assessed the prevalence and evolution of renal cysts in children, and described clinical characteristics, mode of presentation and ultimate outcomes.

Materials and Methods

Our institutional ultrasound database was searched for all abdominal ultrasound reports from 2006 to 2017. These reports were then cross-referenced with a manual retrospective chart review. Clinical characteristics including mode of presentation, cyst characteristics, and outcomes were analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric statistical methods.

Results

Of 70,500 abdominal ultrasound scans during the study period 1,531 (2.2%) met the study inclusion criteria. Overall 26% of cysts were complex and 10.1% of cases were associated with hydronephrosis. Echogenic kidneys were more likely to be associated with simple cysts (p = 0.0001). There was no difference between cyst diameter and symptomatology (p = 0.82). The conversion of simple to complex renal cysts was less than 1% and 1.8% of complex cysts developed renal cell carcinoma.

Conclusions

In a large cohort of children who underwent abdominal imaging we found a 10-year renal cyst prevalence of 2.2%. Given that nearly all cysts follow a benign course and that simple cysts will invariably grow within 2 years, we believe that these cases could be safely discharged after that point. We continue to recommend surveillance for patients with cysts larger than 15 mm, complex cysts, family history of adult polycystic kidney disease or those with concomitant genitourinary anomalies requiring ongoing followup.

### Approach to renal cystic masses and the role of radiology [^114NeYvU]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Most renal masses are benign cysts; a subset are malignant. Most renal masses are incidental findings. Evaluation of renal cysts has evolved with updates to the Bosniak classification system and other guidelines. The Bosniak classification provides detailed definitions and extends the system from computed tomography to MR imaging. This article provides a simple approach to the evaluation of cystic or potentially cystic renal masses. The radiologist is central to this process. Key elements include confirming that a renal lesion is cystic and not solid, determining the need for further characterization by imaging, and judicious application of the Bosniak classification system.

Discussion

Indirect evidence from the small non-cystic renal mass literature has supported the role of active surveillance as a management option for complex renal cysts. Two recent retrospective studies have also reported the outcomes of patients with a complex renal cyst who opted to be managed by active surveillance. The average cyst sizes in the two studies were 4.1 cm and 3.5 cm for Bosniak III cysts, and 3.1 cm and 3.8 cm for Bosniak IV lesions, respectively. Both studies have suggested that this approach could be safely used in this population, with only one death due to kidney cancer observed after 5 years of follow-up in these studies. Moreover, only two patients with a Bosniak IV cyst developed a metastasis out of 243 patients with a Bosniak III or IV cyst (0.8%) – both of whom had refused surgery despite evidence of local progression. Criteria for lesion progression included increase in cyst size, increase in vascularity, and increase in size of the solid component. Importantly, during the 5-year observation period, 65% of patients avoided surgery given the absence of lesion progression, and among patients who progressed, 16.5% were found to have a benign tumor on final pathology. While these results are encouraging, given the low quality of existing evidence, current guidelines on the management of complex renal cysts continue to recommend surgery as the mainstay treatment and suggest that the use of active surveillance should be reserved for select patients.

This study sought out to assess the adoption of active surveillance in Canada and to examine barriers to more widespread use. We found that approximately one third of Canadian urologists stated that they offered active surveillance as a treatment option in greater than 50% of patients who are diagnosed with a Bosniak III cyst, while only 10% of urologists offered surveillance in the majority of Bosniak IV cases. Importantly, over 60% of urologists did not consider or rarely considered active surveillance as a treatment option for a Bosniak IV cyst. Furthermore, the adoption of active surveillance for both Bosniak III and IV cysts was significantly greater among academic urologists compared to non-academic urologists. Likely reflecting the confidence of urologists for active surveillance, a greater proportion of urologists felt that, when offered to a patient, the chance of surveillance being chosen as management strategy was greater among patients diagnosed with a Bosniak III cyst than those with a Bosniak IV cyst.

### Ultrasound of renal masses [^1168SdTT]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Renal masses are common incidental findings. Although most are benign, it is important to evaluate for features concerning for malignancy. Because of its relative low cost; excellent differentiation among simple cysts, complex cysts, and solid lesions; and lack of ionizing radiation, ultrasound is the preferred modality for initial workup of renal lesions. Given the increasing availability of contrast-enhanced ultrasound, more and more lesions are now able to be completely characterized by sonography alone, including use of the Bosniak criteria.

Methods

The consensus process was initiated by the Network for Early Onset Cystic Kidney Disease (NEOCYST), which is a consortium of clinical, genetic and translational researchers devoted to the study of early-onset cystic kidney diseases. In addition to paediatric nephrologists from the consortium, external experts in paediatric ADPKD, adult ADPKD, cystic kidney disease genetics, paediatric radiology and patient representatives were invited to participate (Supplementary information). C.G. M.C. R.D.P. R.T. J.K. M.D.S. J.K. A.M.M. A.T. and D.M. prepared systematic literature reviews in advance of the consensus conference held on 1 December 2017 in Leuven, Belgium. Tabulated results of the literature reviews are included in the Supplementary information.

Initial recommendations were developed during the conference by discussion in thematic workgroups and plenary sessions. Evidence and recommendations were graded according to the method used in the current American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, (Fig. 1). The grading of recommendations into strong, moderate and weak recommendations takes into account not only the quality of the evidence but also the balance of potential benefits and harms assessed by the consensus group. The preliminary results of the consensus meeting were presented on 2 December 2017 at an international symposium on 'Management of Polycystic Kidney Diseases from Childhood to Adulthood' in Leuven, Belgium, where 104 participants voted live and anonymously on the major drafted recommendations. A first written draft was compiled by C.G. and reviewed by all members of the consensus group. Consequently, two rounds of anonymous voting were performed using the Delphi method until each recommendation reached at least 70% support. The results of the symposium votes and the Delphi votes are presented in the Supplementary information.

The final draft of the Consensus Statement was endorsed by the council of the International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA) and the European Society of Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN) after thorough review by members of the ESPN Workgroup for inherited kidney diseases. The manuscript was also reviewed by ADPKD experts from the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network (ERKNet), whose helpful comments were incorporated.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^111SnzSu]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Renal mass and localized renal cancer — initial imaging evaluation is as follows: In patients with a solid or complex cystic renal mass, clinicians should obtain high quality, multiphase, cross-sectional abdominal imaging to optimally characterize and clinically stage the renal mass, and characterization should include assessment of tumor complexity, degree of contrast enhancement (where applicable), and presence or absence of fat (Clinical Principle). MR imaging without and with intravenous contrast may be appropriate for patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast and may provide improved characterization of small renal tumors, particularly those less than 2 cm in diameter, and Doppler US and contrast-enhanced US using microbubbles may also be considered in select patients in whom other forms of intravenous contrast are contraindicated; as of 2017, contrast-enhanced US is approved for assessment of hepatic lesions and can be considered for off-label use for renal mass evaluation. Complex cystic renal masses that have somewhat thickened irregular walls or septa with measurable enhancement are classified as Bosniak 3, and approximately 50% of such lesions are malignant, while Bosniak 4 complex cystic lesions have enhancing nodular soft tissue components and about 75–90% are malignant. A recent systematic review focused on patients with CKD 4 and 5 reported that the incidence of NSF in this population was less than 0.07% with second generation gadolinium agents, and current ACR guidelines on the use of contrast media state that patients need not be screened for renal function prior to receiving group II GBCA, which are now considered safe at any level of eGFR.

### Ultrasound imaging of renal cysts in children [^114BD46J]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Renal cysts can be focal or diffuse and unilateral or bilateral. In childhood, most renal cysts are due to hereditary diseases rather than simple cysts or acquired cystic diseases, unlike adults. Inherited cystic diseases can be ciliopathies due to a primary ciliary defect (as in polycystic kidney diseases and nephronophthisis). Acquired causes include obstructive cystic dysplasia, dyselectrolytemia, and acquired cysts in renal replacement therapy. The final diagnosis requires a multispecialty approach, including radiology, pathology, and genetics. Imaging is a very important component in treating patients with cystic renal diseases. This article discusses the ultrasound findings of cystic renal diseases in children, along with a brief discussion of other imaging modalities and a suggested ultrasound reporting format.

Immediate or delayed screening

In our view, parents and young people may reasonably opt for either immediate diagnostic testing to confirm disease status or regular clinical screening to identify disease manifestations with the option of later diagnostic testing. Regular clinical screening mainly comprises measurement of blood pressure and proteinuria, which should be performed at the same intervals as those recommended for children with proven symptomatic or asymptomatic disease (see below). The feasibility of regular blood pressure monitoring in the community may vary in different settings and should be taken into account.

We recommend that parents receive non-directional counselling about the potential benefits and uncertainties of current diagnostic screening tests. Health-care professionals should inform parents with the aim of shared decision-making and encourage them to keep the best interests of the child in mind. Teenagers and competent younger children should be involved in the decision-making process as much as possible, and ideally a family approach will facilitate discussion to balance the views of the parents and the young person. We also encourage talking to children and adolescents about the possibility of disease transmission early on in an age-appropriate way as this positively influences coping and family interactions –. If discussion with the child is deferred until the formal age of majority, families may benefit from the help of a genetic counselling service or a similarly trained professional.

Box 1 Screening in at-risk minors

Recommendation 1.1

All parents of at-risk minors should be counselled about inheritance of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and the potential benefits and harms of diagnostic screening (evidence level X; recommendation level strong).

Recommendation 1.2

Parents of at-risk minors should be offered access to diagnostic screening after counselling (evidence level X; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 1.3

For asymptomatic minors at risk of ADPKD, repeated screening for treatable, but usually asymptomatic disease manifestations (that is, hypertension and proteinuria) without diagnostic testing or immediate diagnostic screening (by ultrasonography or genetic testing) should be considered equally valid approaches to clinical care. The decision whether to perform diagnostic screening should be shared between parents (or legal guardians) and health-care professionals. Minors should be involved where possible (evidence level X; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 1.4

If the decision is taken not to perform diagnostic screening in childhood, parents should be made aware of their responsibility to inform their children of disease risk when they reach legal age of majority (evidence level X, recommendation level moderate).

### Incidentalomas: initial management [^116CVHBv]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Incidentalomas are increasingly common findings on radiologic studies, causing worry for physicians and patients. Physicians should consider the risk of discovering incidentalomas when contemplating imaging. Patients may assume that incidentalomas are cancer, and may not be aware of the radiation risks associated with repeat imaging. Once incidentalomas are detected, appropriate management is dependent on an informed patient's wishes and the clinical situation. Guidelines are provided for the initial management of eight incidentalomas (pituitary, thyroid, pulmonary, hepatic, pancreatic, adrenal, renal, and ovarian). Patients presenting with pituitary incidentalomas should undergo pituitary-specific magnetic resonance imaging if the lesion is 1 cm or larger, or if it abuts the optic chiasm. Thyroid incidentalomas are ubiquitous, but nodules larger than 1 to 2 cm are of greater concern. Worrisome pulmonary incidentalomas are those larger than 8 mm or those with irregular borders, eccentric calcifications, or low density. However, current guidelines recommend that even pulmonary incidentalomas as small as 4 mm be followed. Solid hepatic incidentalomas 5 mm or larger should be monitored closely, and multiphasic scanning is helpful. Pancreatic cystic neoplasms have malignant potential, and surgery is recommended for pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm with suspicious features. Adrenal lesions larger than 4 cm are usually biopsied. The Bosniak classification is a well-accepted means of triaging renal incidentalomas. Lesions at category IIF or greater require serial monitoring or surgery. Benign or probably benign ovarian cysts 3 cm or smaller in premenopausal women or 1 cm or smaller in postmenopausal women do not require follow-up. Ovarian cysts with thickened walls or septa, or solid components with blood flow, should be managed closely.

Factors increasing likelihood of offering active surveillance

For both Bosniak III and IV cysts, age and the presence of comorbidities were perceived as having an impact on the likelihood of a patient being offered active surveillance as a treatment alternative (Table 3). The majority of urologists viewed older patients (> 75 years of age) as being ideal candidates. Nevertheless, nearly 30% of urologists thought that the lower age cut-off should be 65 years old for patients with Bosniak III cysts. Likewise, most urologists viewed that cyst size influenced their decision to offer surveillance and that cysts < 4 cm were ideal for active surveillance.

Table 3
Association of patient and tumor factors with likelihood of recommending active surveillance and specific cut-offs viewed as most appropriate for active surveillance (N = 127 for Bosniak III; N = 124 for Bosniak IV)

More specifically, for Bosniak III cysts, the presence of cyst wall nodularity (74.8%) and the maximal thickness of septa/calcification (44.1%) were also considered characteristics that impacted the likelihood of offering active surveillance. An upper limit threshold of 3 mm (IQR 2–5 mm) in maximal thickness of septa/calcification was perceived as being most appropriate for surveillance. For Bosniak IV cysts, the size of the nodular component was seen as important to the decision to offer active surveillance (69.9%) with a median perceived upper limit cut-off of 2 cm (IQR 1–3 cm).

Triggers for intervention during active surveillance

Several characteristics were perceived by urologists as being criteria for intervention for patients initially managed by active surveillance (Table 4). The most commonly reported criteria for Bosniak III cysts were progression on imaging from Bosniak III to IV cysts, worsening or change in the wall or septa enhancement, progression or development of cyst wall nodularity. For Bosniak IV cysts, the two most common triggers for intervention were perceived as being the growth rate of solid component (> 0.5 cm/year) and the growth of solid component (> 3 cm).
