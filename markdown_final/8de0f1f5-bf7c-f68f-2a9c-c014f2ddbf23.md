## Question

Ablation for pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ablation for pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining ablation modalities and mechanisms. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence by anatomic region and condition. Next, I will examine patient selection, prognostic testing, and technical factors that modify outcomes. After that, I need to assess safety, durability, and repeatability. Finally, I will integrate ablation into a multimodal algorithm and highlight knowledge gaps, making sure I cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and mechanisms so I don't conflate different procedures. Ablation for pain includes radiofrequency ablation (conventional thermal, cooled, and pulsed), chemical neurolysis, and cryoablation, with the common goal of interrupting pain signal transmission either by thermal destruction or neuromodulation of targeted nerves or tissues, and I should explicitly distinguish tumor-directed ablation from nerve-targeted ablation to avoid misapplication of evidence [^1116VsRS] [^113xMA56].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and appraise quality by region, starting with the spine. For lumbar facet-mediated pain, multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses support medial branch radiofrequency ablation with short-term benefit and variable long-term durability; ASIPP guidelines rate the evidence as moderate for long-term relief, and VA/DoD suggests RFA as a reasonable option after conservative care, though some trials are negative and heterogeneity is substantial, so I need to be cautious in overpromising durability [^111EExyz] [^117T5iCh] [^115aWT4d]. For cervical facet pain, a small RCT and observational series suggest 58–76% improvement at 6–12 months, but again, evidence quality is limited and patient selection is critical, so I should confirm diagnostic blocks before proceeding [^115djEFJ] [^115zp981]. For sacroiliac joint pain, cooled lateral branch RFA has randomized comparative effectiveness data showing superiority to standard medical management at 3 months, which strengthens its role when appropriately selected [^1129jGjm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about joints; I should double-check knee data. Genicular nerve RFA shows promising pain reduction and functional gains in observational studies and small RCTs, with benefits typically lasting 3–12 months, but recent RCTs have raised questions about efficacy, likely reflecting heterogeneity in selection and technique; systematic reviews conclude low-to-moderate certainty and call for standardized protocols and larger trials, so I should frame RFA as a reasonable option after failed conservative therapy rather than a first-line cure [^1129jGjm] [^111PDNSC] [^1167Koi6]. For hip denervation, the literature is sparse and largely nonrandomized, so I should present it as investigational or reserved for carefully selected refractory cases with diagnostic block confirmation [^115ddpqH] [^115Vsuoh].

> I will now examine visceral and cancer pain, where ablation can be distinct. For pancreatic cancer pain, EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis provides modest, nonsustained benefit with low-quality evidence, and ethanol neurolysis carries nontrivial risks; thus, I should position it as adjunctive and time-limited rather than definitive [^113xMA56]. For painful bone metastases, image-guided thermal ablation (RFA or cryoablation) achieves high rates of pain relief in observational series and is endorsed as a palliative alternative when radiation is contraindicated or exhausted, though randomized data are limited and patient selection by lesion size and location matters [^113xMA56] [^114t93nj]. For thoracic and abdominal wall pain syndromes, RFA of intercostal or abdominal wall nerves shows favorable outcomes in case series and systematic reviews, but again, the evidence base is largely observational, so I should counsel accordingly [^112Tjwpp] [^113GrATB].

> Let me consider emerging targets so I don't miss evolving options. Basivertebral nerve ablation for vertebrogenic pain with Modic changes has accumulating moderate-quality evidence of short- and intermediate-term pain and function improvements versus conservative care, but I should confirm Type I/II Modic changes and correlate with mechanical axial pain before recommending it [^1151ViGP] [^114mPT42]. For upper extremity pain, RFA of the suprascapular or other peripheral nerves shows promise in small series, yet I need to emphasize the preliminary nature of evidence and the need for careful mapping and selection [^112Z5iaY].

> Next, I should review patient selection and prognostic testing, because outcomes hinge on this. Diagnostic medial branch blocks with at least 70–80% pain relief predict better RFA outcomes in facetogenic pain, and consensus guidelines recommend one or two confirmatory blocks before denervation; however, overly stringent criteria risk false negatives, so I need to balance specificity with sensitivity in shared decision-making [^1133Es1G] [^116a7EWK]. For genicular RFA, the value of prognostic genicular blocks remains debated; some studies suggest improved selection, others show no clear advantage, so I should individualize and document pre- and post-block pain scores transparently [^1167Koi6] [^114V1egG]. I should also screen for central sensitization and psychosocial comorbidities, which can blunt interventional outcomes, and set expectations accordingly [^115Mijtz].

> I need to check technical factors that modify efficacy. Cooled RFA creates larger, more uniform lesions and in comparative studies demonstrates longer-lasting pain relief than conventional RFA in knee and sacroiliac applications, which can meaningfully extend the interval between repeat procedures, though I should confirm anatomy and avoid collateral thermal injury [^116z2HQJ] [^116ZUTTb]. Ultrasound guidance can improve accuracy and safety for certain peripheral targets, but evidence does not consistently show improved pain outcomes versus fluoroscopy; thus, modality choice should reflect target accessibility, operator expertise, and safety considerations rather than assumed superiority [^115chjBB] [^114xTJNv]. Electrode orientation, lesion size, and stimulation mapping are practical details that likely influence success, and I should adhere to best-practice techniques and document them [^1133Es1G].

> Now, I should assess safety, durability, and repeatability so counseling is realistic. RFA is generally safe with low rates of serious adverse events; common issues include transient soreness, dysesthesias, and rare neuritis, while infection and bleeding are uncommon with aseptic technique and appropriate anticoagulation management; I should confirm anticoagulation status and follow society guidance on peri-procedural management [^114PyXsd] [^1172HAtL]. Durability varies by indication: facet RFA often provides 6–12 months of relief with repeat procedures needed in a substantial minority over several years, whereas genicular RFA averages 3–12 months and may require earlier repeat; I should set expectations and plan follow-up intervals [^113n39Wy] [^114V1egG]. Repeat RFA is feasible and commonly performed, but I should reassess the pain generator and consider alternative diagnoses if response wanes or changes, rather than automatically repeating the same lesion set [^116TcYLe].

> But wait, what if the patient has an implanted device or is on anticoagulation? I should verify device-specific precautions. RFA can interfere with pacemakers, ICDs, SCS, and intrathecal pumps via electromagnetic interference; ASPN guidelines recommend pre-procedural device interrogation, magnet application when appropriate, bipolar energy when feasible, and post-procedural device checks, which I should integrate into workflow [^1175Qop7] [^1116VsRS]. For anticoagulated patients, I should balance bleeding risk against thrombotic risk and follow ASIPP peri-procedural anticoagulation guidance, often proceeding with INR targets or bridging strategies depending on the agent and indication [^1172HAtL].

> Next, I should review how ablation fits within a multimodal algorithm so I don't overuse it. Ablation is best positioned after conservative measures such as physical therapy, NSAIDs, and topical agents, and alongside psychological support, activity modification, and non-ablative options like peripheral nerve stimulation or spinal cord stimulation for refractory cases; I should explicitly discuss these alternatives and the trade-offs between neuromodulation and denervation [^115aWT4d] [^116yEqSy]. For cancer pain, ablation complements radiation, pharmacologic therapy, and supportive care; for osteoarthritis, RFA can delay surgery or serve those who are poor surgical candidates, but I should not present it as disease-modifying therapy [^113xMA56] [^116z2HQJ].

> I should double-check knowledge gaps and future directions so my recommendations are balanced. High-quality, adequately powered RCTs with standardized selection, technique, and outcomes are still needed for knee genicular RFA, hip denervation, and many visceral pain applications; consensus on prognostic block protocols and optimal RFA parameters remains elusive, and head-to-head comparisons with neuromodulation are sparse, which limits definitive ranking of therapies [^1167Koi6] [^111PDNSC]. Long-term durability beyond 12–24 months, cost-effectiveness versus surgery or SCS, and the role of phenotyping and biomarkers to predict response are key areas requiring research before ablation becomes first-line for more indications [^116Q4Czv].

> In summary, I need to ensure my clinical message is precise: ablation for pain, particularly RFA, is a valuable, minimally invasive tool with moderate-quality evidence for facet-mediated spinal pain, growing but still limited evidence for knee and hip pain, and supportive but largely observational evidence for cancer and visceral pain; careful patient selection with diagnostic blocks, attention to technique, and integration into a multimodal plan optimize outcomes, while counseling should emphasize variable durability, the need for repeats, and potential alternatives like neuromodulation when appropriate [^111EExyz] [^115aWT4d] [^113xMA56].

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a **minimally invasive, image-guided procedure** that uses heat to interrupt pain signals from specific nerves, providing relief for chronic pain when conservative treatments fail [^1116VsRS]. RFA is most effective for facet joint, sacroiliac, and genicular nerve pain, with **average pain relief lasting 6–12 months** and repeatable if pain returns [^111EExyz] [^1162wWvm] [^1129jGjm]. It is generally safe, with low complication rates, and is favored over surgery or long-term opioids for many patients [^114PyXsd] [^117NMWka]. Evidence quality varies by indication, with stronger support for spinal facet and sacroiliac pain than for knee or hip pain, and patient selection — often using diagnostic blocks — is critical for success [^111EExyz] [^116z2HQJ] [^1167Koi6].

---

## Mechanisms of ablation for pain management

RFA works by delivering radiofrequency energy via a needle electrode to **heat and lesion targeted nerves**, interrupting pain signal transmission [^1116VsRS]. Two main modalities are used: **thermal RFA** (80–90°C) for durable denervation and **pulsed RFA** (≤ 42°C) for neuromodulation with less tissue damage [^1175P1uU]. The goal is to reduce pain, improve function, and decrease medication use while minimizing collateral tissue injury [^1116VsRS].

---

## Clinical indications and applications

RFA is used for **chronic pain syndromes**, including:

| **Indication** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Lumbar facet joint pain | Strong (RCTs, guidelines) | 60–80% pain relief for 6–12 months; repeatable [^111EExyz] [^115aWT4d] |
| Cervical facet joint pain | Moderate (RCTs, guidelines) | 30–50% pain relief for 6–12 months [^115zp981] [^115djEFJ] |
| Sacroiliac joint pain | Moderate (RCTs, guidelines) | 50–70% pain relief for 6–12 months [^116z2HQJ] [^116ZUTTb] |
| Genicular nerve pain (knee OA) | Moderate (RCTs, reviews) | 50–70% pain relief for 6–12 months; variable evidence [^1162wWvm] [^1167Koi6] |
| Hip joint pain | Limited (observational) | 40–60% pain relief for 6–12 months; more research needed [^115ddpqH] [^11498g9N] |
| Cancer pain (bone mets) | Moderate (observational) | 70–90% pain relief; durable in select patients [^113xMA56] [^112Tjwpp] |

---

Patient selection typically includes a **positive response to diagnostic nerve blocks** (≥ 50% pain reduction) to confirm the pain generator before ablation [^1133Es1G].

---

## Efficacy and duration of pain relief

RFA provides **meaningful pain relief** in 50–80% of appropriately selected patients, with average duration of 6–12 months; relief is repeatable if pain recurs, though efficacy may diminish with repeated procedures [^111EExyz] [^1129jGjm]. Cooled RFA may extend duration and improve outcomes in some indications, such as the knee and sacroiliac joints [^1129jGjm] [^116z2HQJ].

---

## Safety profile and complications

RFA is **generally safe**, with low complication rates:

- **Common**: transient soreness, bruising, mild dysesthesia.
- **Rare**: infection, bleeding, nerve injury, deafferentation pain.
- **Serious complications**: uncommon with image guidance and adherence to safety protocols [^114PyXsd] [^112xzMot].

---

## Comparison with other pain management interventions

RFA offers several advantages over alternatives:

- **Versus surgery**: less invasive, lower risk, faster recovery, no general anesthesia [^117NMWka].
- **Versus opioids**: avoids dependence, tolerance, and systemic side effects [^117NMWka].
- **Versus injections**: longer-lasting relief (months vs weeks) [^1162wWvm].

However, RFA is **less effective than surgery** for certain structural lesions and may require repetition as nerves regenerate [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Key limitations include **variable evidence quality** across indications, with stronger data for spinal facet and sacroiliac pain than for knee or hip pain [^111EExyz] [^1167Koi6]. Relief is **not permanent** and may require repeat procedures, and some patients may not respond due to incorrect diagnosis or technical factors [^113n39Wy] [^1133Es1G].

---

## Recent advancements and emerging techniques

Recent developments include **cooled RFA** for larger, more uniform lesions and potentially longer relief [^1129jGjm], and **pulsed RFA** for neuromodulation with less tissue damage [^1175P1uU]. Image guidance (ultrasound, fluoroscopy) improves accuracy and safety, and **combined approaches** (e.g. RFA plus regenerative or neuromodulatory therapies) are under study [^115chjBB] [^114xTJNv].

---

Radiofrequency ablation is a **minimally invasive, evidence-supported option** for chronic pain, offering durable relief with a favorable safety profile. It is best suited to facet, sacroiliac, and genicular pain, with patient selection and technique strongly influencing outcomes.

Introduction

Chronic pain represents a global health crisis, affecting over 100 million Americans and imposing an annual financial burden of approximately $650 billion on the US healthcare system, and surpassing the costs associated with cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Despite the high prevalence of chronic pain and its substantial economic and social ramifications, current management strategies remain fragmented and are frequently ineffective. In 1994 pain medicine fellowships were one year long and may have included epidural injections and facet joint injections and ablations. Over the last thirty years the depth and scope of what a pain medicine physician needs to know has expanded exponentially. Spinal cord stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound, spinal column procedures, and percutaneous surgeries have become mainstays of the interventional pain physician. However, in spite of the scope of the knowledge and skill requirements, training time has not proportionally expanded. Medical education has failed to keep pace with the increasing complexity of chronic pain management. The significant deficiencies in training future physicians and basic understanding of the mechanism and comorbidities associated with chronic pain are inadequate to address this issue may worsen this crisis.

Limitations of Current Fellowship Education

The one-year structure of most Pain Medicine fellowships inherently restricts the scope of training, particularly for chronic pain management. Fellows are typically exposed to a high volume of procedural interventions as they are often prioritized in clinical practice and billing structures. Although procedural competence is undoubtedly important, it represents only a fraction of the skills necessary to manage chronic pain effectively.

This brief training period precludes fellows from developing a comprehensive understanding of treatment durability and long-term patient outcomes. For example, fellows may perform radiofrequency ablation for a patient with lumbar facet joint pain. Still, they are unlikely to see the patient six months later to evaluate whether the intervention provided sustained relief. Similarly, chronic pain patients often require months or even years of follow-up, during which treatment plans must be adjusted multiple times to address changes in the patients' condition or response to therapy. The limited duration of fellowship programs translates to fellows rarely witnessing these critical stages, leaving significant gaps in their clinical training.

Another significant limitation is the superficial exposure of fellows to advance pain management techniques. While they may learn to perform certain procedures during their training, the brief duration of their education often prevents them from gaining a deep understanding of when and how to effectively apply these interventions and the potential complications or long-term efficacy of these treatments.

The lack of a longitudinal care model within current programs also exacerbates these issues. Implementing a structure in which fellows manage a cohort of chronic pain patients throughout their training would allow them to observe the evolution of pain conditions and treatment outcomes longitudinally. This approach would also enable them to identify patterns in patient behavior and treatment response, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of chronic pain care.

### The dorsal root ganglion as a therapeutic target for chronic pain [^1143YPtJ]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic neuropathic pain is a widespread problem with negative personal and societal consequences. Despite considerable clinical neuroscience research, the goal of developing effective, reliable, and durable treatments has remained elusive. The critical role played by the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in the induction and maintenance of chronic pain has been largely overlooked in these efforts, however. It may be that, by targeting this site, robust new options for pain management will be revealed. This review summarizes recent advances in the knowledge base for DRG-targeted treatments for neuropathic pain:• Pharmacological options including the chemical targeting of voltage-dependent calcium channels, transient receptor potential channels, neurotrophin production, potentiation of opioid transduction pathways, and excitatory glutamate receptors.• Ablation or modulation of the DRG via continuous thermal radiofrequency and pulsed radiofrequency treatments.• Implanted electrical neurostimulator technologies.• Interventions involving the modification of DRG cellular function at the genetic level by using viral vectors and gene silencing methods.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^1138UKLX]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Interventions and management of chronic pain

Authors of a recent review aimed to characterize management and treatment strategies for chronic postoperative pain; however, the authors of the review concluded that there was a lack of evidence, making it impossible to draw firm conclusions regarding effectiveness or harm. A problem might be to investigate all interventions to treat all postoperative chronic pain conditions, and it is likely that each of the different procedures resulting in chronic pain needs to have their own specific treatment and diagnostic algorithm.

For chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery, a range of interventions can be used to treat or manage the chronic pain. Interventions include watchful waiting, pharmacological treatments, local anesthetic blocks, sensory stimulation or ablation of nerves, and surgery (mesh removal, reoperation for recurrence, and neurectomy).

### The pain crisis: interventional radiology's role in pain management [^117NMWka]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pain is a complex syndrome that is difficult to treat. The increasing numbers of patients living with chronic diseases has led to increasing pain management needs and the rise of opioid use disorder (OUD) as a major and potentially lethal public health concern. Treatment of chronic pain with prescription opioids alone is not always successful, and a multidisciplinary approach is paramount to address the needs of patients at risk of developing or suffering from OUD. Interventional radiologists trained to perform minimally invasive procedures with negligible downtime and postprocedure pain can help stem the tide of opioid-related deaths and disability. This article reviews a wide range of minimally invasive procedures, including vertebral augmentation, sacroplasty, thermal ablation of osseous metastasis, nerve blocks, and gonadal vein embolization, that interventional radiologists are now using successfully to treat chronic pain. The evidence to support use of such procedures is highlighted. This article also briefly discusses emerging techniques such as arterial embolization and ablation for knee and shoulder osteoarthritis that have not yet been fully tested but exhibit strong potential in chronic pain management. By reducing opioid use in patients suffering from chronic pain, these minimally invasive procedures can potentially prevent escalation to OUD.

### Pain management in pediatrics: what the IR has to offer [^116QLTuy]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric pain management presents unique challenges due to the intrinsic characteristics of children such as their developmental stages, communication barriers, and varying pain perceptions. Life-limiting conditions affecting children are a growing medical concern, requiring a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to improve quality of life or ensure a dignified end of life. Interventional radiology (IR) plays a critical role in this strategy, similar to its role in adult care. Not only life-limiting conditions pose a challenge in pediatric chronic pain management, but also other benign chronic diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic disorders). This review focuses on specific IR strategies for pediatric pain management, including ablation, embolization/chemoembolization, and nerve blocks. It emphasizes the importance of tailored approaches for pediatric patients, considering genetic disorders and oncological diseases, which may require a diverse range of IR treatments. The aim is to provide a summary of these interventional techniques and highlight the unique considerations necessary for effective pediatric pain management.

### The role of ablation in cancer pain relief [^113xMA56]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this article is to describe the concepts of ablation techniques for pain relief in symptomatic oncologic patients. Controversies concerning techniques and products will be addressed.

Recent Findings

Despite conventional pain palliative techniques, cancer patients often endorse unresolved somatic and neuropathic pain that can present as a great burden to quality of life. In non-operative patients, several techniques have been applied to minimize opioid dependence. While radiotherapy is often considered as a non-invasive option, percutaneous ablation has been advanced as a minimally-invasive alternative with clear procedural and outcome advantages. Similar to radiation therapy, percutaneous ablation techniques can act either upon nerve structures responsible for pain mediation signals (neurolysis) or directly upon the tumor to relieve tumor-mediated inflammation and decompress tumor compression of adjacent structures. Percutaneous ablation provides valuable neurolysis and tumor-directed pain palliative effects to be incorporated into clinical guidelines for pain reduction in oncologic patients. Selection among different ablation techniques should be based upon an individually tailored approach, to include consideration of all treatment modalities.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^1134yyn6]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

ASIPP interventional pain management guidelines — preamble, definitions, objectives, population, and implementation are outlined as follows: Chronic pain is defined as pain that "persists 6 months after an injury and/or beyond the usual course of an acute disease or a reasonable time for a comparable injury". The National Uniform Claims Committee (NUCC) defined interventional pain management as "the discipline of medicine devoted to the diagnosis and treatment of pain and related disorders by the application of interventional techniques in managing subacute, chronic, persistent, and intractable pain, independently or in conjunction with other modalities of treatments". Interventional techniques are described by MedPAC as "minimally invasive procedures, such as needle placement of drugs in targeted areas, ablation of targeted nerves, and some surgical techniques, such as discectomy and the implantation of intrathecal infusion pumps and spinal cord stimulators". The purpose states these guidelines "are statements developed to improve the quality of care, patient access, treatment outcomes, the appropriateness of indicated and medically necessary care, efficiency and effectiveness, and to achieve cost containment by improving the cost-benefit ratio". Objectives include "Providing strategies to manage chronic spinal pain and/or its consequences to improve the quality of clinical care", "Providing recommendations that are generally acceptable to a wide range of specialties and agencies", "Developing methods that are sound and transparent", "Utilizing a process which is valid, reliable, reproducible, clinically applicable, and flexible", "Systematically assessing the clinical and cost effectiveness of treatments and management strategies with an evidence-based approach", and "Increasing compliance, dispelling misconceptions, contributing to appropriate patient expectations, and facilitating the improved relationship between patients, physicians, and payers". The population covered "includes all patients suffering with chronic spinal pain eligible to undergo commonly utilized and effective interventional technique(s)", and "The treatment plan must take into consideration the evidence, patient preferences, and risk-benefit ratio". Implementation timelines were set: "Effective date – May 1, 2013", "Expiration date – December 31, 2015", and "Scheduled review – April 2014".

### Image-guided peripheral nerve interventions-applications and techniques [^114xTJNv]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Interventional radiology continues to be at the forefront of acute and chronic pain management. Our unique imaging expertise and ability to target difficult to reach structures allows for the continuous development of new ways to treat a variety of pain generators. In addition, the advent of thermal ablation techniques and technologies has provided a unique opportunity to offer patients more durable and predictable options to treat their pain. This is particularly important during the opioid epidemic, as multiple local and international governmental bodies push for physicians to create ways to manage pain while reducing the need for long-term opioid dependence. This article aims to review various image-guided techniques and tools for the treatment of pain related to peripheral pain generators, with a focus on the extremities, lumbosacral and pelvic region, and the chest wall. For each target and pathology, we will discuss general etiology, anatomy, procedural approach, and briefly evaluate the supporting literature in each clinical situation.

### Radiofrequency for chronic knee pain: a literature review [^1162wWvm]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive Analysis of the Effectiveness of RF Therapy for Chronic Knee Pain

RF therapy has become an important minimally invasive technique for the treatment of chronic knee pain, especially for patients with osteoarthritis and other degenerative diseases. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of RF therapy in reducing pain and enhancing functional outcomes. A systematic review highlighted that patients who underwent RF ablation had significantly lower pain scores after treatment, and several patients maintain pain relief for up to six months. This sustained effect is due to the method's ability to disrupt the transmission of pain signals by targeting specific nerves associated with the knee joint, resulting in long-lasting analgesia. In addition, the safety of RF therapy is commendable and the rate of serious complications is low, making it a viable option for patients who cannot tolerate more invasive surgical interventions. While these findings are promising, additional randomized controlled trials are needed to further confirm the long-term benefits and determine the optimal protocol for RF therapy in managing chronic knee pain.

### Radiofrequency procedures to relieve chronic knee pain: an evidence-based narrative review [^113uCYN5]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Chronic knee pain from osteoarthritis or following arthroplasty is a common problem. A number of publications have reported analgesic success of radiofrequency (RF) procedures on nerves innervating the knee, but interpretation is hampered by lack of clarity regarding indications, clinical protocols, targets, and longevity of benefit from RF procedures.

Methods

We reviewed the following medical literature databases for publications on RF procedures on the knee joint for chronic pain: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar up to August 9, 2015. Data on scores for pain, validated scores for measuring physical disability, and adverse effects measured at any timepoint after 1 month following the interventions were collected, analyzed, and reported in this narrative review.

Results

Thirteen publications on ablative or pulsed RF treatments of innervation of the knee joint were identified. A high success rate of these procedures in relieving chronic pain of the knee joint was reported at 1 to 12 months after the procedures, but only 2 of the publications were randomized controlled trials. There was evidence for improvement in function and a lack of serious adverse events of RF treatments.

Conclusions

Radiofrequency treatments on the knee joint (major or periarticular nerve supply or intra-articular branches) have the potential to reduce pain from osteoarthritis or persistent postarthroplasty pain. Ongoing concerns regarding the quality, procedural aspects, and monitoring of outcomes in publications on this topic remain. Randomized controlled trials of high methodological quality are required to further elaborate role of these interventions in this population.

### Navigating current controversies in radiofrequency ablation of the genicular nerves for chronic knee pain in osteoarthritis: a daring discourse [^1167Koi6]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic knee joint pain affects millions worldwide, with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of genicular nerves emerging as a potential treatment in the last 15 years. Despite its growing popularity, with studies demonstrating its efficacy in pain reduction for up to 12 months, recent randomized controlled trials have questioned the efficacy of RFA. Discrepancies in study results may partially be explained by the heterogeneity of patient selection and technical protocols. This daring discourse aims to explore and critically analyze the ongoing debates surrounding RFA of the genicular nerves, addressing key controversies, namely: (1) Is there a role for performing prognostic blocks prior to RFA? (2) What are the optimal target sites for final cannulae placement for the classical targets? (3) Which and how many nerves should be targeted in RFA procedures? (4) What are the comparative benefits of using ultrasound versus fluoroscopy guidance, and whether a combined technique may be advantageous? (5) Is there a potential role for pulsed radiofrequency of the genicular nerves? (6) Should genicular nerve RFA be performed after total knee arthroplasty?Through this in-depth discussion, we aim to guide pain medicine clinicians in informed decision-making and encourage further research in this field.

Comparison of the Efficacy of RF Therapy with Other Therapeutic Approaches

The comparison between RF therapy and traditional treatment strategies for chronic knee pain has become the focus of recent research. When juxtaposed with traditional drug therapy, RF therapy has exhibited superior results in terms of speed and duration of pain relief. Studies have shown that patients who receive RF therapy have greater improvements in pain and quality of life measures compared with patients who receive standard medical management. In addition, RF therapy has fewer side effects, which is a significant advantage over long-term drug use, which often produces adverse reactions and dependency problems. In addition, RF ablation is less invasive than surgery, resulting in faster recovery time and reduced medical costs due to shorter length of hospitalization and fewer postoperative care requirements. However, it is crucial to recognize that RF therapy may be inappropriate for all patients, as certain pathological conditions may influence its effectiveness. Compared with hyaluronic acid injections, RF therapy provides prolonged pain relief with fewer repeat interventions, making it a cost-effective option for managing chronic knee pain. In a randomized controlled trial, RF ablation demonstrated superior pain relief and functional improvement over platelet-rich plasma injections, suggesting its potential as a first-line interventional therapy for knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, the choice of personalized treatment based on the individual patient's situation is crucial to optimize treatment outcomes and improve patient satisfaction.

### Radiofrequency ablation for thoracic and abdominal chronic pain syndromes [^113GrATB]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic thoracic pain and chronic abdominal pain are common conditions that can significantly affect quality of life. Pain syndromes encompassing a variety of causes, including cancer pain, neuritis, and postsurgical pain, are traditionally managed by the use of pharmacologic therapy; however, many cases are refractory to these conservative methods. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been increasingly used as a tool to treat resistant, chronic pain of both thoracic and abdominal origin. Multiple cases and trials have been reported that show the efficacy of RFA in the treatment of these chronic pain conditions.

### Radiofrequency procedures to relieve chronic hip pain: an evidence-based narrative review [^115ddpqH]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Chronic hip pain from osteoarthritis and other degenerative conditions is a common problem. A few publications have recently reported analgesic success of radiofrequency (RF) procedures on nerves innervating the hip, but interpretation is hampered by lack of clarity regarding indications, clinical protocols, anatomic targets, and longevity of benefit from RF procedures.

Methods

We reviewed the following medical literature databases for publications on RF procedures on the hip joint for chronic pain: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar through February 28, 2017. Existing knowledge on innervation of the hip joint was synthesized. Data on analgesic and functional outcomes and adverse effects measured at any time points following the interventions were also collected, analyzed, and reported in this narrative review.

Results

Fourteen publications on ablative RF treatments of innervation of the hip joint were identified. A high success rate of these procedures in relieving chronic pain of the hip joint was reported at 8 days to 36 months after the procedures, but none of the publications were randomized controlled trials. There was evidence for improvement in function and a lack of serious adverse events of RF treatments.

Conclusions

Radiofrequency treatments for the sensory innervation of the hip joint have the potential to reduce pain secondary to degenerative conditions. Ongoing concerns remain regarding the anatomic targets, as well as quality, procedural aspects, and monitoring of outcomes in publications on this topic. Randomized controlled trials of high methodological quality are required to further elaborate the role of these interventions in this population.

### Water-cooled radiofrequency provides pain relief, decreases disability, and improves quality of life in chronic knee osteoarthritis [^112imnt9]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic osteoarthritis (OA) is a widespread source of pain and disability and represents a growing economic burden across aging populations. Representing a major focus of arthritis care, OA of the knee is especially concerning as it has the potential to restrict mobility and significantly impair quality of life. Chronic OA is often poorly managed both pharmacologically and nonpharmacologically, with surgical management representing the definitive treatment. Those who are not surgical candidates or simply opt for minimally invasive treatments are usually faced with a lack of alternatives. An additional treatment presents itself in the form of water-cooled radiofrequency ablation, which involves the use of thermal lesions to interrupt the active pain pathways. An 81-year-old woman with bilateral severe knee OA was initially seen and evaluated in an outpatient physiatry clinic after multiple previous workups of her ongoing knee pain. With a known diagnosis of end-stage knee OA, the patient chose to proceed with bilateral water-cooled radiofrequency ablation. At 6 weeks and 3 months after the procedure, the patient maintained adequate levels of pain relief, markedly improved function, and enhanced quality of life. Water-cooled radiofrequency ablation has the potential to create lasting pain relief and with minimal adverse effects in patients with chronic knee OA.

### Radiofrequency for chronic knee pain: a literature review [^113W8Er7]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Looking ahead, future research should concentrate on several key areas to further clarify the role of RF therapy in the management of chronic knee pain. Longitudinal studies evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of RF therapy are critical. In addition, exploring potential pain relief mechanisms may yield insights to improve patient selection criteria and treatment options. Studying the synergies of combined RF with other treatment modalities may also enhance pain management strategies.

In summary, while RF treatment is a valuable tool for the management of chronic knee pain, a comprehensive approach that integrates diverse research and treatment strategies is crucial for advancing clinical practice. Ongoing exploration in this field will enhance the understanding and application of RF therapy, ultimately improving patient outcomes and formulating future pain management guidelines.

### Microglial ablation does not affect opioid-induced hyperalgesia in rodents [^116b2uLQ]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Opioids are the frontline analgesics in pain management. However, chronic use of opioid analgesics causes paradoxical pain that contributes to the decrease of their efficacy in pain control and the escalation of dose in long-term management of pain. The underling pathogenic mechanism is not well understood. Microglia have been commonly believed to play a critical role in the expression of opioid-induced hyperalgesia in animal models. We performed microglial ablation experiments using either genetic (CD11b-diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mouse) or pharmacological (colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor inhibitor PLX5622) approaches. Surprisingly, ablating microglia using these specific and effective approaches did not cause detectable impairment in the expression of hyperalgesia induced by morphine. We confirmed this conclusion with a behavioral test of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, in male and female mice, and with different species (mouse and rat). These findings raise caution about the widely assumed contribution of microglia to the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia.

### Percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation of the medial branch nerves for the treatment of chronic axial back pain in patients after radiofrequency ablation [^116Goh5T]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As the leading cause of disability worldwide, chronic low back pain (LBP) represents a significant societal challenge and economic burden for patients and health care systems. When LBP becomes chronic, a cycle of intensified pain and disability can occur as the result of central sensitization (i.e. primarily nociceptive pain can lead to sustained changes in central pain processing in the spinal cord and supraspinal centers that take on nociplastic characteristics), which produces hypersensitivity to normal inputs as well as pain. Disability resulting from chronic LBP is known to commonly interfere with and reduce activities of daily living (e.g. walking, housework, personal care) and decreases quality of life. Chronic LBP can be difficult to treat with existing approaches, and the limited efficacy and drawbacks associated with existing approaches, such as medication management, radiofrequency ablation, or surgery, highlight the need for new non-opioid, nondestructive, and nonsurgical pain management strategies.

### Role of peripheral nerve stimulation in treating chronic neuropathic pain: an international focused survey of pain medicine experts [^1111DQCh]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Interventional pain management (IPM) options for refractory neuropathic pain (NP) have recently increased with availability of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) equipment and expertise. Given a lack of high-quality evidence and guidelines on this topic, we sought to understand the perception of physicians with expertise in treating NP regarding IPM and the role of PNS. We emailed a survey in March 2022 to international NP experts including pain medicine physicians, researchers, and leaders of 11 professional pain societies. No representatives from vendors of PNS systems were included in the design of the survey nor as respondents. Among 24 respondents (67% of those contacted), the distal common peroneal, tibial, and sural nerves were most frequently targeted (60%) with PNS. Persistent postsurgical pain of more than 3 months was the most common indication for PNS (84%). The aggregate NP treatment algorithm in order of median rank was non-opioid medications as first line, IPM including epidural/perineural steroid injections tied with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation as second line, pulsed radiofrequency (RF) tied with RF ablation/denervation as third line, temporary then permanent PNS as fourth line, followed by spinal cord stimulation, opioids, cryoablation, botulinum, peripheral nerve field stimulation, intrathecal targeted drug delivery, and others. Before offering PNS, 12 respondents (50%) indicated their preference for trialing non-neuromodulation treatments for 1–3 months. Twenty-two respondents (92%) agreed PNS should be offered early in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The most common barriers to PNS use were cost, lack of high-quality evidence in support of its use, lack of exposure to PNS in training programs, and lack of familiarity with the use of ultrasound guidance. PNS appears to have an increasing role in the treatment of NP but more research is needed on the outcomes of PNS to elucidate its role.

### Interventional pain procedures: a narrative review focusing on safety and complications. PART 2 interventional procedures for back pain [^112xzMot]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) such as "pain that persists or recurs for longer than 3 months. Such pain often becomes the sole or predominant clinical problem in some patients". The most frequent chronic pain condition is low back pain. When conservative treatment fails to relieve pain, interventional procedures may be an alternative option in selected patients. Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in image-guided interventional procedures performed for the management of acute and chronic pain. However, rising numbers of complications related to these procedures has also been observed, varying from minor to severe and debilitating. There is considerable concern regarding severe complications which may occur following interventional procedures for pain treatment. Exceedingly severe complications have been reported, including infection and spinal cord infarction. The occurrence of adverse events regarding various spine interventions varies greatly and, although detailed evidence-based guidelines are available to reduce the risks associated with these procedures, there are considerable variations in clinical practice. A certain procedure carries an inherently non-zero, adverse-effect risk. However, this risk will increase if the technique is employed poorly or incorrectly. Physicians are urged to be heedful of patient safety to ensure that adverse events are reduced to a minimum. The safety of interventional procedures depends not only on physician expertise but also patient selection and preparation. This narrative review aims to describe complications that may result from commonly performed image-guided interventional pain procedures. In this second installment of our three-part series, we analyze complications arising from common interventional pain procedures for chronic back pain. Clinicians frequently propose minimally invasive treatments, such as branch nerve blocks, epidural steroid injections or radiofrequency ablation, when managing non-cancer spinal pain chronic in nature. In 2020, the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued an update to its guidelines confirming this recommendation. The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) also provided updates in the same year, reiterating their endorsement of interventional pain techniques (facet joint injections, nerve blocks and radiofrequency ablation).

### Review of craniofacial pain syndromes involving the greater occipital nerve: relevant anatomy, clinical findings, and interventional management [^11584GBd]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Craniofacial pain syndromes exhibit a high prevalence in the general population, with a subset of patients developing chronic pain that significantly impacts their quality of life and results in substantial disabilities. Anatomical and functional assessments of the greater occipital nerve (GON) have unveiled its implication in numerous craniofacial pain syndromes, notably through the trigeminal-cervical convergence complex. The pathophysiological involvement of the greater occipital nerve in craniofacial pain syndromes, coupled with its accessibility, designates it as the primary target for various interventional procedures in managing craniofacial pain syndromes. This educational review aims to describe multiple craniofacial pain syndromes, elucidate the role of GON in their pathophysiology, detail the relevant anatomy of the greater occipital nerve (including specific intervention sites), highlight the role of imaging in diagnosing craniofacial pain syndromes, and discuss various interventional procedures such as nerve infiltration, ablation, neuromodulation techniques, and surgeries. Imaging is essential in managing these patients, whether for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. The utilization of image guidance has demonstrated an enhancement in reproducibility, as well as technical and clinical outcomes of interventional procedures. Studies have shown that interventional management of craniofacial pain is effective in treating occipital neuralgia, cervicogenic headaches, cluster headaches, trigeminal neuralgia, and chronic migraines, with a reported efficacy of 60–90% over a duration of 1–9 months. Repeated infiltrations, neuromodulation, or ablation may prove effective in selected cases. Therefore, reassessment of treatment response and efficacy during follow-up is imperative to guide further management and explore alternative treatment options. Optimal utilization of imaging, interventional techniques, and a multidisciplinary team, including radiologists, will ensure maximum benefit for these patients.

### Radiofrequency for chronic knee pain: a literature review [^114QyUuo]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This review aimed to explore the current applications of radiofrequency (RF) therapy in managing chronic knee pain and to compare different treatment strategies.

Methods

A comprehensive review of recent literature was conducted, concentrating on variations in target selection, guidance techniques, and treatment parameters that influence therapeutic outcomes.

Results

RF therapy is a minimally invasive and effective treatment for chronic knee pain, providing faster recovery compared with traditional interventions. However, differences in treatment options can lead to significant variability in the efficacy and safety.

Conclusion

A thorough understanding of the distinct characteristics of various RF therapy strategies is required for optimizing chronic knee pain management. Future research should emphasize systematic evaluation of these approaches to refine clinical practice and establish evidence-based pain management protocols.

### Review article: is ultrasound guidance advantageous for interventional pain management? A systematic review of chronic pain outcomes [^115chjBB]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Modern ultrasound (US) is an attractive alternative to anatomical landmark-, nerve stimulation-, and fluoroscopic-guided techniques for interventional procedures performed to treat chronic pain syndromes.

Methods

In this review, we evaluated the effects of US guidance compared with traditional guidance techniques on performance, efficacy, and safety outcomes for interventional chronic pain procedures. We identified 46 studies, including 41 case series and 5 randomized trials of intermediate-to-good quality that investigated the use of US guidance for a diverse variety of chronic pain procedures.

Results

Our results suggest that US guidance can match or improve performance- and safety-related outcomes compared with many anatomic landmark-, nerve stimulation-, and fluoroscopic-guided techniques for treating chronic pain.

Conclusions

There are presently insufficient data to support improved efficacy with procedures performed with US guidance for relieving both short- and long-term chronic pain.

### Comparative effectiveness review of cooled versus pulsed radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review [^111PDNSC]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee and patients post total knee arthroplasty often develop refractory, disabling chronic knee pain. Radiofrequency ablation, including conventional, pulsed, and cooled, has recently become more accepted as an interventional technique to manage chronic knee pain in patients who have failed conservative treatment or who are not suitable candidates for surgical treatment.

Objective

This systematic review aimed to analyze published studies on radiofrequency ablation to provide an overview of the current knowledge regarding variations in procedures, nerve targets, adverse events, and temporal extent of clinical benefit.

Study Design

A systematic review of published studies investigating conventional, pulsed, or cooled radiofrequency ablation in the setting of chronic knee pain.

Methods

Medline, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases were reviewed for studies on radiofrequency ablation for patients with chronic knee pain through July 29, 2016. From the studies, the procedural details, outcomes after treatment, follow-up points, and complications were compiled and analyzed in this literature review. Included studies were analyzed for clinical relevance and strength of evidence was graded using either the NHLBI Quality assessment of controlled intervention studies or the NHLBI quality assessment for before-after (pre-post) studies with no control group.

Results

Seventeen total publications were identified in the search, including articles investigating conventional, pulsed, or cooled radiofrequency ablation. These studies primarily targeted either the genicular nerves or used an intraarticular approach. Of the studies, 5 were small-sized randomized controlled trials, although one involved diathermy radiofrequency ablation. There were 8 retrospective or prospective case series and 4 case reports. Utilizing the strength of evidence grading, there is a low level of certainty to suggest a superior benefit between targeting the genicular nerve, an intraarticular approach, or targeting the larger nerves such as femoral and tibial nerves. Utilizing the strength of evidence grading, there is a low level of certainty in supporting the superiority of any specific RFA procedure modality. The majority of the studies report positive patient outcomes, but the inconsistent procedural methodology, inconsistent patient assessment measures, and small study sizes limit the applicability of any specific study to clinical practice.

Limitations

While the wide search strategy included a variety of articles, broad conclusions and pooled data could not be obtained based on the studies analyzed.

Conclusions

Overall, the studies showed promising results for the treatment of severe chronic knee pain by radiofrequency ablation at up to one year with minimal complications. Numerous studies, however, yielded concerns about procedural protocols, study quality, and patient follow-up. Radiofrequency ablation can offer substantial clinical and functional benefit to patients with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis or post total knee arthroplasty. Key words: Radiofrequency ablation, knee osteoarthritis, knee pain, genicular nerve, total knee arthroplasty (TKA), cooled radiofrequency ablation, pulsed radiofrequency ablation.

### Radiofrequency techniques to treat chronic knee pain: a comprehensive review of anatomy, effectiveness, treatment parameters, and patient selection [^114V1egG]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedures to treat chronic knee pain has surged in the past decade, though many questions remain regarding anatomical targets, selection criteria, and evidence for effectiveness.

Methods

A comprehensive literature review was performed on anatomy, selection criteria, technical parameters, results of clinical studies, and complications. Databases searched included MEDLINE and Google Scholar, with all types of clinical and preclinical studies considered.

Results

We identified nine relevant clinical trials, which included 592 patients, evaluating knee RFA for osteoarthritis and persistent postsurgical pain. These included one randomized, placebo-controlled trial, one randomized controlled trial evaluating RFA as add-on therapy, four comparative-effectiveness studies, two randomized trials comparing different techniques and treatment paradigms, and one non-randomized, controlled trial. The results of these studies demonstrate significant benefit for both reduction and functional improvement lasting between 3 and 12 months, with questionable utility for prognostic blocks. There was considerable variation in the described neuroanatomy, neural targets, radiofrequency technique, and selection criteria.

Conclusion

RFA of the knee appears to be a viable and effective treatment option, providing significant benefit to well-selected patients lasting at least 3 months. More research is needed to better identify neural targets, refine selection criteria to include the use of prognostic blocks, optimize treatment parameters, and better elucidate relative effectiveness compared to other treatments.

### Factors predicting outcomes from chronic pain management interventions [^111B1vrT]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Disease burden

Although it seems reasonable that a greater disease burden should produce a higher degree of pain, and that patients with greater pain severity should feel more benefits from interventional procedures, neither premise is proven. Data are mixed about whether a greater severity of lesions or symptoms correlates with outcomes from interventional pain procedures, and an inverse relation is frequently found. In a recent systematic review of 15 studies (median 73 participants per study), no individual prognostic factor (including baseline pain severity, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or electromyography findings) was significantly associated with outcomes after epidural steroid injections. In a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial conducted in 350 patients undergoing epidural steroid injections, the radiological severity of the lumbar stenosis was not significantly associated with postprocedural outcomes. In a retrospective study in > 1200 patients receiving epidural steroid injections for sciatica, lower baseline pain scores, lower opioid doses, and unilateral (v bilateral) symptoms were correlated with positive outcomes. A prospective study in 346 patients who received injection or radiofrequency ablation for low back pain found inverse relations between baseline pain score, duration of symptoms, and treatment outcomes.

### The optimal patient profile and appropriate role of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for patients with persistent spinal pain syndrome-type 1 (PSPS-T1) not suitable for spine surgery: a European modified Delphi consensus [^1112vQK6]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, the treatment approach should include multimodal intensive conservative treatment, conventional medical management, and interventional pain therapy, where eligible, prior to considerations of further treatment (Figure 3).

Across Europe, there is a need to identify patients with refractory pain who may benefit from SCS. Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK recommends SCS for patients who continue to experience chronic pain (measuring at least 50 mm on a 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale) for at least six months despite appropriate CMM. European consensus recommendations published in 2020 indicate that the inclusion criteria for SCS should include age ≥ 18 years; chronic low back/leg pain with a duration of at least six months and at least moderate severity impact on QoL; presence of complex regional, neuropathic, or ischemic pain syndromes; failure of previous CMM and/or minimally invasive treatments; and where there are no clear benefits from spine surgery.

The diverse composition of SCS patient cohorts has made patient subtype characterization more complicated. For example, some HCPs proposed radiofrequency ablation following CMM. However, the respondents in this study displayed mixed opinions, reflecting the heterogeneity of patient subgroups. Most studies on radiofrequency ablation focused on lumbar facet joints and sacroiliac joints. There is therefore a need to use both real-world and clinical evidence, including a European PSPS-T1 registry, to better identify patient subgroups suitable for SCS and refine pain management protocols.
3. Spine surgery should be performed if clear indications associated with anatomical targets are presented, including neural compression or instability, lumbar disc herniation, spinal canal stenosis, and the risk/benefit of surgery is considered favorable; otherwise, SCS can be a treatment of choice for patients who are ineligible for spine surgery (Figure 3).

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^117ASvYL]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Interventional pain management rationale and definitions — according to on-page organizational definitions — note that the National Uniform Claims Committee (NUCC) defines interventional pain management as the discipline of medicine devoted to diagnosis and treatment of pain-related disorders using interventional techniques for subacute, chronic, persistent, and intractable pain, alone or with other modalities, and that the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) defines interventional pain management techniques as minimally invasive procedures including percutaneous precision needle placement of drugs in targeted areas or ablation of targeted nerves, surgical techniques such as laser and endoscopic discectomy, and placement of intrathecal infusion pumps and spinal cord stimulators for chronic, persistent, or intractable pain. Chronic spinal pain is described as a complex and multifactorial disease process with increasing prevalence and economic consequences. Interventional pain physicians are familiar with various image-guided interventional techniques, and pain generators include intervertebral discs, facet joints, sacroiliac joints, ligaments, fascia, muscles, and nerve root dura. Many causes of spinal pain are acute recurrent problems punctuated by flare-ups or chronic diseases requiring long-term treatment with ongoing care, and the importance of spinal interventional techniques has been established based on advances in imaging, neuroanatomic findings, precision diagnostic and therapeutic injection techniques, and reported nonoperative treatment successes.

### The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) guidelines for radiofrequency ablative procedures in patients with implanted devices [^1175Qop7]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a treatment modality used in interventional pain management to treat several conditions including chronic neck or back pain, sacroiliac joint pain, major joint pain, and pain from sites that can be isolated to a sensory nerve amenable to RFA. The goals of such procedures are to reduce pain, improve function, delay need for surgical intervention, and reduce pain medication consumption. As applications for RFA expand through novel techniques and nerve targets, there is concern with how RFA may impact patients with implanted medical devices. Specifically, the electrical currents used in RFA produce electromagnetic interference, which can result in unintentional energy transfer to implanted devices. This may also interfere with device function or cause damage to the device itself. As the number of patients with implanted devices increases, it is imperative to establish guidelines for the management of implanted devices during RFA procedures. This review aims to establish guidelines to assist physicians in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management of implanted devices in patients undergoing procedures using radiofrequency energy. Here, we provide physicians with background knowledge and a summary of current evidence to allow safe utilization of RFA treatment in patients with implanted devices such as cardiac implantable electronic devices, spinal cord stimulators, intrathecal pumps, and deep brain stimulators. While these guidelines are intended to be comprehensive, each patient should be assessed on an individual basis to optimize outcomes.

### Cooled radiofrequency ablation versus standard medical management for chronic sacroiliac joint pain: a multicenter, randomized comparative effectiveness study [^116z2HQJ]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide, with sacroiliac joint pain comprising up to 30% of cases of axial lower back pain. Conservative therapies provide only modest relief. Although placebo-controlled trials show efficacy for sacral lateral branch cooled radiofrequency ablation, there are no comparative effectiveness studies.

Methods

In this randomized, multicenter comparative effectiveness study, 210 patients with clinically suspected sacroiliac joint pain who obtained short-term benefit from diagnostic sacroiliac joint injections and prognostic lateral branch blocks were randomly assigned to receive cooled radiofrequency ablation of the L5 dorsal ramus and S1–S3 lateral branches or standard medical management consisting of pharmacotherapy, injections and integrative therapies. The primary outcome measure was mean reduction in low back pain score on a 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included measures of quality of life and function.

Results

3 months post-treatment, the mean Numeric Rating Scale pain score for the cooled radiofrequency ablation group was 3.8 ± 2.4 (mean reduction 2.5 ± 2.5) compared with 5.9 ± 1.7 (mean reduction 0.4 ± 1.7) in the standard medical management group (p < 0.0001). 52.3% of subjects in the cooled radiofrequency ablation group experienced > 2 points or 30% pain relief and were deemed responders versus 4.3% of standard medical management patients (p < 0.0001). Comparable improvements favoring cooled radiofrequency ablation were noted in Oswestry Disability Index score (mean 29.7 ± 15.2 vs 41.5+13.6; p < 0.0001) and quality of life (mean EuroQoL-5 score 0.68 ± 0.22 vs 0.47 ± 0.29; p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

In patients with sacroiliac joint pain, cooled radiofrequency ablation provided statistically superior improvements across the spectrum of patient outcomes compared with standard medical management.

### Radiofrequency ablation's effectiveness for treating abdominal and thoracic chronic pain syndromes: a systematic review of the current literature [^112Tjwpp]. Pain Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Many patients suffer from abdominal and thoracic pain syndromes secondary to numerous underlying etiologies. Chronic abdominal and thoracic pain can be difficult to treat and often refractory to conservative management. In this systematic literature review, we evaluate the current literature to assess radiofrequency ablation's (RFA) efficacy for treating these debilitating chronic pain conditions in the thoracic and abdominal regions.

Objectives

The objective of this study is to determine the pain relief efficacy of RFA on chronic thoracic and chronic abdominal disease states.

Study Design

This study is a systematic literature review that uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) method to gather academic literature articles through a methodical approach. The numbers obtained from each academic manuscript were then used to calculate the percent efficacy of radiofrequency ablation on thoracic and abdominal pain relief.

Methods

Articles from 1992 through 2022 were gathered using PRISMA guidelines. The search terms "Radiofrequency Ablation Thoracic Pain" and "Radiofrequency Ablation Abdominal Pain" were used to identify articles to include in our study. Our search yielded a total of 575 studies, 32 of which were included in our study. The articles were then categorized into pain causes. The efficacy of RFA for each qualitative study was then quantified. Risk of bias was also assessed for articles using the Cochran Risk of Bias tool, as well as a tool made by the National Institutes of Health.

Results

The PRISMA search yielded a total of 32 articles used for our study, including 16 observational studies, one cohort study, 6 case reports, 6 case series, and 3 clinical trials. Twenty-five articles were labeled good quality and one article was labeled fair quality according to the risk of bias assessment tools. The studies examined RFA efficacy on chronic abdominal and chronic pain syndromes such as spinal lesions, postsurgical thoracic pain, abdominal cancers, and pancreatitis. Among these etiologies, RFA demonstrated notable efficacy in alleviating pain among patients with spinal osteoid osteomas or osteoblastomas, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer. The modes of RFA used varied among the studies; they included monopolar RFA, bipolar RFA, pulsed RFA, and RFA at different temperatures. The average efficacy rate was 84% ranging from 55.8% - 100%. A total of 329 males and 291 females were included with ages ranging 4 to 90 years old.

Limitations

Limitations of this review include the RFA not being performed at the same nerve level to address the same pathology and the RFA not being performed for the same duration of time. Furthermore, the efficacy of RFA was evaluated via large case series and single cohort observational studies rather than control group observational studies and clinical trial studies.

Conclusion

A systematic review of the literature supports RFA as a viable option for managing abdominal and thoracic pain. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate the efficacy of the various RFA modalities to ensure RFA is the source of pain relief as a large body of the current literature focuses only on observational studies.

### Radiofrequency for chronic knee pain: a literature review [^1175P1uU]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Different RF Therapy Modalities

Various RF treatment modalities have been explored for their effectiveness in alleviating knee pain. Standard RF ablation, pulsed RF, low-temperature plasma RF, and bipolar water-cooled RF are commonly used techniques. Standard RF ablation has been shown to provide immediate pain relief by disrupting nerve conduction pathways, which can be particularly beneficial for patients with local pain. Conversely, pulsed RF operates at lower temperatures and minimizes tissue damage while achieving analgesic effects. This technique has attracted attention due to its safety and lower complication rate. Low-temperature plasma RF is another innovative approach that utilizes ionized gas to target pain pathways and has shown promise in previous studies. Finally, bipolar water-cooled RF is known for its ability to provide a more consistent and controlled energy distribution, potentially leading to improved outcomes. Each RF modality has distinct advantages and limitations, requiring a tailored approach based on the patient's individual characteristics and pain mechanisms. Modern RF devices have been improved in terms of energy output accuracy and stability, emerging essential for optimizing treatment outcomes. Additionally, advancements in patient safety and comfort have been prioritized. For instance, RF devices with intelligent temperature control systems can continuously monitor and adjust temperature in real time, minimizing the risk of damage to surrounding tissues. This represents a significant advancement in RF-based pain management, enhancing both safety and efficacy. The comparison of these different RF technologies suggests that selecting the right approach should be tailored to the specific clinical needs and patient situation to achieve the best pain management outcomes. Water-cooled RF has gained attention due to its ability to create larger lesion areas with controlled temperature distribution, reducing the risk of thermal damage while ensuring effective nerve ablation. Comparative studies indicate that pulsed RF may be preferable in certain cases due to its lower risk of neurodestruction and ability to preserve nerve function while modulating pain pathways. Figure 3 illustrates how water-cooled RF interacts with tissues. Table 1 compares four RF therapy modalities for chronic knee pain management, outlining their mechanisms, operating temperatures (60–90°C to ≤ 42°C), clinical advantages, such as nerve preservation and precision control, limitations including tissue damage risk and high cost, and key supporting studies from 2018 to 2024.

### Dorsal root ganglion pulsed radiofrequency with scar radiofrequency ablation combined for chronic postoperative abdominal pain: a retrospective study [^112mRbec]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) is a well-recognized complication of abdominal surgery, characterized by pain that develops or worsens in the surgical area and persists for more than three months after surgery, with other causes of pain excluded. Given the wide range of abdominal procedures performed, the incidence of chronic postoperative abdominal pain (CPAP) varies depending on the type of surgery. Previous studies have reported that CPAP occurs in up to 51.6% of patients following inguinal hernia repair, the prevalence of chronic pain after uterine and gastrointestinal surgeries ranges from 16.2% to 30.2% and 21.8% to 32.1%, respectively. The underlying mechanisms of CPAP, like other forms of CPSP, are not yet fully understood. However, contributing factors may include preoperative psychological conditions, surgical trauma, and perioperative pain management strategies. Neuropathic components are believed to play a critical role, potentially resulting from peripheral and central sensitization as well as direct nerve injury. Conventional treatments for CPAP include medication, physiotherapy, nerve blocks and surgical interventions. However, these approaches have limitations such as medication side effects, limited efficacy, short-lived effects, and great surgical trauma. As a result, many patients experience persistent functional impairment, psychological distress, and reduced overall quality of life.

Radiofrequency-based interventions, including pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have emerged as effective minimally invasive techniques for managing chronic pain. These modalities have demonstrated long-term pain relief, reduced reliance on analgesics, and improved quality of life in patients with refractory chronic abdominal pain.PRF is believed to modulate neuronal excitability and inhibit pain signal transmission, whereas RFA directly ablates nerve endings within post-surgical scar tissue, alleviating pain by reducing nerve compression.

From a pathophysiological perspective, the combination of dorsal root ganglion pulsed radiofrequency (DRG-PRF) and scar RFA may provide improved pain relief by simultaneously addressing neuropathic and mechanical components of CPAP. Notably, clinical evidence supporting the effectiveness of this synergistic approach in managing CPAP is still lacking. Therefore, this study aims aimed to evaluate the efficacy of scar RFA combined with dorsal root ganglion (DRG) PRF in the management of CPAP.

Efficacy and Safety of RF Therapy

Efficacy Assessment Indicators

The efficacy of RF treatment can be evaluated according to the specific clinical situation using various indicators. Commonly assessed measures include pain relief or functional improvement. For instance, in the management of chronic pain, studies have shown that pain scores significantly reduce after treatment, and numerous patients experience remarkable pain relief that lasts for several months following RF treatment. Patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life and satisfaction scores, also play a vital role in assessing the overall success of RF treatment, reflecting the importance of a holistic approach to evaluate treatment efficacy. Consequently, combining clinical, radiological, and patient-reported measures provides a comprehensive assessment of RF therapy's efficacy across various applications.

Evaluation of the Safety of RF Therapy

RF therapy is a minimally invasive treatment that has gained popularity due to its efficacy in managing various medical conditions, particularly tumors, heart diseases, and pain management. The assessment of RF safety relies primarily on the outcomes of clinical trials and subsequent observational studies. The current literature indicates that RF has a high overall safety profile; however, it is associated with risks and complications. Therefore, despite the high safety of RF, it is imperative for clinicians to thoroughly evaluate patients prior to treatment and maintain vigilant monitoring to mitigate potential risks and ensure patient safety. Prior research indicated that RF therapy maintains analgesic effects for up to 12 months in some patients, although more effective treatments may be required to sustain long-term benefits. While RF therapy is generally well tolerated, rare complications, such as neuritis and dysesthesia, have been reported, necessitating careful patient selection and post-procedural monitoring.

Potential Side Effects and Complications of RF Therapy

Although RF therapy is generally considered safe, it is not without risks. Potential side effects can range from mild to severe, depending on the anatomical location being treated and the patient's underlying condition. Common mild adverse effects include localized pain, swelling, and bruising at the treatment site, which typically resolve within a few days without intervention. More serious complications, though rare, may involve thermal injury to adjacent structures, potentially causing unintended nerve or blood vessel damage. Additionally, there is a risk of infection at the puncture site, necessitating strict adherence to aseptic techniques during the procedure. Long-term complications, such as scar tissue formation or fibrosis, may also occur and impact the function of the treated area. Therefore, clinicians must carefully weigh the benefits and risks of RF therapy and provide patients with thorough preoperative counseling on potential complications.

### Efficacy of needle-placement technique in radiofrequency ablation for treatment of lumbar facet arthropathy [^113TSFn6]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is a widespread disorder with a prevalence of 2%–40% in the US. In individuals suffering from chronic pain, 28% complain of low-back pain. Excluding nonstructural causes of pain, low-back pain can arise from multiple areas: the intervertebral discs of the spine, the zygapophysial (facet) joints of the spine, and the paravertebral muscles, ligaments, and fascia. Postmortem studies have revealed that intervertebral discs and zygapophysial joints exhibit the greatest degree of degeneration within the spine, thus indicating the potential role of these structures in causing low-back pain. In patients with a structural cause of low-back pain, 15% of cases arise from the lumbar facet joints. The etiology of lumbar facet-joint pain is thought to result from repetitive stress and trauma to the joint, leading to inflammation and stretching of the joint capsule. Treatment options range from conservative management with the use of medications and physical therapy to interventional management with the use of intra-articular facet-joint injections and radiofrequency ablation of the nervous innervation to the facet joints.–

Multiple studies have been performed assessing the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation to denervate the facet joint as an interventional means of treating low-back pain.–In these studies, varying procedural techniques were utilized to ablate the nerves that innervate the facet joints. The early Australian technique described by Bogduk and Long in 1980 targets the dorsal surface of the transverse process just caudal to the most medial end of the superior edge of the transverse process. The advanced Australian technique described by the International Spine Intervention Society uses a steep caudocephalad axial tilt of the fluoroscopy beam with a 20° lateral tilt to allow the radiofrequency-ablation needle to hug the anterolateral aspect of the base of the superior articular process. Multiple papers have detailed the anatomic course of the nerves that innervate the facet joints. A recent review compared the anatomic and technical accuracy of the different procedural techniques in treating lumbar facet arthropathy, and described the advanced Australian technique as being the most anatomically appropriate technique. Currently, there is no available literature comparing the efficacy of the early Australian versus the advanced Australian facet joint-denervation technique.

In this study, we sought to examine the efficacy of the early Australian technique and the advanced Australian technique in terms of patient pain relief, both quantitative and subjective, as well as duration of relief. The rate of complications, the need for follow-up procedures, and whether patient factors affected outcomes were also assessed to determine which technique provided better patient safety and outcome.

### Pain with different ablation techniques in healthy cervical tissue | JCO global oncology… [^1151Ugnu]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract Abstract 21 Background: Traditional cryotherapy and thermoablation are safe and effective treatments for precancerous cervical lesions. Women can present with short-term pain during and after the procedures. Comparing conventional treatments with CryoPen will stablish efficacy and adverse effects with the goal of developing low-cost, effective treatments for developing countries. We undertook this work to determine pain after treatment with conventional cryotherapy with CO 2, the CryoPen adapted for low-resource settings, and the thermocoagulator. Methods: One hundred twenty-five women age 25 to 65 years who were scheduled for hysterectomy for indications other than cervical pathology were randomly assigned to one of five treatment arms: single- and double-freeze arms for conventional cryotherapy and the adapted CryoPen, and a single application of thermoablation at 100° C for 40 seconds.

Treatment was administered 12 to 24 hours before hysterectomy. By using the verbal numerical pain scale, treating physicians asked participants to rate their pain intensity from 0 to 10. Results: To date, 118 pain scores have been collected — 23 single-freeze and 25 double-freeze conventional cryotherapy; 23 single-freeze and 25 double-freeze CryoPen; and 22 thermoablation. Pain ranged from 0 to 3 for single-freeze cryotherapy, 0 to 4 for double-freeze cryotherapy, 0 to 6 for single-freeze CryoPen, 1 to 8 for double-freeze CryoPen, and 2 to 8 for thermoablation. In descending order of median pain scores, thermoablation was followed by double-freeze CryoPen, single-freeze CryoPen and double-freeze conventional cryotherapy, and single-freeze conventional cryotherapy. Conclusion: Both conventional cryotherapy and CryoPen are less painful ablation techniques compared with thermoablation.

Lower pain ratings for single-freeze compared with double-freeze strategies with both conventional cryotherapy and CryoPen support further research into the rationale for the traditional double-freeze regimen.

### Randomized trial of sacroiliac joint arthrodesis compared with conservative management for chronic low back pain attributed to the sacroiliac joint [^117GknTC]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2019). Medium credibility.

Low back pain is the number-1 contributor to global health burden in terms of years lived with disability. Chronic low back pain is the most common specific reason for prescribed opioid useand has contributed to marked increases in opioid abuse. Finding effective solutions for chronic low back pain is a critical agenda item for health-care professionals worldwide.

Pain from the sacroiliac joint has long been recognized as a potential source of chronic low back pain, playing a role in 15% to 30% of patients with chronic low back pain -. Also, the sacroiliac joint is implicated in up to 40% of patients with new-onset low back pain after lumbar arthrodesis.

The effectiveness of nonsurgical treatments for chronic sacroiliac joint pain remains unclear. Periarticular radiofrequency ablation and periarticular corticosteroid injections are supported only by short-term evidence; to our knowledge, no long-term, high-quality evidence supports these treatments' effectiveness. Open surgical arthrodesis of the sacroiliac joint can be achieved through multiple approaches. With the advent of minimally invasive approaches, open arthrodesis of the sacroiliac joint has decreased in usage. The most studied minimally invasive sacroiliac joint arthrodesis device, triangular titanium implants, has evidence support from randomized trials, a multicenter single-arm trial, prospective case series -, and comparative case series -. We conducted a randomized trial of minimally invasive sacroiliac joint arthrodesis compared with conservative management, previously reporting short-term outcomes. Herein, we report 2-year results.

### The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) guidelines for radiofrequency ablative procedures in patients with implanted devices [^1116VsRS]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Radiofrequency Ablation

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a treatment modality used in multiple specialties from treatment of cardiac arrhythmias to targeted destruction of tumors. It is used in interventional pain management to treat several conditions including chronic neck or back pain, sacroiliac joint pain, major joint pain, and pain from sites that can be isolated to a sensory nerve amenable to RFA. Conventional or thermal RFA uses a needle that delivers continuous high-voltage current to produce a heat lesion on a pain-transmitting nerve. The tip of the needle is heated to approximately 80 degrees Celsius, and the resulting lesion disrupts the pain signals to the brain. Pulsed radiofrequency utilizes short bursts of high-voltage current with intermittent pauses resulting in lower temperatures of approximately 42 degrees Celsius. The proposed mechanism of action is thought to be modulation of pain signals rather than thermal destruction of the nerve. The goals of such procedures are to reduce pain, improve function, delay or eliminate the need for surgical intervention, and reduce pain medication requirements. Contraindications to RFA are few but include site specific use of anticoagulants, site infection, and the inability of the patient to consent or desire not to proceed with the procedure. The electrical currents used in RFA produce electromagnetic interference (EMI) which can rarely result in unintentional energy transfer to implanted devices. This could theoretically interfere with device function or damage the device. As a result of this potential interference and the growing number of implanted devices, it is imperative to establish guidelines for the management of these devices during RFA procedures.

Problem

Implanted devices are becoming more prevalent as technologies improve and average lifespan continues to grow. Applications for RFA are also expanding with novel techniques and nerve targets. This increases the potential use of RFA in patients with implanted devices.

Goal

The primary objective of this review is to update previous recommendations and provide current guidelines to assist physicians and affiliated healthcare professionals in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management of implanted devices in patients undergoing procedures using radiofrequency energy. In addition, we hope to shape procedures and policies of institutions to improve patient safety in this population.

Application of Guidelines

These guidelines aim to provide physicians with background knowledge and a summary of current evidence to allow safe utilization of RFA treatment in patients with implanted devices. While these guidelines are intended to be comprehensive, each patient should be assessed on an individual basis to optimize outcomes.

### The utilization of radiofrequency techniques for upper extremity pain management [^112Z5iaY]. Pain Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In the 1990s, radiofrequency ablation emerged as a novel therapeutic approach tool for pain alleviation that did not result in neurological harm. Radiofrequency techniques are emerging methods as a possible option for upper extremity pain management. Furthermore, joint pain can result from multiple etiologies, and the management can differ based on what joint is affected. With the various management methods available to treat joint pain, radiofrequency ablation could be an effective, minimally invasive, promising intervention.

Objectives

This study aimed to review the current and historical uses of radiofrequency in upper extremity pain compared to other management methods and to address the utilization of radiofrequency in upper extremity pain management.

Study Design

This is a narrative review of relevant studies on using radiofrequency techniques in upper extremity pain management.

Methods

On June 26, 2022, Medline/PubMed, Google Scholar, ERIC, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for relevant literature documenting the use of radiofrequency techniques in treating upper extremity pain. The terms "radiofrequency", "pain", "upper extremity", "shoulder", "elbow", and "wrist" were used, resulting in 61 studies fitting the inclusion criteria. A narrative review was then undertaken.

Results

Radiofrequency ablation and its techniques are among the contemporary medical procedures that could be cost-effective solutions for patients suffering from chronic and postoperative pain. Its utilization for shoulder-related pain has been frequently studied, as it showed significant improvement with a high satisfaction rate as a solo procedure. When compared to intraarticular corticosteroid injections or local anesthetics, it was found to be more effective than local anesthetics. Although it did not appear superior to intraarticular corticosteroid injections, it had the advantage of infrequent repeat treatment. By comparison, studies involving the elbow and wrist showed promising results but were not as thorough as studies on the shoulder. Therefore, considering the possible side effects and complications, caution is warranted.

Limitations

The paucity of articles available on its application to the elbow and wrist joints. More articles are necessary for the generalizability of the results.

Conclusion

Radiofrequency techniques are a promising, minimally invasive procedure for controlling upper extremity pain. More studies on the topic, especially on elbow and wrist pain, are warranted for the generalizability of the results.

### Basivertebral nerve ablation technique [^114mPT42]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic low back pain represents a leading cause of global disability, but can often be complex in etiology, with multiple pain generators contributing to patient discomfort. Anterior column low back pain involves the vertebral bodies and discs, with the vertebral body endplates now known to be a significant pain generator. Vertebrogenic low back pain secondary to irritation of the basivertebral nerve presents as axial discomfort, worse with forward flexion, and with concomitant Type I or II Modic changes on MRI. Minimally invasive basivertebral nerve radiofrequency ablation has emerged as an effective intervention for managing anterior column back pain. In this article, the authors present a comprehensive approach to identifying and treating vertebrogenic low back pain through image guided basivertebral nerve ablation. We outline the patient presentation and diagnostic workup, followed by a detailed procedural guide including equipment requirements, technique execution, and potential technical challenges and complications.

### Radiofrequency techniques to treat chronic knee pain: a comprehensive review of anatomy, effectiveness, treatment parameters, and patient selection [^112SeEaH]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) entails the discrete delivery of thermal energy produced by an alternating current to neural tissue, thereby degrading its ability to conduct pain signals. First described as a treatment for pain in the 1960's, RFA evolved from a therapy primarily employed to alleviate neuropathic pain to one used today predominantly for mechanical joint pain amidst reports of increased pain stemming from deafferentation and neuroma formation. Since the neurosurgeon Norman Shealy adapted its use for the treatment of pain arising from the spinal facet joints in the mid-1970's, the accepted indications for RFA have expanded steadily over the ensuing decades. The advent of cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA)and the non- ablative pulsed radiofrequency (PRF)therapy have further broadened the clinical utility of RF for chronic pain states. Accepted targets for RF treatment now include most neural structures to include major nerves and ganglia.–The use of RF as a treatment for knee pain was first described in a small case series involving the treatment of different types of joint pain by Sluijter et al, who noted complete eradication of pain with intra-articular PRF in a patient with refractory post-traumatic knee pain. This area of pain medicine has evolved in the past decade, and though knee RFA has been the subject of numerous publications, high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remain sparse. The objectives of this publication are to review the relevant neuroanatomy of the knee and the available literature on RFA.

Search strategy

We systematically searched and screened all titles and abstracts from MEDLINE and Google Scholar from inception to February 1, 2018 using the following key words: "knee", "pain", "arthritis", "persistent postsurgical pain", "chronic postsurgical pain", "radiofrequency", "ablation", "denervation", and "pulsed radiofrequency". This initial search yielded 92 trials of varying design, which were then separately reviewed by the authors. For the purposes of this review only randomized and comparative trials were selected, with all other study types being excluded. A total of nine randomized or comparative trials were ultimately identified by independent searches conducted by each author. The literature search was complemented by reviewing the reference lists of the selected publications to search for additional articles missed by our initial electronic search.

### The use of radiofrequency in the treatment of pelvic pain [^116wZmAM]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a procedure in which radio waves are used to destroy abnormal or dysfunctional tissue. It has been an increasingly utilized treatment option for a variety of medical conditions, such as chronic pain, wherein sensory nerves are targeted and ablated, eliminating their ability to transmit pain signals to the brain. There is a lack of clarity regarding the indications, technique, and efficacy of RFA for chronic pelvic pain. This article reviews recent literature and discusses these topics, including adverse events for different pelvic ablation and pulsed radiofrequency treatment of chronic pelvic pain.

### Spinal cord stimulation [^112mjnYT]. Pain Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation is the most common mode of neuromodulation used in managing chronic low back pain. It is minimally invasive and reversible as opposed to nerve ablation. The basic scientific background of the initial spinal cord stimulation trials was based on the gate control theory of Melzack and Wall. It has been demonstrated in multiple studies that dorsal horn neuronal activity caused by peripheral noxious stimuli could be inhibited by concomitant stimulation of the dorsal columns. Various other mechanisms, which may play a significant role in the mechanism of action of spinal cord stimulation, include the suppressive effect of spinal cord stimulation on tactile allodynia, increased dorsal horn inhibitory action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), prevention or abolition of peripheral ischemia, and effects on human brain activity. Spinal cord stimulation is indicated in low back pain with radiculopathy, failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, and ischemic heart disease. There is substantial scientific evidence on the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation for treatment of low back and lower extremity pain of neuropathic nature. Clinical studies revealed a success rate of from 50% to 70% with spinal cord stimulation, with decreased pain intensity scores, functional improvement and decreased medication usage. This review discusses multiple aspects of spinal cord stimulation, including pathophysiology and mechanism of action, rationale, indications, technique, clinical effectiveness, and controversial aspects.

### Review of the safety of bipolar radiofrequency ablation in patients with chronic pain with implantable cardiac rhythm management devices [^111crypg]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pain, especially low back pain and hip pain, has been a growing public health concern that affects over 100 million Americans annually. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has distinct advantages over other chronic pain management modalities and its use has been increasing over the past decade. Among the growing population with comorbid conduction disorders and persistent pain, RFA and its potential interference with implantable cardiac devices is of concern.RFA is becoming a foundational element of persistent pain management and has been shown to be effective in a multitude of chronic pain syndromes. Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED), such as cardiac pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillators, have been used in the treatment of cardiac conduction diseases for a number of decades. With our aging population, these diseases have increased in both incidence and prevalence. Chronic pain and cardiac conduction diseases are both common in our increasingly aging population.

Objectives

This study aims to determine if the literature supports the hypothesis that patients with CIEDs can safely use RFA with minimal to no interaction.

Study Design

Systematic assessment of literature with a modified approach with bipolar RFA.

Methods

A narrative review with systematic assessment of the literature was carried out. In this review, we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), open non-randomized control studies, prospective studies, retrospective studies, case series, and case reports. All types of radiofrequency utilized for pain management including pulsed and conventional were included. Outcome measures included interactions between the cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), adverse events, RFA efficacy in treating the pain using pain scores, and other complications.

Results

Our search criteria yielded 4 studies for inclusion, with inclusion of 33 patients and 71 bipolar radiofrequency for treatments. No adverse events or interactions occurred between the bipolar radiofrequency device and the implanted cardiac devices in any of these patients. Bipolar radiofrequency was utilized in all patients (n = 33). Overall there were no complications or malfunctions.

Limitations

Small sample size, narrative review.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence that bipolar RFA can be safely used in patients with CIEDs for chronic pain provided that proper precautions are employed. Considerations for safe use are provided.

### Factors predicting outcomes from chronic pain management interventions [^115Mijtz]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Central sensitisation

Central sensitisation might predict interventional pain outcomes because the primary cause is not regional pathology, but rather the disordered processing of sensory stimuli. The negative impact of central sensitisation is compounded by the high rates of psychopathology and concomitant pain generators in this population, the low specificity of diagnostic imaging and physical exexamination signs for rheumatological conditions, and procedural overuse. For nearly all interventional procedures, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services lists diffuse pain as an exclusion criterion.

In a systematic review on the effect of nervous system sensitisation on musculoskeletal pain outcomes in 13 studies (n = 1920, most involved joint replacement), O'Leary et al reported that five exploratory studies found an association between quantitative sensory testing indicative of central sensitisation and poor interventional treatment outcomes, with two studies that used self-reported questionnaires also finding an association; four studies that performed a multivariable analysis were evenly divided on an association. The authors concluded that insufficient evidence existed to support an independent relation between sensitisation and poor outcomes.

A more recent and comprehensive review by Georgopoulos et al reported on 37 studies (five randomised studies, n = 3860 participants) where quantitative sensory testing was used before a pain intervention (psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, integrative treatments, and surgery). The authors found modest but consistent correlations between baseline quantitative sensory testing measures and follow-up pain and disability. For the prototypical nociplastic condition, fibromyalgia, studies have found a negative effect on outcomes for hip and knee replacement, abdominal surgery, perineural injections, and facet joint radiofrequency ablation, with negative radiofrequency ablation outcomes possibly attributable to aberrant responses to diagnostic blocks.

Preoperative and acute postoperative pain

Preoperative pain and severe acute postoperative pain are risk factors for persistent postsurgical pain, defined by ICD-11 (International classification of diseases, 11th revision) as pain persisting for ≥ 3 months after surgery. The median incidence of persistent postsurgical pain is 20–30%, slightly decreasing with time and varying widely by procedure. Studies have found that preoperative pain both at the surgical site and outside the site predicts persistent postsurgical pain. Preoperative pain is complex, however, representing the possibility of pre-existing nociplastic pain but potentially confounded by disease burden, psychopathology, and chronic opioid use. Uncontrolled postoperative pain increases the risk for subsequent persistent postsurgical pain, with severe pain on postoperative day 1 predicting persistent postsurgical pain.

Interventional pain management and peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) definitions and uses are described, with interventional pain management defined as "the discipline of medicine devoted to the diagnosis and treatment of pain related disorders, principally with the application of interventional techniques in managing subacute, chronic, persistent, and intractable pain, independently or in conjunction with other modalities of treatment", and interventional pain management techniques defined as "minimally invasive procedures including, percutaneous precision needle placement, with placement of drugs in targeted areas or ablation of targeted nerves; and some surgical techniques such as laser or endoscopic discectomy, intrathecal infusion pumps and spinal cord stimulators (SCS), for the diagnosis and management of chronic, persistent or intractable pain". PNS is characterized as "a neuromodulation therapy that involves implanting an electrode near a peripheral nerve responsible for the pain", in which "The electrode(s) deliver electrical impulses to the affected nerve, disrupting pain signal transmission and thereby reducing the sensation of pain", and has been applied for "chronic pain conditions of upper and lower extremities, entrapment syndromes, headache and facial pain, intercostal neuralgias, axial spinal pain, and other peripheral injuries and diseases", with neuropathic pain approaches including "two minimally invasive approaches to stimulating the medial branches of the dorsal medial ramus (the peripheral motor nerves innervating the multifidus muscle of the lower back)".

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for facet joint interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines facet joint interventions 2020 guidelines [^116TcYLe]. Pain Physician (2020). High credibility.

Facet joint interventions — frequency of interventions details that in the diagnostic phase, a patient may receive 2 episodes of diagnostic interventions no sooner than 2 weeks apart, with careful judgment of response. In the therapeutic phase (after the diagnostic phase is completed), the suggested frequency would be 3 months or longer between therapeutic facet joint nerve blocks, provided that ≥ 50% relief is obtained for 2½-3 months. For facet joint nerve ablation, the suggested frequency would be 6 months or longer (maximum of 2 times per year) between each procedure, provided that 50% or greater relief is obtained for 5–6 months. If the interventional procedures are applied for different regions, they may be performed at intervals of no sooner than one week or preferably 2 weeks for most types of procedures, if they are not allowed to be performed in one setting or contraindicated. In the therapeutic phase for medial branch neurotomy should remain at intervals of at least 6 months per each region with multiple regions involved, and it is further suggested that all regions be treated at the same time, provided all procedures are performed safely. In the treatment or therapeutic phase, the interventional procedures should be repeated only as necessary according to the medical necessity criteria, and it is suggested that these be limited to a maximum of 4 times for local anesthetic and steroid blocks over a period of one year, per region, with unusual circumstances (recurrent injury or cervicogenic headache) allowing repetition not exceeding 6 times in a year after stabilization in the treatment phase. For billing purposes, cervical and thoracic are considered as one region and lumbar and sacral are considered as one region, and diagnostic facet joint nerve blocks are required to be repeated only with intermittent trauma or changes in the pain pattern after successful treatment with therapeutic facet joint interventions.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^112Z2VjR]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Heel pain surgical management — third tier care continues tier 1 and/or 2 programs with consideration of surgical management, and options may include plantar fasciotomy using recognized techniques or extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) as an alternative. Current practice favors a minimally invasive approach to plantar fasciotomy versus extensive open surgical exposures, and in most cases removal of the plantar heel spur does not seem to add to the success of the outcome. In some cases multiple etiologic factors including nerve entrapment may necessitate combining nerve release and plantar fasciotomy, and radiofrequency coblation of the plantar fascia as well as radiofrequency nerve ablation and cryoprobe have been advocated more recently as an alternative surgical approach to chronic heel pain.

### Interventional techniques in the management of chronic pain: part 2.0 [^111iJCnh]. Pain Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the management of chronic pain are systematically developed statements to assist physician and patient decisions about appropriate health care related to chronic pain. These guidelines are professionally derived recommendations for practices in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic or persistent pain. They were developed utilizing a combination of evidence and consensus based techniques, to increase patient access to treatment, improve outcomes and appropriateness of care, and optimize cost-effectiveness. The guidelines include a discussion of their purpose, rationale, and importance, including the patient population served, the methodology and the pathophysiologic basis for intervention. Various interventional techniques will be discussed addressing the rationale for their use in chronic pain with analysis of the outcomes data and cost effectiveness. These guidelines do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations. It is expected that a provider will establish a plan of care on a case-by-case basis, taking into account an individual patient's medical condition, personal needs, and preferences, and the physician's experience. Based on an individual patient's needs, treatment different from that outlined here could be warranted.

### The use of spinal cord stimulation / neuromodulation in the management of chronic pain [^116yEqSy]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain causes a tremendous burden on the society in terms of economic factors and social costs. Rates of spinal surgery, especially spinal fusion, have increased exponentially over the past decade. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been one response to the management of pain, but it has been fraught with numerous catastrophic-related adverse effects. Clinically, spinal cord stimulation (SCS)/neuromodulation has been used in the management of chronic pain (especially spine-related pain) for more than two decades. More recent advances in this field have led to new theories and approaches in which SCS can be used in the management of chronic spine-related pain with precision and efficacy while minimizing adverse effects commonly seen with other forms of chronic pain treatment (eg, narcotics, injections, ablations). Narcotic medications have adverse effects of habituation, nausea, constipation, and the like. Injections sometimes lack efficacy and can have only limited duration of efficacy. Also, they can have adverse effects of cerebrospinal fluid leak, infection, and so on. Ablations can be associated with burning discomfort, lack of efficacy, recurrent symptoms, and infection. High-frequency stimulation, burst stimulation, tonic stimulation with broader paddles, and new stimulation targets such as the dorsal root ganglion hold promise for improved pain management via neuromodulation moving forward. Although a significant rate of complications with SCS technology are well described, this can be a useful tool in the management of chronic spine-related pain.

### Developments in minimally invasive surgical options for vertebral pain: basivertebral nerve ablation – A narrative review [^1151ViGP]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Historically, intervertebral disc degeneration has been the etiological target of chronic low back pain; however, disc degeneration is not necessarily directly associated with pain, and many other anatomical structures are potential etiologies. The vertebral endplates have been postulated to be a source of vertebral pain, where these endplates become particularly susceptible to increased expression of nociceptors and inflammatory proliferation carried by the basivertebral nerve (BVN), expressed on diagnostic imaging as Modic changes. This is useful diagnostic information that can help physicians to phenotype a subset of low back pain, which is known as vertebral pain, in order to directly target interventions, such as BVN ablation, to this significant pain generator. Therefore, this review describes the safety, efficacy, and the rationale behind the use of BVN ablation, a minimally invasive spinal intervention, for the treatment of vertebral pain. Our current literature review of available up-to-date publications utilizing BVN ablation in the treatment of vertebral pain suggests that there is limited, but moderate-quality evidence that this is an effective intervention for reduction of disability and improvement in function, at short- and long-term follow-up, in addition to limited moderate-quality evidence that BVN RFA is superior to conservative care for pain reduction, at least at 3-month follow-up. Our review concluded that there is a highly clinical and statistically significant treatment effect of BVN ablation for vertebral pain with clinically meaningful benefits in pain reduction, functional improvements, opioid dose reduction, and improved quality of life. There were no reported device-related patient deaths or serious AEs based on the available literature. BVN ablation is a safe, well-tolerated and clinically beneficial intervention for vertebral pain, when proper patient selection and surgical/procedural techniques are applied.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for rehabilitation of individuals with lower limb amputation [^113JRUhv]. DoD/VA (2024). High credibility.

Sidebar C: Pain management outlines perioperative, residual limb pain (RLP), and chronic phantom limb pain (PLP) guidance. For perioperative care, intraoperative placement of a perineural catheter for the post-operative delivery of local anesthetic can reduce pain following amputation surgery (Recommendation 4), and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against targeted muscle reinnervation or other peripheral nerve surgical management for phantom limb pain (PLP) (Recommendation 3). For RLP management, there is insufficient evidence for or against neurostimulation (e.g., peripheral nerve stimulation, or spinal cord stimulation) or neuroablation (e.g., cryoneurolysis, radio frequency ablation) interventions (Recommendation 21). For chronic PLP, guidance includes perineural catheter delivered anesthetic for the treatment of chronic severe phantom limb pain with functional impairment (Recommendation 22); consult for mirror therapy, alone or in combination with other therapies, to improve pain, function and quality of life for individuals with phantom limb pain (Recommendation 11); insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any systemic pharmacologic intervention for the management of phantom limb pain (Recommendation 23); and insufficient evidence for or against neurostimulation (e.g., peripheral nerve stimulation, or spinal cord stimulation) or neuroablation (e.g., cryoneurolysis, radio frequency ablation) interventions for the management of phantom limb pain (Recommendation 21).

### Consensus guidelines from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience for the use of 60-day peripheral nerve stimulation therapy. A NEURON living guideline project [^115gdbnc]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic LBP due to lumbar facet joint disease has been treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) rhizotomies of the medial branches of the dorsal rami. Lumbar RFA for facetogenic LBP is generally successful; however, there is variability in outcomes, and it remains a "de facto" neuro-destructive procedure.

Recently, interventional techniques for chronic LBP treatment have involved electrical modulation of the lumbar medial branch nerves. Evidence suggests that PNS of the lumbar medial branch nerves may be effective in improving pain and function in patients with chronic axial LBP, and both short and long-term follow-ups demonstrate good safety profiles. The proposed mechanism of action is primarily the modulation of the afferent pain signal and the disruption of central sensitization of pain. Secondarily, stimulation of efferent nerve signals to activate low back muscles, especially the multifidus muscle, has been implicated in the restorative action of the therapy. The rationale behind a 60-day trial of PNS for managing chronic lower back pain is complex and involves several factors:
Anatomical Landmarks: The anatomical landmarks for the placement of the PNS 60-day electrode are readily identified with fluoroscopy or ultrasound guidance (medial and inferior to the facet joint).
Preservation of Anatomy: The therapy does not involve a neuro-destructive procedure and preserves the anatomical integrity of the corresponding medial branches.
Extended Evaluation Period: The 60-day duration allows for a comprehensive assessment of pain relief and functionality, offering a better understanding of the treatment's long-term potential than traditional shorter trials.
Reduced Risk of Placebo Effects: A longer trial period reduces the likelihood of placebo effects that are more pronounced in shorter studies, providing more reliable data on the effectiveness of the treatment.
Sustained Improvement: Evidence suggests that even up to five months following treatment and removal of the temporary 60-day trial system, 93% of patients reported sustained and clinically meaningful improvements.
Minimized Surgical Risks: The 60-day trial system does not involve permanent implants, thus reducing or even eliminating complications associated with surgical procedures, such as infection, hardware failure, and the need for additional surgeries.
Minimized Anesthesia Risks: Because the 60-day trial system does not involve surgical procedures, anesthesia is not required, which reduces associated risks.
Establish an Alternative to Opioid Treatment: The use of 60-day PNS presents a viable non-pharmacological option for treating chronic back pain and offers several advantages over traditional opioid pain management strategies, particularly in avoiding the harmful long-term effects associated with opioid use.
Less Invasive Hardware: The smaller, less invasive introducer and electrode reduce tissue trauma, minimize post-procedural pain, and enhance overall patient comfort and satisfaction.
Flexible Treatment Pathway: If effective, the temporary trial can lead to consideration for a permanent spinal implant if clinically appropriate, offering patients a potential continuum of care based on their responses and individual clinical needs.
Prevention of Chronic Back Pain: A 60-day trial of PNS may serve as a preventive measure and can be employed preemptively as a prophylactic approach to reduce the risk of developing chronic back pain after surgery.
Objective Measurement of Outcomes: The structured data collection over 60 days allows for more robust statistical analysis and comparison with prior treatment modalities, aiding clinicians in making informed decisions.

### Radiofrequency for chronic knee pain: a literature review [^115QcPwv]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Indications and Contraindications for RF Therapy

RF therapy is a minimally invasive technique that is widely utilized in various pain management protocols. The prime candidates for this therapy are individuals suffering from chronic pain, particularly those who do not respond well to traditional drug treatments. For instance, patients with chronic knee osteoarthritis, postherpetic neuralgia, and other joint pain conditions may consider undergoing RF therapy. Additionally, this approach may alleviate the pain associated with certain internal diseases. The rationale for utilizing RF therapy in these patient populations lies in its ability to disrupt pain transmission pathways, thereby providing significant relief and improved quality of life for patients with persistent pain.

Despite its wide range of indications, RF therapy has certain contraindications and requires preventive measures. Patients with acute infections, bleeding disorders, malignancies, or allergies to local anesthetics are typically ineligible candidates for this treatment. Additionally, factors, such as pregnancy and implanted cardiac devices may influence the safety and efficacy of RF therapy. Prior to such an intervention, the doctor must conduct a thorough evaluation of the patient's medical history and physical examination results to ensure the safety of the treatment. Finally, careful consideration of indications and contraindications for RF therapy is essential in clinical practice to achieve the best therapeutic effect.

### Are chronic pain fellowships disguised as acute pain fellowships which manage chronic pain? How to recognize and repair [^112tndE4]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic Pain Management: A Continuum of Care

Effective chronic pain management necessitates a comprehensive approach encompassing understanding the patient's trajectory over extended periods, often months or years. In contrast to acute pain, which typically presents with a distinct onset and resolution, chronic pain is characterized by persistence. It is influenced by maladaptive behaviors, psychological stressors, and fluctuating social determinants of health. These factors can exacerbate symptoms and create a complex array of challenges for both patients and healthcare providers.

Notwithstanding this complexity, current Pain Medicine fellowships are structured to follow patients for a maximum of one year, providing limited opportunities for fellows to observe the long-term progression of chronic pain conditions involving psychological lability and its influence on the pain experience. This fragmented care model often limits fellows' abilities to understand the full spectrum of chronic pain management, including the durability or lack thereof of interventions and the evolution of pain conditions over time. For example, while fellows may become proficient in performing interventional procedures such as nerve blocks or spinal cord stimulation, they often lack the opportunity to observe patients' long-term outcomes or adjust care plans based on treatment efficacy and durability.

Chronic burn pain persists for 6 months or longer after the wound has healed, affecting the patient's quality of life and daily activities. Pharmacological treatments are essential in the treatment of chronic pain after burns, but interventional methods come to the fore in cases where there is no response to pharmacological treatments. Radiofrequency ablation is known as a safe, effective, and minimally invasive treatment for patients with intractable chronic pain. Various pain syndromes can be successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation however, there is no publication of chronic pain management associated with burn injury. Here, we first describe the successful management of chronic burn pain using radiofrequency ablation of the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve.

### Cervical facet joint pain and cervicogenic headache treated with radiofrequency ablation: a systematic review [^115zp981]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic neck pain is often multifactorial and is a leading cause of pain and disability. Cervical facet joint pain is a common cause of neck pain and, in addition to more conservative modalities, can be treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the respective medial branch nerves. Cervicogenic headaches are a frequent complaint in pain clinics in the United States and can be targeted via a similar procedural approach.

Objectives

We evaluated randomized controlled trials of cervical facet joint pain and cervicogenic headaches with the goal of establishing a current level of evidence for treating these etiologies of pain with RFA.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Methods

Database search, from inception through July 2021, was performed identifying randomized controlled trials for cervical medial branch RFA. Two reviewers independently evaluated the studies to identify those meeting criteria. Primary outcome measures included pain relief and duration of pain relief. Secondary outcome measures included function, sleep, mood, return to work, additional treatments, and complications.

Results

Four randomized controlled studies met inclusion criteria and were selected for this review, each demonstrated low risk of bias. Of these studies, 3 were unique with the fourth being a subgroup analysis. Primary outcome measures of pain relief and duration of relief were variable with successful relief ranging from 30% to 50% and median duration of pain relief also demonstrating a wide variety. Function and psychological distress were also variably reported and found variable relief to treatment with no difference between groups in 2 of the studies.

Limitations

Primary limitations of the review are the paucity of randomized controlled trials and the variability in measured outcome measures.

Conclusions

Based on this systematic review, efficacy of cervical facet RFA in treatment of chronic neck pain has Level II evidence.

### Chronic pain and bone-related pathologies: a narrative review [^114KwMUz]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Other Strategies

Other avenues of analgesic treatment are promising. For example, inhibitors of Cathepsin K, the proteolytic enzyme produced by osteoclasts, have been shown in animal models to exhibit modest chondroprotective and pain-reducing effects. Sclerostin, produced by osteocytes, prevents bone formation by inhibiting Wnt signaling in the cells: antisclerostin antibodies have been shown in animals to augment the size and the strength of the intervertebral disc by stimulating Wnt signaling, an interesting approach since intervertebral disc degeneration is a leading cause of low back pain. Likewise, the sequestration of NGF or the inhibition of TrkA channelsoffer new mechanistic possibilities, but can only be approved in humans if the profile of adverse effects is satisfactory. Plants used in traditional Chinese medicine have also been evaluated: for example, aconitine alleviates both cold and mechanical allodynia in cancer-induced bone pain via the regulation of TRPA1 receptor.

Surgery and interventional radiology also increasingly have their place in the management of pain, particularly in cancer. Surgery, alone or combined with radiation therapy, radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy are often the first step in pain management, especially in palliative care. Percutaneous cryotherapy is considered as a safe and effective technique in the treatment of benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumors, a first option and a valid alternative to radiofrequency ablation. For painful bone metastases, it is advised when other standard treatments (radiotherapy, bisphosphonate therapy, and chemotherapy) are no longer effective in controlling the disease or when they cannot be repeated. With the increased incidence of vertebral osteoporotic fractures, kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty techniques are treatments that may provide pain relief and functional recovery, although often associated with several side effects. A recent meta analysisshowed kyphoplasty to be superior to vertebroplasty in terms of reducing cement leakage and of increasing postoperative vertebral body height; but this is more costly and has a longer operative time.

### Pain outcomes after mechanochemical ablation vs cyanoacrylate adhesive for truncal ablation… [^1148qMMk]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Is there a difference in the amount of pain experienced when patients with primary saphenous vein incompetence are treated with mechanochemical ablation or cyanoacrylate adhesive. Findings In this randomized clinical trial, the median scores for maximum and average pain experienced were low and similar between the mechanochemical ablation and cyanoacrylate adhesive groups. Objective To assess pain scores immediately after truncal ablation using a 100-mm visual analog scale and 10-point number scale to compare pain-related outcomes following mechanochemical ablation vs cyanoacrylate adhesive treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants. Overall, the median maximum pain score experienced during truncal treatment was 23 mm on a VAS and 3 mm on the 10-point number scale. Distributions of the maximum pain scores for MOCA and CAE were similar. The median maximum pain scores measured by VAS for MOCA and CAE were 24 mm and 20 mm, respectively. The overall median average pain score experienced at the end of truncal treatment was 10. 5 mm on the VAS and 3 on the 10-point number scale. Distributions of the average pain scores for MOCA and CAE were similar. Table 3 summarizes all secondary outcomes. The overall median pain score reported in the 10 days postoperatively was 9. 75 mm on the VAS. The median pain score for MOCA was 10. 5 mm and CAE 7 mm. This difference was not statistically significantly. Overall, the median maximum pain score experienced at the end of adjunctive treatment was 23. 00 mm on the VAS and 5 on the number scale and the median average pain score was
18. 5 mm on the VAS and 3 on the number scale.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^113TH4Ms]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Radiofrequency treatment

Radiofrequency can be used to block the nerve by moderate heating (40°C) that does not result in thermocoagulation or can be used at a higher intensity, thereby heating the nerve resulting in ablation of the tissue. Radiofrequency can be done either at the peripheral level or at the vertebral level. A study investigated pulsed radiofrequency at the dorsal root ganglia with heating of the nerve to 40–42°C, demonstrating pain relief for up to 20 weeks. Another study investigated radiofrequency at a higher intensity, where the nerves were heated to 70–90°C, thereby causing thermocoagulation of the nerve, and demonstrated pain relief lasting up to 12 months.

Another option is to implant a device that stimulates the nerves (spinal cord stimulation), and this has been demonstrated to provide some relief up to 12 months. However, the current clinical use of radiofrequency or spinal implants is limited.

### Nerve blocks and neuroablative surgery for chronic pancreatitis [^115Uto3B]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Surgical decompressive procedures for "large-duct" chronic pancreatitis have been notably successful in relieving pain. However, management of patients with intractable pain from "small-duct" chronic pancreatitis has been difficult, often resulting in narcotic addiction and/or malnutrition from major pancreatic resection. In view of the disappointing results from extensive pancreatic resections in these cases, denervation of pancreatic sympathetic pain afferents has been suggested as an alternative. Although denervation procedures have been attempted at multiple anatomical levels, results have unfortunately been mixed. The observed variability in results has been attributed to poor patient selection, incomplete understanding of neurophysiology of pancreatic pain, and perhaps inadequate knowledge of pancreatic neuroanatomy. At present, the preferred form of neural ablation is splanchnicectomy. However, a consistent and reliable method for identifying candidates for splanchnicectomy is critical, as it is clinically difficult to distinguish true pancreatic pain from other nociceptive conditions masquerading as pancreatic pain. Differential epidural anesthesia (DEA) is a promising, safe test for initial evaluation and patient selection, although it is not as precise as sometimes claimed. Patients responding to sympathetic block during DEA seem to be the best candidates for operative sympathetic ablation. At the moment, the optimal surgical approach to splanchnic ablation, which offers the least morbid technique, most favorable results, and an attractive risk-benefit ratio, is bilateral thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy. More experience and longer follow-up will be necessary to evaluate this approach.

Conclusions

Considering an aging population, the dichotomy of both osteoarthritic disease and cardiovascular or central nervous system disease in the same patient is strikingly likely. Considering this, the need for both RFA ablation and implantable cardiac, neuro, or other devices will become more common in all settings. Adherence and attention to this guidance will improve safety and efficacy, thus leading to improved care.

### An international survey on the practice of lumbar radiofrequency ablation for management of zygapophyseal (facet)-mediated low back pain [^1152fyRT]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic low back pain is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Approximately 15–45% of chronic low back pain is due to facet joint arthropathy. Facet-mediated pain is typically related to osteoarthritis with nociception originating in the synovial membrane, hyaline cartilage, bone, or fibrous capsule of the facet joint. Due to the anatomic considerations and the overall size of the facet joints, there are minimally invasive and effective long-term treatment options for lumbar facet-mediated low back pain. Nociceptive sensation in the facet joints is carried by afferent fibers in the medial branch nerves of the lumbar dorsal rami (MBN). Thus, lesioning of the MBN by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is commonly used as a treatment for facet-mediated low back pain.

The use of RFA for the treatment of chronic pain was first described in 1931 when Kirschner described treatment of trigeminal neuralgia through radiofrequency to the gasserian ganglion. The first described application of RFA for lumbar spine facetogenic pain occurred in 1975 by Shealy. This led to a number of other physicians describing the use of RFA for the treatment of low back pain between 1976 and 1980. Over the 1990s and into the 2000s the RFA techniques were refined. Today, in many centers around the world, RFA is a very common long-term treatment of axial, mechanical, and facet-mediated low back pain. Furthermore, with advancements in technology, there are several modalities of RFA including traditional RFA, cooled RFA, pulsed RFA, and bipolar RFA, all of which have unique characteristics with advantages and disadvantages.

Despite the significant accumulation of evidence highlighting the efficacy of RFA for treatment of low back pain and the significant evolution of multiple modalities of RFA in clinical practice, there has been limited efforts to assess clinical practice variations in the United States and worldwide. The purpose of this clinical survey is to evaluate provider-related factors, procedural-related factors, and variation in clinical practice among pain provides worldwide that utilize lumbar RFA for treatment of chronic low back pain.

The past two decades have witnessed a surge in the use of cervical spine joint procedures including joint injections, nerve blocks and radiofrequency ablation to treat chronic neck pain, yet many aspects of the procedures remain controversial.

Methods

In August 2020, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the American Academy of Pain Medicine approved and charged the Cervical Joint Working Group to develop neck pain guidelines. Eighteen stakeholder societies were identified, and formal request-for-participation and member nomination letters were sent to those organizations. Participating entities selected panel members and an ad hoc steering committee selected preliminary questions, which were then revised by the full committee. Each question was assigned to a module composed of 4–5 members, who worked with the Subcommittee Lead and the Committee Chairs on preliminary versions, which were sent to the full committee after revisions. We used a modified Delphi method whereby the questions were sent to the committee en bloc and comments were returned in a non-blinded fashion to the Chairs, who incorporated the comments and sent out revised versions until consensus was reached. Before commencing, it was agreed that a recommendation would be noted with > 50% agreement among committee members, but a consensus recommendation would require ≥ 75% agreement.

Results

Twenty questions were selected, with 100% consensus achieved in committee on 17 topics. Among participating organizations, 14 of 15 that voted approved or supported the guidelines en bloc, with 14 questions being approved with no dissensions or abstentions. Specific questions addressed included the value of clinical presentation and imaging in selecting patients for procedures, whether conservative treatment should be used before injections, whether imaging is necessary for blocks, diagnostic and prognostic value of medial branch blocks and intra-articular joint injections, the effects of sedation and injectate volume on validity, whether facet blocks have therapeutic value, what the ideal cut-off value is for designating a block as positive, how many blocks should be performed before radiofrequency ablation, the orientation of electrodes, whether larger lesions translate into higher success rates, whether stimulation should be used before radiofrequency ablation, how best to mitigate complication risks, if different standards should be applied to clinical practice and trials, and the indications for repeating radiofrequency ablation.

Conclusions

Cervical medial branch radiofrequency ablation may provide benefit to well-selected individuals, with medial branch blocks being more predictive than intra-articular injections. More stringent selection criteria are likely to improve denervation outcomes, but at the expense of false-negatives (ie, lower overall success rate). Clinical trials should be tailored based on objectives, and selection criteria for some may be more stringent than what is ideal in clinical practice.

Radiofrequency neurotomy for chronic low back pain of facet joint origin — based on 6 positive randomized trials and 10 positive observational studies, the evidence for conventional radiofrequency neurotomy is good for short- and long-term relief; by contrast, based on one randomized trial and one observational study meeting inclusion criteria, the evidence is limited for pulsed radiofrequency neurotomy.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^114crNdz]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Radiofrequency facet joint denervation in chronic low back pain (LBP) shows short-term functional improvement but uncertain efficacy; the treatment group had significantly greater improvement in Roland–Morris scores at 4 weeks with no Oswestry or VAS differences, and no between-group differences at 12 weeks. The work group downgraded the study and stated it provides Level II evidence that patients reporting relief within one week of an intra-articular steroid injection and receiving radiofrequency ablation perpendicular to the nerve report no improvement in pain at 3 and 12 months versus sham radiofrequency denervation.

Other techniques

Radiofrequency ablation

Although there is only one report about the application of radiofrequency ablation for patients with ACNES, the published studies regarding the other causes of intercostal neuralgia (such as blunt trauma, surgery, and postherpetic neuralgia) reported good results after thermal radiofrequency ablation of the nerve itself or of the relevant dorsal root ganglion (DRG).–

Tellez Villajos et al, published a case of ACNES management with radiofrequency ablation of the DRG at the level of T11–T12 with good results. Stolker et aland van Kleef and Spaansused pulsed radiofrequency in other cases of intercostal neuralgia and observed a significant reduction in pain, while another study reported better results with the pulsed radiofrequency of the DRG. The classic thermal radiofrequency ablation (performed at 80°C for 90 seconds under fluoroscopic guidance and after sensory and motor testing) was also effective in six patients suffering from traumatic intercostal neuralgia from the fourth to the twelfth thoracic nerve level. In both techniques, postprocedural pain and pneumothorax were the most frequent complications. There is also another case report presented by Birthi et al, reporting a patient with chronic abdominal pain who was treated with bilateral pulsed radiofrequency at the level of T10–T11. However, this technique has not been tested in a systematic manner or compared with other treatment options, and its long-term results are unknown.

However, Van Kleef et alin their evidence-based guidelines for interventional pain management, rated both the pulsed and the thermal radiofrequency approaches of the DRG in the cases of intercostal neuralgia as 2C+ (effectiveness only demonstrated in observational studies). However, ACNES has a different etiology; the mechanical irritation of the nerve in its peripheral course is the main cause of injury, but it is still an intercostal neuralgia, and the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation in the refractory cases, when other interventional techniques or surgery fails to provide pain relief, is yet to be defined.

Neuromodulation techniques

The application of neuromodulation techniques, especially peripheral or spinal nerve stimulation has not yet been tried in the therapy of ACNES. However, it might be effective in the management of the disease after the failure of all interventional and surgical therapies, as it has been found to be effective in other forms of neuropathic pain of different origin and etiology. The exact role of nerve stimulation in ACNES is yet to be unraveled, as there is no current evidence to support its use.

### Application of spinal ablative techniques for the treatment of benign chronic painful conditions: history, methods, and outcomes [^112Sd7AL]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

The literature on current neuroablative techniques for treating benign chronic painful conditions is comprehensively reviewed.

Objective

To provide the reader with an understanding of the indications, techniques, and outcomes for the various ablative procedures used to treat chronic pain syndromes.

Summary Of Background Data

Neuromodulatory techniques are rapidly supplanting the traditional neuroablative procedures used to treat many types of pain.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was conducted for each of the following procedures: radiofrequency facet denervation, cordotomy, myelotomy, sympathectomy, DREZotomy, rhizotomy, and ganglionectomy. In the review of each article, special attention given to the outcome, length of follow-up, complications, and number of patients. Summaries of this data were compiled to provided historical perspective, current techniques, indications, and outcomes for each of the aforementioned procedures. The outcomes cited for each procedure generally represent the data from the three or four largest series with adequate follow-up length.

Results

The aforementioned procedures have 30% to 90% success rates, with success defined as at least a 50% reduction in perceived pain. These results tend to diminish with time. However, most are associated with a significant degree of morbidity and relatively high complication rates. In addition, many of the techniques lead to deafferentation pain syndromes.

Conclusions

Ablative spinal techniques offer pain relief for many patients, but the use of these methods should be considered carefully in the light of available nondestructive procedures that may achieve similar goals with potentially lower morbidities.

### Cooled radiofrequency ablation provides prolonged pain relief compared to traditional radiofrequency ablation: a real-world, large retrospective clinical comparison from a single practice [^1129jGjm]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Genicular radiofrequency ablation is an established therapy for chronic knee pain. An analysis comparing different probe sizes and technologies has not yet been undertaken for this indication. This large retrospective, comparison study from a single-center comprehensive pain management practice aims to do that.

Methods

Outcomes of 170 patients who underwent traditional radiofrequency ablation (tRFA) for chronic knee pain were compared to 170 consecutive patients who received cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) with similar (p = 0.5) pre-procedural pain scores.

Results

The VAS pain score at the first post-procedure visit at 4–6 weeks decreased to 5.07 ± 2.8 cm for tRFA and to 4.26 ± 3.2 cm for CRFA (p < 0.001 for both from baseline). The difference was profound and significantly better in the favor of CRFA (p < 0.001) as the duration of reduction of pain scores by greater than 50% was 2.6 months for tRFA and 11.1 months for CRFA. There were only 15 patients (8.8%) who continued to receive > 50% of pain relief in tRFA at 12 months, as opposed to 78 (46%) at 12 months for CRFA. We compared the initial outcomes and long-term pain relief. Long-term outcomes were better for the bigger lesion size treatment group patients.

Conclusion

We conclude that the duration and intensity of pain relief were of a greater magnitude after the larger diameter probe cooled RFA.

Radiofrequency Ablation in Relieving Pain in Patients With Bones MetastasesClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells and may help to relieve pain caused by bone metastases. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation in relieving pain in patients who have bone metastases. OBJECTIVES:
- Determine the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation, in terms of pain relief at 4 weeks, in patients with painful bone metastases.
- Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.
- Compare the change in pain interference with daily life and analgesic use at 4 weeks vs baseline in patients treated with this regimen.
- Determine the time to recurrence of worst pain in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive radiofrequency ablation to targeted tumor on day 0. Patients who achieve a reduction in worst pain of at least 2 points within 4–8 weeks but experience recurring pain at the RFA site or are diagnosed with a new painful lesion within 4–24 weeks receive 1 additional treatment to the recurring or new site. Pain, analgesic use, and quality of life are assessed at baseline, on day 1, weekly for 4 weeks, and then every 2 weeks for 20 weeks. Patients are followed for 6 months beyond the last RFA treatment.

### A systematic review: current and future directions of dorsal root ganglion therapeutics to treat chronic pain [^112AdF7g]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of the study was to systematically review the historical therapeutics for chronic pain care directed at the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and to identify future trends and upcoming treatment strategies.

Methods

A literature search on bibliographic resources, including EMBASE, PubMed Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews from literature published from 1966 to December 1, 2012 to identify studies and treatments directed at the DRG to treat chronic pain, and was limited to the English language. Case series, case reports, and preclinical work were excluded. Information on emerging technologies and pharmacologics were captured separately, as they did not meet the inclusion criteria.

Results

The literature review yielded three current clinical treatment strategies: ganglionectomy, conventional radiofrequency treatment of the dorsal root ganglion, and pulsed radiofrequency treatment of the DRG. Seven studies were identified utilizing ganglionectomy, 14 for conventional radiofrequency, and 16 for pulsed radiofrequency. Electrical stimulation and novel therapeutic delivery strategies have been proposed and are in development.

Conclusions

Despite a robust understanding of the DRG and its importance in acute nociception, as well as the development and maintenance of chronic pain, relatively poor evidence exists regarding current therapeutic strategies. Novel therapies like electrical and pharmacologic strategies are on the horizon, and more prospective study is required to better qualify the role of the DRG in chronic pain care.
