## Question

glud1 mild hypoglycemia adolescent female

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage mild hypoglycemia in an adolescent female with suspected GLUD1-related hyperinsulinism–hyperammonemia syndrome, including when to suspect the diagnosis, what tests to order, how to interpret results, and how to treat and monitor long term. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypoglycemia and documenting hyperinsulinism. Then, I should verify the presence of persistent mild hyperammonemia and exclude urea cycle disorders. Next, I will consider the genetic differential and prioritize GLUD1 testing. After that, I need to outline acute and chronic management, including diazoxide, dietary strategies, and when to trial off therapy. Finally, I should plan neurodevelopmental surveillance and family counseling, while double-checking for pitfalls like mosaicism and alternative diagnoses that could mimic this phenotype [^112mFpMe] [^112FfaNg].

> Let me first confirm the hypoglycemia phenotype and its severity; in adolescents, neuroglycopenic symptoms typically emerge below about 55 mg/dL, so I need to document symptomatic episodes with low plasma glucose and relief with correction, ideally capturing a critical sample during a monitored fast or spontaneous event to meet Whipple's triad and to quantify insulin dynamics, because milder presentations can be subtle and intermittent in GLUD1-HI/HA [^1125rQWK] [^116RDJNX].

> Wait, let me verify the biochemical signature of hyperinsulinism; I should check plasma insulin, C-peptide, free fatty acids, and β-hydroxybutyrate at the time of hypoglycemia, expecting inappropriately elevated insulin and C-peptide with suppressed ketones and FFA, and I should calculate the glucose infusion rate if hospitalized, since a need above roughly 8–10 mg/kg/min supports hyperinsulinism even when absolute insulin is not strikingly high, which is not uncommon in milder GLUD1 presentations [^115v3rp4].

> I need to ensure I do not miss the hyperammonemia clue; persistent mild hyperammonemia in the 60–200 μmol/L range alongside hyperinsulinism strongly suggests GLUD1-HI/HA, but I should double-check that ammonia is measured on multiple occasions, fasting and postprandial, because unlike urea cycle defects, the ammonia elevation here is typically stable and not responsive to protein restriction or ammonia-scavenging therapy, which helps distinguish the two entities [^1117BipD] [^1171RG7q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the broader genetic differential for adolescent-onset hyperinsulinism, including dominant ABCC8/KCNJ11 variants, GCK, HNF4A/HNF1A, HADH, and SLC16A1, noting that GLUD1 variants are a leading cause of diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism and that childhood-onset GLUD1 cases cluster in the catalytic domain (exons 6–7) more often than infancy-onset cases, which may correlate with milder, later presentations, so I will prioritize GLUD1 sequencing while keeping a multi-gene panel in reserve if GLUD1 is negative [^111wUyZf] [^113bCzKx] [^113BfK3T].

> Let me consider provocative testing; a leucine or protein load can unmask protein-sensitive hypoglycemia in GLUD1-HI/HA, but I should confirm that this is done in a supervised setting with close glucose monitoring, and I must remember that some patients show fasting and protein-induced hypoglycemia while others are predominantly postprandial, so a negative leucine test does not exclude the diagnosis when the biochemical triad is present [^111Md6uR] [^112g4chP].

> Next, I should review acute management; for symptomatic hypoglycemia, I will treat with intravenous dextrose bolus and infusion per Pediatric Endocrine Society guidance, and I can use glucagon 0.5–1 mg IV/IM/SC as a temporizing bridge to raise glucose quickly, but I need to ensure a plan to transition to disease-specific therapy once stabilized to avoid recurrent neuroglycopenia [^116fjBFi].

> I will now examine chronic therapy; diazoxide is first-line and typically effective in GLUD1-HI/HA, often at 5–10 mg/kg/day divided BID–TID, so I should initiate diazoxide with baseline labs and monitor for fluid retention, hypertrichosis, and bone marrow suppression, and I should titrate to maintain fasting glucose above about 70 mg/dL while allowing for a reasonable fasting duration, recognizing that many GLUD1 patients are diazoxide-responsive and some can wean over time [^112mFpMe].

> But wait, what if diazoxide alone is insufficient; I should confirm adherence and adequate dosing, then layer in dietary strategies such as frequent, carbohydrate-consistent meals and, in some patients, a leucine-restricted or protein-modified diet, because reducing leucine load can mitigate GDH-driven insulin secretion, and I should coordinate with a pediatric dietitian to balance growth needs with hypoglycemia prevention [^112g4chP] [^111Md6uR].

> I should double-check for spontaneous remission; case series document that some children with GLUD1-HI/HA experience remission in mid-childhood, so if control remains excellent on a low diazoxide dose, a carefully supervised trial off therapy with close home glucose monitoring and fasting tolerance testing is reasonable, but I need to ensure readiness to resume treatment if hypoglycemia recurs [^115KCntF].

> Next, I should review neurodevelopmental surveillance; seizures and learning difficulties occur in a substantial minority even with good glycemic control, so I will arrange baseline neurocognitive testing and epilepsy screening if there are spells, and I will maintain a low threshold for EEG if there are absence or myoclonic events, because non-hypoglycemic seizures have been reported in GLUD1-HI/HA and early recognition changes management [^115iSjjc] [^111irdmy].

> I need to ensure family counseling and cascade testing; GLUD1-HI/HA is usually autosomal dominant with variable expressivity, so parents and siblings should be offered genetic testing, and I should explain that de novo mutations are common and that prenatal or preimplantation testing may be considered in future pregnancies, while also discussing the benign nature of the mild hyperammonemia and the importance of early recognition in at-risk infants [^1171RG7q] [^114mawxG] [^114fcKU3].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have not overlooked mimics; in adolescents with intermittent hypoglycemia, I must consider insulinoma, factitious insulin use, and exercise-induced hyperinsulinism due to SLC16A1 variants, and I should confirm that C-peptide is inappropriately elevated with endogenous insulin to exclude exogenous insulin, using a supervised fast and imaging selectively if the biochemical picture is atypical or if diazoxide fails [^112FfaNg] [^115v3rp4].

> Finally, I will summarize the diagnostic anchor points to avoid premature closure; the triad of recurrent symptomatic hypoglycemia with inappropriately elevated insulin/C-peptide, persistent mild hyperammonemia unresponsive to protein restriction, and a compatible genetic variant in GLUD1 establishes the diagnosis of HI/HA, and in an adolescent with this profile, I should proceed with GLUD1 sequencing and initiate diazoxide-based therapy while planning for dietary support, neurodevelopmental follow-up, and family screening to optimize outcomes and prevent delays in care [^1171RG7q] [^1117BipD] [^112mFpMe].

GLUD1-related mild hypoglycemia in adolescent females presents with **fasting and protein-sensitive hypoglycemia** and persistent mild hyperammonemia, typically without neonatal macrosomia or severe symptoms [^1117BipD] [^111Md6uR] [^114j1xHS]. Diagnosis relies on documenting hyperinsulinism with suppressed ketones during hypoglycemia and confirming a **GLUD1 variant** on genetic testing [^1125rQWK] [^111wUyZf]. Management is **diazoxide-responsive** in most cases, with adjuncts such as frequent feeds, a leucine-restricted diet, and nighttime cornstarch; prognosis is favorable with treatment, but neurocognitive risks persist if hypoglycemia is unrecognized or undertreated [^112mFpMe] [^112g4chP] [^115iSjjc].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Age of onset**: Often in infancy or early childhood, but milder cases may present in adolescence [^112Xk1q5] [^112BxZPJ].
- **Symptoms**: Fasting and protein-sensitive hypoglycemia, seizures, lethargy, and neurodevelopmental issues [^1117BipD] [^115iSjjc].
- **Hyperammonemia**: Persistent mild elevation (usually 60–150 µmol/L), often asymptomatic [^1117BipD] [^114fcKU3].
- **Birth weight**: Typically normal; neonatal macrosomia is uncommon [^111oDvJf] [^114j1xHS].

---

## Pathophysiology

GLUD1 encodes glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes glutamate oxidation to α-ketoglutarate, generating ATP and triggering insulin secretion [^111Md6uR] [^113SQDqE]. Activating GLUD1 mutations reduce GTP inhibition, increasing GDH activity and causing **excess insulin release**, especially with protein intake [^1117BipD] [^111Md6uR]. In the liver, increased GDH activity drives ammonia production, causing **persistent mild hyperammonemia** [^1117BipD] [^117Qoukv].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis requires a **multimodal approach**:

| **Diagnostic step** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Clinical history | Recurrent fasting/protein-sensitive hypoglycemia, mild hyperammonemia |
| Biochemical testing | - Hyperinsulinism (inappropriately elevated insulin/C-peptide) <br/> - Suppressed ketones during hypoglycemia <br/> - Mild hyperammonemia (60–150 µmol/L) [^notfound] |
| Genetic testing | Pathogenic GLUD1 variants (commonly in exons 6, 7, 11, 12) [^1117BipD] [^113bCzKx] |
| Provocative testing | Leucine or protein load may trigger hypoglycemia (not routinely required) [^111Md6uR] [^112g4chP] |

---

## Management strategies

Management aims to maintain normoglycemia and prevent neuroglycopenic injury:

- **Diazoxide**: First-line therapy; opens KATP channels to suppress insulin secretion; effective in most GLUD1 cases [^114hwQ2j] [^114fcKU3].
- **Dietary measures**: Frequent feeds, leucine-restricted diet, and nighttime cornstarch to reduce protein-induced hypoglycemia [^112g4chP] [^111Md6uR].
- **Adjunctive therapies**: Octreotide or sirolimus for diazoxide-unresponsive cases (rare in GLUD1) [^112g5HEX] [^112CZSaM].
- **Monitoring**: Regular home glucose checks, periodic ammonia levels, and neurodevelopmental assessments [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

With appropriate therapy, **glycemic control is typically excellent** and hypoglycemia often resolves spontaneously in adolescence or early adulthood [^115KCntF]. Persistent neurodevelopmental issues, including learning difficulties and seizures, may occur if hypoglycemia is unrecognized or undertreated [^115iSjjc] [^114emguU]. Long-term complications are uncommon with good control, though diabetes may develop after pancreatectomy in other HI forms (not typical in GLUD1) [^112g5HEX] [^112CZSaM].

---

## Genetic counseling

GLUD1-HI/HA is **autosomal dominant** with variable expressivity; ~70% are de novo, and ~30% are inherited [^116csaz1] [^1117BipD]. Parents and siblings should undergo genetic testing to identify at-risk relatives, and prenatal testing is available for families with known mutations [^notfound].

---

GLUD1-related mild hypoglycemia in adolescent females is characterized by fasting/protein-sensitive hypoglycemia with mild hyperammonemia, normal birth weight, and a favorable response to diazoxide and dietary therapy. Early recognition and **targeted management** are essential to prevent neurocognitive complications.

### Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia: think of hyperinsulinism / hyperammonemia (HI / HA) syndrome caused by mutations in the GLUD1 gene [^1171RG7q]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome (HI/HA) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder presenting with hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia. It is caused by activating mutations in the GLUD1 gene.

Case Reports

Three patients from two different centers, a 14-month-old female, a 28-year-old female (mother of the first patient) from Toronto and an unrelated 2.5-year-old male from Vienna, presented with multiple episodes of seizures associated with hypoglycemia.

Results

All patients had mild to moderate hypoglycemia, inappropriate insulin levels and mild hyperammonemia, thus suggesting a disorder of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Molecular genetic testing of the GLUD1 gene identified heterozygous mutations in all patients (patient 1 and her mother a novel c.1526G > C mutation; patient 3 a known c.809C > G mutation).

Conclusion

We present three new patients with GDH caused by heterozygous mutation in the GLUD1 gene. Mild hyperammonemia and inappropriately elevated insulin levels should suggest a GLUD1 mutation. Early onset hypoglycemia associated with seizures, and especially a good response to diazoxide treatment, should include this disorder in the differential diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.

Hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia (HI/HA) syndrome, often characterized by recurrent symptomatic hypoglycemia and persistent hyperammonemia, is the second most frequent cause of the congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). Here, we reported a patient with normal birth weight, repeated seizures, untreatable hypoglycemia, and persistent, mild hyperammonemia. The genetic diagnosis revealed that the patient carried a heterozygous, de novo missense mutation (N410I, c.1401A > T) in the glutamate dehydrogenase 1 gene (GLUD1). The patient was treated with diazoxide, which significantly alleviated the hypoglycemia. CT and MRI brain scanning at different developmental stages revealed large-scale brain damage in the front lobe. Severe neurodevelopment deficits were identified in the follow-up.

Hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia (HI/HA) syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by recurrent hypoglycemia and persistent mild elevation of plasma ammonia. HI/HA syndrome is one of the more common forms of congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), caused by activating mutations within the GLUD1 gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). We report here on monozygotic twin girls presented with fasting- and protein-induced hypoglycemia and mild persistent hyperammonemia. Genetic analysis revealed that both girls were heterozygous for a novel missense mutation within exon 11 [c.1499A > T, p.(R443W)] of the GLUD1 gene. Despite early treatment with diazoxide and a low protein diet, they both developed non-hypoglycemic seizures in early childhood followed by cognitive impairment. In addition to their clinical course, a review of the literature on HI/HA syndrome is provided.

### Biochemical evaluation of an infant with hypoglycemia resulting from a novel de novo mutation of the GLUD1 gene and hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome [^111Md6uR]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome (HI/HA) (OMIM 606762), the second most common form of congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is associated with activating missense mutations in the GLUD1 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Patients present with recurrent symptomatic postprandial hypoglycemia following protein-rich meals (leucine-sensitive hypoglycemia) as well as fasting hypoglycemia accompanied by asymptomatic elevations of plasma ammonia. In contrast to other forms of CHI, the phenotype is reported to be milder thus escaping recognition for the first few months of life. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to avoid the neurodevelopmental consequences including epilepsy and learning disabilities which are prevalent in this disorder. We report an infant presenting with afebrile seizures secondary to hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia resulting from a novel de novo mutation of the GLUD1 gene.

Genotype Associations Could Not Fully Explain the Variability in Ages at Diagnosis of HI

Mosaic variants were more common in the childhood-onset cohort than the infancy-onset cohort (10% vs 0.9% (n = 4/42 vs 11/1248), P < 0.00001, Table 1). However, 81% (n = 34/42) of variants in the childhood-onset group had been detected in individuals diagnosed with HI in infancy (Table 4), suggesting that the underlying genetics was not the sole factor influencing the age at diagnosis.

Table 4.
Variants reported as causative in individuals clinically diagnosed with hyperinsulinism in childhood

We next investigated the mode of inheritance of ABCC8 -HI, as dominantly acting variants can cause a milder form of diazoxide-responsive disease compared with recessively inherited ABCC8 variants. There was no difference in the proportion of dominantly acting variants within each group (infancy cohort n = 107/907 vs childhood cohort n = 2/12, P = 0.6) (Table 1).

For GLUD1, we investigated whether the position of the variant had an impact on the age at diagnosis of HI, due to previous reports that the location of variants impacted the clinical presentation of disease. We found that the GLUD1 variants identified in the childhood-onset cohort clustered in the catalytic domain (exons 6 and 7) of the enzyme (n = 11/16, 69%), while those found in the infancy-onset cohort clustered in the allosteric domain (exons 10, 11, and 12) (n = 34/56, 61%, P = 0.04) (Table 1). This association was, however, not significant after correction for multiple comparisons.

### Hyperinsulinism hyperammonaemia (HI / HA) syndrome due to GLUD1 mutation: phenotypic variations ranging from late presentation to spontaneous resolution [^115KCntF]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background The hyperinsulinism/hyperammonaemia (HI/HA) syndrome is the second most common cause of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia, caused by activating mutations in GLUD1. In this article, we report a series of three unrelated patients with HI/HA syndrome who demonstrated variable phenotypes, ranging from delayed presentation to spontaneous resolution of hypoglycaemia, thereby expanding the current knowledge and understanding of GLUD1 mutations. Case presentation This paper is a retrospective analysis of patients with HI/HA syndrome who demonstrated a variable disease course. Patient 1 presented with hypoglycaemic seizures at the age of 7 months and was diagnosed with HI/HA syndrome. Patient 2, a 5-year-old boy, on anti-convulsants since 8 months of age, was diagnosed with HI/HA at the age of 4 years. Patient 3, an 11-year-old girl with a history of transient neonatal hypoglycaemia, was diagnosed with HI/HA at the age of 12 months following evaluation for absence seizures. Patients 1 and 2 had raised ammonia levels, whilst patient 3 had normal ammonia level. The genetic analysis in all three patients confirmed GLUD1 mutation. Good glycaemic control was observed in all following diazoxide treatment. All patients have learning difficulties. Patient 1 demonstrated spontaneous resolution of hypoglycaemia at the age of 8 years, enabling discontinuation of diazoxide. Conclusions The cases highlight the diagnostic challenges in HI/HA syndrome due to a highly variable presentation. Knowledge of variable phenotypes would enable early diagnosis, thereby decreasing the risk of long-term neurological damage. Spontaneous resolution of hyperinsulinism could occur, and it is important to consider a trial off diazoxide therapy especially if the patients are on a small dose of diazoxide.

Delayed Diagnosis Was Not the Main Driver of Childhood Diagnoses

As we did not detect significant variant-level associations to explain the variability in age at diagnosis, we next investigated whether a delayed diagnosis of HI was likely in those presenting in childhood. Case note review revealed that 5 individuals within the childhood-onset group (9.5%, n = 4/42) had experienced hypoglycemic episodes or seizures during infancy but had not received a clinical diagnosis of HI at that time (Table 4). We next compared corrected birth weights, since birth weight is a surrogate marker for insulin secretion in utero, where it acts as a growth factor. The childhood-onset cohort had a significantly lower median birth weight than the infancy-onset cohort (Z-score: −0.3 vs 1.4, P < 0.00001, Table 1 and Fig. 3A). These differences appeared to be driven by ABCC8 -HI (Z: −0.5 vs 1.5, P = 0.0004, Table 1 and Fig. 3B). The median birthweight in the childhood-onset cohort was similar to the population average, providing no evidence of increased insulin secretion in utero. This supports the theory that for the majority of cases, it was not undetected hypoglycemia that resulted in the later age at diagnosis.

### Non-surgical treatment may be appropriate for most Chinese children with monogenic congenital hyperinsulinism based on a retrospective study of 121 patients [^114fcKU3]. Pediatric Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients carrying ABCC8 / KCNJ11 (ATP-sensitive potassium channel [KATP]) variants exhibit early onset and refractory, although the association between symptom severity and pancreatic islet function remains unclear. Biallelic recessive KATP variants manifest as diffuse CHI, whereas focal CHI typically results from inheriting paternal variants at 11p15.1 with the loss of maternal allele. Given the high cure rate of surgery for focal CHI, surgical intervention is recommended in appreciable quantity of previous researches. Some evidence suggests conservative treatments can decrease the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes for diffuse CHI, with some patients experiencing spontaneous remission during long-term follow-up. In addition, occurrence of postsurgery endocrine and exocrine dysfunction suggests a trend towards conservative therapy over surgery. Activating variants of GLUD1 represent another common cause of monogenic CHI, with affected children typically being feeding-responsive and/or diazoxide-responsive. Unlike urea cycle defects, patients often display mild to moderate elevated serum ammonia without symptoms. Approximately one-third of affected children exhibit neurological disorders such as seizures and behavioral disturbances, even those maintained blood glucose well.

In this current cohort, we investigated the clinical and genetic characteristics of 121 children with monogenic CHI over the past 16 years. Motivated by our previous research, the objective is to explore unique genotype–phenotype correlations within the Chinese population on the basis of an enlarged sample size.

Treatment algorithms for the management of congenital hyperinsulinism

A management plan is summarized in Fig. 6. Iterative variations of this decision model will depend on local factors, such as method and turnaround of genetic analysis, medical insurance requirements and comorbidities. Exceptions to the diazoxide response‐guided gene mutation analysis include syndromic associations, possibility of HNF4A, consanguinity and family history of genetic CHI. After initial glycaemic stabilization, the assessment of genetic aetiology and diazoxide responsiveness are key steps that determine future clinical management strategies. Good response to an initial diazoxide dose < 10 mg/kg/day generally indicates satisfactory KATP channel activity and therefore indicates the possibility of dose reduction over time. In those in whom there is continued requirement for diazoxide (even at a low dose) after 6 months of treatment, gene analysis should be considered to identify non‐KATP genetic forms of CHI such as GLUD1.

In contrast to other conditions, where genetic aetiology does not lead to immediate management changes, in CHI the finding of a paternal heterozygous mutation acting in a recessive manner is a clue that hypoglycaemia may be attributable to a focal lesion in the pancreas. While the additional genetic event of silencing of maternal alleles cannot be ascertained prior to surgery, the finding of a recessively acting paternal mutation should prompt 18‐fluoro‐dopa PET scanning 46. However, in some instances where the mutation is novel, it is not possible to predict recessive or dominant inheritance, the latter being associated with diffuse CHI. Another caveat to the genetic strategy delineating focal and non‐focal CHI is the reliance on blood lymphocyte DNA extraction; in the event of a mosaic mutation or a mutation occurring in low frequency, lymphocyte genomic DNA testing may fail to identify a mutation. 18‐fluorodopa PET‐CT (or PET‐MRI) scanning could therefore be considered in those in whom mutations are either uncertain or cannot be identified but continue to require diazoxide/somatostatin receptor analogue treatment without dose reduction after 1 year of diagnosis. In centres without facilities for 18‐fluorodopa PET‐CT scanning, medical therapy should be continued; however, in those in whom focal CHI remains a possibility, the aim should be to refer to a centre with scan facilities before considering pancreatectomy.

### Intractable absence seizures in hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome [^111irdmy]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

A girl with intractable absence seizures and facial myoclonia at age 7 years was eventually diagnosed with hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome because of hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinism, hyperammonemia, and the results of an oral l-leucine loading test. Her seizures occurred even during periods of relatively normal blood glucose levels, and were completely suppressed by diazoxide treatment only. Her diagnosis of hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome was confirmed by a loss of sensitivity of glutamate dehydrogenase for guanosine 5'-triphosphate. Genetic studies identified the I444M mutation in the GLUD1 gene, which encodes glutamate dehydrogenase. This case illustrates the complex relationship between seizures and hypoglycemia in hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome that can create diagnostic difficulties. The possibility of hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome should be considered in patients with refractory absence seizures with myoclonia.

Discussion

We identified pathogenic variants in 69.8% of individuals diagnosed with HI before the age of 16 years. This represents the minimal prevalence of monogenic HI in our cohort, since only the most commonly affected genes were screened. We further showed that HI is monogenic in a significant number of cases with childhood-onset disease, with pathogenic variants in GLUD1 being the most common etiology.

The pickup rate was lower but still substantial in childhood-diagnosed HI, with the monogenic cause identified in 74.5% of individuals diagnosed in infancy compared to 24.3% of individuals diagnosed in childhood. The age at diagnosis of HI in our genetically solved childhood-onset cohort ranged from 1 to 13 years, with 75% diagnosed between ages 1 and 2.7 years (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Although previous studies have separated individuals based on age at diagnosis of HI, this is the first study to report the prevalence of known variants within these age groups.

Some differences in the genetic subtypes of HI were observed between the infancy and childhood groups, with disease-causing variants in 6 genes identified exclusively within the infancy-onset cohort. Although it is possible that our childhood-onset cohort was underpowered to detect these rare forms of HI, we were also unable to find reports of childhood-onset cases in the literature. This suggests that variants in these genes predominantly cause early-onset HI. The only gene in which a variant was found exclusively in the childhood-onset cohort was TRMT10A. This represents the second reported case of a disease-causing TRMT10A variant in a child referred for HI genetic testing.

We found that mosaic variants were more common in the childhood-onset than the infancy-onset cohort (P < 0.00001). These variants were detected from blood samples, and we were unable to test pancreatic DNA. It seems likely that in these individuals there is a mixed population of cells within the pancreas, in which some cells do not harbor the disease-causing variant, which impacts the severity and age at presentation of HI. No further significant associations between the genotype and age at presentation of disease were identified.

### Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia diagnosed in childhood can Be monogenic [^111aUXQK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by inappropriate insulin secretion despite low blood glucose. Persistent HI can be monogenic, with 38% to 79% of individuals found to have a pathogenic variant in one of the known disease-causing genes. The variability in these pickup rates will in part reflect how comprehensively the known genes are screened as well as the clinical features of the populations studied.

Biochemical evidence of insulin-induced hypoglycemia is a prerequisite for genetic testing; however, there are no established criteria for the age at diagnosis of HI. This is in contrast to other monogenic disorders of insulin secretion such as neonatal diabetes mellitus and maturity-onset diabetes of the young where the age at presentation of disease is a main criterion for genetic testing.

For monogenic HI, hypoglycemia is typically diagnosed in infancy (before 12 months of age) with the most severe cases presenting within the first few days of life. In these individuals, disease-causing variants in the KATP channel genes, ABCC8 and KCNJ11, are most common. Individuals with disease-causing variants in other commonly reported HI genes, such as GLUD1, often present later in infancy or, more rarely, in childhood or adulthood.

The wide range in age at clinical presentation seen within the same monogenic forms of HI has limited its usefulness in helping to guide genetic testing of this disorder. Furthermore, no studies have systematically screened the known genes in individuals diagnosed outside of infancy, and the large, published cohorts often report limited data on the ages at presentation of HI. Together, this makes it difficult to accurately assess how likely monogenic HI is when diagnosed outside of infancy.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of monogenic HI in a large cohort of individuals clinically diagnosed with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia before 16 years of age. We then compared the pickup rates for a pathogenic variant in those diagnosed before and after 12 months of age and sought to identify genotype-phenotype relationships that could explain the variability in age at presentation of disease within the common genetic subgroups.

### Clinical and molecular data from 61 Brazilian cases of congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [^116on9pt]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Mutations of the GLUD1 gene were detected in 17% of the total series and in 29% of the cases in which no mutations were detected for the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes.

The GCK gene was analyzed in the 23 cases in which no mutation was detected in the ABCC8, KCNJ11 and GLUD1 genes. Mutations in heterozygosis were detected in this gene in 3 cases (6%), 2 of them in exon 6 (c.1115C > T) and 1 in exon 10 (c.1829G > T). The GCK gene was responsible for 6% of the mutations in the total series and for 10% of the mutations detected in cases that were negative for mutations of the genes associated with the potassium channel.

Sequencing of the HADH, SLC16A1 and HNF4A genes did not reveal any mutations.

Table 3 and Figure 1 show the distribution of mutations by gene and also their percentages in the group.

Table 3
Mutations found in 61 patients with CHH

Figure 1
Distribution by gene of the mutations found in 61 patients with CHH.

The clinical-molecular correlation with the response to diazoxide and with the histological form could not be determined because in 68% of the cases in which diazoxide was used the dose administered was less than 5 mg/kg/d, not considered ideal for the establishment of the response. All those patients that used low dose, didn't respond to medical treatment.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [^112FfaNg]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2009). Medium credibility.

Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH) is a consequence of unregulated insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells and is a major cause of hypoglycemic brain injury and mental retardation. Congenital HH is caused by mutations in genes involved in regulation of insulin secretion, seven of which have been identified (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, CGK, HADH, SLC16A1 and HNF4A). Severe forms of congenital HH are caused by mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11, which encode the two components of the pancreatic beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel. Mutations in HNF4A, GLUD1, CGK, and HADH lead to transient or persistent HH, whereas mutations in SLC16A1 cause exercise-induced HH. Rapid genetic analysis combined with an understanding of the histological features (focal or diffuse disease) of congenital HH and the introduction of (18)F-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine PET-CT to guide laparoscopic surgery have totally transformed the clinical approach to this complex disease. Adult-onset HH is mostly caused by an insulinoma; however, it has also been reported to present as postprandial HH in patients with noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome, in those who have undergone gastric-bypass surgery for morbid obesity, and in those with mutations in the insulin-receptor gene.

### Non-surgical treatment may be appropriate for most Chinese children with monogenic congenital hyperinsulinism based on a retrospective study of 121 patients [^112Coxkj]. Pediatric Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

6. Conclusion

ABCC8 variants have always elucidated the primary genetic cause of patients with monogenic CHI. Two factors in our substantial cohort, the deficiency of homozygous variants in KATP genes and a rather high prevalence of GLUD1 variants within the Chinese population stand out prominently, contributing for non-surgical therapy. The variants associated with diabetes from the literature, while causing CHI in our cohort, may expand the phenotypic spectrum, and serve as additional considerations for us to avoid surgical intervention as much as possible. Our results suggest that neonatal-onset children should be paid attention owing to relatively low response rate of non-surgical treatment, especially those with KATP variants.

### Hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome in two Peruvian children with refractory epilepsy [^114emguU]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is a heterogeneous clinical disorder with great variability in its clinical phenotype, and to date, pathogenic variants in 23 genes have been recognized. Hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome (HI/HA) is the second most frequent cause of this disease that shows an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by an activating mutation of the GLUD1 gene, which responds favorably to the use of diazoxide. HI/HA syndrome presents with fasting hypoglycemia; postprandial hypoglycemia, especially in those with a high protein content (leucine); and persistent mild hyperammonemia. Neurological abnormalities, in the form of epilepsy or neurodevelopmental delay, are observed in a high percentage of patients; therefore, timely diagnosis is crucial for proper management.

Case Presentation

We report the clinical presentation of two Peruvian children that presented with epilepsy whose genetic analysis revealed a missense mutation in the GLUD1 gene, one within exon 11, at 22% mosaicism; and another within exon 7, as well as their response to diazoxide therapy. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first two cases of HI/HA syndrome reported in Peru.

Conclusions

HI/HA syndrome went unnoticed, because hypoglycemia was missed and were considered partially controlled epilepsies. A failure to recognize hypoglycemic seizures will delay diagnosis and adequate treatment, so a proper investigation could avoid irreversible neurological damage.

### Activating AKT2 mutation: hypoinsulinemic hypoketotic hypoglycemia [^113Mkaek]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH), characterized by unregulated insulin secretion, is an important cause of persistent and severe hypoglycemia. The biochemical picture of HH is hypoketotic hypo-fatty-acidemic hypoglycemia along with elevated serum insulin. Not infrequently, serum insulin might be undetectable in HH despite the presence of evidence of insulin action (suppressed ketogenesis and lipolysis). However, autonomous activity of the downstream insulin signaling pathway without the presence of the ligand (insulin) will give rise to the same clinical and biochemical picture, apart from undetectable serum insulin/C-peptide. AKT2, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is involved downstream to the insulin receptor in mediating the physiological effects of insulin.

Aim

We describe the second report of an activating AKT2 mutation leading to hypoinsulinemic hypoketotic hypoglycemia.

Patients and Methods

The proband presented with hemihypertrophy and symptomatic hypoglycemia. Investigations confirmed evidence of insulin action, despite absence of detectable serum insulin on multiple occasions. Molecular genetic testing for common causes of HH (ABCC8, KCNJ11, and GLUD1) was negative. Sequencing of AKT2 identified a de novo mosaic c.49G→A (p.E17K) mutation, consistent with the clinical and biochemical phenotype.

Conclusions

This is the second report of an activating AKT2 mutation leading to hypoinsulinemic hypoketotic hypo-fatty-acidemic hypoglycemia. In patients presenting a clinical and biochemical picture of HH with undetectable serum insulin, consideration of autonomous activation of the downstream insulin signaling pathway should be made.

### Congenital hyperinsulinism with hyperammonaemia [^111QNxz4]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Congenital hyperinsulinism is considered to be the most frequent cause of persistent recurrent hypoglycaemia in infants. The clinical presentation and response to pharmacological treatment may vary significantly depending on the underlying pathology. We report a case of a female infant with mild but early onset of recurrent hypoglycaemia. Metabolic workup revealed hyperinsulinism combined with mild hyperammonaemia as well as elevation of α-ketoglutarate in urine. Genetic testing demonstrated a de novo mutation in exon 7 of the glutamate dehydrogenase gene on chromosome 10. Episodes of hypoglycaemia responded to treatment with diazoxide. The differential diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism is discussed.

### Clinical and molecular data from 61 Brazilian cases of congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [^113AwSzn]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

An electronic message was sent to all members of the Department of Endocrinology of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics, involving representatives of almost all Brazilian states, inviting them to participate in this study. Information about all patients with a diagnosis of CHH was requested, such as sex, gestational age, type of delivery, birth weight and length, age at the onset of symptoms, age at diagnosis of the disease, laboratory results, histological form of the disease, response to drug therapy, need of pancreatectomy, presence of sequelae, and mortality.

The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo, and the parents or persons responsible for the living patients gave written informed consent to participate. A whole blood sample was then collected from each index case and his/her parents for DNA extraction followed by the determination of mutations of the seven genes.

DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using a commercial kit (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit-Qiagen, Dusseldorf, German) and the sample was stored at −70°C; the exon ligands of the intron/exons of the genes were amplified by PCR. The PCR product was then sequenced by a standard method using an ABI 3730 sequencer (Applied Bio systems, Warrington, UK) and the sequences obtained were compared to the published sequences.

Mutations were first searched in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes. When no mutations were detected in these genes, mutations were searched in the GLUD1 and GCK genes and in cases of no mutations, the remaining genes were investigated.

Data are reported as absolute and relative frequency, with means and standard deviations.

### Non-surgical treatment may be appropriate for most Chinese children with monogenic congenital hyperinsulinism based on a retrospective study of 121 patients [^111d6DqF]. Pediatric Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) constitutes a heterogeneous disorder characterized by inappropriate secretion of insulin from pancreatic β -cells, resulting in severe hypoglycemia in neonates and infant. The estimated incidence in live births ranges from 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 28,000 in the outbred populations. The clinical spectrum of CHI is diverse, with seizures or unconsciousness being the most severe symptoms, while nonspecific symptoms like hypothermia, lethargy, and hypotonia pose challenges in accurate identification.

To date, 16 crucial genes implicated in insulin secretion have been reported in association with CHI, such as ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 8 (ABCC8), potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 11 (KCNJ11), glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1), glucokinase (GCK), hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A), and solute carrier family 16 member 1 (SLC16A1). These genes have been identified in 36%–69% of cases through genetic testing. ABCC8 variants predominantly account for the genetic basis, explaining 55%–100% of positive variant cases, while in KCNJ11 and GLUD1 display varying proportions. However, there is a dearth of large-cohort studies in the Chinese population with only a few research endeavors providing a comprehensive overview of genotype–phenotype correlations in China.

### NEUROD1 mutation in an Italian patient with maturity onset diabetes of the young 6: a case report [^115cr9ki]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

For beta-cell dysfunction, patients risk being wrongly treated with multiple insulin injections from an early age. It is well known that insulin therapy increases the risk of hypoglycaemia and also brings a lot of psychological issues that deeply affect patients' quality of life. Since very young, patients treated with insulin have to measure blood glucose levels multiple times per day, undergo a regular medical examination, and organize the injection even when they go out for meals.

For this reason, a selection of the patients based on their clinical features would enable an early diagnosis of MODY, decreasing the risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes, improving patients' quality of life, and containing the health-care costs related to close self-monitoring of blood glucose. We suggest suspecting MODY and to screen for gene mutation in all patients with a strong family history of diabetes, early-onset, normal BMI, and no autoimmunity.

### Clinical and molecular data from 61 Brazilian cases of congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [^112aDWw2]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

The lack of response to treatment occurred in 40% of the present cases, a much higher rate than reported in the more recent literature. Surgery was possibly indicated before the correct use of drug treatment, with appropriate doses. It was interesting to note that only 2 of the most recent 11 cases required pancreatectomy.

It is noteworthy that 100% of the operated cases had the diffuse form of the disease. According to the literature, 1/3 of the operated cases involve the focal form of the disease and this difference requires revision of the histological material and clinical-molecular correlation.

Together, genes ABCC8 and KCNJ11 were responsible for mutations in 21 of 53 cases (39%) of CHH. This result is similar to obtained in other series, i.e. 47% of cases in the American series and 40.8% in the British one.

A clinical-molecular correlation regarding the response to diazoxide and the histological form was found to be impossible.

Thus, mutations of the GLUD1 gene were detected in 17% of the total series and in 29% of cases in which no mutations of the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes were detected. As reported earlier, this gene is responsible for the clinical form of hypoglycemia associated with high levels of serum ammonia, and is also the major gene affected in cases in which no mutations are detected in genes ABCC8 and KCNJ11. Serum ammonia was determined in only one of these patients, with a normal result. A high level of serum ammonia directs the molecular investigation and the drug treatment, as the response to diazoxide is usually exuberant, with no low dose. Unfortunately, diazoxide was not used in these 9 cases, a fact that did not permit us to establish the clinical-molecular relationship reported in the literature.

### A severe case of hyperinsulinism due to hemizygous activating mutation of glutamate dehydrogenase [^113SQDqE]. Pediatric Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Activating mutations in the GLUD1 gene, which encodes glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), result in the hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome. GDH is an allosterically regulated enzyme responsible for amino acid-mediated insulin secretion via the oxidative deamination of glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate, leading to ATP production and insulin release. This study characterizes a novel combination of mutations in GLUD1 found in a neonate who presented on the first day of life with severe hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and seizures. Mutation analysis revealed a novel frameshift mutation (c.37delC) inherited from the asymptomatic mother that results in a truncated protein and a de novo activating mutation (p.S445L) close to the GTP binding site that has previously been reported. GTP inhibition of GDH enzyme activity in 293T cells expressing the p.S445L or wild-type GDH showed that the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) for GTP was approximately 800 times higher for p.S445L compared to wild type. GTP inhibition of GDH activity in lymphoblasts from the patient, from a heterozygote for the p.S445L mutation, and in wild-type lymphoblasts showed that the IC 50 for GTP of the patient was approximately 200 times that of wild type and 7 times that of heterozygote. However, while the patient had a loss of GTP inhibition of GDH that was more severe than that of heterozygotes, the patient's clinical phenotype is similar to typical heterozygous mutations of GDH. This is the first time we have observed a functionally homozygous activating mutation of GDH in a human.

### Genome-wide homozygosity analysis reveals HADH mutations as a common cause of diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia in consanguineous pedigrees [^115uq7Eg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia (HH), which is characterized by unregulated secretion of insulin despite a low blood glucose concentration, most commonly presents in the neonatal period with the phenotype ranging from mild to severe medically unresponsive hypoglycemia. Diazoxide targets the ATP-sensitive potassium (K ATP) channel in the pancreatic β-cell and is often the first line of treatment. Patients who show a poor response to diazoxide therapy are likely to require a pancreatectomy.

Mutations in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes, which encode the SUR1 and Kir6.2 subunits of the K ATP channel, most often cause diazoxide-unresponsive HH but rare mutations in these and five other genes (GCK, GLUD1, HADH, HNF4A, and SLC16A1) have been reported in patients with diazoxide-responsive HH. Mutations in these genes are often associated with discrete phenotypes, for example GLUD1 mutations also result in hyperammonemia while SLC16A1 mutations cause exercise-induced hyperinsulinism. While the clinical characteristics may guide the order of genetic testing, it should be noted that these genotype/phenotype relationships are not absolute. For example, recessive mutations in the hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH) gene were first identified in patients with specific fatty acid oxidation defects where urinary 3-hydroxyglutarate was present and plasma 3-hydroxybutyryl-carnitine levels were raised. However, two patients with homozygous HADH mutations but with normal acylcarnitines and urine organic acids have recently been reported.

Recently, we demonstrated that a genetic diagnosis was possible for 27% of cases in our cohort with diazoxide-responsive HH (59/220 patients). Mutations in KCNJ11, ABCC8, GCK, and HNF4A were excluded, but HADH was not sequenced because there was no report of any abnormality in the acylcarnitines and urine organic acids. Autozygosity analysis is a useful method for identifying novel genetic etiologies within consanguineous pedigrees through the identification of a genetic region harboring a mutation that is identical by descent. In the present study we have undertaken genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis on a subset of unrelated consanguineous probands with diazoxide-responsive HH and no genetic diagnosis.

### Non-surgical treatment may be appropriate for most Chinese children with monogenic congenital hyperinsulinism based on a retrospective study of 121 patients [^11463yVZ]. Pediatric Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

The clinical characteristics of GLUD1 variants in 35 patients were consistent with those reported in previous literatures, as well as the high-frequency variant (p.S498L). It is noteworthy that patients with GLUD1 variants in exons 11 and 12 were associated with earlier onset and diazoxide treatment. Among the six patients with frequent feeding, carrying variants located in exons 6 and 7, which mirrors recent evidence. Then we speculated that GLUD1 variants from different exons might indicate the onset time and disease severity. This may be attributed to the encoding of a unique allosteric domain in exons 11 and 12, wherein active variants result in increased activity of glucose dehydrogenase and severe symptoms.

We found that neonatal-onset patients with KATP variants were prone to be macrosomia at birth, presented with milder symptoms and had a higher percentage of operative intervention, along with higher levels of serum insulin and C-peptide than non-neonatal onset ones. It is obvious that severity of symptoms may not be related to secretions of serum insulin and C-peptide. Our intention is to highlight that therapeutic choice, particular surgery, depends on the genotypes and onset time possibly due to severer dysfunction of the pancreatic β -cells. This result may help improving patient–clinician communication about the benefits and risks of treatment to refine shared decision making for children with CHI.

### Differential diagnosis and management of neonatal hypoglycemia [^112a4TMj]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Persistent hypoglycemia in the neonate is most often caused by hyperinsulinemia. Recent discoveries in the molecular and biochemical regulation of insulin secretion have increased dramatically our understanding of disorders responsible for syndromes of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. This article focuses on defects and disorders of the KATP channel, activating mutation of glucokinase and glutamate dehydrogenase, and other disorders that may be associated with specific phenotypes to permit appropriate targeted therapies. It is essential to evaluate these entities carefully because of the emerging evidence that at least half, if not more, have focal disease, which can be cured by local excision rather than diffuse disease, which may not be cured even after near total pancreatectomy with risk for future diabetes. Delay in diagnosis may be associated with developmental delay. The mechanisms of hypoglycemia remain incompletely understood.

### Clinical and genetic characteristics of congenital hyperinsulinism in Norway: a nationwide cohort study [^114j1xHS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Monoallelic recessive paternal inheritance with presumed somatic loss of the maternal allele in a focal or multifocal endocrine pancreatic region was, including the proband with a coexisting GCK variant described later, seen in 17 probands (22%), constituting the largest ABCC8 subgroup in our cohort. Age at onset was known for all but 1 proband, and 14/15 had disease onset within the first week of life, including 10 on the first day. Only 1 patient was responsive to diazoxide. Among 11 octreotide-treated probands, 9 were responsive and 1 was partially responsive. Nine probands underwent 18 F-DOPA PET imaging revealing focal morphology in 5. One proband had an autopsy where focal morphology was uncovered after death, resulting in 6 total cases of focal CHI (8% of the 77 CHI probands).

Probands With Other Genetic Findings

KCNJ11: The novel heterozygous missense variant p.(Gly289Asp) in KCNJ11 was detected in one proband with normal birth weight (Table 3). Hypoglycemia (blood glucose 1.2 mmol/L) and seizures occurred on the second day of life. The carbohydrate need was 12.3 mg/kg/min. Treatment involved dietary adjustments.

GLUD1: Heterozygous GLUD1 gain-of-function variants are associated with hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome. We observed de novo missense GLUD1 variants in two probands (Table 3). Normal birth weights and elevated ammonia levels were reported in both probands (several measurements ranging from 100 to 300 µmol/L). Disease onset with seizures was in the 3rd and 15th month, respectively, for the probands harboring the pathogenic p.(Ser498Leu) variant and the novel, likely pathogenic p.(Arg318Thr) variant. Treatment involved dietary adjustments in combination with diazoxide. Carbohydrate need was available in 1 proband (14 mg/kg/min).

### Gene duplications resulting in over expression of glucokinase are not a common cause of hypoglycaemia of infancy in humans [^115QKs4H]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

It is well established that chromosome rearrangements and duplications which result in the loss of or the over expression of gene(s) can result in syndromes which feature hypoglycaemia. More recently studies have demonstrated the importance of "gene dosage" in monogenic disorders of the pancreatic β-cell. Investigators routinely screen for mutations using the gold standard methodology of direct sequencing of the coding regions and conserved splice sites of the gene of interest, however this method does not detect heterozygous deletions or duplications of one or more exons of the gene. Hypoglycaemia of infancy (HI) is a rare condition characterised by unregulated insulin secretion despite hypoglycaemia. Mutations in genes encoding the K ATP -channel subunits SUR1(ABCC8) and Kir6.2 (KCNJ11), glucokinase (GCK), the mitochondrial enzymes glutamate-dehydrogenase (GLUD1) and short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (SCHAD) are responsible for approximately 50% of the cases of HI. GCK activating mutations have been reported in a relatively small number of cases (n = 7) of HI and are characterised by regulated insulin secretion albeit at a reduced threshold for glucose stimulated insulin release. The majority of patients can be treated successfully with the potassium channel opener diazoxide or with diet treatment alone, although cases that have undergone partial pancreatectomy have been reported.

3.4. Genotype–Phenotype Correlations

Neither the comparison of clinical features between patients with variants in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes nor that between patients with ABCC8 variants (p.G111R) and other ABCC8 variants had significant difference (seen in Tables S2 and S3). As shown in Table 1, patients with KATP variants tended to be macrosomia at birth, had earlier onset time, exhibited a lower response rate to non-surgical interventions, while displayed a higher level of serum C-peptide than those with GLUD1 variants. Additionally, patients with GLUD1 variants had severer symptoms at onset than those with KATP variants.

The subgroup analyses were presented in Tables 2 and 3. For KATP subgroup, neonatal-onset patients tended to be macrosomia, had a higher birth weight, inclined towards milder symptoms at onset, exhibited a higher proportion of surgical intervention, and had higher concentrations of serum insulin and C-peptide than those with non-neonatal onset. For GLUD1 subgroup, patients with variants in exons 6 and 7 demonstrated later onset compared to those in exons 11 and 12, with a higher response rate of frequent feeding.

### Neurological aspects of hyperinsulinism-hyperammonaemia syndrome [^115iSjjc]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperinsulinism-hyperammonaemia syndrome (HHS) is a rare cause of congenital hyperinsulinism, due to missense mutations in the GLUD1 gene, resulting in glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) overactivity. The aim of this study was to document the spectrum of neurological disturbances associated with HHS and to identify possible phenotype-genotype correlations. We retrospectively analyzed the neurological outcomes of 22 consecutive patients (12 males, 10 females) aged from 18 months to 40 years and diagnosed with HHS. We analyzed demographic and clinical features and neuroradiological, biochemical, and genetic findings. Fourteen patients had childhood-onset epilepsy. Learning disability was found in 17 patients. Two patients had pyramidal involvement and one had generalized dystonia. Seizures were observed in 11 of 19 patients with documented GLUD1 mutations, and nine of these 11 patients had a mutation in the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding site. Our data demonstrate that neurological disorders in HHS are more frequent than previously thought and might suggest that mutations in the GTP binding site of GDH could be associated with more frequent epilepsy.

### Clinical and molecular data from 61 Brazilian cases of congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [^115DkCvs]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The maintenance of appropriate blood glucose levels is of vital importance at all ages, but particularly during the neonatal and breastfeeding period. In this phase of life, cerebral tissue is not yet fully mature and is marked by intense metabolic activity and extreme avidity for glucose, being considerably more sensitive to reductions of glycemic levels even if transient. Thus, the occurrence of hypoglycemia in this phase of life is relate to high morbility and mortality.

Inappropriate insulin secretion in relation to blood glucose levels characterizes hyperinsulinism, which is the main cause of persistent and recurrent hypoglycemia during this phase of life.

The congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (CHH) represent a heterogeneous group of clinical condition, the most severe and frequent form of HH. The CHH may present as different clinical characteristics (responsive or not to diazoxide, elevated or not ammonia levels) and histological subgroups (focal or diffuse form), but the aspect most recently investigated is the genetic of CHH.

Mutations in seven different genes (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, SLC16A1 and HNF4A) are responsible for about 50% of all CHH cases. Of these genes, ABCC8 and KCNJ11, located in regions neighboring chromosome 11 (11p15.1), are responsible for the expression of the proteins SUR1 and Kir6.2. These proteins comprise the potassium channels sensitive to adenosine-triphosphate which play a fundamental role in the control of insulin secretion stimulated by glucose. Inactivating mutations in these two genes are responsible for the most common and severe forms of CHH. Defects of the other five genes involved are responsible for a smaller number of cases of CHH.

Mutations in these genes are expressed with particular histopathological features, clinical manifestations, therapeutic response to drugs and therefore the investigation of these molecular alterations permits a precise diagnosis and an appropriate management.

The objectives of the present study were to obtain clinical information regarding patients with CHH from the largest possible number of clinical centers in Brazil and to determine the molecular etiology of such cases.

### Genome-wide homozygosity analysis reveals HADH mutations as a common cause of diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia in consanguineous pedigrees [^113jvfjM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

In keeping with previous reports a range in birth weights and ages at diagnosis of HH were observed in the patients with HADH mutations. Interestingly, none of the patients were reported to have abnormalities in plasma acylcarnitines or urine organic acids, a phenotype reported in 3/5 published probands. While the absence of abnormal acylcarnitines and urine organic acids in these patients may be attributable to limitations in laboratory analysis, it is possible that the phenotype is mutation-dependent because none of the mutations identified in this cohort have been found in individuals with abnormal acylcarnitines and urine organic acids. It is unlikely, however, that the disease spectrum reflects the severity of the mutation as the majority of patients with isolated HH have null mutations.

A number of studies have demonstrated that HADH has a pivotal role in regulating insulin secretion. Most recently a study by Li et al. examined the mechanism of insulin dysregulation in mice with a knock-out of the hadh gene. Pull-down experiments demonstrated protein–protein interactions between HADH and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), and studies on isolated islets showed in increased in the affinity of GDH for its substrate α-ketoglutarate. It is therefore likely that HADH mutations cause HH by activation of GDH via loss of inhibitory regulation of GDH by HADH. This finding is of particular interest as activating mutations in GLUD1, which encodes GDH, are a common cause of hyperinsulinism and hyperammonemia.

In conclusion we have shown that mutations in HADH account for 10% of cases with diazoxide-responsive HH without a mutation in the known genes. This study takes the number of HADH mutations identified in our cohort to 12, with a prevalence similar to that for HH attributable to HNF4A or GLUD1 mutations. We recommend that analysis of the HADH gene is considered in all patients with diazoxide-responsive HH who originate from known consanguineous pedigrees, isolated populations, or countries where inbreeding is frequent, regardless of whether there is evidence of abnormal fatty acid oxidation.

### Hyperinsulinism and hyperammonemia syndrome: report of twelve unrelated patients [^1117BipD]. Pediatric Research (2001). Low credibility.

Hyperinsulinism and hyperammonemia syndrome has been reported as a cause of moderately severe hyperinsulinism with diffuse involvement of the pancreas. The disorder is caused by gain of function mutations in the GLUD1 gene, resulting in a decreased inhibitory effect of guanosine triphosphate on the glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) enzyme. Twelve unrelated patients (six males, six females) with hyperinsulinism and hyperammonemia syndrome have been investigated. The phenotypes were clinically heterogeneous, with neonatal and infancy-onset hypoglycemia and variable responsiveness to medical (diazoxide) and dietary (leucine-restricted diet) treatment. Hyperammonemia (90–200 micromol/L, normal < 50 micromol/L) was constant and not influenced by oral protein, by protein- and leucine-restricted diet, or by sodium benzoate or N-carbamylglutamate administration. The patients had mean basal GDH activity (18.3 ± 0.9 nmol/min/mg protein) not different from controls (17.9 ± 1.8 nmol/min/mg protein) in cultured lymphoblasts. The sensitivity of GDH activity to inhibition by guanosine triphosphate was reduced in all patient lymphoblast cultures (IC(50), or concentrations required for 50% inhibition of GDH activity, ranging from 140 to 580 nM, compared with control IC(50) value of 83 ± 1.0 nmol/L). The allosteric effect of ADP was within the normal range. The activating effect of leucine on GDH activity varied among the patients, with a significant decrease of sensitivity that was correlated with the negative clinical response to a leucine-restricted diet in plasma glucose levels in four patients. Molecular studies were performed in 11 patients. Heterozygous mutations were localized in the antenna region (four patients in exon 11, two patients in exon 12) as well as in the guanosine triphosphate binding site (two patients in exon 6, two patients in exon 7) of the GLUD1 gene. No mutation has been found in one patient after sequencing the exons 5–13 of the gene.

### Clinical and genetic characterization of 153 patients with persistent or transient congenital hyperinsulinism [^113wYgmF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Major advances have been made in the genetics and classification of congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI).

Objective

To examine the genetics and clinical characteristics of patients with persistent and transient CHI.

Design

A cross-sectional study with the register data and targeted sequencing of 104 genes affecting glucose metabolism.

Patients

Genetic and phenotypic data were collected from 153 patients with persistent (n = 95) and transient (n = 58) CHI diagnosed between 1972 and 2015. Of these, 86 patients with persistent and 58 with transient CHI participated in the analysis of the selected 104 genes affecting glucose metabolism, including 10 CHI-associated genes, and 9 patients with persistent CHI were included because of their previously confirmed genetic diagnosis.

Main Outcome Measures

Targeted next-generation sequencing results and genotype-phenotype associations.

Results

Five novel and 21 previously reported pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HNF4A, and SLC16A1 genes were found in 68% (n = 65) and 0% of the patients with persistent and transient CHI, respectively. KATP channel mutations explained 82% of the mutation positive cases.

Conclusions

The genetic variants found in this nationwide CHI cohort are in agreement with previous studies, mutations in the KATP channel genes being the major causes of the disease. Pathogenic CHI-associated variants were not identified in patients who were both diazoxide responsive and able to discontinue medication within the first 4 months. Therefore, our results support the notion that genetic testing should be focused on patients with inadequate response or prolonged need for medication.

### Extremes of clinical and enzymatic phenotypes in children with hyperinsulinism caused by glucokinase activating mutations [^112Xk1q5]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia in infants with congenital hyperinsulinism has been associated with mutations that affect the regulation of insulin secretion by all three major classes of metabolic fuels: glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. The most common of these disorders is caused by recessive mutations of the β-cell ATP-sensitive K + (K ATP) channel; these mutations cause severe neonatal hypoglycemia that does not respond to medical therapy with diazoxide, a K ATP channel agonist, and often requires near-total pancreatectomy. Other genetic forms of congenital hyperinsulinism, such as dominant mutations of glutamate dehydrogenase, cause less severe disease, with hypoglycemia that may not be recognized until childhood or even adult life and that responds well to diazoxide therapy (,–). In 1998, the first case of hyperinsulinism caused by a dominant gain-of-function mutation of glucokinase was reported. This remains one of the rarest forms of hyperinsulinism, and information on its clinical and biochemical manifestations is limited because only a few cases have been reported subsequently. Most of these cases have been identified because of family histories of hypoglycemia with dominant patterns of transmission, and most affected individuals were reported to have relatively mild disease that could be managed medically with diazoxide.

### Clinical and molecular data from 61 Brazilian cases of congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [^116ErAmK]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the clinical and molecular characteristics of a sample of Brazilian patients with Congenital Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia (CHH).

Methods

Electronic message was sent to members from Endocrinology Department- Brazilian Society of Pediatrics requesting clinical data for all cases of CHH. A whole blood sample from living patients was requested for DNA extraction followed by a search for mutations of the genes ABCC8, KCNJ11, GCK, GLUD1, HADH, SLC16A1 and HNF4A.

Results

Of the 61 patients evaluated, 36 (59%) were boys, and only 16 (26%) were born by normal delivery. Gestational age ranged from 32 to 41 weeks (mean = 37 weeks and 6 days). Birth weight ranged from 1590 to 5250 g (mean = 3430 g). Macrossomia occurred in 14 cases (28%). Age at diagnosis ranged from 1 to 1080 days (mean = 75 days). DNA for molecular analysis was obtained from 53 of the 61 patients. Molecular changes in the ABCC8 gene were detected in 15 (28%) of these 53 cases, and mutations in the KCNJ11 gene were detected in 6 (11%). Mutations in the GLUD1 gene were detected in 9 cases (17%) of the total series. Mutations of the GCK gene in heterozygosis were detected in 3 cases. No mutations were detected in the sequencing of genes HADH, SLC16A1 and HNF4A.

Conclusion

The present study conducted in Brazil permitted the collaborative compilation of an important number of CHH cases and showed that the present clinical and molecular data are similar to those of published global series.

DNA quantity and quality sufficient for molecular analysis was obtained from 53 of the 61 patients (87%). In 15 of these 53 cases (28%), molecular changes were detected in the ABCC8 gene. All mutations were in heterozygosis, occurring in exon 1 in 6 cases (c.72C > A in 4 and c.134C > T in 2), in exons 31 (c.3992–9G > A) and 36 (c.4415–13G > A) in 2 cases, and in exons 2 (c.257 T > G), 3 (c.331G > A), 4 (c.563A > G), 5 (c.742C > T) and 12 (c.1792C > T) in 1.

Mutations in the KCNJ11 gene were detected in 6 cases (11%), all of them in heterozygosis, 2 of them being c.801C > G, 2 c.808C > G and 2 c.1142G > A.

The ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes were jointly responsible for mutation in 21 (39%) of 53 cases of CHH.

Analysis of the GLUD1 gene was carried out in the 32 cases in which no mutations were detected in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes. Mutations in this gene were detected in 9 cases (17%), 8 of them being in heterozygosis and 1 in homozygosis. Of these, 7 cases occurred in exon 7 (c.1019A > G), 1 in exon 6 (c.37266C > T) and 1 in exon 10 (c.49322G > T). Serum ammonia was determined in only one of these 9 patients, with a normal result.

### Two unrelated Chinese patients with hyperinsulinism / hyperammonemia (HI / HA) syndrome due to mutations in glutamate dehydrogenase gene [^112g4chP]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperinsulinism/ hyperammonemia (HI/HA) syndrome is caused by excessive activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) encoded by GLUD1 gene, which oxidizes glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate and which is a potential regulator of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells and of ureagenesis in the liver. So GDH is important in normal glucose homeostasis. Mutations of GDH result in HI/ HA syndrome.

Methods

We have performed protein (leucine) and fat loading test on one patient. We detected the level of serum glucose, insulin and blood ammonia. Genomic DNA of the two patients and their parents is isolated from blood and the exons of GLUD1 gene are amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for direct sequencing.

Results

The leucine diet can evocate hypoglycemia obviously. Two heterozygous mutations c.978G > A (R269H) and c.1506C > T (S445L) are identified, respectively. These are both de novo. For one patient, a better blood glucose level can be gained from leucine-restriction diet, and without diazoxide while, for the other patient, diazoxide is necessary.

Conclusions

The heterozygous mutations in GLUD1 gene can cause HI/HA syndrome, it is sensitive to the leucine. The diazoxide and leucine-restriction diet do well in controlling the blood glucose level.

### Low-level mosaic GCK mutations in children with diazoxide-unresponsive congenital hyperinsulinism [^115nMeBQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, our results demonstrate that somatic postzygotic mutations of known HI genes, particularly GCK, should be considered in children with diazoxide-unresponsive nonfocal HI who have no identifiable mutation in peripheral-blood DNA. In these cases, highly sensitive NGS methods and pancreatic samples may be required to detect mutations of GCK. These results add to the previously published reports by us and others describing postzygotic mutations of known HI genes as the underlying mechanism of disease in 16 children with HI. Although it is possible that some children with negative mutation analysis for known HI genes in peripheral-blood DNA have mutations in novel HI genes, we speculate that somatic postzygotic mutations of known dominant genes, such as GCK, ABCC8, and GLUD1, could be present in a substantial proportion of HI cases with negative conventional genetic testing.

### Non-surgical treatment may be appropriate for most Chinese children with monogenic congenital hyperinsulinism based on a retrospective study of 121 patients [^116cgkBE]. Pediatric Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective: There is a notable absence of extensive Chinese studies involving monogenic congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). The purpose of this large retrospective Chinese cohort with monogenic CHI from a national children's medical center was to analyze the genetic and clinical characteristics.

Methods: We compared clinical characteristics grouped by genotypes based on CHI-targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) and performed subgroup analyses by onset time.

Results: Totally, 121 non-consanguineous patients were enrolled. Among them, 79 patients (65.3%) had variants in ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) genes (62 heterozygotes and 17 compound heterozygotes), 35 (28.9%) in glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1), and 7 (5.8%) in rare genes (hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase [HADH], glucokinase [GCK], and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha [HNF4A]). Ten patients had ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 8 (ABCC8) variants (p.G111R), and 12 had GLUD1 variants (p.S498L), suggesting two potential founder variants. Three ABCC8 variants (p.G1478R, p.L580_S581insFASL, and p.S986 ⁣ ∗) and two HNF4A variants (p.R63W and p.V382I) were previously reported to be associated with diabetes. Non-surgical treatment was effective in 65.9% of patients with KATP variants, while in 100% of those with non- KATP variants. For the subgroup of KATP variants, neonatal-onset patients tended to present with mild symptoms (67.9% versus 19.3%), had a higher proportion of surgical intervention (24.5% versus 3.8%), and displayed higher levels of serum insulin and C-peptide than non-neonatal onset ones (p < 0.001).

Conclusion: The absence of homozygous variants in KATP genes and a quite higher proportion of GLUD1 variants than previous cohorts, may explain a high response rate of non-surgical treatment in this study. Surgery might be considered for neonatal-onset children, especially when KATP variants were discovered but not for those carried variants reported to cause diabetes in later life. While expanding the genotypic spectrum, we also highlight the clinical significance of genetic screening.

### Perspective on the genetics and diagnosis of congenital hyperinsulinism disorders [^114hwQ2j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most common cause of hypoglycemia in children. The risk of permanent brain injury in infants with HI continues to be as high as 25–50% due to delays in diagnosis and inadequate treatment. Congenital HI has been described since the birth of the JCEM under various terms, including "idiopathic hypoglycemia of infancy", "leucine-sensitive hypoglycemia", or "nesidioblastosis".

Evidence Acquisition

In the past 20 years, it has become apparent that HI is caused by genetic defects in the pathways that regulate pancreatic β-cell insulin secretion.

Evidence Synthesis

There are now 11 genes associated with monogenic forms of HI (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH1, UCP2, MCT1, HNF4A, HNF1A, HK1, PGM1), as well as several syndromic genetic forms of HI (eg, Beckwith-Wiedemann, Kabuki, and Turner syndromes). HI is also the cause of hypoglycemia in transitional neonatal hypoglycemia and in persistent hypoglycemia in various groups of high-risk neonates (such as birth asphyxia, small for gestational age birthweight, infant of diabetic mother). Management of HI is one of the most difficult problems faced by pediatric endocrinologists and frequently requires difficult choices, such as near-total pancreatectomy and/or highly intensive care with continuous tube feedings. For 50 years, diazoxide, a KATP channel agonist, has been the primary drug for infants with HI; however, it is ineffective in most cases with mutations of ABCC8 or KCNJ11, which constitute the majority of infants with monogenic HI.

Conclusions

Genetic mutation testing has become standard of care for infants with HI and has proven to be useful not only in projecting prognosis and family counseling, but also in diagnosing infants with surgically curable focal HI lesions. (18)F-fluoro-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) PET scans have been found to be highly accurate for localizing such focal lesions preoperatively. New drugs under investigation provide hope for improving the outcomes of children with HI.

### Hyperinsulinism presenting in childhood and treatment by conservative pancreatectomy [^115tWjea]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the uncommon presentation of hyperinsulinism in an 8-year-old boy.

Methods

We describe the patient's clinical findings, results from biochemical and imaging studies, surgical approach, and outcome. The discussion encompasses a review of literature that provided the basis for the diagnostic and surgical approach applied to this patient's case.

Results

An obese 8.5-year-old boy initially presented with hypoglycemic seizures after initiation of dietary changes to treat obesity. Biochemical analysis indicated hyperinsulinism. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed no pancreatic lesions suggestive of insulinoma. Genetic studies identified no known mutations in the ABCC8, KCNJ11, GCK, or GLUD1 genes. Selective arterial calcium stimulation and hepatic venous sampling did not document a focal source for hyperinsulinism in the pancreas, and positron emission tomography with 18-fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine showed diffusely increased uptake in the pancreas. The patient ultimately required partial pancreatectomy because of continued hypoglycemia while taking diazoxide and octreotide. Intraoperative glucose monitoring directed the extent of surgical resection. A 45% pancreatectomy was performed, which resolved the hypoglycemia but led to impaired glucose tolerance after surgery.

Conclusion

The unusual presentation of hyperinsulinism in childhood required a personalized approach to diagnosis and surgical management using intraoperative glucose monitoring that resulted in a conservative pancreatectomy.

### Dominantly inherited hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia [^116KT1cU]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI), the most important cause of hypoglycaemia in early infancy, is a heterogeneous disease with two types of histological lesions, focal and diffuse, with major consequences in terms of surgical approaches. In contrast to focal islet-cell hyperplasia, always sporadic to our knowledge, diffuse hyperinsulinism is a heterogeneous disorder involving several genes, various mechanisms of pathogenic mutations and different transmissions: (i) channelopathy involving the genes encoding the sulphonylurea receptor (SUR1) or the inward-rectifying potassium channel (Kir6.2) in recessively inherited HI or more rarely dominantly inherited HI; (ii) metabolic disorders implicating the short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD) enzyme inrecessively inherited HI, the glucokinase gene (GK), the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (GLUD1) when hyperammonemia is associated, dominant exercise-induced HI with still-unknown mechanism, and more recently the human insulin receptor gene in dominantly inherited hyperinsulinism. Thus, dominant HI disorders always correspond to diffuse HI, where most hypoglycaemia occur in infancy, and are sensitive to medical treatment. Channel causes could be due to dominant negative mutation with one abnormality in channels composed of four Kir6.2 subunits and four SUR1 subunits, leading to a complete destruction of the channel structure or function, or due to haploinsufficiency with only one functional allele, leading to 50% of functional protein, which is not sufficient to obtain enough opened channels to maintain the membrane depolarized. Metabolic causes are due to a gain of function of enzyme activity (deregulated enzymes), except for physical exercise-induced hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia, of still-unknown cause. Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most important cause of hypoglycaemia in early infancy (Aynsley-Green et al 2000; Cornblath et al 1990; Pagliara et al 1973; Thomas et al 1977). The inappropriate oversecretion of insulin is responsible for profound hypoglycaemia that requires aggressive treatment to prevent severe and irreversible brain damage (Volpe 1995). HI is a heterogeneous disease associated with several genes, various mechanisms of pathogenic mutations and different transmissions (Dunne et al 2004).

### Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia diagnosed in childhood can Be monogenic [^116QVPQu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we have shown that a significant number of individuals diagnosed with HI in childhood can have a monogenic etiology. Although the likelihood of identifying a pathogenic variant was lower for childhood-onset than infancy-onset HI, the number of children receiving a genetic diagnosis in our cohort was substantial and therefore genetic testing should be considered in all cases with persistent HI, regardless of age at diagnosis.

### Long-term outcome and treatment in persistent and transient congenital hyperinsulinism: a Finnish population-based study [^1112Ez3Y]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Genetics

We have previously reported the genetic findings of 95 and 58 patients in this cohort with P-CHI and T-CHI, respectively, based on exon sequencing of 10 CHI-associated genes. As a summary of the previous results, pathogenic or likely pathogenic gene variants were identified in 68% of the patients with P-CHI. K ATP channel genes explained the disease in 56% (n = 53) of all P-CHI patients (5 patients with homozygous recessive, 6 with compound heterozygous recessive, 15 with heterozygous recessive founder mutation ABCC8 /p.V187D, 14 with heterozygous dominant founder mutation ABCC8 /p.E1506K, 3 with other heterozygous dominant variants, 6 with other heterozygous recessive variants, and 4 with a novel heterozygous variants having yet undetermined inheritance). The 2 founder mutations accounted for 58% (n = 38) of the mutation-positive patients. Additionally, 13% (n = 12) of the P-CHI patients carried a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in other CHI-associated genes, (including heterozygous dominant variants in GLUD1, n = 6; GCK, n = 2; SLC16A1, n = 3; and HNF4A, n = 1). None of the patients with T-CHI carried a CHI-causing gene variant.

Diagnosis

The diagnostic features are presented in Table 1. In P-CHI group, hypoglycemia was detected in the neonatal period (aged < 28 days), infancy (28 days to 1 year), and in childhood (> 1 years) in 71%, 22%, and 7%, respectively, of the patients with P-CHI.

Hypoglycemia was significantly more often diagnosed in routine screening of neonatal hypoglycemia in the T-CHI than in P-CHI group (P = 0.002), but also in the 21st century P-CHI patients compared with the earlier patients (P = 0.038). Severe symptoms at the onset were significantly more common in the P-CHI group than the T-CHI group (P < 0.001), and more infrequent in the more recently treated P-CHI patients (P = 0.007). Severe symptoms at the onset were significantly more common when hypoglycemia manifested at a post-neonatal age compared with the neonatal period (61% vs 8%; P < 0.001).

### Comprehensive screening shows that mutations in the known syndromic genes are rare in infants presenting with hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia [^115WZMoP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Patient details

82 infants with HH diagnosed within the first 12 months of life were referred for genetic testing to the Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust. All patients in the cohort had received a biochemical diagnosis of HH in their local centre. All patients had a blood glucose of < 2.8 mmol/L (median 1.9 mmol/L) with a concomitant insulin of > 15 pmol/L (median 96 pmol/L) and/or a c‐peptide of > 300 pmol/L (see Table 1). In all cases, the HH had persisted for greater than 6 months or had required pancreatic resection following a poor response to treatment. In 15 patients, extra‐pancreatic features were present at the time of referral for genetic testing. None of these patients had received a clinical diagnosis consistent with a known syndromic form of HH at the time of study. Mutations in the ABCC8, KCNJ11, HADH, HNF4A, HNF1A, GLUD1, GCK, and SLC16A1 genes had been excluded in all patients using targeted next‐generation sequencing. 11 The coding regions of the HH candidate genes, UCP2 and HK1, were also screened but no likely pathogenic variants were identified in the cohort. 12, 13, 14

### Clinical heterogeneity of hyperinsulinism due to HNF1A and HNF4A mutations [^114byB49]. Pediatric Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dominant inactivating mutations in HNF1A and HNF4A have been described to cause hyperinsulinism (HI) before evolving to diabetes. However, information available in the literature regarding the clinical phenotype is limited.

Objective

To report the prevalence of HNF1A and HNF4A mutations in a large cohort of children with HI, and to describe their genotypes and phenotypes.

Design

Retrospective descriptive study.

Methods

Medical records were reviewed to extract clinical information. Mutation analysis was carried out for 8 genes associated with HI (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, HNF4A, HNF1A, and UCP2).

Results

HNF1A and HNF4A mutations were identified in 5.9% (12 out of 204; HNF1A = 7, HNF4A = 5) of diazoxide-responsive HI probands. The clinical phenotypes were extremely variable. Two children showed evidence of ketone production during hypoglycemia, a biochemical profile atypical for hyperinsulinism. At the time of analysis, diazoxide was discontinued in 5 children at a median age of 6.8years. None had developed diabetes mellitus at a median age of 7.0years.

Conclusions

Given the heterogeneous clinical phenotypes of HNF1A- and HNF4A-HI, all children with transient, diazoxide-responsive HI without clear history of perinatal stress, should be screened for HNF1A and HNF4A mutations as it predicts the clinical course and affects the subsequent management plan.

### Genotype and phenotype correlations in 417 children with congenital hyperinsulinism [^113BfK3T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Hypoglycemia due to congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is caused by mutations in 9 genes.

Objective

Our objective was to correlate genotype with phenotype in 417 children with HI.

Methods

Mutation analysis was carried out for the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel genes (ABCC8 and KCNJ11), GLUD1, and GCK with supplemental screening of rarer genes, HADH, UCP2, HNF4A, HNF1A, and SLC16A1.

Results

Mutations were identified in 91% (272 of 298) of diazoxide-unresponsive probands (ABCC8, KCNJ11, and GCK), and in 47% (56 of 118) of diazoxide-responsive probands (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, HADH, UCP2, HNF4A, and HNF1A). In diazoxide-unresponsive diffuse probands, 89% (109 of 122) carried KATP mutations; 2% (2 of 122) had GCK mutations. In mutation-positive diazoxide-responsive probands, 42% were GLUD1, 41% were dominant KATP mutations, and 16% were in rare genes (HADH, UCP2, HNF4A, and HNF1A). Of the 183 unique KATP mutations, 70% were novel at the time of identification. Focal HI accounted for 53% (149 of 282) of diazoxide-unresponsive probands; monoallelic recessive KATP mutations were detectable in 97% (145 of 149) of these cases (maternal transmission excluded in all cases tested). The presence of a monoallelic recessive KATP mutation predicted focal HI with 97% sensitivity and 90% specificity.

Conclusions

Genotype to phenotype correlations were most successful in children with GLUD1, GCK, and recessive KATP mutations. Correlations were complicated by the high frequency of novel missense KATP mutations that were uncharacterized, because such defects might be either recessive or dominant and, if dominant, be either responsive or unresponsive to diazoxide. Accurate and timely prediction of phenotype based on genotype is critical to limit exposure to persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children with congenital HI.

### Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy: the challenge continues [^1179tX1j]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinemia is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children. Recent discoveries in the molecular and biochemical regulation of insulin secretion have dramatically increased our understanding of the disorders responsible for syndromes of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Here, we briefly review the current knowledge of disorders of the K(ATP) channel, activating mutations of glucokinase and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and other disorders that may be associated with specific phenotypes and permit appropriate targeted therapies. Despite these advances, much remains to be learned. We do not understand the mechanisms or defects in many instances, including defective carbohydrate glycosylation syndromes and perinatal hypoxia, both of which may be associated with hyperinsulinemia. Most importantly, preoperative distinction between diffuse and focal lesions cannot be always reliably made even after selective arterial infusion with calcium, glucose or a sulfonylurea with concurrent hepatic venous sampling for insulin. The ability to distinguish diffuse from localized lesions has profound implications for therapeutic approaches, prognosis and genetic counseling. To date, about 50% of individuals with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy can be correctly categorized. Thus, the challenge continues.

### Extremes of clinical and enzymatic phenotypes in children with hyperinsulinism caused by glucokinase activating mutations [^1128iBCe]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Patients.

Child 1 is a 17-year-old male subject who had a large-for-gestational-age birth weight of 4.8 kg at term. Hypoglycemia was detected in the first hour after delivery, and high rates of intravenous glucose infusion were required to control blood glucose levels (18 mg · kg −1 · min −1; normal < 5–6). Plasma insulin levels at times of hypoglycemia were found to be elevated (8–15 μU/ml; normal < 3). He was not fully responsive to diazoxide, defined as being able to fast > 12 h with blood glucose of > 70 mg/dl. However, treatment with a high dose of diazoxide (20 mg · kg −1 · day −1) and feedings every 4 h prevented symptoms of hypoglycemia, although plasma glucose levels remained largely between 2.8 and 3.3 mmol/l (50–60 mg/dl). There were no family members with hypoglycemia.

At 1 year of age, he was referred to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia because of persistently low plasma glucose values of 2.2–3.3 mmol/l (40–60 mg/dl). A trial of octreotide gave only transient improvement in control of hypoglycemia. Because of persistent hypoglycemia at 23 months of age, a 95% pancreatectomy was performed; however, this failed to control hypoglycemia. Diazoxide treatment was retried, but plasma glucose fell to 3.3 mmol/l (60 mg/dl) after only 5 h of fasting. Treatment consisted of feedings given frequently, day and night. Despite the low levels of plasma glucose, hypoglycemic symptoms rarely occurred, mainly triggered by exercise or high-carbohydrate feedings. His parents report that his hypoglycemia appeared to improve after age 11 years, and nighttime feedings were stopped. However, they also report that he now has occasional hyperglycemia after meals, suggestive of mild glucose intolerance. Currently, child 1 has normal school performance.

### Extremes of clinical and enzymatic phenotypes in children with hyperinsulinism caused by glucokinase activating mutations [^112wmmSs]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Table 1 shows the responses in child 1 and child 3 to stimulation tests of insulin secretion. Both children showed exaggerated acute insulin responses to intravenous glucose. In child 3, acute insulin responses to calcium and leucine were normal, in contrast to the hyperresponsiveness to calcium and leucine seen in patients with K ATP channel or glutamate dehydrogenase mutations, respectively. In further contrast to patients with K ATP or glutamate dehydrogenase hyperinsulinism, hypoglycemia was not provoked by oral protein tolerance tests in either child 1 or child 3. All three children had normal serum concentrations of cholesterol and triglyceride.

TABLE 1
Acute insulin response to insulin secretagogues and plasma lipid concentrations

Review of the surgical specimen of resected pancreas from child 1 showed normal islet distribution, shape, and size from head to tail. There were occasional large endocrine cell nuclei that occupied an area at least three times as large as the surrounding endocrine cell nuclei, similar to the histological features seen in recessive K ATP hyperinsulinism. The surgical biopsies from child 2 showed normal pancreas.

Genetic mutation analysis.

In child 1, mutation analysis of genomic DNA identified a heterozygous novel missense mutation, ins454A (nt 13631–364 ins CGG). In child 2, a glucokinase mutation was suspected because of the stability of his hypoglycemia (Fig. 2); he was found to have a heterozygous novel W99L missense mutation (nt 296 G > T). In child 3, a mutation in glucokinase was also suspected because of the stability of hypoglycemia; he had a heterozygous novel M197I mutation (nt 591 G > T). The mutations were not detected in any of the children's parents and were not found in 100 normal chromosomes. No mutations were found in other hyperinsulinism genes, including ABCC8, KCNJ11, and GLUD1.

### Hyperinsulinism of infancy: novel ABCC8 and KCNJ11 mutations and evidence for additional locus heterogeneity [^116Vv5Ep]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Hyperinsulinism of infancy is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by dysregulation of insulin secretion resulting in severe hypoglycemia. To date, mutations in five different genes, the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1, ABCC8), the inward rectifying potassium channel (K(IR)6.2, KCNJ11), glucokinase (GCK), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1), and short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (SCHAD), have been implicated. Previous reports suggest that, in 40% of patients, no mutation can be identified in any of these genes, suggesting additional locus heterogeneity. However, previous studies did not screen all five genes using direct sequencing, the most sensitive technique available for mutation detection. We selected 15 hyperinsulinism of infancy patients and systematically sequenced the promoter and all coding exons and intron/exon boundaries of ABCC8 and KCNJ11. If no mutation was identified, the coding sequence and intron/exon boundaries of GCK, GLUD1, and SCHAD were sequenced. Seven novel mutations were found in the ABCC8 coding region, one mutation was found in the KCNJ11 coding region, and one novel mutation was found in each of the two promoter regions screened. Functional studies on beta-cells from six patients showed abnormal ATP-sensitive K+ channel function in five of the patients; the sixth had normal channel activity, and no mutations were found. Photolabeling studies using a reconstituted system showed that all missense mutations altered intracellular trafficking. Each of the promoter mutations decreased expression of a reporter gene by about 60% in a heterologous expression system. In four patients (27%), no mutations were identified. Thus, further genetic heterogeneity is suggested in this disorder. These patients represent a cohort that can be used for searching for mutations in other candidate genes.

### Low-level mosaic GCK mutations in children with diazoxide-unresponsive congenital hyperinsulinism [^116A1XuP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The presence of GCK mutations in the children including in the present report who required surgery due to inadequate responses to diazoxide therapy is consistent with our previous observation that, although initial reports of GCK-HI suggested successful treatment with diazoxide, the drug often fails to provide adequate control of hypoglycemia (due to tachyphylaxis). Similarly, patients with somatic GCK mutations and histology consistent with LINE-HI were also referred for surgery due to inadequate response to diazoxide. The poor response of these patients to diazoxide presumably reflects the fact that the glucokinase protein is stabilized by glucose so that attempts to raise glucose levels lead to further increases in enzyme activity and overcome the inhibitory effect of diazoxide on insulin secretion.

Mosaic GCK mutations appeared to be overrepresented among the patient cases in whom a postzygotic low-level mosaic mutation could be found (5/10 cases in the present series) in comparison to the 10% of cases of GCK-HI seen in our overall group of diazoxide-unresponsive patients. The reason for this apparent difference is unclear, but might reflect differences in the ability to detect low-level mosaic mutations in GCK vs ABCC8 and raises the possibility that some cases with mutations of ABCC8 escaped detection.

It is possible that a larger proportion of all children with HI, including those with diazoxide-responsive forms, have a somatic postzygotic mutation in a known HI gene than has been previously recognized. We recently reported somatic mosaic GLUD1 mutations, identifiable at low levels of mosaicism in peripheral blood from 2 children with clinical features of hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome. Among children with HI due to dominant mutations in ABCC8, KCNJ11, GCK, or GLUD1 that are identified in blood on routine clinical genetic testing, 42% appear to be de novo. It is unclear how many of these apparent de novo mutations represent somatic postzygotic mutations that are present at a high enough level of mosaicism to be detectable in peripheral-blood DNA by standard sequencing methods vs mosaic parental germ-line mutations. In fact, in our series of somatic mosaic GLUD1 mutations, we identified a somatic postzygotic GLUD1 mutation at a low level of mosaicism in peripheral-blood DNA from the mother of a child with an apparent de novo GLUD1 mutation.

### High incidence of heterozygous ABCC8 and HNF1A mutations in Czech patients with congenital hyperinsulinism [^111ZsdHZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Congenital hyperinsulinism of infancy (CHI) represents a group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by oversecretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells causing severe hypoglycemia.

Objective

We studied the distribution of genetic causes of CHI in a Czech population.

Methods

Countrywide collection of patients with CHI included 40 subjects (12 females, median age of diagnosis, 1 wk [interquartile range, 1–612 wk]). We sequenced the ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, UCP2, SLC16A1, HNF4A, and HNF1A genes and investigated structural changes in the ABCC8 gene. We functionally tested novel variants in the ABCC8 gene by Rb(86+) efflux assay and novel variants in the HNF1A gene by transcriptional activation and DNA-binding tests.

Results

We found causal mutations in 20 subjects (50%): 19 carried a heterozygous mutation while one patient was homozygous for mutation in the ABCC8 gene. Specifically, we detected 11 mutations (seven novel) in ABCC8, one novel mutation in KCNJ11, five mutations (two novel) in HNF1A, two novel mutations in HNF4A, and one in GCK. We showed a decrease of activation by diazoxide in mutant KATP channels with novel ABCC8 variants by 41–91% (median, 82%) compared with wild-type (WT) channels and reduced transcriptional activity of mutant HNF1A proteins (2.9% for p. Asn62Lysfs93* and 22% for p. Leu254Gln) accompanied by no DNA-binding ability compared with WT HNF1A.

Conclusion

We detected a higher proportion of heterozygous mutations causing CHI compared with other cohorts probably due to lack of consanguinity and inclusion of milder CHI forms. Interestingly, HNF1A gene mutations represented the second most frequent genetic cause of CHI in the Czech Republic. Based on our results we present a genetic testing strategy specific for similar populations.

### Identification of the molecular dysfunction caused by glutamate dehydrogenase S445L mutation responsible for hyperinsulinism / hyperammonemia [^117Qoukv]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Congenital hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia (HI/HA) syndrome gives rise to unregulated protein-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells, fasting hypoglycemia and elevated plasma ammonia levels. Mutations associated with HI/HA were identified in the Glud1 gene, encoding for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). We aimed at identifying the molecular causes of dysregulation in insulin secretion and ammonia production conferred by the most frequent HI/HA mutation Ser445Leu. Following transduction with adenoviruses carrying the human GDH-wild type or GDH-S445L-mutant gene, immunoblotting showed efficient expression of the transgenes in all the investigated cell types. Enzymatic activity tested in INS-1E beta-cells revealed that the mutant was much more sensitive to the allosteric activator ADP, rendering it highly responsive to substrates. INS-1E cells expressing either the wild type or mutant GDH responded similarly to glucose stimulation regarding mitochondrial activation and insulin secretion. However, at basal glucose glutamine stimulation increased mitochondrial activity and insulin release only in the mutant cells. In mouse and human islets, expression of mutant GDH resulted in robust elevation of insulin secretion upon glutamine stimulation, not observed in control islets. Hepatocytes expressing either the wild type or mutant GDH produced similar levels of ammonia when exposed to glutamine, although alanine response was strongly elevated with the mutant form. In conclusion, the GDH-S445L mutation confers hyperactivity to this enzyme due to higher sensitivity to ADP allosteric activation. This renders beta-cells responsive to amino acid stimulation, explaining protein-induced hypoglycemia secondary to non-physiological insulin release. Hepatocytes carrying mutant GDH produced more ammonia upon alanine exposure, which underscores hyperammonemia developed by the patients.

### Low-level mosaic GCK mutations in children with diazoxide-unresponsive congenital hyperinsulinism [^1125yrxL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children. In 90% of children with nonsyndromic forms of HI that are not responsive to medical therapy with diazoxide, mutations are identified in 1 of 3 genes in peripheral-blood DNA. Inactivating mutations in 1 of the 2 subunits of the β-cell K ATP potassium channel, SUR1 and Kir6.2, encoded by ABCC8 and KCNJ11 on chromosome 11p account for 89% of these cases, while activating mutations in GCK are identified in 1%. In contrast, only about 40% of children with diazoxide-responsive nonsyndromic forms of HI are found to carry a mutation in 1 of 8 genes in peripheral-blood DNA (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, HNF1A, HNF1A, UCP2, HADH, SLC16A1).

Mutations in the K ATP channel genes can act in either a dominant or recessive fashion and result in one of two histological forms: diffuse HI, which results from biallelic-recessive inactivating mutations or from monoallelic dominant-negative mutations; and focal HI, which is a small lesion of islet-cell adenomatosis caused by a recessive K ATP channel mutation on the paternal chromosome in conjunction with a somatic loss of heterozygosity for the maternal chromosome 11p15 region. Children with recessive K ATP channel mutations have little or no functional channels and are not responsive to treatment with diazoxide, a K ATP channel agonist. In contrast, dominant KCNJ11 mutations and approximately half of dominant ABCC8 mutations are associated with sufficient K ATP channel activity to be diazoxide responsive.

Glucokinase is the rate-limiting enzyme for glucose metabolism in the β cell and acts as the "glucose sensor" setting the threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β cells. Dominant-activating mutations in GCK result in increased glucose phosphorylation at a lower glucose threshold than normal for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β cells, leading to fasting and glucose-induced hypoglycemia. GCK-HI is only partially responsive to therapy with diazoxide. In children with GCK-HI who undergo pancreatectomy, the reported histology ranges from normal in appearance to diffuse HI.

3.3. Non- KATP Variants

3.3.1. GLUD1 Variants

A total of 35 patients (35/121, 28.9%) presented with heterozygous GLUD1 variants, with the majority (32/35, 91.4%) harboring de novo variants. The remaining three patients all denied familial history of hyperinsulinism and/or diabetes, with two paternally inherited and one maternally inherited. Eleven previously reported missense mutations were detected, distributed across exons 6, 7, 11, and 12. The high-frequency variants (p.S498L), found in 12/35 (34.3%) patients, resides in exon 11. Thirty-one patients (31/35, 88.6%) presented with hyperammonemia, as four patients exhibited normal concentration of serum ammonia in the initial evaluation. Only four patients occurred during neonatal period, with variants residing in exon 11 or 12. Twenty-nine patients depended on diazoxide to keep glycemic control, the remaining six carried variants located in exon 6 or 7 and merely required frequent feeding. These observations prompted us to conducted subgroup analysis based on the distribution of exons.

3.3.2. Other Variants

As detailed in Table 1 and Table S1, three patients (2.5%) had variants in HADH gene, 2 (1.7%) in GCK. Additionally, two previously reported HNF4A variants, p.R63W and p.V382I, associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), were found in two patients (1.7%) without family history of hyperinsulinism and/or diabetes. Among these seven diazoxide-responsive patients, four had neonatal onset time and five presented seizures initially.

2.2. Variants Analysis

This study received approval from the Ethics committee of Beijing children's hospital. A comprehensive panel for target enrichment was designed to include genes associated with CHI, namely, ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), HNF1A, HNF4A, phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1), phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2), hexokinase 1 (HK1), potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 (KCNQ1), SLC16A1, forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit gamma (EIF2S3), and calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 D (CACNA1D), sourced from the RefSeq database (genome research consortium human build 37 [GRCh37]/human genome build 19 [hg19]). All genes underwent sequenced by the next generation sequencing assay. Variants were annotated using the ANNOVAR software and cross-referenced with multiple databases, such as gnomAD, 1000 Genome, ESP6500, dbSNP, ExAC, ClinVar, and the human gene mutation database (HGMD). Three criteria were employed to select potential pathogenic variants in downstream analysis: (1) variants reads exceeding five, with a variant ration no less than 30%; (2) variants were excluded if their frequency exceeded 5% in gnomAD, ExAC, 1000 Genomes, and ESP6500 databases; and (3) the synonymous variants were excluded if not found in the HGMD database. Pathogenicity of genetic variants was assessed using the American College of Medical Genetics criteria and predicted by silico methods and tools like REVEL, SIFT, PolyPhen2, Mutation taster, and GERP++. All benign and likely benign variants were excluded from further consideration.

2.3. Statistical Analysis

International Business Machines Corporation Statistical Product Service Solutions (IBM SPSS) Statistics (22.0 Version; Armonk, NY, USA) was employed for data analysis. Counting variables are expressed as median (range) values, while categorical variables are presented as the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients. The Mann–Whitney U test and Student's t test were utilized to compare counting variables, and Pearson's chi-squared test, Yates's correction for continuity along with Fisher's exact test were applied to compare categorical variables. A p value < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.

### The genetic basis of congenital hyperinsulinism [^116csaz1]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is biochemically characterised by the dysregulated secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells. It is a major cause of persistent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HH) in the newborn and infancy period. Genetically CHI is a heterogeneous condition with mutations in seven different genes described. The genetic basis of CHI involves defects in key genes which regulate insulin secretion from beta-cells. Recessive inactivating mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 (which encode the two subunits of the adenosine triphosphate sensitive potassium channels (ATP sensitive K(ATP) channels)) in beta-cells are the most common cause of CHI. The other recessive form of CHI is due to mutations in HADH (encoding for-3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase). Dominant forms of CHI are due to inactivating mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11, and activating mutations in GLUD1 (encoding glutamate dehydrogenase) and GCK (encoding glucokinase). Recently dominant mutations in HNF4A (encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha) and SLC16A1 (encoding monocarboxylate transporter 1) have been described which lead to HH. Mutations in all these genes account for about 50% of the known causes of CHI. Histologically there are three (possibly others which have not been characterised yet) major subtypes of CHI: diffuse, focal and atypical forms. The diffuse form is inherited in an autosomal recessive (or dominant manner), the focal form being sporadic in inheritance. The diffuse form of the disease may require a near total pancreatectomy whereas the focal form requires a limited pancreatectomy potentially curing the patient. Understanding the genetic basis of CHI has not only provided novel insights into beta-cell physiology but also aided in patient management and genetic counselling.

### Nesidioblastosis: an old term and a new understanding [^115v3rp4]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Nesidioblastosis is a clinically, pathologically, and genetically heterogeneous disease. Differences between well described forms in neonates with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) and rare forms in adults are described. Histopathologic criteria include hypertrophic islets occasionally showing beta cells with pleomorphic nuclei, ductuloinsular complexes, and neoformation of islets from ducts. These changes can be found as diffuse or focal forms of nesidioblastosis. Although most cases occur sporadically, several genetic defects (SUR1, Kir6.2, GCK, and GLUD1 genes) have been described in neonates. In adults a higher rate of nesidioblastosis is observed in conjunction with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. The disease is diagnosed biochemically by a supervised fasting test in adults and in neonates by determining the glucose requirements to maintain normoglycemia, inappropriately high insulin and c-peptide levels, low free fatty acid and ketone body concentrations, glycemic response to glucagons, and the absence of ketonuria. If all highly selective noninvasive imaging techniques fail to identify a tumor, selective arterial calcium stimulation testing for gradient-guided surgery in adults and percutaneous transhepatic pancreatic venous sampling in neonates should be performed. a 95% pancreatectomy is necessary in neonates with a diffuse form of nesidioblastosis, whereas focal forms can be treated by partial pancreatectomy.

### Clinical and molecular data from 61 Brazilian cases of congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [^113ba5vz]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This was the first large-scale study compiling CHH cases in Brazil. Although most samples were from the Southeast region of the country, all regions were represented, except for the North.

The sample was quite representative in global terms. Recent publications have reported 17 cases for Saudi Arabia, 11 cases for China and 33 cases for Italy.

The largest samples have been compiled in the two major world reference centers, i.e. England (Great Ormond Hospital) with 300 cases and the United States (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) with 417 cases and 223 cases of pancreatectomy.

As observed in other series, we also could not detect differences regarding gender and prematurity.

Birth weight ranged from 1590 to 5250 g, with a mean value of 3430 g. In the present series, macrossomia occurred in 14 cases (28%) as compared to 50% of cases in the Italian sample. The diagnosis was made after 90 days of life in 14 (28%) in our children, later than other series, which is a matter of concern since a delayed diagnosis increases the risk of morbi-mortality.

There is still a substantial heterogeneity regarding the diagnostic threshold for the diagnosis of hypoglycemia in Brazil. Regarding the collection of the diagnostic critical sample, there was no standardization of the exams or of the time when they should be performed. Ammonia was rarely determined, and it should be remembered that hyperammonemia directs the clinical and molecular diagnosis and the clinical conduct regarding the GLUD1 gene.

There is also a clear need to standardize the treatment, also considering that diazoxide is not a drug easily available in Brazil, requiring importation.

Diazoxide is the medication of choice for the treatment of hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism during the neonatal period. None of the other studies have reported the systematic and early use of glucorticoids, as noted in the present series. Nifedipine is not indicated and the use of growth hormone is indicated only in the presence of its deficiency.

### Molecular and clinical analysis of Japanese patients with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism: predominance of paternally inherited monoallelic mutations in the KATP channel genes [^113E4TYv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative identification of the focal form of congenital hyperinsulinism is important for avoiding unnecessary subtotal pancreatectomy. However, neither the incidence nor the histological spectrum of the disease is known for Japanese patients.

Aims

The aim of the study was to elucidate the molecular and histological spectrum of congenital hyperinsulinism in Japan.

Subjects

Thirty-six Japanese infants with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism were included in the study.

Methods

All exons of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K(ATP) channel) genes (KCNJ11 and ABCC8), the GCK gene, and exons 6 and 7 and 10–12 of the GLUD1 gene were amplified from genomic DNA and directly sequenced. In patients with K(ATP) channel mutations, the parental origin of each mutation was determined, and the results were compared with the histological findings of surgically treated patients. In one of the patients with scattered lesions, islets were sampled by laser capture microdissection for mutational analysis.

Results

Mutations were identified in 24 patients (66.7%): five in GLUD1 and 19 in the K(ATP) channel genes. Sixteen had a paternally derived, monoallelic K(ATP) channel mutation predictive of the focal form. In 10 patients who underwent pancreatectomy, the molecular diagnosis correctly predicted the histology, more accurately than [18F]-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography scans. Three patients showed focal lesions that occupied larger areas of the pancreas. Preferential loss of the maternal allele was observed in these islets.

Conclusion

The majority of the Japanese patients with K(ATP) channel hyperinsulinism (84.2%) demonstrated paternally inherited monoallelic mutations that accurately predicted the presence of the focal form.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^111EJVWe]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone and IGF-I therapy — initial treatment selection in unexplained IGF-I deficiency: We recommend a trial of GH therapy before initiating IGF-I for patients with unexplained IGF-I deficiency (Strong recommendation). Patients with hormone signaling defects known to be unresponsive to GH treatment can start directly on IGF-I replacement; these include patients with very low or undetectable levels of GHBP and/or proven GHR gene mutations known to be associated with Laron syndrome/GHIS, GH-neutralizing antibodies, STAT5b gene mutations, and IGF1 gene deletion or mutation. Studies have shown that the growth response of patients with GHD to GH treatment is greater than growth response of patients with PIGFD to IGF-I, with peak growth velocities of 10–12 cm/year versus 8–9 cm/year, respectively; GH is a once-daily subcutaneous injection, while IGF-I (in the United States) is administered as twice-daily subcutaneous injections, and hypoglycemia is not a risk with GH therapy, as it is with IGF-I treatment.

### Mechanisms of disease: advances in diagnosis and treatment of hyperinsulinism in neonates [^112NhLk6]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Hyperinsulinism is the single most common mechanism of hypoglycemia in neonates. Dysregulated insulin secretion is responsible for the transient and prolonged forms of neonatal hypoglycemia, and congenital genetic disorders of insulin regulation represent the most common of the permanent disorders of hypoglycemia. Mutations in at least five genes have been associated with congenital hyperinsulinism: they encode glucokinase, glutamate dehydrogenase, the mitochondrial enzyme short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and the two components (sulfonylurea receptor 1 and potassium inward rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11) of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP) channels). K(ATP) hyperinsulinism is the most common and severe form of congenital hyperinsulinism. Infants suffering from K(ATP) hyperinsulinism present shortly after birth with severe and persistent hypoglycemia, and the majority are unresponsive to medical therapy, thus requiring pancreatectomy. In up to 40–60% of the children with K(ATP) hyperinsulinism, the defect is limited to a focal lesion in the pancreas. In these children, local resection results in cure with avoidance of the complications inherent to a near-total pancreatectomy. Hyperinsulinism can also be part of other disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and congenital disorders of glycosylation. The diagnosis and management of children with congenital hyperinsulinism requires a multidisciplinary approach to achieve the goal of therapy: prevention of permanent brain damage due to recurrent hypoglycemia.

### Congenital hyperinsulinism caused by hexokinase I expression or glucokinase-activating mutation in a subset of β-cells [^115NDqNv]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Less often CHI is caused by activating mutations in GCK (encoding glucokinase), GLUD1 (encoding glutamate dehydrogenase), or SLC16A1 (encoding monocarboxylate transporter 1) or by inactivating mutations in HADH (encoding 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase), UCP2 (encoding mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2), HNF4A (encoding HNF4α), or HNF1A (encoding HNF1α). It is unclear how mutations in HNF4A and HNF1A alter β-cell function. All the others affect distinct metabolic pathways in β-cells in such a way that too many otherwise normal K ATP channels are closed at any glucose concentration. In these cases of accelerated β-cell metabolism, diazoxide retains its ability to open the channels, which explains the sensitivity of the patients to medical treatment with the drug. The islet features in K ATP channel–unrelated, diazoxide-treatable CHI cases are not well-known because of the rarity and only exceptional surgical treatment of these cases.

A novel anatomopathological form of CHI was described recently in 16 patients. Its hallmark is a mosaicism of the islets. Morphologically hyperfunctional islets containing β-cells with large nuclei, abundant cytoplasm, and signs of intense proinsulin synthesis coexist with resting islets containing β-cells with small nuclei, shrunken cytoplasm, and signs of low proinsulin synthesis. Whereas hypoactive islets are present in the whole pancreas, hyperactive islets are located in one or in a few adjacent lobules. This concentration in a limited region of the gland explains why selective partial pancreatectomy often was curative. Despite some similarities, this pathological entity differs from K ATP channel–related focal CHI by a lack of germinal mutation in ABCC8 or KCNJ11 and a clinical responsiveness of the cases to treatment with diazoxide.

Insulin secretion by pancreatic fragments from six of these patients could be investigated in vitro using the same methods as in our recent study of K ATP channel–related CHI pancreas. We show that β-cells from the hyperactive region have functionally normal K ATP channels, and that the inappropriate secretion of insulin can be attributed to an increased responsiveness to glucose that, on the basis of immunohistochemical or genetic analyses of the tissues, we attribute to undue expression of low-K m hexokinase I (HK-I) or to an activating mutation in GCK in hyperfunctional islets only.

### NEUROD1 mutation in an Italian patient with maturity onset diabetes of the young 6: a case report [^112vqrws]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

International guidelines report sulphonylureas as the first-line treatment for monogenic diabetes, so we decided to start therapy with gliclazide RM (60 mg) suspending insulin at all (Table 2, Visit 2).

Unfortunately, glycaemic values did not benefit from the treatment with sulphonylureas, and at the following medical examination in March 2020, the patient showed inadequate glycaemic control and a very low c-peptide value (Table 1, Visit 2). We, therefore, restored the therapy with basal insulin, in addition to gliclazide and metformin. Metformin was maintained to provide a better insulin sensitivity and because of its cardiovascular protective effect. In October 2020, the glycaemic control was remarkably improved with this kind of scheme therapy (Table 1, Visit 3 and Table 2, Visit 3), practicing only one injection a day and without the necessity to measure blood sugar after every meal.

He referred us that his quality of life has remarkably improved, although this data was not measured with specific questionnaires. Two and a half years have passed from the first visit to obtaining a glycaemic compensation with stable therapy. During the follow-up, no hypoglycaemia was detected, and the patient did not develop any diabetic complication.

Since MODY is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, the family's counseling was provided to the patient. His brother and sister did not show hyperglycaemia, either evidence of NEUROD1 mutation at the genetic testing. The patient's mother had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus for many years but, because of her old age and immobility, she refused to come to our outpatient clinic for genetic testing. The patient signed written informed consent for the publication of his laboratory and clinical data.

### Congenital hypoglycemia disorders: new aspects of etiology, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes: highlights of the proceedings of the congenital hypoglycemia disorders symposium, Philadelphia April 2016 [^114RTqp4]. Pediatric Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia continues to be an important cause of morbidity in neonates and children. Prompt diagnosis and management of the underlying hypoglycemia disorder is critical for preventing brain damage and improving outcomes. Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most common and severe cause of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates and children. Recent discoveries of the genetic causes of HI have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology, but its management is complex and requires the integration of clinical, biochemical, molecular, and imaging findings to establish the appropriate treatment according to the subtype. Here we present a summary of a recent international symposium on congenital hypoglycemia disorders with emphasis on novel molecular mechanisms resulting in HI, genetic diagnosis, overall approach to management, novel therapies under development, and current outcomes.

### Increased referrals for congenital hyperinsulinism genetic testing in children with trisomy 21 reflects the high burden of non-genetic risk factors in this group [^116MWr7D]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

We studied 2011 individuals referred for HI genetic testing to the Exeter Genomics Laboratory between 2008 and 2020. Clinical information was provided at referral using a standardized request form. Follow‐up data by case note review were requested for all individuals with HI and Down syndrome.

We performed targeted next‐generation sequencing of 13 known HI genes including ABCC8, CACNA1D, CDKN1C, GCK, GLUD1, HADH, HNF1A, HNF4A, INSR, KCNJ11, PMM2, SLC16A1, and TRMT10A in all individuals with HI and Down syndrome using previously described methods. We used Stata/SE v16.0 to perform a one‐sample binomial test to assess if the prevalence of Down syndrome in our cohort was significantly higher than the population prevalence (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA).

Informed consent was obtained from the parents or guardians of all probands. This study was approved by the North Wales Research Ethics Committee (517/WA/0327).

### Therapies and outcomes of congenital hyperinsulinism-induced hypoglycaemia [^112CZSaM]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Congenital hyperinsulinism is a rare disease, but is the most frequent cause of persistent and severe hypoglycaemia in early childhood. Hypoglycaemia caused by excessive and dysregulated insulin secretion (hyperinsulinism) from disordered pancreatic β cells can often lead to irreversible brain damage with lifelong neurodisability. Although congenital hyperinsulinism has a genetic cause in a significant proportion (40%) of children, often being the result of mutations in the genes encoding thechannel (8 and 11), not all children have severe and persistent forms of the disease. In approximately half of those without a genetic mutation, hyperinsulinism may resolve, although timescales are unpredictable. From a histopathology perspective, congenital hyperinsulinism is broadly grouped into diffuse and focal forms, with surgical lesionectomy being the preferred choice of treatment in the latter. In contrast, in diffuse congenital hyperinsulinism, medical treatment is the best option if conservative management is safe and effective. In such cases, children receiving treatment with drugs, such as diazoxide and octreotide, should be monitored for side effects and for signs of reduction in disease severity. If hypoglycaemia is not safely managed by medical therapy, subtotal pancreatectomy may be required; however, persistent hypoglycaemia may continue after surgery and diabetes is an inevitable consequence in later life. It is important to recognize the negative cognitive impact of early‐life hypoglycaemia which affects half of all children with congenital hyperinsulinism. Treatment options should be individualized to the child/young person with congenital hyperinsulinism, with full discussion regarding efficacy, side effects, outcomes and later life impact.

### Milder phenotypes of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome [^112gbDCm]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS) is a treatable condition resulting from impaired glucose transport into the brain. The classical presentation is with infantile-onset epilepsy and severe developmental delay. Non-classical phenotypes with movement disorders and early-onset absence epilepsy are increasingly recognized and the clinical spectrum is expanding. The hallmark is hypoglycorrhachia (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] glucose < 2.2 mmol/l) in the presence of normoglycaemia with a CSF/blood glucose ratio of less than 0.4. GLUT1DS is due to a mutation in the solute carrier family 2, member 1 gene (SLC2A1). We present five individuals (four males, one female), all of whom had a mild phenotype, highlighting the importance of considering this diagnosis in unexplained neurological disorders associated with mild learning difficulties, subtle motor delay, early-onset absence epilepsy, fluctuating gait disorders, and/or dystonia. The mean age at diagnosis was 8 years 8 months. This paper also shows phenotypical parallels between GLUT1DS and paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesia.

### Paradoxical maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) arising from loss-of-function mutations in ATP-sensitive potassium channels [^113BLvWU]. Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic β-cell KATP channel closure underlies electrical excitability and insulin release, but loss or inhibition of KATP channels can lead to paradoxical crossover from hyperinsulinism plus hypoglycemia, to glucose-intolerance or diabetes. We report genotype-phenotype information on a set of patients clinically diagnosed with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and carrying coding variants in the KATP regulatory subunit gene ABCC8. In contrast to the naïve prediction that diabetes should be associated with KATP gain-of-function (GOF, as in KATP-dependent neonatal diabetes) each mutation caused mild to severe loss-of-function (LOF), through distinct molecular mechanisms, suggesting the affected individuals may have crossed over to glucose intolerance from KATP channel LOF-dependent congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). Our data provide definitive support for a paradoxical form of MODY in association with KATP channel LOF, genetically and mechanistically distinct from a late diagnosis of diabetes resulting from KATP GOF. To avoid confusion and inappropriate treatment efforts, we argue that diabetes driven by KATP-GOF and KATP-LOF mutations should be officially recognized as distinct diseases.

### New insights and new conundrums in neonatal hypoglycemia: enigmas wrapped in mystery [^113fEYLx]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Activating mutations of glucokinase (GCK) (Fig. 1), the "glucose sensor" of the β-cell, are rare and, depending on the mutation, may cause fasting hypoglycemia in varying degrees at varying ages of life. GCK, also known as hexokinase IV or hexokinase D, has a lower affinity for glucose than other hexokinases and is most active in the physiological range of glucose of 4–10 mmol/L (72–180 mg/dL) with a K m of ∼8 mmol/L (144 mg/dL). There are other mammalian hexokinases, known as I, II, and III (A, B, C), designated as low- K m enzymes, displaying high affinity for glucose even at glucose concentrations as low as 1 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) or less. Hexokinase I/A, is found in all mammalian tissues and is considered a housekeeping enzyme, usually not regulated by hormonal or metabolic processes. Hexokinase II/B is the principal regulated isoform present in various cell types, whereas hexokinase III/C is normally substrate inhibited by glucose at physiological concentrations. Mutations in these isoforms have not, until recently, been implicated in any form of HI. Some inactivating mutations in the K ATP channel, non- K ATP focal lesions recently described, as well as glutamate dehydrogenase, short-chain 3-OH acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and GCK (Fig. 1) are responsive to diazoxide, an agent used to keep the channel in an open and hence insulin-nonsecreting state. Despite the mounting and impressive body of data on genetic defects causing hyperinsulinism, the cause of ∼50% of syndromes of congenital hyperinsulinism in infants remains unknown.

FIG. 1.
The question mark following hexokinase I indicates that the current article suggests but has not proven this mutation to be responsible for the syndrome described. Glucose and amino acids stimulate insulin release by generating ATP, which leads to closure of ATP-sensitive plasma membrane potassium channels, plasma membrane depolarization, activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels, an increase of cytosolic calcium, and release of insulin from storage granules. Leucine is an allosteric activator of glutamate dehydrogenase that enables protein metabolism. Inactivating mutations in the K ATP channel lead to closure and hence excessive unregulated insulin secretion causing hypoglycemia — these mutations may respond to diazoxide, an agent that promotes the opening of these channels. By contrast, activating mutations of the K ATP keep the channel open, preventing insulin secretion and hence causing diabetes of varying degrees. These defects may be amenable to therapy with sulfonylureas that act on the sulfonylurea receptor 1 regulatory component to overcome the open state, induce closure, and hence restore insulin secretion.

### Therapies and outcomes of congenital hyperinsulinism-induced hypoglycaemia [^114rFCYr]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Congenital hyperinsulinism is a rare disease, but is the most frequent cause of persistent and severe hypoglycaemia in early childhood. Hypoglycaemia caused by excessive and dysregulated insulin secretion (hyperinsulinism) from disordered pancreatic β cells can often lead to irreversible brain damage with lifelong neurodisability. Although congenital hyperinsulinism has a genetic cause in a significant proportion (40%) of children, often being the result of mutations in the genes encoding the K ATP channel (ABCC8 and KCNJ11), not all children have severe and persistent forms of the disease. In approximately half of those without a genetic mutation, hyperinsulinism may resolve, although timescales are unpredictable. From a histopathology perspective, congenital hyperinsulinism is broadly grouped into diffuse and focal forms, with surgical lesionectomy being the preferred choice of treatment in the latter. In contrast, in diffuse congenital hyperinsulinism, medical treatment is the best option if conservative management is safe and effective. In such cases, children receiving treatment with drugs, such as diazoxide and octreotide, should be monitored for side effects and for signs of reduction in disease severity. If hypoglycaemia is not safely managed by medical therapy, subtotal pancreatectomy may be required; however, persistent hypoglycaemia may continue after surgery and diabetes is an inevitable consequence in later life. It is important to recognize the negative cognitive impact of early-life hypoglycaemia which affects half of all children with congenital hyperinsulinism. Treatment options should be individualized to the child/young person with congenital hyperinsulinism, with full discussion regarding efficacy, side effects, outcomes and later life impact.

Clinical definition and confirmation — Clinical hypoglycemia is defined as a PG concentration low enough to cause symptoms and/or signs of impaired brain function, and confirmation relies on Whipple's triad: symptoms and/or signs consistent with hypoglycemia, a documented low PG concentration, and relief of signs/symptoms when PG concentration is restored to normal; suspected hypoglycemia should be treated promptly to avoid potential adverse consequences.

### Increased plasma incretin concentrations identifies a subset of patients with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism without KATP channel gene defects [^1124hZFY]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Congenital hyperinsulinism causes profound hypoglycemia, which may persist or resolve spontaneously. Among 13 children with congenital hyperinsulinism, elevated incretin hormone concentrations were detected in 2 with atypical, persistent disease. We suggest that incretin biomarkers may identify these patients, and that elevated hormone levels may contribute to their pathophysiology.

The effectiveness of the different treatments in these patients was evaluated. Among these patients, six (Patients 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7; 75%) received diazoxide treatment, and 50.0% of those (Patients 4, 5, and 6) were found to be responsive. Patient 1 was treated with a combination of diet and antiepileptic drugs, which resulted in only one instance of hypoglycemia. Patient 8 did not receive any specific drug treatment and remained hypoglycemia-free. Patient 2 received octreotide treatment, which successfully normalized their glucose levels. Patients 3 and 7 were unresponsive to diazoxide and octreotide and had mental retardation. However, all patients who responded to diazoxide were able to withdraw from treatment with age without experiencing hypoglycemia.

### Compound heterozygosity for the common sulfonylurea receptor mutations can cause mild diazoxide-sensitive hyperinsulinism [^115pA7vo]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) is a disorder characterized by dysregulation of insulin secretion and prolonged hypoglycemia. Mutations in the genes of both subunits of the beta-cell KATP channel, Kir 6.2 (potassium channel) and SUR1 (sulfonylurea receptor) have been associated with the autosomal recessive form of this disorder. It was previously demonstrated that patients harboring SUR1 mutations often do not respond well to diazoxide. A patient is reported of compound heterozygosity for the 2 most common mutations previously reported to be associated with PHHI in Ashkenazi Jews; splice mutation of intron 32 (3993–9G→A) and deletion of phenylalanine at position 1388. Relatively low glucose utilization (< 10 mg/kg/min) was needed to maintain blood gllucose concentrations. In addition, treatment with diazoxide was highly effective. We suggest that diazoxide unresponsiveness is not always present in patients with SUR1 mutations and that the probable cause of the milder phenotype in this compund heterozygote state

### Mutations of the same conserved glutamate residue in NBD2 of the sulfonylurea receptor 1 subunit of the KATP channel can result in either hyperinsulinism or neonatal diabetes [^1127TUV9]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Loss-of-function mutations in Kir6.2 or SUR1 give rise to congenital hyperinsulinism, which is characterized by continuous and unregulated insulin secretion despite very low plasma glucose levels. Patients usually present shortly after birth with persistent hypoglycemia that requires immediate treatment to avoid brain damage. Therapy in most cases involves a partial pancreatectomy, but less severe forms of the disease can be managed with the K ATP channel-opener diazoxide.

Many disease-causing mutations in Kir6.2 and SUR1 have been described. However, to date, all mutations that cause neonatal diabetes have been identified in residues that differ from those that cause hyperinsulinemia. We describe here the identification and functional characterization of mutations at the same residue of SUR1 that can cause neonatal diabetes or its converse, hyperinsulinism.

### Genetic characteristics and long-term follow-up of 11 patients with congenital hyperinsulinism followed in a single center [^111ndzjR]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of 1:40,000 live births. Here, we characterize 11 patients treated at Munich Children's Hospital Schwabing.

Methods

We analyzed data on birth, treatment and laboratory results including genetic testing and evaluated the long-term course with a follow-up visit.

Results

All patients had severe, diazoxide-(DZX)-resistant hypoglycemia, beginning immediately after birth. Two patients were treated by medical therapy, eight underwent subtotal pancreatectomy and one had a partial resection. Both patients who had medical therapy still suffer from occasional hypoglycemia. Six patients with subtotal pancreatectomy were affected by mild hypoglycemia. Seventy-five percent of patients who had surgical treatment developed diabetes mellitus (DM) at a median age of 10.5 (8–13) years. In 89% of patients with available genetic testing, mutations of the ABCC8 gene were detected.

Conclusions

The majority of CHI-patients not responding to DZX underwent surgery. After subtotal pancreatectomy, patients typically developed diabetes around early puberty.

### Ketotic hypoglycaemia following sleeve gastrectomy [^115sFrHS]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnoses for fasting KH in adults include deficiencies in counterregulatory hormones (growth hormone, cortisol) and IEM. Glycogen storage disorders (GSD) other than GSD1 and disorders of gluconeogenesis cause KH, whereas fatty acid oxidation disorders and GSD1 cause non‐ketotic hypoglycaemia. A long duration of fasting prior to the development of hypoglycaemia and ketosis typically occurs in inherited disorders of gluconeogenesis, however, the absence of a high alanine level and lactic acidosis in the cases presented is atypical for this diagnosis.

Hepatic forms of GSD, including GSD 0a, I, III, VI, IX and Fanconi–Bickel syndrome, can cause fasting hypoglycaemia and varying degrees of hepatomegaly. GSD 0, VI and IX may not present with hepatomegaly and may have a milder phenotype as gluconeogenesis is intact. Most GSD present in infancy/childhood, but there have been rare case reports of GSD I, III and IX diagnosed in adulthood. All are autosomal recessive except for GSD type IXa, which is X‐linked. Neither of the above cases had other features of GSD such as elevated lactate, hyperuricaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, hepatomegaly, myopathy or a family history. However, ketotic forms of GSD may not necessarily present with these features, and initial endocrinological and metabolic screening tests may be unremarkable. In a study by Brown and colleagues, which included 164 children with KH, variants in genes causing GSD were found in 12% of patients. None of these patients had hepatomegaly and all had negative metabolic screening tests prior to enrolment in the study. GSDs are managed by dietary modification, guided by a specialist metabolic dietician, including the avoidance of fasting, regular low glycaemic index and high protein meals, though often require the addition of cornstarch.

### Previously undiagnosed genetic disease in adult patient with hepatic masses and reported history of congenital hyperinsulinism [^115VeoK2]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Glycogen storage disease type 1A (GSD1A), also known as Von Gierke's disease, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting glycogen metabolism in the liver. It most commonly presents in infancy with hypoglycaemia and failure to thrive, but cases have been reported as undiagnosed until adulthood. A woman in her early 20s with diabetes mellitus presented with right upper quadrant pain and was found to have several haemorrhagic hepatic adenomas. This patient had insulin-dependent diabetes since a pancreatectomy at age 9 months due to continued episodes of hypoglycaemia and suspected insulinoma. During the hospital stay, the hepatic adenomas were embolised, but significant lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia continued. Further workup revealed a chronic lactic acid level, during several hospital stays, of above 5mmol/L. After cytology of hepatic tissue ruled out hepatocellular carcinoma, the patient was discharged and recommended to follow-up for genetic testing, which confirmed the diagnosis of GSD1A.

### A novel mutation associated with congenital hyperinsulinism [^114QoR9q]. American Journal of Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Congenital hyperinsulinism is an important cause of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates. We present a term large-for-gestation neonate with congenital hyperinsulinism, who was found to have a novel sporadic missense mutation in the ABCC8 gene. The clinical phenotype of our case is described along with results of genetic testing. Our patient had an early onset of persistent hypoglycemia, which responded to diazoxide and octreotide. The echocardiogram revealed diffuse hypertrophy of the ventricular walls and septum, which regressed spontaneously by 8 months of age. The specific ABCC8 missense mutation has not been previously reported in association with congenital hyperinsulinism. Our case highlights the need for genetic evaluation in this condition. The unraveling of new mutations with unique phenotypic features may have diagnostic and prognostic utility.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^116fjBFi]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

For disorders such as hyperinsulinism, the aim is to prevent recurrent hypoglycemia that increases the risk of subsequent, possibly unrecognized, hypoglycemic episodes. For disorders such as defects in glycogen metabolism and gluconeogenesis, maintenance of PG concentration in the normal range prevents metabolic acidosis and growth failure, and possibly the development of long-term complications.

Any episode of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia should be rapidly corrected with IV dextrose infusion. The initial dose is 200 mg/kg, followed by infusion of 10% dextrose at a maintenance rate for age. In cases of hyperinsulinism, glucagon can be expected to raise PG concentration to normal or above within 10–15 minutes and to maintain that concentration for at least 1 hour. Doses of 0.5–1.0 mg (independent of weight), given IV, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously, are usually effective; lower doses (0.03 mg/kg) may carry less risk of transient nausea and vomiting, but may be ineffective unless given IV.

Long-term therapy for hypoglycemia disorders should be based on the specific etiology of the disorder, in consultation with a physician experienced in the diagnosis and management of hypoglycemia in infants and children and with careful consideration of patient and family preferences. Medications are available for some disorders, such as hyperinsulinism, and for cortisol and growth hormone deficiency. Surgery may be necessary in some children with hyperinsulinism who are unable to maintain PG concentration in a safe range through medical therapy. Nutritional therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for some disorders, such as disorders of glycogen metabolism or hereditary fructose intolerance. Some milder disorders may be treated adequately by avoidance of prolonged fasting. Patients diagnosed with ketotic hypoglycemia who have recurrent episodes should be reevaluated for other specific disorders, such as glycogen synthase deficiency (GSD 0), GSD type VI, GSD type IX (especially in males), and MCT1 gene deficiency. Nonspecific treatment with glucocorticoids for neonates with hypoglycemia is discouraged.

### Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia diagnosed in childhood can Be monogenic [^115yCDYd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

To assess whether a delayed clinical diagnosis could explain the variability in age at presentation of HI, we searched clinical request forms for evidence of unexplained hypoglycemia in infancy. This identified 4 individuals clinically diagnosed with HI in childhood with potential previous symptoms of hypoglycemia, including seizures. To investigate whether a delayed diagnosis was common, we studied the corrected birth weights of our cohort and found no evidence to support the presence of increased insulin secretion in utero and thus undiagnosed HI from birth in the childhood-onset cohort. In fact, we found that the birth weights of individuals diagnosed with ABCC8 -HI in childhood were significantly lower than those diagnosed in infancy, in keeping with these being true cases of later-onset disease rather than infancy-onset cases with a delayed diagnosis.

Taken together, the lower birth weights and the finding that 75% of individuals in the childhood-onset cohort were diagnosed before 2.7 years suggest that these monogenic cases represent the tail end of the normal distribution in age at diagnosis. This is supported by the finding that 81% of the variants identified in the childhood-onset cohort were detected in those diagnosed in infancy, suggesting that alternative genetic or environmental factors are having an impact on the age at presentation of HI in these individuals.

Our study has limitations. First, individuals were ascertained based on clinical referral. To determine the true prevalence of monogenic HI, a systematic screen is required. Second, while we screened the most common causes of HI (accounting for 69.8% of cases) we did not screen all known genetic causes of HI. We may therefore have missed pathogenic variants in the genes reported to cause syndromic HI; however, this would only have a small impact since they are expected to be rare. Insulinomas are a well-recognized cause of HI, with the youngest reported age at diagnosis being 2 years; while evidence of this as an underlying cause led to exclusion, they were not systematically screened for in our cohort. We compared individuals diagnosed with HI in childhood, defined as age 1 to 16 years, to those diagnosed in infancy, younger than 12 months. While these age categories have been used in previous studies, alternative cutoffs may have yielded different results. Finally, although we studied a large overall cohort, the sample size for the childhood cohort was relatively small and may not be truly representative.

Abstract

Context

Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is characterized by inappropriate insulin secretion despite low blood glucose. Persistent HI is often monogenic, with the majority of cases diagnosed in infancy. Less is known about the contribution of monogenic forms of disease in those presenting in childhood.

Objective

We investigated the likelihood of finding a genetic cause in childhood-onset HI and explored potential factors leading to later age at presentation of disease.

Methods

We screened known disease-causing genes in 1848 individuals with HI, referred for genetic testing as part of routine clinical care. Individuals were classified as infancy-onset (diagnosed with HI < 12 months of age) or childhood-onset (diagnosed at age 1–16 years). We assessed clinical characteristics and the genotypes of individuals with monogenic HI diagnosed in childhood to gain insights into the later age at diagnosis of HI in these children.

Results

We identified the monogenic cause in 24% (n = 42/173) of the childhood-onset HI cohort; this was significantly lower than the proportion of genetic diagnoses in infancy-onset cases (74.5% [n = 1248/1675], P < 0.00001). Most (75%) individuals with genetically confirmed childhood-onset HI were diagnosed before 2.7 years, suggesting these cases represent the tail end of the normal distribution in age at diagnosis. This is supported by the finding that 81% of the variants identified in the childhood-onset cohort were detected in those diagnosed in infancy.

Conclusion

We have shown that monogenic HI is an important cause of hyperinsulinism presenting outside of infancy. Genetic testing should be considered in children with persistent hyperinsulinism, regardless of age at diagnosis.

Once focal CHI has been confirmed by scanning, the logical choice is to proceed to lesionectomy, if the lesion is amenable to surgery. Exceptionally, there may be a case to consider conservative medical treatment if the patient has normoglycaemia with existing treatment 23. This choice is also applicable to those in whom a lesion is not localized in spite of scan information. However, the balance of risks favours a surgical approach over a medical one; the prospect of 'cure' has to be balanced against the risk of unpredictable hypoglycaemia and the long duration of medical therapy incurring the risk of life‐threatening side effects.

If investigations suggest non‐focal aetiology and hypoglycaemia is not amenable to standard medical therapy, subtotal pancreatectomy may be necessary to reduce the burden of morbidity from recurrent hypoglycaemia, prolonged hospital stay and drug side effects. Diabetes secondary to surgery is usually delayed for a few years 44 and could be reasonably well managed on modern insulin pump therapy. Some centres may advocate sparing the pancreas in return for extensive medical therapy with high‐dose treatment with SSRAs, mTOR inhibitors, enriched nutrition and continuous feeding. At present it is not known if long‐term cognitive and functional outcomes of subtotal pancreatectomy are any different from those of complicated medical therapy.
