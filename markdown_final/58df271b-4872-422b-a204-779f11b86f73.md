## Question

Diabetic female with Bp 170/100 what drug to give her now?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg in a woman with diabetes, including whether to start one or two drugs, which agents to choose, dosing, monitoring, and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and the urgency of therapy. Then, I should verify the blood pressure target and whether dual therapy is indicated at this level. Next, I will select the drug classes and specific agents, including single-pill combination options. After that, I need to outline dosing, titration, and monitoring. Finally, I should consider special situations such as pregnancy, older age, and kidney disease, and close with a concise recommendation and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and the severity. A confirmed office blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg meets criteria for hypertension in diabetes and is well above the threshold where dual therapy is recommended, so I should not delay pharmacologic treatment while relying on lifestyle alone at this level [^117GhiTP] [^1171XHPT]. Wait, let me verify the confirmation step; I should ensure this reading is an average of two or more measurements on two or more occasions unless it is ≥ 180/110 mmHg with cardiovascular disease, in which case a single visit diagnosis is acceptable, but given 170/100 mmHg and diabetes, I should still confirm if this is the first documented elevation before labeling and committing to long-term therapy [^117GhiTP].

> Next, I should review the blood pressure target. The on-treatment goal for most adults with diabetes is less than 130/80 mmHg if it can be safely attained, with individualized decisions for older or frail adults and those with limited life expectancy, so I will aim for < 130/80 mmHg while monitoring tolerability and adverse effects [^115E6VAW] [^112yZ4af]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with major guidelines; ADA 2025 and ESH 2023 both endorse < 130/80 mmHg as the primary target in diabetes, with shared decision-making to individualize when needed [^115E6VAW] [^115dXkdu].

> I will now examine whether monotherapy or dual therapy is indicated. At 170/100 mmHg, this is approximately 40/20 mmHg above target, and current standards recommend initiating two antihypertensive agents or a single-pill combination to achieve faster, more reliable control and reduce cardiovascular risk, so dual therapy is appropriate here rather than starting with one drug and waiting to add later [^116Q1srx] [^1171XHPT]. Let me double-check that this applies across societies; AACE 2023 similarly advises dual therapy when initial BP is > 150/100 mmHg, reinforcing this approach [^114wc1ce].

> Now, I need to select the drug classes. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line in diabetes because of their cardiovascular and renal benefits, particularly in the presence of albuminuria, so one of the two initial agents should be an ACE inhibitor or an ARB [^114JoSkz] [^114wc1ce]. For the second agent, a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide-like diuretic are preferred partners to achieve complementary blood pressure lowering; I should avoid combining an ACE inhibitor with an ARB because of harm from hyperkalemia and kidney injury, and I should avoid thiazides if eGFR is below about 30 mL/min/1.73 m² where a loop diuretic is more appropriate [^115v8d8z]. Hold on, I should verify that both CCBs and thiazides are acceptable second agents; ADA 2025 and ESH 2023 support either CCB or thiazide with a RAAS blocker as initial dual therapy in diabetes [^112V7dMV] [^114C8oA5].

> Let me consider specific agents and formulations. A reasonable single-pill combination to start is an ARB plus a thiazide, such as losartan/hydrochlorothiazide, or an ARB plus a dihydropyridine CCB, such as olmesartan/amlodipine, which can simplify the regimen and improve adherence while delivering the needed blood pressure reduction [^114zZSo6] [^11733D4y]. I should confirm that these combinations are guideline-concordant; FDA labeling and contemporary guidance support these combinations as initial therapy in patients likely to need more than one agent, which fits this case [^11733D4y] [^114zZSo6].

> I need to ensure dosing is appropriate. Starting with moderate doses and titrating every 2 to 4 weeks is prudent. For example, losartan 50–100 mg with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg daily, or olmesartan 20–40 mg with amlodipine 5–10 mg daily, with dose adjustments based on response and tolerability [^114zZSo6]. Wait, let me verify the titration cadence. AACE suggests reassessing and adjusting every 2–3 months, but with stage 2 hypertension I favor closer follow-up initially, such as every 2–4 weeks until control is achieved, then spacing out as stable [^114wc1ce].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I will check serum creatinine and potassium about 1–2 weeks after starting or changing ACE inhibitors or ARBs, then periodically, and monitor blood pressure closely during titration. I should also screen for symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially in older adults, and adjust therapy if present [^111t9VDK]. Hold on, I should verify that this early lab check is recommended; ADA standards emphasize renal function and potassium monitoring with RAAS blockade and diuretics, which supports a 1–2 week check in this context [^111t9VDK].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or planning pregnancy. I need to check for pregnancy status because ACE inhibitors and ARBs are contraindicated in pregnancy; if pregnancy is possible, I should use methyldopa, nifedipine, or labetalol instead and target 110–135/85 mmHg with careful maternal–fetal monitoring, avoiding RAAS blockers entirely during gestation [^1132VYRh] [^114u8JmL]. I should confirm this with the pregnancy-specific guidance in ADA 2025, which details these alternatives and targets [^114u8JmL].

> I will now examine age-related considerations. In adults 65 years and older, I should still prioritize an ACE inhibitor or ARB, but I must individualize the blood pressure goal and go slower with titration to avoid falls and orthostatic symptoms. A reasonable target is < 140/90 mmHg if tolerated, with shared decision-making about pursuing < 130/80 mmHg when benefits outweigh risks [^115v8d8z] [^115QoK6i]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to cap the systolic target at 150 mmHg in all older adults, but I should correct that; while VA/DoD suggests < 150 mmHg as a conservative goal, ADA and ESH endorse individualization and support < 130/80 mmHg when tolerated, so I should align with the more recent, society-endorsed targets while monitoring closely in older adults [^115QLKwC] [^115E6VAW] [^115dXkdu].

> Let me consider kidney disease, since diabetes often coexists with CKD. If albumin-to-creatinine ratio is ≥ 300 mg/g or 30–299 mg/g, an ACE inhibitor or ARB is strongly indicated for renal protection, and I should monitor eGFR and potassium more frequently, especially after dose changes or if combined with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which may be needed for resistant hypertension [^114JoSkz] [^115v8d8z]. I should double-check that this approach aligns with ADA 2025, which it does, including the caution about MRAs with RAAS blockade due to hyperkalemia risk [^114JoSkz] [^115v8d8z].

> Next, I should review lifestyle therapy, because even with dual pharmacotherapy, sodium restriction, weight loss if overweight, physical activity, and alcohol moderation meaningfully augment blood pressure control and cardiometabolic risk reduction. I will implement these in parallel and adjust expectations accordingly [^114wc1ce]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; lifestyle alone would be insufficient at 170/100 mmHg, but it remains essential adjunctive therapy to sustain control and potentially reduce pill burden over time [^1171XHPT].

> Putting this together, my immediate recommendation is to initiate dual antihypertensive therapy now, using an ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-like diuretic, preferably as a single-pill combination to enhance adherence, with moderate starting doses and a plan to titrate every 2–4 weeks toward a target of < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, alongside concurrent lifestyle measures and early lab monitoring for renal function and potassium [^1171XHPT] [^112V7dMV] [^114zZSo6] [^11733D4y]. I should confirm pregnancy status before selecting RAAS blockade, individualize targets in older adults, and escalate promptly if control is not achieved, adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist or beta-blocker as indicated for resistant hypertension while avoiding ACEi/ARB co-administration [^1132VYRh] [^115v8d8z] [^112V7dMV].

Start **dual therapy** with an ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic [^112V7dMV] for a diabetic patient with BP 170/100 mmHg, as recommended by ADA 2025 and AACE 2023 [^114wc1ce]. This approach achieves faster BP control, reduces cardiovascular risk [^1171XHPT], and improves adherence [^112fR7qf]. If dual therapy is not feasible, start with an ACE inhibitor or ARB [^1151Dbmu] and add a second agent within 2–4 weeks. Monitor for **renal function and electrolytes**, and adjust therapy to reach a target of < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated [^111t9VDK] [^115E6VAW].

---

## Recommended pharmacological management

### Initial pharmacological therapy

- **Dual therapy**: Start two agents — an ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or thiazide diuretic [^112V7dMV] — to achieve faster BP control and reduce cardiovascular risk [^113YD1Xp].

- **ACE inhibitors or ARBs**: First-line for patients with diabetes because of their cardiovascular and renal benefits [^1151Dbmu], especially in the presence of albuminuria [^114JoSkz].

- **Calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics**: Preferred second agents due to efficacy and favorable metabolic profiles in diabetes [^112V7dMV].

---

### Alternative approach if dual therapy is not feasible

If dual therapy is not immediately feasible, start with an **ACE inhibitor or ARB** [^112V7dMV] and add a second agent within 2–4 weeks if BP remains uncontrolled.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dual therapy

Faster BP control is achieved with **initial combination therapy** compared with monotherapy, particularly in stage 2 hypertension [^115nvs2k] [^113YD1Xp]. Improved adherence is also seen with **single-pill combinations**, which enhance adherence and long-term BP control [^112fR7qf] [^113YD1Xp].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Renal function and electrolytes**: Monitor serum creatinine and potassium within 1–2 weeks after initiating or adjusting therapy, especially with ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^1119ouhn].

- **Blood pressure monitoring**: Reassess BP within 2–4 weeks after initiating or adjusting therapy to ensure adequate control and adjust treatment as needed [^notfound].

- **Individualized treatment goals**: Aim for a BP target of < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities [^115E6VAW] [^112yZ4af].

The hypertensive and normotensive Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) studies were prospective, randomized, interventional clinical trials with 5 years of follow-up that examined the role of intensive versus standard blood pressure control in a total of 950 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the hypertensive ABCD study, a significant decrease in mortality was detected in the intensive blood pressure control group when compared with the standard blood pressure control group. There was also a marked reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction when patients were randomly assigned to initial antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition rather than calcium channel blockade. The results of the normotensive ABCD study included associations between intensive blood pressure control and significant slowing of the progression of nephropathy (as assessed by urinary albumin excretion) and retinopathy, and fewer strokes. In both the hypertensive and normotensive studies, mean renal function (as assessed by 24 h creatinine clearance) remained stable during 5 years of either intensive or standard blood pressure intervention in patients with normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/24 h) or microalbuminuria (30–300 mg/24 h) at baseline. By contrast, the rate of creatinine clearance in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy (> 300 mg/24 h; albuminuria) at baseline decreased by an average of 5 ml/min/year in spite of either intensive or standard blood pressure control. Analysis of the results of 5 years of follow-up revealed a highly significant correlation of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality with left ventricular mass and severity of albuminuria.

Screening and diagnosis

Measurement of blood pressure in the office should be done by a trained individual and follow the guidelines established for nondiabetic individuals: measurement in the seated position, with feet on the floor and arm supported at heart level, after 5 min of rest. Cuff size should be appropriate for the upper arm circumference. Elevated values should be confirmed on a separate day. Because of the clear synergistic risks of hypertension and diabetes, the diagnostic cutoff for a diagnosis of hypertension is lower in people with diabetes (blood pressure ≥ 130/80) than in those without diabetes (blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg).

Home blood pressure self-monitoring and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may provide additional evidence of "white coat" and masked hypertension and other discrepancies between office and "true" blood pressure, and studies in nondiabetic populations show that home measurements may better correlate with CVD risk than office measurements. However, the preponderance of the clear evidence of benefits of treatment of hypertension in people with diabetes is based on office measurements.

Treatment goals

Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit (reduction of CHD events, stroke, and nephropathy) of lowering blood pressure to < 140 mmHg systolic and < 80 mmHg diastolic in individuals with diabetes (,–). Epidemiologic analyses show that blood pressure > 115/75 mmHg is associated with increased cardiovascular event rates and mortality in individuals with diabetes. Therefore, a target blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg is reasonable if it can be safely achieved. The ongoing ACCORD trial is designed to determine whether blood pressure lowering to systolic blood pressure < 120 mmHg provides greater cardiovascular protection than a systolic blood pressure level of < 140 mmHg in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Treatment strategies

Although there are no well-controlled studies of diet and exercise in the treatment of hypertension in individuals with diabetes, studies in nondiabetic individuals have shown anti-hypertensive effects similar to pharmacologic monotherapy of reducing sodium intake and excess body weight; increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products; avoiding excessive alcohol consumption; and increasing activity levels. These nonpharmacological strategies may also positively affect glycemia and lipid control. Their effects on cardiovascular events have not been established. An initial trial of nonpharmacologic therapy may be reasonable in diabetic individuals with mild hypertension (systolic blood pressure 130–139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 80–89 mmHg). If the blood pressure is ≥ 140 mmHg systolic and/or ≥ 90 mmHg diastolic at the time of diagnosis, pharmacologic therapy should be initiated along with nonpharmacologic therapy.

Hypertension management in persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) emphasizes appropriate assessment and individualized pharmacotherapy: The use of 24‑hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is not part of diagnostic criteria but "is an important tool for guiding management", and "Routine use of ABPM may be considered for the evaluation of white‑coat hypertension, masked hypertension, and nighttime nondipping status". For treatment inertia, "pharmacotherapy should be intensified when needed to achieve BP goals". As initial agents, "ACE inhibitors or ARBs are indicated as pharmacotherapy for BP control and to delay the progression of CKD", while "ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used together and should be used with caution with spironolactone to avoid hyperkalemia or AKI". Thiazide diuretics can be effective "in persons aged 65 years and older", though low‑dose hydrochlorothiazide may adversely affect glycemia and lipids. "BP control reduces the risk of stroke and major CVD events in persons with T2D". For resistant hypertension, "The addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist should be considered…; however, monitoring for hyperkalemia and kidney function is necessary in those taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB".

Background

Hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is a prevalent condition that leads to substantial morbidity and mortality.

Purpose

To evaluate the goals and optimal agents for treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

Review of the medical literature

Study Selection

Randomized trials that evaluated the pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes and reported microvascular and macrovascular outcomes.

Data Extraction

Studies were identified by using the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, meta-analyses, review articles, and expert recommendation. The searches of the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE were performed in May 2000 and updated in April 2002. Data were abstracted to standardized forms by a single reviewer and were confirmed by a second reviewer.

Data Synthesis

Treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes provides dramatic benefit. Target diastolic blood pressures of less than 80 mm Hg appear optimal; systolic targets have not been as rigorously evaluated, but targets of 135 mm Hg or less are reasonable. Studies that compare drug classes do not suggest obviously superior agents. However, it is reasonable to conclude that thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, and perhaps angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be the preferred first-line agents for treatment of hypertension in diabetes. beta-Blockers and calcium-channel blockers are more effective than placebo, but they may not be as effective as diuretics, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, or ACE inhibitors; however, study results are inconsistent in this regard.

Conclusions

Treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes, with blood pressure goals of 135/80 mm Hg, provides dramatic benefits. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and ACE inhibitors may be the best first-line treatments, although other agents are usually necessary and goals may not be achieved even with three or four agents. Aggressive blood pressure control may be the most important factor in preventing adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, pharmacotherapy, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to use the same drug treatment strategies in patients with T2DM as for patients without diabetes but lower BP to < 130/80 mmHg as the primary goal.
Use combination strategies in most patients as BP control is difficult in diabetes.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115Nnm1n]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Risk-based thresholds for initiation of blood pressure (BP) treatment in adults — algorithm: If the patient has an average BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, initiate antihypertensive medications to lower BP and reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. If BP is below this level, in those with existing clinical CVD (coronary heart disease [CHD], stroke, heart failure [HF]), initiate antihypertensive medications to lower BP and reduce CVD risk if average systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 130 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 80 mm Hg for secondary prevention of CVD. If there is no existing CVD, but the patient has diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD), or has increased short-term risk defined as a 10-year PREVENT-CVD risk ≥ 7.5%, initiate antihypertensive medications to lower BP and reduce CVD risk if average SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg for primary prevention of CVD. If none of these apply, initiate antihypertensive medications to lower BP if average SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg after 3–6 months of lifestyle intervention. In older adults who may be frail or have a limited life expectancy, a clinician-patient assessment of potential benefits and harms of BP lowering should be pursued to align care with patient goals.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^112fR7qf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration and reduced healthcare costs. Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs and the rationale for using particular combinations in patients with hypertension and renal impairment.

Why should early combination therapy be considered?

Worldwide guidelines recommend combination therapy as a first-line treatment option for hypertension likely not to be controlled on monotherapy (e.g. 20/10 mmHg above target BP) because of evidence showing that only a minority of patients will achieve and maintain BP goals on monotherapy. The recent re-appraisal of the European guidelines also recommended the preferential use of SPCs to improve adherence.

There are a number of compelling reasons why early combination therapy should be used in patients with hypertension (Table 1), including lack of efficacy with monotherapy, greater BP control and attenuation of side effects associated with monotherapeutic treatment. In addition, hypertensive patients with comorbidities, such as renal disease, might benefit from additional effects of multiple antihypertensive agents, beyond those related to BP lowering.

### Management of hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: guidelines based on current evidence [^113vhMMh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Hypertension and diabetes are becoming increasingly common. Most patients with both disorders have a markedly worsened risk for premature microvascular and macrovascular complications. The appropriate management of the hypertension seen in almost 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus remains controversial. However, over the past few years, many randomized, controlled trials have provided guidance for more effective therapy. These trials have established the need for a lower goal blood pressure (< 130/80 mm Hg) than has previously been recommended. In addition, they have proven the efficacy of drugs from three major classes of antihypertensive agents; however, comparative trials have failed to show definite superiority of any particular class in either lowering blood pressure or reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To achieve therapy goals, multiple antihypertensive drugs are usually needed. On the basis of their apparent superiority in slowing diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should probably be the first choice. Second and third choices should be a long-acting diuretic and a calcium-channel blocker or a beta-blocker, respectively. Attention should also be directed toward nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic control of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia.

Hypertension and blood pressure management — pregnancy with diabetes and chronic hypertension specifies a blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mmHg for initiation or titration of therapy with no increase in risk of small-for-gestational-age birth weight; therapy should be deintensified for blood pressure < 90/60 mmHg; and a blood pressure goal of 110–135/85 mmHg is suggested to reduce the risk of accelerated maternal hypertension.

BP goal in diabetes

Current guidelines recommend lowering BP to < 130/80 mmHg in diabetic patients. However, these guidelines are not based on solid evidence. In the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial, 11,140 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to treatment with a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide or matching placebo. After a mean of 4.3 years of follow-up, active treatment (BP 136/73 mmHg) reduced the relative risk of a major macrovascular or microvascular event by 9%, compared with the placebo treatment (BP 140/73 mmHg). The authors stated that the study treatment was not affected by the initial BP levels. However, the mean initial BP of the studied population was 145/81 mmHg, and 7,655 (68.5%) patients had a history of current antihypertensive treatment. Analysis of subgroups revealed that in patients with no history of hypertension, active treatment did not reduce CV events. It is noteworthy that the achieved SBP in this trial was 136 mmHg. In other trials that showed benefit of BP lowering, the achieved SBP was > 130 mmHg.

Only in one small study (the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes [ABCD]) were the achieved SBP levels < 130 mmHg. In the normotensive ABCD study, 480 type 2 diabetic patients with baseline normal BP (< 140/90 mmHg) were randomized to intensive (10 mmHg below the baseline diastolic BP) or moderate (80–89 mmHg) diastolic BP control. Despite a 9-mmHg difference in SBP between the intensive and the moderate groups, the primary end point (change in creatinine clearance) was the same. Intensive BP control was associated with improvement in only secondary outcomes (less progression to incipient or overt diabetic nephropathy, less progression to diabetic retinopathy and less incidence of stroke).

Two recent publications showed that, in diabetic patients, tight control of SBP was not associated with improved CV outcomes compared with usual control.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114C8oA5]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertension in diabetes mellitus — treatment initiation, regimen, and targets: Antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended when the office BP is > 140/90 mmHg, and alongside lifestyle interventions treatment should usually be initiated with a two-drug combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a CCB or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic; recording 24 h ABPM in apparently normotensive people with diabetes may be a useful diagnostic procedure. Substantial evidence supports the benefits of BP reduction in people with diabetes to reduce major macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, as well as reducing mortality, and recent RCTs show that the selective inhibitors of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 in the kidney can reduce office and ambulatory BP by several mmHg even when people are treated with antihypertensive drugs. We recommend that in people with diabetes, the first objective should be to lower BP to < 140/90 mmHg, aiming at an SBP of 130 mmHg; provided that the treatment is well tolerated, treated SBP values of < 130 mmHg should be considered because of the benefits on stroke prevention, and achieved SBP values of < 120 mmHg should always be avoided.

Stage 2 hypertension is ≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 100 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is a 2-drug combination for most (usually thiazide-type diuretic and ACE inhibitor or ARB or β-blocker or CCB). With compelling indications, use drug(s) for the compelling indications, with other antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB) as needed. Treatment is determined by highest BP category. Treat patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes to BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Initial combined therapy should be used cautiously in those at risk for orthostatic hypotension.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with diabetes mellitus [^1134KvG7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure (BP), doctors often want to know what blood pressure target they should try to achieve. The standard blood pressure target in clinical practice for some time has been less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg for the general population of people with elevated blood pressure. Several clinical guidelines published in recent years have recommended lower targets (less than 130/80 mmHg) for people with diabetes mellitus. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target reduces mortality and morbidity in those with elevated blood pressure and diabetes.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' BP targets (any target less than 130/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with 'standard' BP targets (less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg) in people with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for related reviews. We conducted electronic searches of the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (January 1946 - October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1946 - October 2013), EMBASE (January 1974 - October 2013) and ClinicalTrials.gov. The most recent search was performed on October 4, 2013. Other search sources were the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing people with diabetes randomized to lower or to standard BP targets as previously defined, and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed and established the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

We found five randomized trials, recruiting a total of 7314 participants and with a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Only one trial (ACCORD) compared outcomes associated with 'lower' (< 120 mmHg) or 'standard' (< 140 mmHg) systolic blood pressure targets in 4734 participants. Despite achieving a significantly lower BP (119.3/64.4 mmHg vs 133.5/70.5 mmHg, P < 0.0001), and using more antihypertensive medications, the only significant benefit in the group assigned to 'lower' systolic blood pressure (SBP) was a reduction in the incidence of stroke: risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.88, P = 0.009, absolute risk reduction 1.1%. The effect of SBP targets on mortality was compatible with both a reduction and increase in risk: RR 1.05 CI 0.84 to 1.30, low quality evidence. Trying to achieve the 'lower' SBP target was associated with a significant increase in the number of other serious adverse events: RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.91, P < 0.00001, absolute risk increase 2.0%. Four trials (ABCD-H, ABCD-N, ABCD-2V, and a subgroup of HOT) specifically compared clinical outcomes associated with 'lower' versus 'standard' targets for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in people with diabetes. The total number of participants included in the DBP target analysis was 2580. Participants assigned to 'lower' DBP had a significantly lower achieved BP: 128/76 mmHg vs 135/83 mmHg, P < 0.0001. There was a trend towards reduction in total mortality in the group assigned to the 'lower' DBP target (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01), mainly due to a trend to lower non-cardiovascular mortality. There was no difference in stroke (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05), in myocardial infarction (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.40) or in congestive heart failure (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.92), low quality evidence. End-stage renal failure and total serious adverse events were not reported in any of the trials. A sensitivity analysis of trials comparing DBP targets < 80 mmHg (as suggested in clinical guidelines) versus < 90 mmHg showed similar results. There was a high risk of selection bias for every outcome analyzed in favor of the 'lower' target in the trials included for the analysis of DBP targets.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time, evidence from randomized trials does not support blood pressure targets lower than the standard targets in people with elevated blood pressure and diabetes. More randomized controlled trials are needed, with future trials reporting total mortality, total serious adverse events as well as cardiovascular and renal events.

### Management of blood pressure in patients with diabetes [^113S3r7F]. American Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Lowering blood pressure (BP) to 135/85 mm Hg is the main goal of treatment. A nonpharmcologic approach is recommended in all patients. If BP levels remain above the target despite nonpharmacologic treatment, drug therapy should be initiated. Blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) represent the cornerstone of the antihypertensive drug arsenal; however, in most patients, combination therapy is required. For many patients, a combination of RAAS blocker and calcium antagonist is the combination preferred by the treating physician. Often three or even four drugs are needed. Treatment should be individualized according to concomitant risk factors and diseases and depending on the age and hemodynamic and laboratory parameters of the patient. In order to maximally reduce cardio renal risk, control of lipid and glycemic levels should also be ensured.

Randomized trials of blood pressure targets in diabetes

In patients with diabetes, randomized trials that compared different blood pressure treatment targets have not shown a clear benefit of lower treatment targets on survival. Benefits on combined morbidity and mortality outcomes were observed in the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) trial where average baseline blood pressure was 160/94 mmHg, and in a subgroup of the HOT (Hypertension Optimal Treatment) trial where the baseline DBP inclusion criteria was 100–115 mmHg, but not in the more recent ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) trial, where average baseline blood pressure was 139/76 mmHg and in which a systolic treatment target of less than 120 mmHg did not influence the risk for major cardiovascular events compared with a treatment target of less than 140 mmHg. One meta-analysis showed that in patients with diabetes, initiation of antihypertensive treatment provided clinical benefit only in patients with pre-treatment SBP ≥ 140 mmHg, and that treatment intensification actually increased the risk for cardiovascular death in patients with SBP less than 140 mmHg. The results of the present study are observational and should not be interpreted as evidence for or against intensified blood pressure treatment in patients with diabetes. However, the results do suggest that an association between lower SBP and higher risk for death may be confined to patients with more advanced cardiovascular disease burden, and that elevated blood pressure may be a more important risk factor in patients without prior cardiovascular events. Importantly, our results should not discourage the use of blood pressure-lowering medications known to prolong survival. For instance, in patients with heart failure who participated in the CHARM (Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity) trials, lower baseline blood pressure was also associated with higher risk for death, but the benefits of treatment with candesartan were not affected by baseline blood pressure levels.

Recommendations

Screening and diagnosis

Blood pressure should be measured at every routine diabetes visit. Patients found to have a systolic blood pressure of ≥ 130 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 80 mmHg should have blood pressure confirmed on a separate day. Repeat systolic blood pressure of ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 80 mmHg confirms a diagnosis of hypertension. (C)

Goals

Patients with diabetes should be treated to a systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg. (C)
Patients with diabetes should be treated to a diastolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg. (B)

Treatment

Patients with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mmHg may be given lifestyle therapy alone for a maximum of 3 months and then, if targets are not achieved, be treated with the addition of pharmacological agents. (E)
Patients with more severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg) at diagnosis or follow-up should receive pharmacologic therapy in addition to lifestyle therapy. (A)
Pharmacologic therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should be with a regimen that includes either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. If needed to achieve blood pressure targets, a thiazide diuretic should be added to those with an estimated GFR (see below) ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² and a loop diuretic for those with an estimated GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m². (C)
Multiple drug therapy (two or more agents at maximal doses) is generally required to achieve blood pressure targets. (B)
If ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, kidney function and serum potassium levels should be closely monitored. (E)
In pregnant patients with diabetes and chronic hypertension, blood pressure target goals of 110–129/65–79 mmHg are suggested in the interest of long-term maternal health and minimizing impaired fetal growth. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are contraindicated during pregnancy. (E)

Hypertension is a common comorbidity of diabetes, affecting the majority of patients, with prevalence depending on type of diabetes, age, obesity, and ethnicity. Hypertension is a major risk factor for both CVD and microvascular complications. In type 1 diabetes, hypertension is often the result of underlying nephropathy, while in type 2 it usually coexists with other cardiometabolic risk factors.

Blood pressure lowering in type 2 diabetes

Before the publication of the results of the ADVANCE BP lowering arm in 2007, BP had been established as an important determinant of risk of microvascular and macrovascular disease in T2D. However, the role of BP lowering irrespective of initial BP levels, or irrespective of use of other BP lowering drugs in T2D was unknown. The ADVANCE trial randomized 11 140 participants with T2D comparing the effects of a fixed combination of perindopril 5 mg and indapamide 1.25 mg versus matching placebo. The primary outcome was the composite of major macrovascular and microvascular events, defined as death from cardiovascular disease, nonfatal stroke or nonfatal myocardial infarction, and new or worsening renal or diabetic eye disease. The mean age of the population was 66 years, and around a third of participants had a history of major macrovascular disease and 10% had a history of major microvascular disease at baseline. There was no requirement for participants to have hypertension, described as a BP of ≥ 140/90mmHg and there were no BP criteria for inclusion. The mean entry BP of randomized patients was 145/81 mm Hg and 41% had a BP < 140/90 mmHg. Among those participants with BP < 140/90 mmHg, the mean BP was 126/74 mmHg. There was good balance between randomized groups across a range of characteristics. The mean follow-up was 4.3 years (range was < 1 month to 5.6 years), which equated to 24 005 patient-years in the active group and 23 845 patient-years in the placebo group.

Randomized treatment adherence was excellent during the follow-up, with 73% of participants adherent to active treatment and 74% to placebo at the end of the follow-up. During the prerandomization active run-in period, where all potentially eligible patients received active treatment, only 3.6% of participants withdrew because of suspected side effects. Compared to placebo, active treatment for a mean of 4.3 years reduced BP by 5.6/2.2 mmHg and reduced the risk of the primary outcome of major macrovascular and microvascular events by 9% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0–17] (P = 0.04), of cardiovascular mortality by 18% (2–32%), and of all-cause mortality by 14% (2–25%) (both P = 0.03) (Fig. 1 a and b).

If no, evaluate diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or short-term risk: "Does the patient have diabetes or CKD, or is the patient at increased short-term risk of CVD (10-year PREVENT-CVD risk ≥ 7.5%)?"; if yes, "Initiate antihypertensive medications to lower BP and reduce CVD risk if average SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg for primary prevention of CVD", and if no, "Initiate antihypertensive medications to lower BP if average SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg after 3–6 months of lifestyle intervention". The figure notes, "In older adults who may be frail or have a limited life expectancy, a clinician-patient assessment of potential benefits and harms of BP lowering should be pursued to align care with patient goals", and clarifies, "Increased short-term or 10-year risk is defined as a 10-year predicted risk for CVD events of ≥ 7.5% using PREVENT".

### Hypertension management in type 2 diabetes mellitus: recommendations of the Joint National Committee VII [^111KdNmY]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

HTN in patients who have diabetes should be managed aggressively; the goal BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg should be attained if clinicians seek to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for these patients. Along with instituting medical therapy after HTN is detected, lifestyle modifications need to be managed aggressively, together with strict glycemic and lipid control. Early management and optimization of treatment of HTN can delay and possibly prevent progression of cardiovascular complications, such as CAD, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Studied approaches to treat HTN in diabetics have included ACEIs and ARBs. Either class of medication, generally in combination with a thiazide diuretic, should be considered as initial therapy. Calcium antagonists, BBs, and alpha-antagonists also have a role in this population of patients, usually as third- and fourth-line add-ons. The importance of using agents that block RAAS is becoming understood better. Typically, three or more antihypertensive medications plus lifestyle interventions are required to achieve a goal BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Managing patients who have diabetes and HTN is a dynamic, ever-changing challenge. Early and aggressive antihypertensive therapy pays off; it is hoped that the insights in this article enable clinicians to meet the challenge more successfully.

### A practical approach to hypertension management in diabetes [^1164RGzr]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Recent trends suggest to target treatment when BP is greater than 140/90. When achieved without undue treatment burden, BP targets of less than 130/80 mmHg may be appropriate for certain individuals with diabetes, like the young, with albuminuria, and/or those with hypertension and one or more additional atherosclerotic CV disease risk factors. Tighter targets of less than 140/90 mmHg in patients 70–80 years old and of less than 150/90 in the elderly (more than 80 years old) seem appropriate. Initiate combination therapy if not at goal or if initial BP is greater than 160/100.

ACEI/ARBs are the most effective drugs for treating hypertension in diabetes, in the absence of contraindications. Calcium antagonists or diuretics are probably appropriate as second-line agents. Newer antidiabetes medications such as SGLT2i have antihypertensive properties and may help in treatment decision-making and choices. Once the BP target is achieved, antihypertensive drugs should be continued in order to promote CV risk reduction. Future trials are needed to determine the appropriate BP targets for patients with diabetes.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Blood pressure management in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1179yqFW]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension aggravates macrovascular and microvascular diseases and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The current Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines of the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2014) recommends that antihypertensive medication should be initiated concomitantly with lifestyle modification when blood pressure (BP) is ⩾130/80mmHg and that target levels of office and home BP should be < 130/80mmHg and < 125/75mmHg, respectively, in T2DM patients. Considering more favorable metabolic profiles and renoprotective effects than other classes of antihypertensive agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are recommended as the first-line therapy for patients with hypertension and T2DM in JSH 2014. However, the target BP and the first-line therapy remain controversial because of the paucity of high-quality evidence with consistency. It is suggested that BP management should be tailored for each patient with T2DM, based on tolerability and considerations of comorbidity.

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone [^1135RfsM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Atenolol and chlorthalidone tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol and chlorthalidone.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed dose combination drug is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension. If the fixed dose combination represents the dose appropriate to the individual patient's needs, it may be more convenient than the separate components.

Figure 1.
Eighth Joint National Committee evidence‐based algorithm for the treatment of hypertension. Reproduced with permission from: James et al. ACEI indicates angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; CCB, calcium channel blocker; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure.

The second change is a target of < 140 over 90 mm Hg (instead of < 130 over 80 mm Hg) in patients with DM or chronic kidney disease. This change was based on multiple studies, including the ACtion to COntrol Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) BP trial, which demonstrated no significant benefit in the primary composite end point among patients treated to a SBP goal < 120 mm Hg compared with < 140 mm Hg, despite significant reductions in stroke. –

Patients diagnosed with hypertension should be encouraged to implement lifestyle changes including regular exercise, dietary sodium restriction, moderation of alcohol consumption, and weight loss, regardless of whether pharmacotherapy is needed. When initiating medical therapy, patients without chronic kidney disease can be started on an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker, a thiazide diuretic, or a calcium channel blocker. Alternatives for nonblack patients and those with chronic kidney disease include an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker; however, the combined use of an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker should be avoided.

Most patients will require at least 2 medications to adequately control their BP. The JNC 8 committee recommends 3 strategies to help achieve BP goals: (1) maximize the dose of the initial medication, (2) add a second medication before reaching the maximal dose of the initial medication, or (3) simultaneously start 2 antihypertensive medications from different classes. Because it is important to achieve and maintain the BP goal, patients should be evaluated regularly, with adjustment and addition of medications as needed. If patients remain hypertensive despite adequate treatment with 3 medications or if there is a contraindication to treatment with any of the recommended first‐line antihypertensive agents, then medications from other classes can be used (eg, beta blocker or aldosterone antagonist) or the patient should be referred to a hypertension specialist.

Because the JNC 8 recommendations do not address prehypertension, resistant hypertension, or secondary hypertension, it is reasonable to follow the prior JNC 7 guidelines or those from other international organizations.–

### The goal of blood pressure in the hypertensive patient with diabetes is defined: now the challenge is go from recommendations to practice [^111Zc5CW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

During many years the BP goals recommended in patients with diabetes were more aggressive than in patients without diabetes. Moreover, it was proposed the maximum of "the lower the better" with no threshold. However, the 2009 European Society of Hypertension guidelines proposed that lowering the blood pressure to less than 130/80 mmHg in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events was unsupported by prospective trial data, and that the systolic blood pressure should be lowered to less than 140 mmHg in these patients. Moreover, this reappraisal of the European guidelines addressed the issue of the so- called J-curve and the clinical implications from this phenomenon, subject that has been reviewed recently. The recommendations suggest lowering the SBP/DBP to values within the 130–139/80–85 mmHg range in all hypertensive patients. Several news clinical trials, including a retrospective analysis supported this recommendation. The International Verapamil SR- Trandolapril Study (INVEST) in which the patients were divided into three groups depending on the achieved BP: (1) those who had not reached the control level (SBP > 140 mmHg), (2) those who had reached the standard control level (SBP < 140–130 mmHg) and (3) those on intensive BP control (SBP < 130 mmHg). In patients with non-controlled BP, the risk of death, MI or stroke was as much as 50% higher compared to those with controlled BP (HR 1.46; p < 0.0001). Interestingly, it was observed an increased risk of death due to any cause - about 8% after 30 months and 5 years after the study [adjusted HR: 1.20 (p = 0.06) and 1.15 (p = 0.04), respectively] in patients with intensively controlled BP. Additional analyses revealed that this risk was caused by a higher incidence of death in patients with SBP below 115 mmHg. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk In Diabetes - Blood Pressure Arm (ACCORD-BP) study was designed to evaluate the impact of treatment aimed at intensive lowering of SBP to < 120 mmHg (compared to standard therapy) on the incidence of CV events in 4,733 DM patients. The study enrolled high-risk DM patients: aged > 40 and with coexisting CVD; or aged > 55 with marked atherosclerosis, albuminuria, and LVH; or with at least two risk factors for CVD: dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension, smoking or obesity. After a year of treatment, the mean SBP was 119.3 mmHg in the group managed intensively and 133.5 mmHg in the group on standard therapy, while the mean DBP values were 64.4 and 70.5 mmHg, respectively. The primary endpoint, comprising nonfatal MI or stroke, or death due to CV causes, occurred in 445 patients (1.87% per year in the group on intensive treatment compared with 2.09% of those on standard therapy; p = 0.20). In addition, there were 294 deaths due to any cause (1.28% in the intensive therapy group vs. 1.19% in the standard treatment group; p = 0.55) and 118 due to cardiovascular causes (0.52% vs. 0.49%, respectively; p = 0.74). The incidence of stroke was significantly higher in the group receiving standard treatment (0.53% vs. 0.32%; p = 0.01); a similar relationship was found for non-fatal stroke (0.30% vs. 0.47%; p = 0.03). It was concluded that intensive hypotensive therapy did not significantly reduce the incidence of primary endpoints or the majority of secondary endpoints; however, it was associated with a significant reduction in the total number of strokes (by 41%; HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39–0.89; p = 0.03) and nonfatal strokes (by 37%). In the intensive therapy group, the incidence of adverse complications of treatment (orthostatic hypotension, hyperkalemia, syncope, bradycardia, arrhythmia or renal function impairment) was significantly increased (3.3% vs. 1.3%). Thus, the ACCORD-BP study demonstrated the importance of defines the group of patients in whom significant BP reduction could be particularly dangerous and, on the other hand, those with a high risk of stroke who could benefit most from an intensive hypotensive therapy. Moreover, the ACCORD-BP study confirmed that lowering SBP to below 115 mmHg may be dangerous.

### Controlling hypertension in patients with diabetes… [^116JXd64]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Although the benefits of lifestyle modification are clear, few patients are able to achieve blood pressure control with these interventions alone. The JNC VI guidelines recommend that patients with diabetes be started on both antihypertensive medication and lifestyle modifications when hypertension is diagnosed. JNC VI recommends angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as preferred agents, with calcium channel blockers and low-dose diuretics as alternatives. 8 Pharmacologic Therapy ACE INHIBITORS ACE inhibitors have proved beneficial in patients who have had a myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, or who have diabetic renal disease. ACE inhibitors may provide additional benefits in patients with diabetes. These patients may have impaired fibrinolysis and endothelial dysfunction, which increase their risk of cardiovascular disease. ACE inhibitors have been shown to improve fibrinolysis and endothelial dysfunction.

17, 18 ACE inhibitors have also been shown to increase insulin sensitivity. 4 One area of concern is the use of ACE inhibitors in persons with underlying renal disease, which is common in patients with diabetes. A recent post hoc analysis. DIURETICS Thiazide diuretics have been shown to benefit patients with diabetes and systolic hypertension. The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program trial was initiated to assess the effect of low-dose, diuretic-based antihypertensive treatment on the rates of major cardiovascular events in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension and diabetes. In all three trials, many patients required the addition of an ACE inhibitor or other antihypertensive to the dihydropyridine CCB to achieve target blood pressure goals. The combination of an ACE inhibitor and a dihydropyridine CCB has been shown to reduce proteinuria.

Recently, the Reduction of Endpoints in Non–Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan study was completed. Cardioselective beta blockers are preferred over the non-selective type because the former are associated with less blunting of hypoglycemic awareness and less elevation of lipid and glucose levels. Another alternative in the hypertensive patient with diabetes is the alpha 1 beta blocker carvedilol, which has been shown to cause fewer alterations in lipid and glucose levels compared with traditional beta blockers. 31 Beta-blocker therapy can be advantageous in many patients with diabetes because of its proven ability to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in persons with atherosclerotic heart disease. 6.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^115ogRoy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^1157FLt7]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evidence from randomised trials of pharmacological treatments on long-term blood pressure (BP) reduction is limited. We investigated the antihypertensive drug effects on BP over time and across different participant characteristics.

Methods

We conducted an individual patient-level data meta-analysis of 52 large-scale randomised clinical trials in the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration using mixed models to examine treatment effects on BP over 4years of mean follow-up.

Results

There were 363684 participants (42%women), with baseline mean age = 65 years and mean systolic/diastolic BP = 152/87mm Hg, and among whom 19% were current smokers, 49% had cardiovascular disease, 28% had diabetes and 69% were taking antihypertensive treatment at baseline. Drugs were effective in lowering BP showing maximal effect after 12 months and gradually attenuating towards later years. Based on measures taken ≥ 12 months postrandomisation, mean systolic/diastolic BP difference (95% CI) between more and less intense BP-lowering treatment was -11.1 (-11.3 to -10.8)/-5.6 (-5.7 to -5.4)mm Hg; between active treatment and placebo was -5.1 (-5.3 to -5.0)/-2.3 (-2.4 to -2.2)mm Hg; and between active and control arms for drug comparison trials was -1.4 (-1.5 to -1.3)/-0.6 (-0.7 to -0.6)mm Hg. BP reductions were observed across different baseline BP values and ages, and by sex, history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes and prior antihypertensive treatment use.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that BP-lowering pharmacotherapy is effective in lowering BP, up to 4years on average, in people with different characteristics. Appropriate treatment strategies are needed to sustain substantive long-term BP reductions.

Observational and interventional studies have shown that intensified blood pressure (BP) reduction can benefit people with diabetes. Because of their special haemodynamic properties, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers are recommended. The results of the BP arm of the ADVANCE study strongly support the recently updated European Society of Cardiology/European Association of Diabetes recommendations for the treatment of BP in people with diabetes, which recommend a target systolic/diastolic BP of 130/80mmHg with few exceptions, and a fixed combination of an RAAS blocker with a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker as first-line treatment.

### A practical approach to hypertension management in diabetes [^113SAXGP]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Epidemiology

Hypertension is twice as common in patients with diabetes than in patients without diabetes. Hypertension (defined as at least 140/90 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension) in an overweight or obese asymptomatic person is also one of the criteria to test for diabetes or prediabetes, and is thus, an important risk factor for diabetes. Individuals aged 55 years or older have a 90% chance of developing hypertension, and approximately 70% of patients with diabetes over the age of 40 years also have hypertension. Eight out of ten diabetes patients are affected by CV-related issues, leading to death. Hence, treating hypertension in diabetes should be a primary consideration when assessing the medical priorities of patients with diabetes.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115v8d8z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension management in older adults with diabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes and hypertension, we recommend that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker should be the first-line therapy, and Technical remark: If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. Therefore, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be the first-line therapy used for the treatment of hypertension in older patients with diabetes and should be included when more than one medication is needed, and these two drug classes should not be used together, especially in patients with CKD, due to increased risks of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. Two drugs should be started together if the initial BP is ≥ 160/100 mm Hg. Because hypertension involves a volume component in many patients with diabetes, a thiazide diuretic is commonly recommended as the third drug unless the eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², in which case a loop diuretic might be more appropriate. If coronary artery disease is significant, a beta-blocker may be appropriate and can be added as a fourth drug to a prior three-drug regimen; if a beta-blocker is used, carvedilol has been shown to have fewer metabolic effects than metoprolol. Notably, when BP is not controlled with three or more medications, referral to a hypertension specialist is indicated.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112V7dMV]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Recommendations for the treatment of confirmed hypertension in nonpregnant people with diabetes — initial blood pressure (BP) determines the number of agents and stepwise escalation. Initial BP ≥ 130/80 and < 150/90 mmHg — start one agent, whereas initial BP ≥ 150/90 mmHg — start two agents. One‑agent options include start ACEi or ARB or CCB† or diuretic‡; for two‑drug initiation, options include start two drugs from ACEi or ARB, CCB† or diuretic‡ or start ACEi or ARB and CCB† or diuretic‡. Assess BP management and adverse effects; if not meeting goal, add agent from complementary drug class (ACEi or ARB; CCB†; Diuretic‡), and for adverse effects, consider change to alternative medication (ACEi or ARB; CCB†; Diuretic‡). If not meeting goal on two agents and then not meeting goal or adverse effects using a drug from each of three classes, consider addition of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and refer to specialist with expertise in BP management; an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is suggested for coronary artery disease (CAD) or urine albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio 30–299 mg/g creatinine and is strongly recommended for urine albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine.

### Amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil [^11733D4y]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals.

Patients with moderate or severe hypertension are at relatively high risk for cardiovascular events (such as strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure), kidney failure, and vision problems, so prompt treatment is clinically relevant. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and should be shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient's risk.

### Management of hypertension in patients with diabetes: the place of angiotensin-II receptor blockers [^115jhxCT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an important cardiovascular (CV) risk factor in patients with diabetes mellitus. In this setting, tight control of blood pressure (BP) significantly reduces CV morbidity and mortality. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was superior to a 0.7% decrease in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as far as reducing morbidity and mortality was concerned. In the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study, the risk of CV events decreased by 51% among patients with type 2 diabetes randomized to the lower BP level. Based on these findings, contemporary treatment guidelines recommend a target SBP/diastolic blood pressure of < 130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^1151Dbmu]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

AACE 2023 type 2 diabetes hypertension targets and treatment recommend that AACE has set a specific BP goal for the majority of adults with T2D as < 130 mm Hg with a diastolic BP goal of < 80 mm Hg, with a lower target considered for persons with micro- or macroalbuminuria, moderate/high risk for or with established ASCVD, peripheral vascular disease, or retinopathy, and recognition that some persons with T2D may not tolerate a goal of < 130/80 mm Hg. Lifestyle therapy is part of initial management, as exercise several times per week is important because there are reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP with endurance and dynamic resistance training, and Mediterranean diets have been demonstrated to lower BP. Pharmacologic therapy specifies that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered first-line therapies for HTN in persons with T2D, particularly in those with DKD; there is no additional benefit for coadministration of an ACEI and an ARB together, and combination may cause harm, an ARB can substitute for ACEI intolerance, and if the initial BP is > 150/100 mm Hg, dual therapy may need to be used at the outset.

### Initial monotherapy and combination therapy and hypertension control the first year [^113YD1Xp]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Initial antihypertensive therapy with single-pill combinations produced more rapid blood pressure control than initial monotherapy in clinical trials. Other studies reported better cardiovascular outcomes in patients achieving lower blood pressure during the first treatment year. We assessed the effectiveness of initial antihypertensive monotherapy, free combinations, and single-pill combinations in controlling untreated, uncontrolled hypertensives during their first treatment year. Electronic record data were obtained from 180 practice sites; 106 621 hypertensive patients seen from January 2004 to June 2009 had uncontrolled blood pressure, were untreated for ≥ 6 months before therapy, and had ≥ 1 one-year follow-up blood pressure data. Control was determined by the first follow-up visit with blood pressure < 140/ < 90 mm Hg for patients without diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease and < 130/ < 80 mm Hg for patients with either or both conditions. Multivariable hazards regression ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for time to control were calculated, adjusting for age, sex, baseline blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, initial therapy, final blood pressure medication number, and therapeutic inertia. Patients on initial single-pill combinations (N = 9194) were more likely to have stage 2 hypertension than those on free combinations (N = 18 328) or monotherapy (N = 79 099; all P < 0.001). Initial therapy with single-pill combinations (HR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.47–1.58]) provided better hypertension control in the first year than free combinations (HR, 1.34; [95% CI, 1.31–1.37]) or monotherapy (reference) with benefits in black and white patients. Greater use of single-pill combinations as initial therapy may improve hypertension control and cardiovascular outcomes in the first treatment year.

### Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes… [^11293zKp]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Treatment algorithm: antihypertensive therapy in the patient with diabetes. In patients with a creatinine level of 1. 8 mg/dL or greater, thiazide diuretics are not effective and loop diuretics may be substituted. ARBs indicates angiotensin receptor blockers; ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; MI, myocardial infarction. Recent studies have shown the beneficial effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker 37, 38 and an angiotensin-converting enzyme/diuretic combination39 in reduction of primary and secondary strokes in high-risk patients, including those with diabetes. The recent Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial 40 also showed that treatments using a diuretic and lowering systolic blood pressure were very important strategies to reduce stroke incidence in patients with diabetes. Subjects were followed for an average of 2 years. In the irbesartan group vs placebo, there was a 39% reduction in the development rate of clinical proteinuria, while in the irbesartan group there was a 70% reduction in the primary end point. Return to a normal UAER, defined as a UAER less than 20 µg/min, was 34% more frequent among patients treated with irbesartan, 300 mg/d, than among patients in the placebo group. The results of this study demonstrate that the ARB irbesartan, 300 mg/d, can delay progression of microalbuminuria to clinical proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. Important elements of the treatment plan for diabetic nephropathy include meticulous blood pressure control and reduction in urine protein excretion to below 1 g/d. In this regard, ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs are of considerable importance. Currently, in type 1 diabetic nephropathy, ACE inhibitors remain the initial agents of choice, and if this class of drugs is poorly tolerated, ARBs can be substituted.

In the instance of type 2 diabetic nephropathy, the available evidence supports the preferential use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. However, to accomplish blood pressure goals in patients with diabetes and hypertension often requires the use of a low-dose diuretic as part of the treatment regimen40, 63.

### A simplified approach to the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension: a cluster randomized, controlled trial [^114AzAnR]. Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Notwithstanding the availability of antihypertensive drugs and practice guidelines, blood pressure control remains suboptimal. The complexity of current treatment guidelines may contribute to this problem. To determine whether a simplified treatment algorithm is more effective than guideline-based management, we studied 45 family practices in southwestern Ontario, Canada, using a cluster randomization trial comparing the simplified treatment algorithm with the Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines. The simplified treatment algorithm consisted of the following: (1) initial therapy with a low-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretic or angiotensin receptor blocker/diuretic combination; (2) up-titration of combination therapy to the highest dose; (3) addition of a calcium channel blocker and up-titration; and (4) addition of a non-first-line antihypertensive agent. The proportion of patients treated to target blood pressure (systolic blood pressure < 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg for patients without diabetes mellitus or systolic blood pressure < 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg for diabetic patients) at 6 months was analyzed at the practice level. The proportion of patients achieving target was significantly higher in the intervention group (64.7% versus 52.7%; absolute difference: 12.0%; 95% CI: 1.5% to 22.4%; P = 0.026). Multivariate analysis of patient-level data showed that assignment to the intervention arm increased the chance of reaching the target by 20% (P = 0.028), when adjusted for other covariates. In conclusion, the Simplified Treatment Intervention to Control Hypertension Study indicates that a simplified antihypertensive algorithm using initial low-dose fixed-dose combination therapy is superior to guideline-based practice for the management of hypertension.

In type 1 diabetes, a similar blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg is recommended, and individualized treatment goals may be < 120/80 mmHg, but this is less supported by the evidence and may increase adverse events.

### Combination therapy versus monotherapy as initial treatment for stage 2 hypertension: a prespecified subgroup analysis of a community-based, randomized, open-label trial [^115nvs2k]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines suggest consideration of initial combination therapy for patients with stage 2 hypertension, but rates of hypertension treatment and control in clinical practice vary according to age, race, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

Objective

This was a prespecified subgroup analysis of one of the primary efficacy end points-mean change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 6 weeks -in a previously published community-based, randomized, open-label trial comparing valsartan monotherapy with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination therapy as initial treatment for high-risk patients with stage 2 hypertension.

Methods

Eligible participants with stage 2 hypertension (SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 100 mm Hg) were treated with valsartan 160 mg/d or valsartan/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg/d for 2 weeks, followed by forced titration to valsartan 320 mg/d or valsartan/HCTZ 320/12.5 mg/d for an additional 4 weeks. In addition to the primary blood pressure end point (change in SBP at 6 weeks), secondary blood pressure end points at 6 weeks included changes in DBP and the proportion of patients achieving a blood pressure control threshold of < 140/90 mm Hg (< 130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes), as recommended by the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7). The subgroups of interest were women, blacks, Hispanics, the elderly (age ≥ 65 years), patients with diabetes, smokers, and lean, overweight, and obese subjects (BMI < 25, 25- < 30, and = 30 kg/m(2), respectively).

Results

The randomized trial included 1668 patients (756 [45.3%] female, 392 [23.5%] black, 109 [6.5%] Hispanic, 220 [13.2%] elderly, 970 of 1641 [59.1%] obese, 166 [10.0%] with diabetes, 467 [28.0%] smokers) with stage 2 hypertension. Among those allocated to combination therapy compared with monotherapy, the mean (SD) change in SBP at 6 weeks was -27.4 (18.5) and -19.3 (17.7) mm Hg in women, -21.4 (17.6) and -12.6 (18.5) mm Hg in black subjects, -21.7 (17.6) and -16.3 (16.5) mm Hg in Hispanic subjects, -25.5 (20.2) and -16.9 (17.9) mm Hg in the elderly, and -23.6 (18.1) and -15.9 (16.2) mm Hg in obese subjects. With the exception of the results for Hispanics, all comparisons of combination therapy and monotherapy were statistically significant (P ≤ 0.01). A higher proportion of those receiving valsartan/ HCTZ compared with valsartan monotherapy reached the JNC 7-defined blood pressure goal (44.5% vs 29.1%, respectively; P < 0.001). This pattern was seen consistently in most subgroups analyzed, including men (41.8% vs 27.9%; P < 0.001), women (47.8% vs 30.5%; P < 0.001), white subjects (46.4% vs 33.8%; P < 0.001), black subjects (41.8% vs 19.1%; P < 0.001), those aged < 65 years (44.6% vs 29.7%; P < 0.001), those aged ≥ 65 years (43.9% vs 24.5%; P = 0.004), overweight subjects (49.0% vs 31.2%; P < 0.001), and obese subjects (41.4% vs 26.0%; P < 0.001). In the entire study cohort, patients assigned to combination therapy had a significantly higher incidence of dizziness compared with those assigned to monotherapy (8.5% vs 4.7%; P = 0.002); however, there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of adverse events between treatment groups in the prespecified subgroups.

Conclusions

Across various subgroups of patients with stage 2 hypertension, combination therapy was consistently associated with a significantly greater reduction in SBP than monotherapy. With the exception of a significantly greater increase in dizziness compared with monotherapy, combination therapy was well tolerated.

### Initial assessment, surveillance, and management of blood pressure in patients receiving vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway inhibitors [^113ug1n6]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

The Goal BP in Patients Receiving VSP Inhibitor Therapy Is Less Than 140/90 mmHg.

The primary goal in this setting is to prevent hypertension-related toxic effects. The recommendation for maintaining BP less than 140/90 mmHg is based on prudence and consistency with JNC guidelines. For some patients in the higher added risk cohort, targets should be adjusted lower. For example, for patients with diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease, a goal BP of less than 130/80 mmHg is the current public health recommendation. For the high- and higher-risk patients, BP should be less than 140/90 mmHg before initiating VSP inhibitor therapy. If the patient reports already taking antihypertensive therapy, adherence to the regimen should be verified. If the patient is adherent and could tolerate, the dose should be titrated to achieve the 140/90 mmHg goal. If the dose is already the maximum, a second agent should be added and titrated appropriately with no less than weekly follow-up. The pace at which antihypertensive therapy is titrated is determined by the treating physician's balancing risks for delaying anticancer therapy with the threat of cardiovascular complications in the setting of incompletely controlled cardiovascular risks.

If the patient is not receiving antihypertensive therapy, begin it intending to titrate to reduce BP to goal. Often, VSP inhibitor therapy should be started shortly after the initial oncology evaluation. Shorter-acting agents with close follow-up (as frequently as every 2–4 days) might achieve the goal BP quickly, and the patient's BP could then be maintained with an equivalent dose of a longer-acting agent. If the BP goal is not achieved, it may not be necessary to delay starting VSP inhibitor therapy until antihypertensive therapy is fully titrated, as long as the BP is below the level that is likely to be associated with acute complications. Before beginning VSP inhibitor therapy, obtain objective evidence of improving BP control and plan to continue titration of the antihypertensive agent to the numerical goal as VSP inhibitor therapy begins. If there is any difficulty making progress toward achieving the goal BP of less than 140/90 mmHg, consultation with the local hypertension specialist should be obtained promptly.

Hypertension/Blood Pressure Control

Screening and diagnosis

Blood pressure should be measured at every routine diabetes visit. Patients found to have systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg should have blood pressure confirmed on a separate day. Repeat systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg confirms a diagnosis of hypertension. (C)

Goals

Patients with diabetes should be treated to a systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg. (C)
Patients with diabetes should be treated to a diastolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg. (B)

Treatment

Patients with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mmHg may be given lifestyle therapy alone for a maximum of 3 months and then, if targets are not achieved, treated with addition of pharmacological agents. (E)
Patients with more severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg) at diagnosis or follow-up should receive pharmacologic therapy in addition to lifestyle therapy. (A)
Pharmacologic therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should be with a regimen that includes either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. If needed to achieve blood pressure targets, a thiazide diuretic should be added to those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (see below) ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² and a loop diuretic for those with an estimated GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m². (C)
Multiple drug therapy (two or more agents at maximal doses) is generally required to achieve blood pressure targets. (B)
If ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, kidney function and serum potassium levels should be closely monitored. (E)
In pregnant patients with diabetes and chronic hypertension, blood pressure target goals of 110–129/65–79 mmHg are suggested in the interest of long-term maternal health and minimizing impaired fetal growth. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are contraindicated during pregnancy. (E)

### Insufficient control of blood pressure and incident diabetes [^11168f85]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this study, for the first time we demonstrate that suboptimal control of blood pressure is a strong predictor of incident type 2 diabetes in initially normoglycemic, hypertensive individuals after a follow-up of at least 2 years on antihypertensive treatment. This effect is independent of age, baseline fasting glucose, presence of metabolic syndrome, and type of antihypertensive therapy. Prescription of β-blockers, but not of thiazides, is also strongly and independently associated with new onset of diabetes.

Our findings extend previous observations indicating that incident type 2 diabetes is more frequent in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects. In particular, Conen et al. recently reported a clear correlation between higher incidence of type 2 diabetes and blood pressure levels in a large population of women, based on modified categories from the 2007 ESH/ESC guidelines.

### Blood pressure guidelines-where are we now? [^115pucha]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

In June 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) updated its recommendations on the management of patients with hypertension (published in 2004), in light of "significant new data" relating to drug treatment.1,2 The update, published in collaboration with the British Hypertension Society (BHS), recommended first-line use of a calcium-channel blocker or a thiazide-type diuretic in patients aged over 55 years or an ACE inhibitor in those aged under 55 years, and advised that beta-blockers should no longer be used for routine initial therapy.1 Recently published data from England suggest that primary care prescribing has changed in line with this new guideline.3 However, interpretation of the evidence that underpins some of the key recommendations is open to debate, particularly as there are differences from some other major guidelines in the recommendations for first-line therapy. Here we consider the updated NICE guideline, the rationale for its treatment recommendations, and the subsequent change in clinical practice. In particular, we focus on the initial drug management of adults without conditions such as diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease that would in themselves be a key determinant of management.

### The impact of JNC-VI guidelines on treatment recommendations in the US population [^115XhywC]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Using epidemiological and clinical trial evidence, the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) updated previous guidelines to suggest that in addition to blood pressure, decisions on initial treatment should emphasize absolute cardiovascular disease risk. We estimated the impact of using cardiovascular disease risk on treatment recommendations for the US population using data from 16 527 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In the US population ≥ 20 years of age, 36% (62 million) had high-normal blood pressure or greater (systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg/ ≥ 85 mm Hg) or were taking antihypertensive medication. Of this population, 5.1% (3.2 million) were stratified into risk group A (no cardiovascular disease risk factors or prevalent cardiovascular disease), 66.3% (41.4 million) into risk group B (≥ 1 major risk factor), and 28.6% (17.9 million) into risk group C (diabetes mellitus, clinical cardiovascular disease, target organ damage). Also, 26% of this group (16.2 million) had high-normal blood pressure and were in risk groups A or B, a context in which vigorous lifestyle modification is recommended in the JNC-VI guidelines. Additionally, 11% (7.0 million) had high-normal blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, 130 to 139 mm Hg/85 to 89 mm Hg, respectively) or stage-1 hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg/90 to 99 mm Hg), and at least 1 factor, placing them in risk group C, but they were not currently on antihypertensive medication. JNC-VI, but not previous JNC guidelines, specifically recommends drug therapy as initial treatment for these patients. We conclude that JNC-VI refines cardiovascular risk and enfranchises more Americans to undertake more aggressive risk reduction maneuvers.

### Pharmacologic management of hypertension in patients with diabetes [^115dwMNa]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with diabetes, and adequate control of blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Patients with diabetes should achieve a target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may slow progression to kidney failure and cardiovascular mortality; these agents are the preferred therapy for managing coexisting diabetes and hypertension. Angiotensin receptor blockers can prevent progression of diabetic kidney disease and are a first-line alternative for patients intolerant of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Thiazide diuretics provide additional antihypertensive effects when combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. With lower doses of these drugs, the risk of clinically significant metabolic alterations is minimal. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also have beneficial effects in managing hypertension in patients with diabetes. Beta blockers reduce cardiovascular events and are useful in a multidrug regimen. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be reserved for patients intolerant of preferred agents or those who need additional therapy to achieve target blood pressure. Many patients with diabetes require combination therapy with multiple antihypertensive agents.

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone (Tenoretic) [^1153GcYH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

TENORETIC is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol and chlorthalidone.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed dose combination drug is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension. If the fixed dose combination represents the dose appropriate to the individual patient's needs, it may be more convenient than the separate components.

### Diabetes: treating hypertension [^1154yvoe]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Between 2007 and 2010, the age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension in US adults with diabetes was 59%, more than double the prevalence in those without diabetes. Major cardiac events occur in approximately 5% of people with diabetes and untreated hypertension each year, and the risk is higher in those with other risk factors, such as diabetic nephropathy.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of different blood pressure targets in people with diabetes and hypertension? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following intervention: more intensive (lower) blood pressure targets versus less intensive (higher) targets in people with diabetes and hypertension.

Hypertension targets and intervention timing in older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) — if an older adult has DM and requires medical therapy for hypertension, then the target blood pressure should be less than 140/90 mmHg if it is tolerated; systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mmHg is not associated with better CVD outcomes than blood pressure control between 130 and 140 mmHg, and there is potential harm in lowering systolic blood pressure to less than 120 mmHg in older adults with type 2 DM; older adults with DM and hypertension should be offered a therapeutic intervention to lower blood pressure within 3 months if systolic blood pressure is 140 to 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure is 90 to 100 mmHg or within 1 month if blood pressure is greater than 160/ 100 mmHg.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### A practical approach to hypertension management in diabetes [^1144yYYm]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is one of the most important comorbidities of diabetes, contributing significantly to death and disability and leads to macrovascular and microvascular complications. When assessing the medical priorities for patients with diabetes, treating hypertension should be a primary consideration. Practical approaches to hypertension in diabetes, including individualized targets are discussed, as per stage and complication of diabetes, according to current studies and guidelines. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the most effective drugs for treating hypertension in diabetes, in the absence of contraindications. Calcium antagonists or diuretics are acceptable as second-line agents. Once the target is achieved, antihypertensive drugs should be continued. Newer antidiabetes medications such as sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) have antihypertensive properties and may assist in treatment decision-making.

### Clinical diagnosis and management of hypertension compared with the Joint National Committee 8 panelists' recommendations [^117QEfHc]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The panelists of the Joint National Committee recently published new recommendations for the management of hypertension. Our study aims to evaluate how current practice compares.

Hypothesis

Current practice likely deviates from the recent JNC 8 panelists' recommendations.

Methods

A survey was sent to cardiology providers at 3 academic medical centers: Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona; and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Providers were asked to select which blood-pressure goal would be deemed appropriate in various cases based on individual practice in both the maintenance of patients already on therapy as well as threshold of when to initiate therapy. Comparisons with current recommendations were made, as well as geographic location and level of experience.

Results

A total of 251 survey requests were sent (May 2014), and 77 responses (30.7%) were received. Cardiologists tended not to practice according to the new guidelines, with most variation seen in patients age > 60 years without comorbidities on active treatment. Providers' selection of initial pharmacologic agents in non-African American patients, African American patients, and patients with diabetes mellitus reflected congruency with guidelines.

Conclusions

Our study found that clinical practice does not correlate well with the new blood-pressure goal recommendations published by the Joint National Committee 8 panelists, particularly in patients age > 60 years. Practitioners are likely to follow the recommendations in regard to pharmacologic management.

Although information concerning the attainment of goal blood pressure for patients commencing antihypertensive therapy is available from controlled trials, no studies have examined this issue in the context of typical clinical practice.

Objective

To examine attainment of blood pressure control over time in patients initiating antihypertensive therapy in clinical practice.

Methods

Using an electronic medical records database, we identified all adults with systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 140/90 mm Hg or higher who initiated antihypertensive drug therapy. Subjects were stratified into subgroups based on the presence of high-risk conditions or characteristics described by the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in their seventh report as "compelling indications" (eg, diabetes) or "special situations" (eg, obesity). Blood pressure control was examined in terms of goal attainment and reductions in blood pressure using last available readings at days 90, 180, and 360, following therapy initiation.

Results

Among the 10,345 study subjects, 47% had compelling indications and 39% had special situations. In the former group, 62% (95% CI 61 to 64) of patients with Stage 1 hypertension (140–159/90–99 mm Hg) attained blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg by day 360; among those with Stage 2 hypertension (≥ 160/100 mm Hg), the corresponding figure was 48% (95% CI 46 to 50). In the latter group, 64% (95% CI 61 to 66) and 55% (95% CI 53 to 57) of patients with Stage 1 and Stage 2 hypertension, respectively, attained blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg by day 360. Among those without high-risk conditions, these percentages were 63% (95% CI 59 to 67) and 55% (95% CI 52 to 59). Among patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, 25% (95% CI 24 to 26) attained blood pressure less than 130/80 mm Hg by day 360.

Conclusions

Many patients starting antihypertensive therapy in clinical practice fail to achieve blood pressure control within the first year. Control is no better, and perhaps worse, among patients at highest risk of adverse outcomes.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, pharmacotherapy, JNC8 2014 guidelines recommend to initiate a thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, ACEi, or ARB as initial antihypertensive treatment in the general nonblack population, including patients with diabetes mellitus.

Hypertension and blood pressure management — screening and diagnosis in diabetes states that blood pressure should be measured at every routine clinical visit, or at least every 6 months; individuals with elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure 120–129 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg) should have repeat measurements including on a separate day to diagnose hypertension; hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg based on an average of two or more measurements on two or more occasions; individuals with blood pressure ≥ 180/110 mmHg and cardiovascular disease could be diagnosed with hypertension at a single visit.
