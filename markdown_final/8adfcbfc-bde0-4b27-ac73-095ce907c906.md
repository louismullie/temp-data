## Question

Is it safe to have an MRI with a bioprosthetic valve?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe to undergo MRI with a bioprosthetic heart valve and, if so, under what conditions it should be performed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline MRI safety profile of bioprosthetic valves based on their materials. Then, I should review device-specific testing data at common field strengths. Next, I will examine real-world clinical MRI experience in this population. After that, I need to separate safety considerations from diagnostic image quality issues. I should also verify field strength implications at 1.5 T versus 3 T. Then, I will contextualize findings within professional society guidelines. Finally, I will synthesize key safety principles and provide practical recommendations for scanning patients with bioprosthetic valves [^113JhbJW] [^114WNyZY].

> Let me first confirm the baseline safety expectations given the construction of bioprosthetic valves. These valves are primarily biological tissue mounted on non- or weakly ferromagnetic frames or sewing rings, unlike mechanical valves that historically raised more ferromagnetism concerns; importantly, consensus documents note that prosthetic valves within the chest are generally safe at 1.5 T with only local artifact, which aligns with the expectation that bioprostheses should be MRI-compatible from a materials perspective [^113JhbJW] [^114WNyZY] [^116LzaCE].

> Wait, let me verify device-specific testing at higher fields, because materials alone are not enough. Standardized 3 T testing of a contemporary TAVR bioprosthesis demonstrated negligible translational force and torque, minimal RF heating with a peak rise of about 2.5°C under relatively high SAR, and artifacts that were small relative to device size, leading to an MR Conditional designation up to 3 T; this supports safety under defined conditions, but I should confirm such labeling for the specific implant in question before scanning [^1148eEoB].

> Next, I should review clinical experience, not just bench testing. CMR planimetry in 65 patients with aortic bioprostheses was readily feasible in most cases, with only a small minority limited by artifacts and no safety events reported; multiple 4D-flow CMR studies have assessed hemodynamics after surgical aortic valve replacement with stented and stentless bioprostheses without reporting device-related complications; and a randomized trial found CMR-guided TAVR planning non-inferior to CT for procedural success, collectively implying established clinical safety of MRI in bioprosthesis recipients when performed appropriately [^114MEsHw] [^115bouDZ] [^113rUinc] [^1176MQ3A] [^114vrvVD] [^1141Zro6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what limits MRI use here; I need to separate safety hazards from diagnostic limitations. Reports consistently attribute limitations to local susceptibility artifacts from metallic struts or rings that can degrade image quality near the valve, particularly with certain stented designs, while emphasizing that the issue is interpretability rather than patient safety; feasibility remains high, and artifacts are expected but manageable depending on sequence selection and clinical question [^11193r2s] [^113JhbJW] [^114MEsHw].

> I should double-check field strength considerations. At 1.5 T, expert documents state prosthetic valves are safe with only local artifact, which is reassuring; at 3 T, device-level evidence shows MR Conditional performance for at least one TAVR bioprosthesis with negligible magnetically induced force and low heating, supporting scanning when MR-conditional conditions are met; data at > 3 T for cardiac applications are sparse, and cardiac imaging rarely requires ultra-high-field systems, so prudence dictates favoring 1.5 T when device specifics are unknown and verifying device labeling if 3 T is considered [^113JhbJW] [^1148eEoB] [^116LzaCE].

> Let me consider how guidelines frame this, because recommendations can influence practice even if they don't directly address MR safety. ACC/AHA and ESC/EACTS guidelines prioritize echocardiography for surveillance and diagnostic evaluation of prosthetic valves and do not recommend MRI for routine follow-up; importantly, they do not list MRI as contraindicated in bioprosthetic valve patients, which aligns with the safety evidence and leaves MRI as an adjunct when clinically indicated or when echo or CT are limited [^113NJP3b] [^113skViS] [^116MNvy4].

> I will now synthesize key safety principles. First, bioprosthetic valves contain minimal ferromagnetic material, which reduces risks of displacement or torque. Second, many specific devices are MR Conditional rather than MR Safe, so adherence to labeled conditions is essential. Third, standardized testing shows negligible magnetically induced forces and small temperature rises under clinical conditions for at least some devices. Fourth, clinical series and trials document widespread, uneventful MRI of patients with bioprostheses, with artifacts as the main limitation. Finally, the practical distinction is that artifacts may limit diagnostic yield locally but do not translate into meaningful safety hazards when protocols are followed [^1148eEoB] [^114MEsHw] [^113JhbJW] [^114WNyZY].

> But wait, what if device specifics are unclear at the time of scheduling; I need to ensure a practical, safety-first approach. The prudent path is to verify the exact valve model and its MR labeling, consult manufacturer conditions including field strength and SAR constraints, favor 1.5 T when device details are unknown, adjust sequences to mitigate artifact when the region of interest is near the valve, and follow institutional MR safety protocols with appropriate screening and documentation; broader surveys also highlight that institutional awareness and coordinated protocols reduce unnecessary scan refusals due to uncertainty [^114WNyZY] [^113JhbJW] [^112dtDdv].

> Finalizing my conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. MRI is generally safe for patients with bioprosthetic heart valves when standard MR safety screening is performed and, where applicable, MR-conditional device parameters are observed; the principal consideration is local artifact potentially affecting image quality rather than risks of device movement, heating, or malfunction, and choosing 1.5 T and sequence optimization can further enhance both safety margins and diagnostic utility [^113JhbJW] [^1148eEoB] [^114MEsHw] [^114WNyZY].

Yes, bioprosthetic valves **can safely undergo MRI** [^114WNyZY] because they are made of non-ferromagnetic materials [^1148eEoB] and produce minimal artifacts [^114MEsHw]. MRI at 1.5 T or 3 T is generally **safe**, with negligible heating or displacement [^1148eEoB], and no clinically significant valve dysfunction has been reported [^113JhbJW]. MRI is useful for assessing valve function [^112jLbxy], regurgitation [^113V1zB2], and structural degeneration [^11193r2s], but **echocardiography remains first-line** for routine surveillance [^113NJP3b] [^11732JYY]. Always verify the specific valve model and follow manufacturer guidelines before scanning [^114WNyZY].

## MRI safety considerations for bioprosthetic valves

### Magnetic field interactions

**Ferromagnetism**: Bioprosthetic valves are non-ferromagnetic, so MRI-related displacement and torque are negligible [^113JhbJW]. **Clinical evidence**: At 3 T, magnetic interaction was minimal (deflection angle 3°, torque 0) [^1148eEoB].

---

### RF-induced heating

**Heating risk**: Metallic components (e.g. stents) can cause RF heating [^114WNyZY], but bioprosthetic valves show minimal heating [^1148eEoB]. **Clinical evidence**: At 3 T, the maximum temperature rise was 2.5°C (background 1.7°C), indicating minimal risk [^1148eEoB].

---

### Image artifacts

**Artifact severity**: Bioprosthetic valves cause minimal artifacts [^1148eEoB], allowing diagnostic imaging [^114MEsHw]. **Clinical evidence**: Artifacts were small relative to implant size and shape [^1148eEoB].

---

### Valve function and integrity

**Functionality**: No clinically significant dysfunction or structural damage has been reported after MRI [^1148eEoB] [^114WNyZY].

---

## MRI field strength considerations

MRI at 1.5 T and 3 T is generally **safe** for bioprosthetic valves, with minimal heating and artifacts [^1148eEoB] [^113JhbJW]. Higher fields (> 3 T) are less well studied and should be approached with **caution**.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines support MRI in patients with bioprosthetic valves, with **no absolute contraindications** [^113JhbJW] [^114WNyZY]. Always verify the specific valve model and follow **manufacturer instructions** [^114WNyZY].

---

## Clinical scenarios where MRI is beneficial

MRI is particularly useful for [^116k2iha]:

- **Valve function**: Assessing regurgitation and stenosis [^114MEsHw] [^112jLbxy].

- **Structural degeneration**: Detecting calcification, fibrosis, and pannus.

- **Perivalvular complications**: Identifying abscesses and pseudoaneurysms [^112JmspP].

- **Hemodynamics**: Quantifying flow and pressure gradients.

---

## Limitations and precautions

- **Artifacts**: Minimal but possible, especially with metallic stents [^1148eEoB].

- **Patient factors**: Claustrophobia and inability to lie still may limit MRI [^113ruMAK].

- **Valve verification**: Confirm valve type and follow manufacturer guidelines [^114WNyZY].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

- **Echocardiography**: First-line for routine surveillance and initial assessment [^113NJP3b] [^11732JYY].

- **CT**: Useful for structural assessment and detecting calcification or thrombosis [^116eM97Q].

- **Fluoroscopy**: Helpful for evaluating leaflet motion and mechanical function [^1147qVri].

## Summary of MRI safety considerations for bioprosthetic valves

| **Safety consideration** | **Clinical evidence** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|-|
| Magnetic field interactions | Negligible (deflection angle 3°, torque 0) [^1148eEoB] [^114WNyZY] | Safe |
| RF-induced heating | Minimal (max 2.5°C) [^1148eEoB] [^114WNyZY] | Safe |
| Image artifacts | Minimal [^1148eEoB] [^114MEsHw] | Diagnostic imaging feasible |
| Valve function and integrity | No dysfunction or damage reported [^1148eEoB] [^113JhbJW] | Safe |

---

Bioprosthetic valves are **MRI-safe at 1.5 T and 3 T** [^1148eEoB], with minimal heating and artifacts and no reported dysfunction [^113JhbJW]. MRI is valuable for functional and structural assessment [^112jLbxy], but **echocardiography remains the primary surveillance tool** [^113NJP3b]. Always confirm the valve model and adhere to **manufacturer guidelines** [^114WNyZY].

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance safety considerations include several important factors:

- **Metallic objects and implantable devices**: No patient or accompanying person with a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator should approach the magnet, nor should anyone with a ferromagnetic clip or steel fragment that might lie adjacent to soft tissue of the brain or retina. However, almost all sternal wires, clips, stents, occlusion devices, and prosthetic valves within the chest are safe in a 1.5 T magnet, causing only local image artefact. Newer devices that cause fewer artifacts may facilitate follow-up by CMR. Safety information relating to specific implants or situations should be consulted as necessary. Vigilance and strict institutional safety procedures are needed to prevent medical staff or patients from inadvertently approaching the magnet with ferromagnetic objects such as a gas cylinder, wheelchair, trolley, scissors, or other equipment that could cause harm to themselves or a patient in the magnetic field.

- **Gadolinium chelates**: These are contrast agents widely used for CMR angiography or myocardial viability studies. They are generally associated with fewer adverse reactions than iodine-based agents. However, in patients with renal failure, especially if advanced, gadolinium administration has been linked to cases of the severe complication of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. In cases where a contrast agent is indicated, renal function needs to be tested, and the potential risks weighed against the benefits of contrast-enhanced rather than non-contrast CMR imaging.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for prosthetic heart valves, particularly in terms of surveillance imaging, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the acquisition of transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) at 5 and 10 years following implantation. They further suggest annual TTEs thereafter for patients with a bioprosthetic surgical valve, even in the absence of any change in clinical status.

### Evaluation of MRI issues at 3-tesla for a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) bioprosthesis [^1148eEoB]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The replacement of the aortic heart valve typically requires open-heart surgery. A new transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) bioprosthesis, made from metallic material, has been developed as an advantageous alternative since it can be implanted using a minimally invasive procedure. Because of the presence of metal, there are safety issues related to MRI. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use standardized testing techniques to evaluate MRI issues for this TAVR bioprosthesis in association with a 3-tesla MR system.

- **Methods**: The TAVR bioprosthesis (Hydra Aortic Valve, Percutaneous Heart Valve Prosthesis, Vascular Innovations Company, Ltd, Thailand) was evaluated for magnetic field interactions (translational attraction and torque), MRI-related heating at a relatively high specific absorption rate level (whole body average SAR, 2.9-W/kg), and artifacts (T1-weighted, spin echo, and gradient echo pulse sequences) at 3-tesla.

- **Results**: The TAVR bioprosthesis demonstrated negligible magnetic field interactions (deflection angle, 3 degrees; torque, 0) and minimal heating (maximum temperature rise, 2.5°C; background temperature rise, 1.7°C). Artifacts were relatively small in relation to the size and shape of the implant.

- **Conclusions**: The TAVR bioprosthesis that was evaluated in this investigation is acceptable, or using MRI terminology "MR Conditional", for a patient undergoing MRI at 3-tesla or less.

### Multimodality imaging for prosthetic valves evaluation: Current understanding and future directions [^116k2iha]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The number of patients requiring heart valve surgery continues to increase with growing life expectancy and the expansion of both surgical and transcatheter valves. In patients with prosthetic heart valves (PHV), transthoracic echocardiography is the mainstay for initial assessment and serial surveillance. However, multimodality imaging — including three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance, fluoroscopy, and nuclear imaging — is becoming more commonly used clinically to aid in diagnosis and to identify the mechanism of PHV dysfunction. This review aims to provide an updated overview of the use of multimodality imaging in the evaluation of PHVs, to illustrate the imaging appearance of different complications, and to highlight a practical approach to assist clinical decision-making in challenging cases of PHV dysfunction.

### Real-time interactive MRI-guided cardiac surgery: aortic valve replacement using a direct apical approach [^1164nDca]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive cardiac surgery requires arresting and emptying of the heart, which compromises visualization of the surgical field. In this feasibility study, a novel surgical procedure is demonstrated where real-time MRI guides the placement of a prosthetic aortic valve in the beating heart via direct apical access in eight porcine hearts. A clinical stentless bioprosthetic valve affixed to a platinum stent was compressed onto a balloon-tipped catheter. This was fed through a 15–18 mm delivery port inserted into the left ventricular (LV) apex via a minimally invasive subxyphoid incision. Using interactive real-time MRI, the surgeon implanted the prosthetic valve in the correct location at the aortic annulus within 90 seconds. In four of the animals, immediately after implantation, ventricular function, blood flow through the valve, and myocardial perfusion were evaluated with MRI. MRI-guided beating-heart surgery may provide patients with a less morbid and more durable solution to structural heart disease.

### Comparison of hemodynamics after aortic root replacement using valve-sparing or bioprosthetic valved conduit [^115bouDZ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to compare aortic hemodynamics and blood flow patterns using in-vivo four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients after valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) and aortic root replacement with bioprosthetic valves (BIO-ARR).

- **Methods**: In-vivo 4D flow MRI was performed in 11 patients after VSARR (47 ± 18 years, 6 bicuspid aortic valves, 5 trileaflet aortic valves), 16 patients after BIO-ARR (52 ± 14 years), and 10 healthy controls (47 ± 16 years). Analysis included three-dimensional blood flow visualization and grading of helix flow in the ascending aorta (AAo) and arch. Peak systolic velocity was quantified in 9 analysis planes in the AAo, aortic arch, and descending aorta. Flow profile uniformity was evaluated in the aortic root and ascending aorta.

- **Results**: Peak systolic velocity (2.0 to 2.5 m/second) in the aortic root and AAo in both VSARR and BIO-ARR were elevated compared with controls (1.1 to 1.3 m/second, p < 0.005). Flow asymmetry in BIO-ARR was increased compared with VSARR, evidenced by more AAo outflow jets (9 of 16 BIO-ARR, 0 of 11 in VSARR). The BIO-ARR exhibited significantly (p < 0.001) increased helix flow in the AAo as a measure of increased flow derangement. Finally, peak systolic velocities were elevated at the aortic root for BIO-ARR (2.5 vs 2.0 m/second, p < 0.05) but lower in the distal AAo when compared with VSARR.

- **Conclusions**: The VSARR results in improved hemodynamic outcomes when compared with BIO-ARR, as indicated by reduced peak velocities in the aortic root and less helix flow disturbance.

### CT and MR imaging prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Standardisation of scanning protocols, measurements and reporting - a consensus document by the European Society of Cardiovascular Radiology (ESCR) [^115oFVBk]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Aortic valve cuspidity is a critical consideration in the context of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The aortic sinus typically contains an aortic valve composed of three distinctive leaflets in most patients. However, in TAVI candidates, the valve is often significantly calcified, which can obscure the number of discernible valve leaflets or valve cuspidity. Despite these difficulties, it is essential to assess valve cuspidity, especially to identify a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). BAVs are notable because aortic stenosis (AS) is a known complication, occurring more frequently and rapidly compared to tricuspid valves. Consequently, BAVs represent about half of all aortic valve replacements due to AS and are not uncommon among TAVI candidates.

While a bicuspid valve morphology does not contraindicate TAVI, it may increase procedural complexity and is associated with a higher risk of requiring a permanent pacemaker post-implantation. Moreover, as guidelines evolve and potentially expand TAVI indications to include patients with intermediate surgical risk and possibly younger age groups, the prevalence of BAV in referred pre-TAVI candidates may increase, given BAV's higher occurrence in younger populations.

### Safety of MRI in patients with retained cardiac leads [^113SXsex]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Efforts to develop MRI-compatible CIEDs are recent, with newly approved devices allowing conditional MRI of patients with intact cardiac leads at both 1.5 T and 3 T scanners. There is, however, a sizeable cohort of patients with abandoned or retained leads for whom MRI under labeling is an absolute contraindication, mostly because very little is known about the phenomenology of MRI-induced heating in the tissue in the presence of partially extracted leads.

The major challenge in quantifying implant-induced heating in this case is that the problem has a large parameter space with many variables that interact with each other. This includes the frequency and geometry of the MRI RF coil, the length, trajectory, and structure of the abandoned/retained lead, the imaging landmark, and the patient's anatomy. Such complexity precludes the application of a systematic experimental approach to infer the worst-case heating scenario.

Numerical simulations, on the other hand, provide an exquisite methodology for exploring thousands of variable combinations in a holistic manner, allowing analysis of parameter extremes outside the bounds of normal clinical practice. This work provides the first comprehensive simulation study of MRI hazards in patients with FRLs, with a focus on RF heating and unintended tissue stimulation. We performed a total of 1800 simulations with 10 patient-derived FRL models registered to body models with a range of low to high relative permittivities (εr = 40–80) and conductivities (σ = 0.1–1.0 S/m), positioned in MRI RF coils tuned to 64 and 127 MHz.

### Four-dimensional flow MRI of stented versus stentless aortic valve bioprostheses [^113rUinc]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The conclusion is that stented and stentless aortic valve prostheses exhibit comparable flow velocity and wall shear stress when assessed for averaged values in the ascending aorta. However, for stentless prostheses, the local flow profiles described with a per-voxel analysis revealed a less obstructed profile more similar to the native aortic valve, with a significantly higher central velocity profile and lower values for outer lumen velocity, wall shear stress, and energy loss.

### CT and MR imaging prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Standardisation of scanning protocols, measurements and reporting - a consensus document by the European Society of Cardiovascular Radiology (ESCR) [^113Gzb1Y]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Coronary obstruction secondary to migrated calcified and non-calcified native valve components during device deployment is a rare procedural complication with a reported incidence of 0.8%, increasing to 3.5% in valve-in-valve procedures. It usually occurs during the procedure but has been reported up to 24 hours after device deployment. Patients with a more susceptible anatomy for this complication have a combination of low-lying ostia of the coronary arteries (OCA) with a large native aortic valve leaflet.

Distance should be measured by tracing a perpendicular line connecting the inferior edge of the OCA with the aortic annulus plane, as the risk of obstruction is considered to be low if this height is more than 10–14 mm. The minimum distance to the OCA should also be calculated in relation to the length of the aortic valve cusps. A recommended stepwise approach to measure the minimum distance of the OCA is displayed in Fig. 14.

- **Standardised measurement protocol**:
	- Fig. 14 illustrates the standardised way to perform measurements of the distance from the annular plane to the ostium of the right coronary artery and the left main. The starting points are the annular plane images (obtained through the steps outlined in Fig. 12). In this image stack, in line with the annulus, the origin of the RCA is located by scrolling through the images in the direction of the aorta (indicated by arrows). Subsequently, the reference lines are rotated in such a way that one of the reference lines aligns appropriately.

Minimum distance of the annulus to the left and right ostium of the coronary arteries can be further explored in the supplementary materials.

### Real-time magnetic resonance-guided aortic valve replacement using Engager valve [^111QKnD8]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

New-generation stented bioprostheses coupled with better imaging modalities are expanding the clinical utility of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study aimed at evaluating the feasibility of real-time cardiovascular magnetic resonance (rtCMR)-guided TAVR using the Medtronic Engager aortic valve system in a preclinical model. The Engager delivery device was slightly modified to make it CMR-compatible. Ten Yucatan swine underwent rtCMR-guided transapical TAVR. Postplacement phase-contrast and first-pass perfusion CMR sequences were used to evaluate for aortic regurgitation and myocardial perfusion, respectively.

Real-time CMR provided excellent visualization of cardiac anatomy during TAVR. Nine of 10 animals had proper valve placement in the aortic annulus as determined by CMR and confirmed by necropsy inspection. Postplacement phase-contrast scans confirmed no intravalvular or paravalvular leaks. Perfusion scans demonstrated sufficient coronary flow. Roentgenographs confirmed proper placement of the prostheses.

The Engager valve can be implanted transapically under rtCMR guidance with a modified, CMR-compatible delivery device in a preclinical model. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance allowed for accurate preplacement evaluation, real-time guidance, and postplacement functional assessment.

### In-vivo assessment of the morphology and hemodynamic functions of the BioValsalva™ composite valve-conduit graft using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and computational modelling technology [^115ZkVzM]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The evaluation of any new cardiac valvular prosthesis should go beyond the classical morbidity and mortality rates and involve hemodynamic assessment. As a proof of concept, the objective of this study was to characterize for the first time the hemodynamics and the blood flow profiles at the aortic root in patients implanted with the BioValsalva™ composite valve-conduit using comprehensive MRI and computer technologies.

- **Methods**: Four male patients implanted with BioValsalva™ and two age-matched normal controls underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Phase-contrast imaging with velocity mapping in three orthogonal directions was performed at the level of the aortic root and descending thoracic aorta. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed for all the subjects with patient-specific flow information derived from phase-contrast MR data.

- **Results**: The maximum and mean flow rates throughout the cardiac cycle at the aortic root level were comparable between normal controls and BioValsalva™ patients (541 ± 199 vs. 567 ± 75 ml/s) and (95 ± 46 vs. 96 ± 10 ml/s), respectively. The maximum velocity (cm/s) was higher in patients (314 ± 49 vs. 223 ± 20; P = 0.06) due to a relatively smaller effective orifice area (EOA), 2.99 ± 0.47 vs. 4.40 ± 0.24 cm² (P = 0.06). However, the BioValsalva™ EOA was comparable to other reported prostheses. The cross-sectional area and maximum diameter at the root were comparable between the two groups. The BioValsalva™ conduit was stiffer than the native aortic wall, with compliance (mm²
- mmHg⁻¹
- 10⁻³) values being (12.6 ± 4.2 vs. [incomplete data]).

### Magnetic resonance imaging safety in pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients: How far have we come [^113PUwp7]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging and cardiovascular implanted electronic device in the early 20th century

One decade ago, the rapid development and use of MRI and CIED in clinical practice, the technical considerations, and several clinical reports on the occurrence or absence of adverse events led to a rapidly increasing interest in the topic, not only among cardiologists and radiologists but also within the cardiovascular device industry. In an editorial to a focused issue on this topic in 2005, it was stressed that in order to make MR scanning as safe as possible, there would have to be an industry-wide effort from concept to market to design and construct implantable cardiac devices and leads for the MRI environment. In this regard, all components of an implantable system need to be developed, tested, and proven safe for evolving MRI technologies.

This viewpoint was also shared by the device companies, who accepted the challenge to address this unmet medical need by designing future device systems to be safe by design, not by chance.

### Detection and prediction of bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration [^112CQwma]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

In the 71 patients without known bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, surgical aortic valve replacement had been conducted 1 month (n = 9), 2 years (n = 22), 5 years (n = 20), and over 10 years (n = 20) previously. The function of these valves of varying ages was generally within normal limits at baseline, with a peak velocity of 2.76 ± 0.52 m/s and a mean gradient of 16.4 ± 7.0 mm Hg.

Contrast-enhanced CT images were not interpretable in 8 patients (11%) due to motion degradation and metallic blooming artifacts from the valve struts. Fourteen subjects (19%) displayed one or more leaflet abnormalities on CT, including spotty calcification (n = 5), noncalcific leaflet thickening (n = 5), and pannus (n = 7).

PET scans were interpretable in all patients. An increased 18 F-fluoride uptake was more common than the abnormalities identified on CT, occurring in 24 patients (34%) with a TBR of 1.55 (IQR: 1.44 to 1.88). Similar to the ex vivo findings, the increased 18 F-fluoride uptake colocalized with areas of spotty calcification, noncalcific leaflet thickening (suggestive of thrombus), and pannus observed on the CT. It was also detected in areas distant from the CT abnormalities.

In terms of predicting bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, 67 of the patients without established valve degeneration at baseline underwent repeat echocardiography at 2 years. They demonstrated increased peak velocities compared with baseline (2.87 [IQR: 2.52 to 3.13] m/s vs. 2.73 [IQR: 2.38 to 3.07] m/s; p = 0.002). There was no association between hemodynamic progression and…

### Advances in clinical applications of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [^112jLbxy]. Heart (2008). Low credibility.

CMR provides non-invasive, clear anatomical valvular information that can impact the clinical management of a patient. It is possible to differentiate a bicuspid from a tricuspid aortic valve (figures 5 and 6). CMR reproducibly characterizes aortic valve anatomy, and the determined aortic valve area correlates well with cardiac catheterization.

- **Black-blood fast spin echo technique**: This is used to visualize the aortic valve (see Figure 5).

- **Cine imaging**: During diastole, an aortic valve may appear tricuspid; however, during systole, it is evident that the valve is functionally bicuspid with fusion of the right and left cusps (see Figure 6).

Phase contrast techniques can reliably measure peak velocity and thus the peak gradient in aortic stenosis. Valvular information, in combination with accurate left ventricular volumes and assessment of thoracic aortic dilatation, can assist in planning valvular replacement and, importantly, determine whether the aorta requires intervention as well. Similar data can be obtained for the assessment of the pulmonic valve, which is not always well-defined by transthoracic echocardiography.

While most valvular lesions seen by echocardiography can be assessed by CMR, echocardiography has the advantages of widespread availability and validation. CMR provides additional information in patients who have poor echocardiographic windows and is useful in patients who are poor candidates for invasive transesophageal echocardiography or when additional surgery beyond the valve is contemplated.

### 2021 ESC/EACTS guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^1129zoSM]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for prosthetic heart valves, and more specifically with respect to the management of bioprosthetic failure, the EACTS/ESC 2022 guidelines recommend considering transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation in the mitral and tricuspid positions for selected patients at high risk for surgical re-intervention.

### Four-dimensional flow MRI of stented versus stentless aortic valve bioprostheses [^1176MQ3A]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

To evaluate aortic velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), and viscous energy loss (EL) of stented and stentless bioprostheses, the study used 4D flow MRI one year after surgical aortic valve replacement.

For this cross-sectional study, 28 patients with either stented (n = 14) or stentless (n = 14) bioprostheses underwent non-contrast-enhanced 4D-flow MRI at 1.5 T. Analyses included comparing velocity, WSS, and EL in the ascending aorta during peak systole for both spatially averaged values and a comparison of local differences using per-voxel analysis.

No significant differences were found in peak and mean velocity (stented vs. stentless: 2.45 m/s vs. 2.11 m/s; p = 0.09, and 0.60 m/s vs. 0.62 m/s; p = 0.89), WSS (0.60 Pa vs. 0.59 Pa; p = 0.55) and EL (10.17 mW vs. 7.82 mW; p = 0.10). Per-voxel analysis revealed significantly higher central lumen velocity and lower outer lumen velocity, WSS, and EL for stentless versus stented prostheses.

One year after aortic valve implantation with stented and stentless bioprostheses, velocity, WSS, and EL were comparable when assessed for averaged values in the ascending aorta. However, the flow profile described with local analysis for stentless prosthesis is potentially favorable, with a significantly higher central velocity profile and lower values for outer lumen velocity, WSS, and EL.

- **Key points**:
	- Stentless bioprostheses can be implanted instead of stented aortic valve bioprostheses.
	- Haemodynamic performance of valve prosthesis can be assessed using 4D flow MRI.

### Recommendations for cardiovascular magnetic resonance in adults with congenital heart disease from the respective working groups of the European Society of Cardiology [^113ruMAK]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Other limitations and considerations

Claustrophobia and patient compliance: CMR studies require the patient to lie still in the tubular bore of a magnet, which may not be tolerated by a small percentage of patients (approximately 5%) due to claustrophobia. Anxiolytics such as oral benzodiazepine can be considered for individuals with mild or moderate claustrophobia. Limited ability to comply with breath-hold instructions can be an added problem in patients with Down syndrome or other cognitive or behavioral issues, although this is less often a problem in the adult than the pediatric population. Neither sedation nor anesthesia can be recommended for CMR of ACHD, unless undertaken in an appropriately equipped and staffed center that maintains regular relevant experience in accordance with local practice guidelines. The relative safety and diagnostic efficacy of anesthesia with intubation compared with sedation remains almost impossible to determine, given the rarity but potential severity of the hazards in the CMR environment. Alternative imaging by repeat echocardiography or by CT may be preferable.

Intravascular pressures and jet velocities: CMR does not, on its own, provide measurements of pressure. Pressure differences across stenoses of heart valves or large vessels can be estimated, by applying the modified Bernoulli equation, from measurements of jet velocities. However, CMR jet velocity mapping requires skill. The acquisition slice, with adequate temporal and spatial resolution and appropriate velocity encoding range (VENC), should be located to transect the core of the jet.

### Magnetic resonance imaging safety in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices [^116vFteW]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

High-strength magnetic and electric fields used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) render images with unmatched soft tissue contrast. These imaging attributes have made MRI an increasingly preferred diagnostic tool in many medical conditions. Initially, there was substantial concern regarding the safety of performing these imaging studies in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), as these devices have the potential to be affected by the intense electric and magnetic fields of the MRI.

More recently, there has been increasing evidence that MRI can be performed safely in patients with devices that have not been specifically labeled by regulatory agencies for use in an MRI environment (MRI non-conditional devices), which has allowed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to start providing reimbursement for MRIs of patients with MRI non-conditional devices. For CMS to reimburse scans, a rigorous protocol must be followed, recognizing that there are still potential adverse effects that can be mitigated by appropriate procedures.

In this review, we will survey the initial experiences and efforts to understand the magnitude of risk for device malfunction and harm, as well as efforts to minimize the potential risks of MRI effects on devices and leads (such as heating, device movement, lead dislodgement, and device malfunction, including inhibition of pacing and generation of arrhythmias).

### Cardiac implanted electronic devices and MRI safety in 2018-the state of play [^111uJx8B]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the presence of cardiac implanted electronic devices (CIEDs) was a contraindication to magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Professional groups from around the world are releasing updated guidelines for the imaging of MR-conditional and legacy CIEDs, reflecting increasing evidence that this can be performed safely when strict protocols are followed.

- **Key points**:
	- The presence of a pacemaker or automatic implanted cardioverter defibrillator is no longer an absolute contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging.
	- Strict protocols enable diagnostic quality images to be obtained with minimal risk.
	- Close collaboration among radiologists, cardiologists, and device manufacturer representatives is required.

### Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: A review of the dangers and difficulties in MR scanning and attempts to improve safety [^116H3vs2]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

An increasing number of patients are being treated with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), many of which are MR conditional. There is a lack of literature on the safe scanning of MR conditional CIEDs. This review article discusses MR imaging safety in patients with implanted CIEDs. Guidelines on the safe use and indications of imaging patients with MR conditional CIEDs are described, followed by a pictorial essay of the radiographic features of these devices.

We also discuss the challenges of monitoring the patient in the MR environment, advances in MRI conditional imaging of devices, availability, limitations, and workflow including vendor-specific and other collaborative efforts to simplify the scanning process. Radiologists must be able to facilitate the safe utilization of MR imaging in patients who have CIEDs. A thorough knowledge of the hazards of imaging non-MR compatible devices is required as well as knowing how to correctly identify and manage the imaging of patients with MR conditional CIEDs.

Finally, we propose steps required to facilitate the safe scanning of patients with MR conditional CIEDs adopted in our institution, and a contingency plan in the event that an inadvertent MR scan of a patient with an MRI unsafe CIED should occur.

- **Main messages**:
	- Risks of MR imaging in patients who have CIEDs have been worked around.
	- There are many technical limitations in enabling safe MR scanning of CIEDs.
	- Radiological identification of MRI-conditional status of CIEDs is useful.
	- Standardizing conditions for safe MRI scanning is important.

### In-vivo assessment of the morphology and hemodynamic functions of the BioValsalva™ composite valve-conduit graft using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and computational modelling technology [^115GsCiS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The evaluation of any new cardiac valvular prosthesis should extend beyond the classical morbidity and mortality rates to involve hemodynamic assessment. As a proof of concept, the objective of this study was to characterize, for the first time, the hemodynamics and blood flow profiles at the aortic root in patients implanted with the BioValsalva™ composite valve-conduit using comprehensive MRI and computational technologies.

- **Methods**: Four male patients implanted with the BioValsalva™ and two age-matched normal controls (NC) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Phase-contrast imaging with velocity-mapping in three orthogonal directions was performed at the level of the aortic root and descending thoracic aorta. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were conducted for all subjects with patient-specific flow information derived from phase-contrast MR data.

- **Results**: The maximum and mean flow rates throughout the cardiac cycle at the aortic root level were very comparable between NC and BioValsalva™ patients (541 ± 199 vs. 567 ± 75 ml/s and 95 ± 46 vs. 96 ± 10 ml/s, respectively). The maximum velocity (cm/s) was higher in patients (314 ± 49 vs. 223 ± 20; P = 0.06) due to a relatively smaller effective orifice area (EOA), 2.99 ± 0.47 vs. 4.40 ± 0.24 cm² (P = 0.06). However, the BioValsalva™ EOA was comparable to other reported prostheses. The cross-sectional area and maximum diameter at the root were comparable between the two groups. The BioValsalva™ conduit was stiffer than the native aortic wall, with compliance (mm²
- mmHg⁻¹
- 10⁻³) values of (12.6 ± 4.2 vs. 25.3 ± 0.4; P = 0.06).

### Performing MRI on patients with MRI-conditional and non-conditional cardiac implantable electronic devices: An update for radiologists [^115rY9vz]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators are commonly encountered in clinical practice and require special consideration when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed. It is estimated that 50–75% of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) will have an indication for MRI during their lifetime. Radiologists may want to recommend MRI or may be consulted about the need to perform MRI in a patient with a CIED, at which point they may need to approve or at least provide guidance on whether MRI may be performed safely.

Even in situations where final clearance will not be provided by the radiologist, he or she can provide valuable information by reviewing radiographs and determining:

- **Device condition**: Whether a device is MRI-conditional and MRI may ultimately be permitted.
- **Standard workflow**: If the device is not MRI-conditional and MRI using the standard workflow will not be approved.
- **Additional information needed**: When further information will be clearly required.

CIED identification and verification of leads can be accomplished through review of the medical record and/or evaluation of a chest radiograph. In patients with MRI-conditional CIEDs (as well as with legacy CIEDs in those institutions that perform MRI of these patients), specific imaging protocols must be adhered to in order to prevent death or injury to the patient or damage to the device. In this update, we provide details regarding the above topics and offer an algorithm for integrating this information into a clinical workflow to efficiently triage patients with CIEDs who are being considered for MRI.

### Long-term comparison between pulmonary homograft versus bioprosthesis for pulmonary valve replacement in Tetralogy of Fallot [^117YLhZe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Freedom from structural valve deterioration or reintervention was observed in patients treated with homografts and bioprostheses.

- **Cardiac MRI findings**: A total of 21 and 85 patients with homografts and bioprostheses, respectively, underwent baseline cardiac MRI. Of those patients, 17 and 40, respectively, underwent cardiac MRI follow-up; and 9 and 16, respectively, among those had late cardiac MRI follow-up. We observed a significant reduction in indexed end-diastolic and end-systolic RV volumes in both patient groups, with no significant difference between homografts and bioprostheses. A repeated measures mixed model confirmed that the type of prosthesis (homograft versus bioprosthesis) did not significantly influence the reduction in RV volumes, with indexed end-diastolic RV volume at −8.5 ± 7.8 mL/m² (P = 0.27) and indexed end-systolic RV volume at −3.1 ± 5.1 mL/m² (P = 0.53).

- **Postoperative changes**: Postoperative changes in right ventricle end-diastolic (left) and end-systolic (right) volumes were examined in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging examinations of patients treated with homografts and bioprostheses.

### Mr safety and compatibility of a noninvasively expandable total-joint endoprosthesis [^112BFctn]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2005). Low credibility.

A noninvasively expandable total-joint endoprosthesis is now available for pediatric patients; the prosthesis can be lengthened by external application of a magnetic field. We investigated the risks of unintentional heating or lengthening of the prosthesis during MR imaging and evaluated the effect of the device on the diagnostic efficacy of MR imaging of surrounding tissues. We performed MR imaging at 1.5 T by using standard pulse sequences and pulse sequences with high-gradient and high-radiofrequency duty cycle. MR imaging caused no measurable change in prosthesis length, and the temperature of the prosthesis increased by less than 1 degree Celsius during repeated 14-minute exposures. Despite significant signal loss and image distortion around the prosthetic joint, clinically useful images were obtained as close as 12 cm from the ends of the prosthetic stems, measured toward the body of the device. Thus, the prosthesis can be safely exposed to MR imaging pulse sequences at 1.5 T, and the visualization of some tissue surrounding the device is clinically useful.

### Incremental value of PET and MRI in the evaluation of cardiovascular abnormalities [^112JmspP]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Valve abscess is considered a complication of infective endocarditis (IE), occurring in both native and prosthetic valves, and requires urgent surgery with debridement of all infected and necrotic tissues. Echocardiography identifies only 40% of surgically proven myocardial abscesses. On MRI, both morphological and functional evaluation of the valve can be performed, allowing for quantification of valvular lesions such as regurgitation or stenosis. Inflammation or abscess appears as soft tissue surrounding the valve. Inflammatory tissue shows high signal on T2-weighted sequences, and abscesses demonstrate fluid signal with peripheral enhancement.

- **Figure description**:
	- **Perivalvular abscess**: A three-chamber Cine SSFP MRI image from a patient with a history of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, who presented with acute onset chest pain, shows a soft-tissue intensity lesion surrounding the aortic valve and the aortic root (arrow). Contrast was not administered due to severe renal dysfunction.
	- **Coronal FDG PET/CT**: In the same patient, it shows intense uptake along the lesion, indicating active inflammation or infection. A follow-up MRI obtained two days later revealed liquefaction and formation of an abscess, which was treated surgically.

PET-CT has demonstrated higher sensitivity than echocardiography in detecting valve abscess, showing intense uptake in affected valves. Hybrid PET/MR imaging can further aid in the characterization and localization of the high uptake zone on PET, thanks to MRI's excellent spatial resolution capabilities.

### Four-dimensional flow MRI of stented versus stentless aortic valve bioprostheses [^115cp15x]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

To evaluate aortic velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), and viscous energy loss (EL) of stented and stentless bioprostheses using 4D flow MRI one year after surgical aortic valve replacement, this study was conducted.

- **Methods**: For this cross-sectional study, 28 patients with either stented (n = 14) or stentless (n = 14) bioprostheses underwent non-contrast-enhanced 4D-flow MRI at 1.5 T. Analyses included a comparison of velocity, WSS, and EL in the ascending aorta during peak systole, assessing both spatially averaged values and local differences using per-voxel analysis.

- **Results**: No significant differences were found in peak and mean velocity (stented vs. stentless: 2.45 m/s vs. 2.11 m/s; p = 0.09 and 0.60 m/s vs. 0.62 m/s; p = 0.89), WSS (0.60 Pa vs. 0.59 Pa; p = 0.55), and EL (10.17 mW vs. 7.82 mW; p = 0.10). Per-voxel analysis revealed significantly higher central lumen velocity and lower outer lumen velocity, WSS, and EL for stentless versus stented prostheses.

- **Conclusion**: One year after aortic valve implantation with stented and stentless bioprostheses, velocity, WSS, and EL were comparable when assessed for averaged values in the ascending aorta. However, the flow profile described with local analysis for stentless prostheses is potentially favorable, with a significantly higher central velocity profile and lower values for outer lumen velocity, WSS, and EL.

- **Key points**:
	- Stentless bioprostheses can be implanted instead of stented aortic valve bioprostheses.
	- Haemodynamic performance of valve prostheses can be assessed using 4D flow MRI.
	- Averaged ascending aorta PSV, WSS, and EL are comparable.

### Safety evaluation of a leadless transcatheter pacemaker for magnetic resonance imaging use [^112KKcLH]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Increased magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) adoption and demand are driving the need for device patients to have safe access to MRI.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to address the interactions of MRI with the Micra transcatheter pacemaker system.

- **Methods**: A strategy was developed to evaluate potential MRI risks including device heating, unintended cardiac stimulation, force, torque, vibration, and device malfunction. Assessment of MRI-induced device heating was conducted using a phantom containing gelled saline, and Monte Carlo simulations incorporating these results were conducted to simulate numerous combinations of human body models, position locations in the MRI scanner bore, and a variety of coil designs. Lastly, a patient with a Micra pacemaker who underwent a clinically indicated MRI scan is presented.

- **Results**: Compared to traditional MRI conditional pacemakers, the overall risk with Micra was greatly reduced because of the small size of the device and the absence of a lead. The modeling results predicted that the nonperfused temperature rise of the device would be less than 0.4°C at 1.5 T and 0.5°C at 3 T, and that the risk of device heating with multiple device implants was not increased compared with a single device. The clinical case study revealed no MRI-related complications.

- **Conclusion**: The MRI safety assessment tests conducted for the Micra pacemaker demonstrate that patients with a single device or multiple devices can safely undergo MRI scans in both 1.5- and 3-T MRI scanners. No MRI-related complications were observed in a patient.

### The European MR safety landscape [^112dtDdv]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

This survey revealed a very heterogeneous European landscape in terms of MR safety. While the majority of institutions at every level have institutional guidelines to handle MR safety decisions and adverse events, coordination is lacking. This is probably not due to a lack of guidelines, as pointed out in the introduction, but rather to a lack of awareness of said guidelines, which is related to the lack of coordinated education of personnel at every level.

This uncertainty leads to a potential under-providing for patients who could benefit from MR scans, as indicated by the low number of scans performed on patients with cardiac devices and the high number of scans refused due to uncertainty. This is based on the answers to question 24: "Have you ever refused to perform a scan because you were unsure about the MR safety assessment of the patient in the last 12 months?"

However, the lack of scanning of patients with cardiac devices — assumed in our study to be representative of cases where safety management is complex — in outpatient facilities and smaller hospitals can also be explained by practical and economic considerations. This is due to the need for extra personnel and/or equipment, specifically personnel able to reprogram the implanted device. In fact, a cardiologist is often responsible for the scanning of cardiac devices everywhere in Europe.

Our survey specifically focused on cardiac devices because they are widespread active implants, and there is now accepted evidence that even MR-unsafe devices can be safely scanned off-label.

### Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: A review of the dangers and difficulties in MR scanning and attempts to improve safety [^114y9rJw]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has steadily increased in use worldwide. It is anticipated that the number of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) requiring an MRI will rise. An estimated 75% of patients with CIEDs will require an MRI during their lifetime.

This review article discusses the safe use of MRI in patients with implanted CIEDs. Radiologists should understand the redesign and engineering principles of these devices, which were once deemed an absolute contraindication to scanning.

The article describes the known hazards of MRI-unsafe CIEDs. It provides guidelines on the safe use, indications, and limitations of imaging patients with MR-conditional CIEDs, including a brief pictorial essay of the radiographic features of these devices.

Finally, we offer steps to facilitate the safe scanning of patients with MR-conditional CIEDs in the form of a proposed guideline, adopted in our institution, and a contingency plan for the inadvertent MR scan of a patient with an MRI-unsafe CIED. These measures have been ratified by the authors' institutional medical board review process and have been successfully implemented at the time of writing.

### Cardiac MRI of patients with implanted electrical cardiac devices [^112shxuv]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Implantable pulse generators and defibrillators have traditionally been considered contraindications to MRI. However, recent data have challenged this paradigm and demonstrated that patients with newer generation devices can safely undergo MRI, including cardiac MRI, provided basic precautions are taken. Indeed, the introduction of MRI conditional systems has led to a conceptual shift in clinical decision making. The question, 'Can this patient undergo MRI safely?' is being superseded by, 'Should this patient be implanted with an MRI conditional device?'

This review outlines the risks associated with MRI in patients with implanted cardiac devices and discusses practical measures to minimize risks and facilitate safe and diagnostic scanning.

### Infective endocarditis after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A state of the art review [^112QguTf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

**Imaging algorithm for prosthetic valve endocarditis**: The first step is to start with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), given its availability and noninvasive nature. With positive findings, one can undergo computed tomography (CT) and consider brain imaging or coronary angiography (depending on age) if there is a plan for surgery. With negative TTE findings, one can perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). If that is negative, repeat TEE one week later if suspicions remain or consider adjunctive imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18 F‐fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (18 F‐FDG‐PET/CT). If TEE has positive findings, one should obtain a CT to characterize abscesses, pseudoaneurysms, and fistulas.

### The emerging applications of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging in transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^114NC9o8]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) serves as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in selected patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and high surgical risk. The planning and follow-up of TAVI require an array of imaging techniques, each with its advantages and limitations. Echocardiography and multidetector computer tomography (MDCT) have established applications in patient selection and procedure guidance but present limitations in some patients. Emerging applications of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) are being developed for TAVI. CMRI can provide structural and functional imaging details required for the TAVI procedure in a manner comparable to or superior to that obtained by echocardiography and MDCT combined.

In this review, we examine the continuously evolving role of CMRI as a complementary or alternative to more established imaging techniques. We address the advantages and disadvantages of CMRI in this context. The role of CMRI in selecting anatomically suitable patients for the TAVI procedure and in post-TAVI follow-up is discussed, with particular emphasis on its applications for assessing aortic stenosis severity and hemodynamic impact, vascular imaging for TAVI access routes, quantification of paravalvular leaks, and left ventricle remodeling in the post-TAVI setting. Additionally, it provides imaging biomarkers as a tool for aortic stenosis risk stratification.

### Feasibility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance to assess the orifice area of aortic bioprostheses [^114MEsHw]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

The prosthetic orifice area, usually calculated by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), provides important information regarding the hemodynamic performance of aortic bioprostheses. However, both TTE and TEE have limitations; therefore, accurate and reproducible determination of the orifice area often remains a challenge. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to assess the orifice areas of aortic bioprostheses.

- **Methods and results**: CMR planimetry of the orifice area was performed in 65 patients (43 with stented and 22 with stentless prostheses; mean time since implantation was 3.1 ± 2.8 years; mean orifice area determined by TTE was 1.70 ± 0.43 cm²; 62 prostheses were normally functioning, 2 had severe stenoses, and 1 had severe regurgitation) in an imaging plane perpendicular to the transprosthetic flow using steady-state free-precession cine imaging under breath-hold conditions on a 1.5-T MR system. CMR results were compared with TTE (continuity equation, n = 65) and TEE (planimetry, n = 31). CMR planimetry was readily feasible in 80.0% of cases; feasible with limitations in 15.4% due to stent, flow, and sternal wire artifacts; and impossible in 4.6% because of flow artifacts. Correlations of the orifice areas obtained by CMR with TTE (r = 0.82) and CMR with TEE (r = 0.92) were significant. The average difference between the methods was -0.02 ± 0.24 cm² (TTE) and 0.05 ± 0.15 cm² (TEE). Agreement was found for both stented and stentless devices regardless of orifice size. Intraobserver and interobserver variabilities of CMR were evaluated.

### Four-dimensional flow MRI of stented versus stentless aortic valve bioprostheses [^114vrvVD]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The institutional ethics committee approved this exploratory cross-sectional study. All consecutive patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement within the previous 9–15 months were screened for exclusion criteria. In addition to standard MRI exclusion criteria, patients with a history of multiple heart valve replacements or known persistent atrial fibrillation were excluded. All eligible patients were asked to participate. After informed consent, the MRI exam was conducted in 30 patients with either a stented Mitroflow (Sorin, Saluggia, Italy; Fig. 1a) or stentless Freedom Solo (Sorin, Saluggia, Italy; Fig. 1b) bioprosthesis.

- **Figures**: Example of the stented and stentless bioprosthesis. (a) Mitroflow prosthesis (Sorin, Saluggia, Italy); (b) Freedom Solo prosthesis (Sorin, Saluggia, Italy).

All participants underwent a cardiovascular MRI at 1.5-Tesla (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany; software version B17). No contrast agent was used. The examination included a standard-of-care, prospective electrocardiogram triggered, and respiratory-gated short axis time-resolved (CINE) MRI for the evaluation of cardiac dimensions and function. For the assessment of aortic blood flow, time-resolved 3D phase-contrast MRI with three-directional flow encoding (4D flow) was obtained in a sagittal oblique 3D volume covering the aortic valve bioprosthesis and the thoracic aorta using electrocardiogram gating during free breathing, with a respiratory navigator placed at the lung-liver interface.

### Assessment of mitral valve regurgitation by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [^113V1zB2]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common valvular heart disease and is the second most frequent indication for heart valve surgery in Western countries. Echocardiography is the recommended first-line test for the assessment of valvular heart disease, but cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides complementary information, especially for assessing MR severity and planning the timing of intervention. As new CMR techniques for the assessment of MR have been developed, standardizing CMR protocols for research and clinical studies has become important to optimize diagnostic utility and support the wider use of CMR for the clinical assessment of MR.

In this consensus statement, we provide a detailed description of the evidence on the use of CMR for MR assessment, highlight its clinical utility, and recommend a standardized CMR protocol and report for MR assessment.

### Midterm results of transapical aortic valve replacement via real-time magnetic resonance imaging guidance [^111U5mDQ]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Percutaneous valve replacements are presently being evaluated in clinical trials. As delivery of the valve is catheter-based, the safety and efficacy of these procedures may be influenced by the imaging used. To assist the surgeon and improve the success of the operation, we have performed transapical aortic valve replacements using real-time magnetic resonance imaging guidance.

- **Methods**: Twenty-eight swine underwent aortic valve replacement by real-time magnetic resonance imaging on the beating heart. Stentless bioprostheses mounted on balloon-expandable stents were used. Magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 T) was used to identify the critical anatomic landmarks. In addition to anatomic confirmation of adequate placement of the prosthesis, functional assessment of the valve and left ventricle and perfusion were also obtained with magnetic resonance imaging. A series of short-term feasibility experiments were conducted (n = 18) in which the animals were humanely killed after valve placement and assessment by magnetic resonance imaging. Ten additional animals were allowed to survive and had follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans and confirmatory echocardiography at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively.

- **Results**: Real-time magnetic resonance imaging provided superior visualization of the landmarks needed. The time to implantation after apical access was 74 ± 18 seconds. Perfusion scanning demonstrated adequate coronary flow, and functional imaging documented preservation of ventricular contractility in all animals after successful deployment.

### MRI evaluation prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI): When to acquire and how to interpret [^113JAatc]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Detailed anatomic assessment of the aortic valve can distinguish between tricuspid, bicuspid, and quadricuspid valves. TAVI has been successfully performed in selected high-risk patients with severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis. The severity of aortic stenosis is mostly quantified by transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiograms. In patients with low flow and low gradient but clinically suspected severe stenosis, dobutamine stress TTE is used to augment flow and unmask severe stenosis. Stress TTE may be contraindicated in some patients (Appendix A).

Aortic stenosis can be quantified on MRI using different methods. Planimetry of maximal visible valve opening in systole on MRI correlates well with planimetry measurements obtained on CT. Severe aortic stenosis is suggested when the aortic valve area is less than 1 cm². The valve leaflets can be evaluated on the 2-D ECG-gated SSFP images. Stenosis calculation based on the Hakki formula (aortic valve area = cardiac flow/√maximum gradient) correlates well with measurements obtained from echocardiography. Additionally, the velocity ratio based on peak velocity in the LVOT and aortic sinuses can also be calculated from two separate 2-D phase contrast MR acquisitions. A velocity ratio of less than 0.25 is compatible with severe stenosis.

- **Assessment of aortic stenosis by planimetry**: 2-D cine SSFP acquisition parallel to the valve plane demonstrates the narrowest opening of the aortic orifice. CT of the same patient also demonstrated a similar orifice area.

- **Diameters of sinuses of Valsalva measured on MRI**: 2-D measurements can be obtained to evaluate the morphology and function of the aortic valve complex.

### Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging versus computed tomography to guide transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial [^1141Zro6]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for guiding transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, a sizable proportion of TAVR candidates have chronic kidney disease, for whom the use of iodinated contrast media is a limitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a promising alternative, but randomized data comparing the effectiveness of CMR-guided versus CT-guided TAVR are lacking.

- **Methods**: An investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial was conducted at two Austrian heart centers. Patients evaluated for TAVR according to the inclusion criteria (severe symptomatic aortic stenosis) and exclusion criteria (contraindication to CMR, CT, or TAVR, a life expectancy < 1 year, or chronic kidney disease level 4 or 5) were randomized (1:1) to undergo CMR or CT guidance. The primary outcome was defined according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 definition of implantation success at discharge, including the absence of procedural mortality, correct positioning of a single prosthetic valve, and proper prosthetic valve performance. Noninferiority was assessed using a hybrid modified intention-to-treat/per-protocol approach, based on an absolute risk difference margin of 9%.

- **Results**: Between September 11, 2017, and December 16, 2022, 380 candidates for TAVR were randomized to CMR-guided (191 patients) or CT-guided (189 patients) TAVR planning. Of these, 138 patients (72.3%) in the CMR-guided group and 129 patients (68.3%) in the CT-guided group eventually underwent TAVR (modified intention-to-treat cohort).

### Joint British Society consensus recommendations for magnetic resonance imaging for patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices [^113dxBRx]. Heart (2024). High credibility.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly a fundamental component of the diagnostic pathway across a range of conditions. Historically, the presence of a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) has been a contraindication for MRI; however, the development of MR Conditional devices that can be scanned under strict protocols has facilitated the provision of MRI for patients. Additionally, there is growing safety data to support MR scanning in patients with CIEDs that do not have MR safety labeling, or with MR Conditional CIEDs where certain conditions are not met, where the clinical justification is robust. This means that almost all patients with cardiac devices should now have the same access to MRI scanning within the National Health Service as the general population.

Provision of MRI to patients with CIED, however, remains limited in the UK, with only half of units accepting scan requests even for patients with MR Conditional CIEDs. Service delivery requires specialist equipment and robust protocols to ensure patient safety and facilitate workflows, meanwhile demanding collaboration between healthcare professionals across many disciplines. This document provides consensus recommendations from the relevant stakeholder professional bodies and patient groups to encourage the provision of safe MRI for patients with CIEDs.

### Prevalence and evolution of susceptibility-weighted imaging lesions in patients with artificial heart valves [^1146EDk9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In patients with mechanical heart valves, cerebral susceptibility-weighted imaging lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, postulated to be caused by degenerative metallic abrasion, are frequently referred to as valve abrasion. It remains unclear whether valve implantation not requiring cardiopulmonary bypass or biological heart valves also shows those lesions.

- **Methods and results**: Two blinded readers assessed lesions and cerebral amyloid angiopathy probability according to established criteria on brain magnetic resonance imaging pre- and post-interventionally. We examined the association between valve type/cardiopulmonary bypass use and the lesion count on the first post-interventional scan using multivariable logistic regression. On post-interventional magnetic resonance imaging, 57/58 (98%) patients with mechanical heart valves had at least one lesion, and 46/58 (79%) had three or more lesions, while 92/97 (95%) patients with biological heart valves had at least one lesion, and 72/97 (74%) had three or more lesions. Multivariate analysis revealed that the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass during implantation significantly increased the odds of having lesions on the first post-interventional magnetic resonance imaging (β per 10 minutes 0.498; 95% confidence interval, 0.116–0.880; P = 0.011), whereas valve type showed no significant association (P = 0.338). Thirty-seven of 155 (23.9%) patients fulfilled the criteria of possible/probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

- **Conclusions**: Lesions in patients with artificial heart valves evolve around the time of valve implantation, and the majority of patients had multiple lesions. The missing association suggests evolving understanding within this domain.

Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Advances in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging over the past two decades have made MR an increasingly attractive imaging modality. With the growing number of patients treated with permanent implanted or temporary cardiovascular devices, clarifying safety issues concerning the performance of MR examinations in these patients is becoming crucial. Extensive, though not complete, ex vivo, animal, and clinical data are available to generate recommendations regarding the safe performance of MR examinations in patients with cardiovascular devices. It is also important to ascertain caveats and contraindications regarding MR examinations for such patients.

Safe MR imaging involves a careful initial patient screening and accurate determination of the permanent implanted or temporary cardiovascular device and its properties. This process requires thoughtful analysis of the risks and benefits of performing the examination at that time and, when indicated, appropriate physician management and supervision. This scientific statement aims to summarize and clarify issues regarding the safety of MR imaging in patients with cardiovascular devices.

### Use of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging for TAVR assessment in patients with bioprosthetic aortic valves: Comparison with computed tomography [^11193r2s]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been successfully utilized to treat patients with failing aortic bioprostheses. Computed tomography (CT) is the usual method for pre-procedural imaging of TAVR in the native position; however, the optimal modality for valve-in-valve procedures has not been established. CT can assess intracardiac anatomy and is superior to cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in the evaluation of coronary artery disease. However, CMR provides superior hemodynamic information, does not carry the risk of ionizing radiation, and may be performed without contrast in patients with renal insufficiency. In this study, CT and CMR were compared for evaluating TAVR in a small cohort of patients with existing aortic bioprostheses.

- **Materials and methods**: Twenty-one patients with aortic bioprostheses were prospectively evaluated by CT and CMR as pre-assessment for TAVR. Agreement between measurements of aortic geometries was assessed.

- **Results**: Sixteen out of 21 patients had aortic bioprostheses constructed with a metal ring, while five had metal strut constructions. Patients with metal struts experienced significant metal artefact on CMR, which compromised image quality in this region. There was good agreement between CT and CMR measurements of aortic geometry. The mean difference (d) in annulus area-derived diameter was 0.5 mm with 95% limits of agreement (L. A) of 4.2 mm. Good agreement was observed between the modalities for the cross-sectional area of the sinuses of Valsalva (d 0.5 cm², L. A 1.4 cm²), sinotubular junction (d 0.9 cm², L. A 1.5 cm²), and ascending upper structures.

### Quantification of periprosthetic valve leakage with multiple regurgitation jets by magnetic resonance imaging [^112fEHok]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

A patient with aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis required replacement of the prosthesis. After initial recovery, his left ventricular function gradually declined, and echocardiography revealed minor paravalvular leakage and a cavern around the prosthesis. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed; flow-imaging and volume-based measurements showed high-grade paravalvular leakage of 45% and 58% regurgitant fraction, respectively. Intraoperatively, dehiscence of more than half of the circumference of the aortic prosthesis was observed. This study demonstrates that MRI can accurately assess periprosthetic valve leakage with multiple regurgitation jets.

### Advances in clinical applications of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [^116LzaCE]. Heart (2008). Low credibility.

The magnetic fields, gradients, and radiofrequency pulses used in MRI pose risks to patients and staff, requiring meticulous safety procedures. Ferromagnetic materials should not be taken into the scanner room. Neurovascular clips, pacemakers, automatic implantable defibrillators, cochlear implants, metal in the eye, retained shrapnel, and neurostimulators are contraindications to MRI, although certain models may be safe. With CMR imaging, it is important to note that intracoronary stents and coronary artery bypass graft surgery are not contraindications. Although small forces are generated within metal heart valves by the magnetic fields, they are minimal compared with the forces generated by the beating heart, and all mechanical heart valves are considered safe. When in doubt, various resources are available to check a device's safety within an MRI scanner.

### Safety of magnetic resonance imaging immediately following Palmaz stent implant: A report of three cases [^113gk2aj]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2001). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide important information on patients with congenital heart defects. There is some reluctance to perform MRI acutely following intravascular stent implant, due to concerns of distortion or movement of the stent in the magnetic field. We report on three patients who underwent MRI evaluation less than 14 days following Palmaz stent implant in the pulmonary arteries and superior vena cava, with no acute adverse outcome or long-term problems.
