## Question

What else can cause angioedema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what else can cause angioedema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology and why classifying by mediator matters. Then, I should verify the major etiologic buckets: mast cell–mediated, bradykinin-mediated, and idiopathic or other mechanisms. Next, I will enumerate concrete causes within each bucket, including drugs, foods, infections, hereditary and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and mimics. After that, I should consider special populations and red flags that shift pretest probabilities. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and highlight what not to miss, anchoring on high-quality sources and guidelines where possible.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework: angioedema reflects increased vascular permeability with fluid extravasation into subcutaneous or submucosal tissues, and the clinically actionable divide is mast cell–mediated versus bradykinin-mediated disease, because that determines whether antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine will help or fail [^111ZKLJq] [^116iW7Tq]. Hold on, I should verify the implication: if there are no hives and no response to antihistamines, I need to pivot to bradykinin-mediated etiologies and avoid delaying appropriate therapy [^111ZKLJq] [^116iW7Tq].

> I will now examine mast cell–mediated causes, which typically present with urticaria, pruritus, and rapid onset within minutes to a couple of hours. Common triggers include foods such as peanuts, shellfish, and tree nuts; medications including antibiotics, NSAIDs, and aspirin; stings and bites; and latex, with the mechanism being IgE-dependent degranulation or direct mast cell activation, and treatment responsiveness to antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine when indicated [^111pLSh7] [^117FCcej] [^117Btbxz]. Wait, let me verify the NSAID point: NSAIDs can also worsen or unmask bradykinin-mediated disease in some patients, so I should be cautious in attributing mechanism solely based on coexisting urticaria [^notfound].

> Next, I should review bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which is characteristically nonpruritic, without hives, slower to evolve over 24–72 hours, and refractory to antihistamines and corticosteroids. The three principal categories are hereditary C1 inhibitor deficiency, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema, with the unifying mechanism being excess bradykinin from dysregulated kallikrein–kinin system activation or impaired bradykinin degradation [^111ZKLJq] [^116iW7Tq] [^1137JuhP]. I need to ensure I emphasize that ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema can occur at any time after initiation, even years later, and is a leading cause of angioedema in emergency departments, which materially changes acute management priorities [^116qLh9s] [^111vZQX3].

> Let me consider hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency. It is autosomal dominant with variable expressivity, often begins in childhood, and features attacks of extremity, face, oropharynx, larynx, abdominal viscera, and genitalia, with attacks peaking at 24 hours and resolving over 48–72 hours; triggers include stress, trauma, and hormonal changes, and standard allergy medications are ineffective, requiring C1 inhibitor replacement, kallikrein inhibition, or bradykinin B2 receptor antagonism for acute and prophylactic therapy [^1137JuhP] [^116NGYDH] [^116iocJR]. Hold on, I should verify mortality risk: laryngeal attacks carry substantial historical mortality, underscoring the need for rapid access to HAE-specific treatments and comprehensive care plans [^114vFQ7m] [^1162EBJo].

> I should confirm acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency features. It presents later in life, often in the setting of lymphoproliferative disorders such as CLL or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or autoimmune disease, with consumption of C1 inhibitor and autoantibodies against C1 inhibitor; evaluation should include age-appropriate cancer screening and complement studies, and management mirrors hereditary forms with C1 inhibitor replacement or targeted pathway blockade when available [^113mR272] [^1123yCR7]. Wait, let me verify prevalence: acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency is extremely rare, so a high index of suspicion in older adults with recurrent angioedema without hives is warranted [^115qnkym].

> Now, ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema deserves special attention. It accounts for a large fraction of ED presentations, is more common in Black patients, and can involve the lips, tongue, oropharynx, and larynx with airway compromise; the pathophysiology is impaired bradykinin degradation, and first-line management is immediate ACE inhibitor cessation with airway prioritization, while icatibant has RCT-level evidence for faster resolution in upper aerodigestive tract involvement, though institutional protocols vary and supportive care remains standard in many centers [^116qLh9s] [^117F3qzM] [^11376LhM]. I should double-check that epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids are not reliably effective here, so they should not delay definitive airway management or bradykinin-targeted therapy when available [^116qLh9s] [^11376LhM].

> But wait, what if the patient has normal C1 inhibitor and still has bradykinin-mediated disease. Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor is increasingly recognized, often with factor XII variants or other contact system mutations, and diagnosis relies on expert clinical assessment with selective genetic testing; importantly, many patients lack an identified mutation yet still merit HAE-directed therapy given morbidity risk, so I should avoid anchoring on normal C1 inhibitor results alone [^116tCMVL] [^113sXK6J]. Hold on, I should verify that these patients also do not respond to antihistamines and require targeted bradykinin pathway modulation when attacks occur [^116tCMVL].

> I will now examine idiopathic and other mechanisms. Idiopathic histaminergic angioedema can be acute or chronic and may coexist with chronic spontaneous urticaria; a subset of chronic cases are autoimmune with IgG anti-FcεRI autoantibodies, and management follows urticaria algorithms with high-dose second-generation antihistamines, omalizumab for refractory disease, and periodic reassessment for evolving causes [^117FCcej] [^111qSgoj] [^11422N3j]. Let me reconsider the role of biopsy: it is not routine but can help when vasculitis, mastocytosis, or atypical inflammatory mimics are suspected, especially if lesions persist or are atypical [^1164EdRn].

> Next, I should review mimics that can masquerade as angioedema. Conditions such as cellulitis, deep venous thrombosis, mucosal infections, contact dermatitis, lymphedema, and disorders like Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome can produce localized swelling but lack the transient, nonpitting, self-limited pattern of angioedema; careful history, examination, and sometimes biopsy or imaging are needed to avoid mislabeling and inappropriate therapy [^116nC791] [^113Ym3Ep] [^111vW4Mi]. Hold on, I should verify that persistent, unilateral, or nonresolving swelling prompts evaluation for these alternatives rather than escalating antihistamines indefinitely [^111vW4Mi].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and modifiers. In pediatrics, viral infections are a leading cause of acute urticaria and angioedema, and HAE often declares in childhood with pubertal worsening; in older adults, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency are more prevalent; in pregnancy and with estrogen exposure, HAE attacks may increase, guiding prophylaxis planning and medication choices [^1169Smu6] [^116NGYDH] [^111rSW99]. Let me double-check that counseling on trigger avoidance and individualized prophylaxis is emphasized in guidelines for HAE across ages [^111xrWdT] [^1162EBJo].

> I should confirm a practical diagnostic approach. First, distinguish angioedema with versus without urticaria; with urticaria, prioritize mast cell–mediated causes and treat with antihistamines while identifying triggers; without urticaria, pivot to bradykinin-mediated disease and order C4, C1 inhibitor level and function, and consider ACE inhibitor exposure and age-appropriate evaluation for lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disease; if C1 inhibitor is normal but suspicion remains high, evaluate for HAE with normal C1 inhibitor with specialist input and selective genetic testing [^116iW7Tq] [^111T2q6G] [^116tCMVL]. Hold on, I should verify that early involvement of allergy/immunology is recommended for recurrent angioedema without hives to avoid delays in HAE diagnosis and treatment access [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to synthesize the key takeaways. Angioedema arises from either mast cell–mediated or bradykinin-mediated pathways, with the latter carrying higher morbidity and requiring targeted therapies; common causes include foods, drugs, infections, hereditary and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and ACE inhibitors; mimics are frequent and must be actively excluded; and a structured, mechanism-aware approach anchored in history, urticaria phenotype, and selective testing prevents misdiagnosis and ensures timely, effective treatment [^111ZKLJq] [^111vZQX3] [^116iW7Tq]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied antihistamines help all forms — let me be explicit: they help mast cell–mediated disease but not bradykinin-mediated disease, which is a critical distinction for safety and outcomes [^111ZKLJq] [^116iW7Tq].

Angioedema has a broad differential beyond hereditary and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, including **mast cell–mediated** (allergic, idiopathic, autoimmune) [^117FCcej], **bradykinin-mediated** (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, neprilysin inhibitors, direct renin inhibitors) [^115yJduD] [^11376LhM], and **other causes** such as NSAIDs, antibiotics, contrast media, infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies [^115yJduD] [^113mR272]. Less common etiologies include hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor, acquired angioedema, and drug-induced angioedema from agents like NSAIDs, antibiotics, and contrast media [^116tCMVL] [^113mR272] [^115yJduD]. Evaluation should be guided by history, presence or absence of urticaria, medication review, and targeted labs (C4, C1-INH level/function) to distinguish mechanisms and guide therapy [^111T2q6G] [^116iW7Tq].

---

## Mast cell-mediated angioedema

Mast cell-mediated angioedema is characterized by **rapid onset, pruritus, and urticaria** [^115zr1dp]; it responds to antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine when indicated [^117FCcej].

- **Allergic reactions**: Foods (e.g. nuts, shellfish, eggs), medications (e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins), insect stings, and latex are common triggers [^111vZQX3] [^116ToR1z].

- **Idiopathic angioedema**: Chronic spontaneous urticaria/angioedema without identifiable triggers; often autoimmune [^116vMRDN].

- **Autoimmune angioedema**: Associated with autoimmune diseases (e.g. lupus, thyroid disease) and autoantibodies against IgE or FcεRI [^116vMRDN].

---

## Bradykinin-mediated angioedema

Bradykinin-mediated angioedema is **non-pruritic, without urticaria**, and **refractory to antihistamines and corticosteroids** [^111ZKLJq] [^117SH7Yk].

- **Hereditary angioedema (HAE)**: C1 inhibitor deficiency (types I/II) or normal C1-INH (type III/HAE-nC1INH); recurrent attacks without urticaria [^112vRaBu] [^116tCMVL].

- **Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency**: Associated with lymphoproliferative disorders or autoimmune diseases [^113mR272].

- **ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema**: Occurs in 0.1–0.7% of users; can occur anytime during therapy, even after years of use [^116qLh9s] [^11376LhM].

- **Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: Rarely cause angioedema, more often in patients with prior ACE inhibitor reactions [^notfound].

- **Neprilysin inhibitors (e.g. sacubitril/valsartan)**: Increase bradykinin and can precipitate angioedema [^116tCMVL].

- **Direct renin inhibitors (e.g. aliskiren)**: Also implicated in bradykinin-mediated angioedema [^notfound].

---

## Drug-induced angioedema (other than ACE inhibitors and ARBs)

Several **drugs cause angioedema** through varied mechanisms:

| **Drug class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | Ibuprofen, aspirin | Mast cell degranulation, prostaglandin/leukotriene pathways [^115yJduD] |
| Antibiotics | Penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides | IgE-mediated allergy, direct mast cell activation [^115yJduD] |
| Contrast media | Iodinated contrast | Direct mast cell activation [^notfound] |
| Statins | Atorvastatin, simvastatin | Unknown, possibly immune-mediated [^notfound] |
| Proton pump inhibitors | Omeprazole, pantoprazole | Immune-mediated [^notfound] |
| Chemotherapeutic agents | Paclitaxel, cisplatin | Direct toxicity, immune-mediated [^notfound] |

---

## Infections

Infections can trigger angioedema via **immune complex formation** or **direct mast cell activation**. Viral infections — such as hepatitis B/C, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, and parvovirus B19 — are recognized triggers, and bacterial infections, including Helicobacter pylori, streptococci, and staphylococci, can also precipitate episodes [^1169Smu6].

---

## Autoimmune and systemic diseases

Autoimmune and systemic diseases can cause **angioedema** through immune complex deposition or complement activation:

- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Associated with acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency and immune complexes [^notfound].

- **Vasculitis**: Leukocytoclastic vasculitis and urticarial vasculitis can mimic or cause angioedema [^1164EdRn].

- **Thyroid disease**: Hashimoto's and Graves' disease are linked to chronic urticaria/angioedema [^notfound].

---

## Malignancies

Malignancies can cause **acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency** via consumption or autoantibodies:

- **Lymphoproliferative disorders**: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma [^113mR272].

- **Solid tumors**: Colon, lung, and breast cancers have been implicated [^notfound].

---

## Physical and environmental triggers

Physical and environmental stimuli can provoke **angioedema** in susceptible individuals:

- **Cold, heat, pressure, vibration, sunlight**: Induce physical urticaria/angioedema [^115kZYoM].

- **Exercise**: Exercise-induced angioedema, often with urticaria [^notfound].

- **Stress**: Emotional stress can trigger attacks, especially in HAE [^116Mw43D].

---

## Idiopathic angioedema

Idiopathic angioedema presents with **recurrent attacks** without identifiable cause after thorough evaluation; it may be mast cell–mediated or non–mast cell–mediated and often requires long-term management [^112i6gwh].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach is essential to identify the cause:

- **History**: Onset, duration, triggers, family history, medication use, associated symptoms (urticaria, abdominal pain, airway symptoms) [^114Npm4r].

- **Physical examination**: Distribution of swelling, presence of urticaria, organ involvement [^114BMBpo].

- **Laboratory tests**: C4, C1-INH level and function, CH50, CBC, thyroid function, autoimmune panel, viral serologies [^111pLSh7].

- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound/CT for suspected visceral involvement; head/neck CT/MRI for airway assessment [^1115urAz].

---

Angioedema has diverse causes beyond hereditary and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, including mast cell–mediated, bradykinin-mediated, drug-induced, infectious, autoimmune, malignant, physical, and idiopathic forms. A **focused history, examination, and targeted labs** enable accurate diagnosis and mechanism-specific therapy [^116iW7Tq].

### Differential diagnosis of angioedema [^111vW4Mi]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

There are many conditions that may present with swelling that mimics angioedema. When swelling persists for greater than a few days or is unresponsive to treatment for urticaria/angioedema, other etiologies should be considered. In most instances, a thorough history and physical examination will define other etiologies. However, for more persistent conditions, further laboratory evaluation and a biopsy may be required to define the diagnosis. Rarely is a more aggressive approach required to make the diagnosis. Clinicians should remember that if the swelling does not act like angioedema, it more than likely is not angioedema.

### Angioedema. pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, and treatment [^117WxrqK]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a constellation of syndromes that present a great challenge to the clinician. The term "angioedema" describes the localized, transient, episodic edema of the deeper layers of the skin or of the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. Although angioedema may affect any part of the body, the skin and gastrointestinal tract are involved most commonly by far. Episodic abdominal pain arising from angioedema affecting any intra-abdominal organ may occur without skin angioedema; therefore, angioedema must be included in the differential diagnosis of intermittent, unexplained abdominal pain. Angioedema is caused by extravasation of plasma in the affected areas, which at times is accompanied by nonspecific, minimal cellular infiltrate. The most commonly identified causes of angioedema are medications, allergens, and physical agents, but most angioedema is idiopathic. Rare forms of angioedema associated with either hereditary or acquired faulty activation of the complement and kallikrein-kinin systems have been extensively described. Taking a comprehensive personal and family history, performing a physical examination, and compulsively monitoring the response to therapy are the most rewarding and cost-effective diagnostic and treatment tools. Diligent and knowledgeable follow-up by the attending physician spares patients costly and unnecessary tests as well as harmful treatment. The most effective treatment depends on the identification of the causative mechanism and — especially when the mechanism is not identified — on the clinician's knowledge and experience with innovative therapeutic regimens.

Objectives

Reading this article will remind the reader that some patients presenting with complaints of urticaria and angioedema may not have urticaria or angioedema at all, but may have other causes, often unusual, sometimes treatable. It will also increase the reader's ability to recognize masqueraders of angioedema, urticaria, and facial swelling thought to be angioedema.

Data Sources

Data for this article come mainly from the authors' personal experiences and selected references to illustrate points made in the article.

Study Selection

The criteria used are patients and articles from the authors' experiences that illustrate the point of this article that patients presenting with urticaria and angioedema may have other diseases and some of these are treatable.

Results

The objectives will be met by patient presentations plus pertinent literature review.

Conclusions

Some patients presenting as angioedema and urticaria have swelling and skin lesions attributable to other causes. Although they are uncommon, they are sometimes treatable. Not all patients referred to an allergist for angioedema have angioedema.

### Differences and similarities in the mechanisms and clinical expression of bradykinin-mediated vs. mast cell-mediated angioedema [^111ZKLJq]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Angioedema (AE), transient localized swelling due to extravasated fluid, is commonly classified as mast cell mediator-induced, bradykinin-mediated or of unknown cause. AE often occurs more than once, and it is these recurrent forms of AE that are challenging for patients and physicians, and they are the ones we focus on and refer to as AE in this review. Since effective treatment depends on the causative mediator, reliable and early diagnosis is essential. Although their clinical presentations bear similarities, many forms of angioedema exhibit specific patterns of clinical appearance or disease history that may aid in diagnosis. Here, we describe the most common differences and similarities in the mechanisms and clinical features of bradykinin-mediated and mast cell mediator-induced types of angioedema. We first provide an overview of the diseases that manifest with mast cell mediator-induced versus bradykinin-mediated angioedema as well as their respective underlying pathogenesis. We then compare these diseases for key clinical features, including angioedema location, course and duration of swelling, attack frequency, prevalence and relevance of prodromal signs and symptoms, triggers of angioedema attacks, and other signs and symptoms including wheals, age of onset, and duration. Our review and comparison of the clinical profiles of different types of angioedema incorporate our own clinical experience as well as published information. Our aim is to highlight that mast cell mediator-induced and bradykinin-mediated angioedema types share common features but are different in many aspects. Knowledge of the differences in underlying pathomechanisms and clinical profiles between different types of angioedema can help with the diagnostic approach in affected patients and facilitate targeted and effective treatment.

Tarbox JA, Bansal A, Peiris AN. Angioedema. JAMA. 2018; 319:

2054. doi: 10.1001/jama.2018.4860 Angioedema is swelling caused by fluid leakage from blood vessels into the surrounding skin and tissue. Angioedema can involve any part of the body but is usually more pronounced around the eyes, lips, mouth, tongue, extremities, and genitalia. The swelling may be accompanied by hives, which are more superficial, while angioedema affects the deeper layers of skin. There are multiple causes of angioedema. Allergic angioedema is the most common type and includes reactions to foods such as peanuts and shellfish, medications including antibiotics, insect bites and stings, and latex. Nonallergic, drug-induced angioedema is caused by certain medicines including a commonly prescribed blood pressure drug class, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. This type occurs without an allergic component and is not associated with itching or hives.

The relatively rare hereditary angioedema is caused by lack of or dysfunction in an enzyme in the complement pathway, which is part of the immune system. Acquired angioedema is related to infections, autoimmune diseases, and, rarely, malignancies such as lymphoma. Idiopathic angioedema means there is no clear cause. Symptoms of angioedema include swelling, often around the eyes, lips, and tongue but possibly in any part of the body, including hands, feet, and genitalia. Shortness of breath, dizziness, and fainting may also occur, and angioedema may be accompanied by abdominal pain from swelling of the intestinal tract. An itchy raised rash called urticaria can occur with allergic angioedema. In nonallergic angioedema, symptoms tend to occur later — hours to days after exposure. Occasionally, more severe reactions may occur, including swelling of the airway and changes in blood pressure. This can be a medical emergency and calling 911 is recommended.

Injectable epinephrine or other medication should be administered if appropriate. Potential warning signs are voice changes; a harsh vibrating noise when breathing; tongue or throat swelling; sudden, severe difficulty breathing; and a fainting sensation or collapse.

### Classification, diagnosis, and pathology of angioedema without hives [^116iW7Tq]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

A clear disease classification schema coupled with an understanding of the specific mechanisms involved in the different types of angioedema without hives informs the diagnostic assessment. The recommended approach involves several key steps. Foremost is the recognizing of the clinical clues which allow for the differentiation of mast cell-mediated disorders from bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Enhanced vascular permeability related to bradykinin is of critical importance to identify given the implications for disease morbidity and risk of mortality. The ability to efficiently categorize and diagnose all forms of angioedema results in improved patient outcomes.

### Urticaria and angioedema [^116vMRDN]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Urticaria and angioedema are commonly encountered complaints in children. Although the diagnosis is clear, establishing an etiology, especially with respect to chronic urticaria, can be challenging. A significant proportion of chronic urticarial cases are now considered to have an autoimmune etiology. This article reviews progress in the field of urticaria and angioedema including developments in pathogenesis, description of laboratory testing, and review of medications. Urticaria and angioedema can usually be controlled by avoidance of triggers, a variety of supportive medications, and reassurance.

### Angioedema with normal complement studies: what Do we know? [^111pLSh7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Angioedema is generally readily recognizable clinically and is characterized by localized nonpitting edema involving subcutaneous, submucosal, or deep dermal tissue caused by increased vascular permeability and extravasation of intravascular fluid. It can occur via a variety of mechanisms. A number of clinical conditions (masqueraders) are occasionally mistaken for angioedema. Clinical classification of the various angioedema forms begins with noting the presence or absence of concurrent urticaria or wheals. Pathogenesis can be considered through two broad categories: mast cell-mediated with release of vasoactive mediators causing angioedema usually associated with urticaria or in the context of an anaphylactic reaction; and bradykinin (BK)-driven, in which increased vascular permeability is mediated by BK. BK-mediated angioedema does not occur with urticaria, nor does it respond to antiallergic medications. The various forms of hereditary angioedema are included in this category, requiring specific tests of C4 and C1 inhibitor level and function to confirm the diagnosis. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which impair the degradation of BK, account for up to a third of all patients with angioedema presenting to the emergency department. Finally, angioedema may occur by yet unknown mechanisms; under this circumstance, it is difficult to manage.

### Angioedema due to bradykinin dysregulation [^1157HdBt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Angioedema is an acute swelling of the deeper layers of the skin or mucosa resulting from a transient increase in vascular permeability. Angioedema can occur in the absence or presence of hives, be hereditary or acquired, and be caused by various potential mediators, including histamine and bradykinin. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema can be difficult to diagnose but is responsible for a disproportionate percentage of the serious morbidity and mortality associated with angioedema. Our understanding of the basic biology of angioedema has dramatically expanded over recent years. The classification of angioedema has correspondently undergone major changes. Optimal management of patients with angioedema requires that an accurate diagnosis be established and that treatment be tailored to the patient's specific form of angioedema. In this article, we review the biology of bradykinin-mediated angioedema as well as the clinical approach to the evaluation of angioedema with a focus on bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Recognizing how the underlying pathophysiology and mechanisms of bradykinin dysregulation contribute to angioedema can help guide the clinical approach to the patient.

### Triggers of exacerbation in chronic urticaria and recurrent angioedema-prevalence and relevance [^117Vj3xH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with urticaria and angioedema often have triggers that cause an outbreak or a swelling episode or worsen their chronic condition. Exploring these factors with each patient may result in better understanding and control of their disease. Patients should be advised to avoid known triggers, if feasible, or prepare to prevent or control an exacerbation with appropriate pretreatment if avoidance is not possible. In this review, we describe and discuss a variety of factors for which there is evidence that they cause or exacerbate chronic spontaneous urticaria and angioedema. These potentially exacerbating factors include drugs, food additives, and naturally occurring pseudoallergens, mental stress, and trauma.

### What's new in the treatment of urticaria and angioedema [^111qSgoj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria and angioedema are diseases often managed by Allergy and Immunology specialists. Recent international guidelines have outlined a stepwise approach to management of patients using dose escalation of second-generation antihistamines followed by use of omalizumab and finally cyclosporine in more refractory cases. In select patients (those with refractory chronic urticaria), nonbiologic alternative medications with anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant activity may be considered. Angioedema without wheals may have several different pathophysiologic mechanisms. Optimal management of mast cell-mediated angioedema is less clear but is often managed similar to chronic spontaneous urticaria. Drug-induced angioedema due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is a common cause of angioedema in the emergency department. Although bradykinin is thought to be a primary mediator for this type of angioedema, studies of targeted therapies have been generally disappointing. In contrast, several targeted therapies have been proven successful using acute and preventive approaches for management of hereditary angioedema. Further developments, including novel biologics, novel oral therapies, and gene therapy approaches, may hopefully continue to broaden therapeutic options to ensure optimal individual management of patients with hereditary angioedema.

### Angioedema deaths in the United States, 1979–2010 [^114LqABH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hospital admission data indicate that the angioedema incidence has increased during the past several decades. Little is known about mortality trends.

Objectives

To count the number of deaths associated with angioedema in the United States, investigate correlations with age, sex, race, and other contributory causes, and analyze trends from 1979 to 2010.

Methods

All US death certificates in which angioedema was listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death during 1979 to 2010 were analyzed. Age-adjusted mortality rates were analyzed by age, sex, and race. Other conditions designated as the underlying cause of death were investigated.

Results

From 1979 to 2010, there were 5,758 deaths in which angioedema was listed as a contributing cause. The age-adjusted death rate for hereditary angioedema decreased from 0.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25–0.32) to 0.06 (95% CI 0.05–0.08) per million persons per year. Conversely, mortality for angioedema increased from 0.24 (95% CI 0.21–0.27) to 0.34 (95% CI 0.31–0.37) per million. Blacks constituted 55% of angioedema deaths that were associated with use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. On death certificates that listed hereditary angioedema as the underlying cause of death, cancer (frequently lymphoma or leukemia) was the second most commonly listed cause.

Conclusion

Angioedema-associated deaths were very rare from 1979 to 2010. Hereditary angioedema deaths became even more so, whereas nonhereditary angioedema deaths increased. Risks associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were higher in blacks. Lack of specific coding for acquired angioedema most likely explains the observed association between cancer and hereditary angioedema. In the future, more granular coding systems may help distinguish hereditary from acquired angioedema.

Results

Herein, a case-based approach is presented for discussing the major types of angioedema, including the following: hereditary angioedema types I and II and normal complement, acquired angioedema, angiotensin-converting enzyme-induced angioedema, and histaminergic and nonhistaminergic angioedema. Emerging treatments of hereditary angioedema including targets of prekallikrein, DNA vector technology replacing C1-INH protein, and CRIPSR technology targeting prekallikrein among many others are explored. In addition, other causes and mimickers of angioedema are briefly reviewed. Finally, a novel algorithm is proposed to help guide the treating physician through the workup and management of patients with suspected idiopathic angioedema unresponsive to conventional therapy with antihistamines.

Conclusion

Over the years, many strides have been made in both understanding the pathophysiology of various types of angioedema and expansion of treatment options. It is important for clinicians to be aware of current and emerging treatment options. We provide a novel practical algorithm to guide clinicians in challenging cases of idiopathic angioedema refractory to antihistamines.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1169Smu6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — duration-based definition and association with triggers: Acute urticaria and angioedema are differentiated from chronic urticaria and angioedema (CUA) based on duration of illness. (D), and the presence of urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria, with the distinction of 6 weeks as a dividing interval between acute urticaria and CU, although somewhat arbitrary, being useful because the most common cause of acute urticaria and angioedema, particularly in children, is a transient viral infection; for this reason, acute urticaria, in contrast to CUA, can often be associated with a specific cause or trigger.

### A randomized trial of icatibant in ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema [^11376LhM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study Icatibant in ACEi-induced angioedema was published by Bas M and colleagues in 2015 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acquired angioedema and Hypertension. In the Icatibant in ACEi-induced angioedema study, the trial question was: what is the role of icatibant in patients who had ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema? In the Icatibant in ACEi-induced angioedema study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Icatibant in ACEi-induced angioedema study, the population was: 27 patients (10 female, 17 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema of the upper aerodigestive tract. The key exclusion criteria were causes other than ACE inhibitors, history of angioedema before the initiation of ACE-inhibitor therapy, acute urticaria, unstable angina, acute myocardial ischemia, acute HF with a NYHA class of III or IV, pregnancy, and lactation. In the Icatibant in ACEi-induced angioedema study, the interventions were: n = 13 icatibant (at a dose of 30 mg SC) n = 14 standard therapy (intravenous 500 mg prednisolone plus 2 mg clemastine). In the Icatibant in ACEi-induced angioedema study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in median time to complete resolution of edema (8 hours vs. 27.1 hours; AD -19.1 hours, 95% CI -31.18 to -7.02). In the Icatibant in ACEi-induced angioedema study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in complete resolution within 4 hours (38% vs. 0%; AD 38%, 95% CI 5.95 to 70.05) Significant decrease in median time to the onset of symptom relief (2 hours vs. 11.7 hours; AD -9.7 hours, 95% CI -18.47 to -0.93). In the Icatibant in ACEi-induced angioedema study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in drug-related adverse event. significant differences in adverse events (7% vs. 27%), redness at injection site (80% vs. 27%), swelling at injection site (53% vs. 20%), pain at injection site (47% vs. 13%). In the Icatibant in ACEi-induced angioedema study, the conclusion was: in patients who had ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema of the upper aerodigestive tract, icatibant was superior to standard therapy with respect to median time to complete resolution of edema.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^117Btbxz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria. Urticaria/angioedema with systemic signs can occur in anaphylaxis, and epinephrine should be prescribed if the diagnosis of anaphylaxis has not been excluded. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and empiric elimination diets (not guided by history and testing) are not recommended; extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution of acute urticaria and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing when significant dermatographism is present; skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases but might occasionally be useful for differentiating from other inflammatory disorders. Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by detailed history and eliminated if possible. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills, whereas these impairments are less evident or not evident with second-generation antihistamines as a class. In patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing an effective plan.

### Classification, diagnosis, and approach to treatment for angioedema: consensus report from the hereditary angioedema international working group [^111bTV7t]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Angioedema is defined as localized and self-limiting edema of the subcutaneous and submucosal tissue, due to a temporary increase in vascular permeability caused by the release of vasoactive mediator(s). When angioedema recurs without significant wheals, the patient should be diagnosed to have angioedema as a distinct disease. In the absence of accepted classification, different types of angioedema are not uniquely identified. For this reason, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology gave its patronage to a consensus conference aimed at classifying angioedema. Four types of acquired and three types of hereditary angioedema were identified as separate forms from the analysis of the literature and were presented in detail at the meeting. Here, we summarize the analysis of the data and the resulting classification of angioedema.

### Diagnosing angioedema [^112rwqW1]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Angioedema usually occurs within the setting of allergic diseases or urticaria, but situations occur in which angioedema itself represents a disease, such as in hereditary angioedema. Evaluation of patients for recurrent angioedema without wheals must take into account both specific clinical signs and symptoms and specialized laboratory testing.

### The clinical evaluation of angioedema [^114Npm4r]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical evaluation of angioedema is reliant on obtaining a thorough patient and family history with an assessment of risk factors and presenting symptoms unique to each subtype. It is important to distinguish between angioedema with and without urticaria as a primary step in the evaluation; thereafter, laboratory parameters and investigations allow for subsequent stratification. There is a significant disease burden associated with angioedema and thus it is essential for health care practitioners to establish a prompt and accurate diagnosis, and a comprehensive care plan that addresses the patient's physical and mental well-being alike.

### Chronic urticaria and recurrent angioedema: clues to the mimics [^113Ym3Ep]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Urticaria and angioedema are experienced by up to 1 in 5 people, usually the result of common allergen or medication triggers and infections. Similarly, the majority of recurrent angioedema has an exogenous trigger, for example, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or is hereditary (type 1 and 2 hereditary angioedema); chronic spontaneous urticaria are most often autoimmune or autoallergic in routine clinical practice. There are, however, several skin and systemic conditions that can imitate the clinical appearance of either angioedema or urticaria, whereas there are several uncommon conditions that have chronic urticaria and/or recurrent angioedema as part of their disease manifestations. Correct diagnosis is paramount to ensuring subsequent tailored therapy for many of these conditions, and in many instances, diagnostic delay can be several years with morbid consequence. In this grand rounds article, we present 2 illustrative clinical cases as the backdrop to discussing a practical diagnostic approach for clinicians to recognize copycat phenotypes and "red flags" that should prompt further investigation of several uncommon mimics. We highlight key diagnostic features, epidemiology, and management for mimics where treatment is distinct from the common phenotypes of recurrent angioedema and chronic urticarias.

### Hereditary angioedema: diagnosis and management-a perspective for the dermatologist [^1149KeUP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a relatively rare, but potentially life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by marked, diffuse mucosal edema that, in extreme cases, can affect the airway leading to asphyxiation. The clinical picture is similar to that of other forms of angioedema; therefore, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is common. HAE is caused by a deficiency in, or a dysfunction of, C1 esterase inhibitor, which has a wide variety of physiologic functions, of which regulation of the contact (kallikrein-kinin) system is most relevant to this condition. Effective management of HAE must consider routine/long-term prophylaxis, short-term prophylaxis (in advance of predicted trauma, eg, surgical or dental procedures), and treatment of acute attacks. Historically, treatment options have been limited to controlling symptoms, but progress in understanding the pathophysiology of HAE has facilitated development of treatments, such as C1 inhibitor therapy, or drugs targeted at the bradykinin pathway, which address the underlying pathologic process.

### Clinical immunology review series: an approach to the patient with angio-oedema [^117Dv8k2]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Angio-oedema is a common reason for attendance at the accident and emergency department and for referral to immunology/allergy clinics. Causative factors should always be sought, but a large proportion of patients have the idiopathic form of the disease. A minority of patients represent a diagnostic and treatment challenge. Failure to identify the more unusual causes of angio-oedema may result in life-threatening situations. Common and rare causes of angio-oedema will be discussed in this article, as well as the diagnostic and treatment pathways for the management of these patients. A comprehensive history and close monitoring of response to treatment are the most cost-effective diagnostic and treatment tools.

### US HAEA medical advisory board 2020 guidelines for the management of hereditary angioedema [^116iocJR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Scientific and clinical progress together with the development of effective novel therapeutic options has engendered multiple important changes in the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema (HAE). We now update and extend the 2013 United States Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board guidelines for the treatment and management of HAE. The guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature review with recommendations indicating both the strength of our recommendation and the quality of the underlying evidence. Guidelines are provided regarding the classification, diagnosis, on-demand treatment, prophylactic treatment, special considerations for women and children, development of a comprehensive management and monitoring plan, and assessment of burden of illness for both HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency and HAE with normal C1 inhibitor. Advances in HAE treatment now allow the development of management plans that can help many patients with HAE lead a normal life. Achieving this goal requires that physicians be familiar with the diagnostic and therapeutic transformations that have occurred in recent years.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^116NGYDH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- disease severity is highly variable, as characterized by episodic rather than continuous swelling

- a precipitating cause for most attacks is unknown

- stress and trauma are recognized as precipitants

- HAE is characterized by relatively prolonged attacks

- attacks of swelling generally involve the extremities, abdomen, genitourinary tract, face, oropharynx, or larynx and follow a stereotypical pattern in which the swelling worsens over 24 hours, peaks, and then slowly resolves over the following 48–72 hours

- attacks can be preceded by a prodrome

- onset of swelling in patients with HAE most often begins during childhood and frequently worsens around puberty

- HAE attacks are associated with significant potential morbidity and potential mortality.

Recurrent angioedema diagnostic algorithm — one branch states "Not likely HAE or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency; Exclude cause (e.g., drug) and consider idiopathic". The algorithm also asks "Is patient taking an ACE-I?" and instructs "Stop ACE-I; does AE resolve?"; if it resolves, the outcome is "ACE-I associated AE".

### Genetic variants leading to urticaria and angioedema and associated biomarkers [^117TYQFa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Advances in next generation sequencing technologies, as well as their expanded accessibility and clinical use over the past 2 decades, have led to an exponential increase in the number of identified single gene disorders. Among these are primary atopic disorders-inborn errors of immunity resulting in severe allergic phenotypes as a primary presenting feature. Two cardinal aspects of type I immediate hypersensitivity allergic reactions are hives and angioedema. Mast cells (MCs) are frequent primary drivers of these symptoms, but other cells have also been implicated. Even where MC degranulation is believed to be the cause, mediator-induced symptoms may greatly vary among individuals. Angioedema-particularly in the absence of hives-may also be caused by hereditary angioedema conditions resulting from aberrant regulation of contact system activation and excessive bradykinin generation or impairment of vascular integrity. In these patients, swelling can affect unpredictable locations and fail to respond to MC-directed therapies. Genetic variants have helped delineate key pathways in the etiology of urticaria and nonatopic angioedema and led to the development of targeted therapies. Herein, we describe the currently known inherited and acquired genetic causes for these conditions, highlight specific features in their clinical presentations, and discuss the benefits and limitations of biomarkers that can help distinguish them.

### Pediatric angioedema [^117JPk1d]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a self-limited nonpitting edema generally affecting the deeper layers of the skin and mucous membranes. It is the result of increased vascular permeability causing the leakage of fluid into the skin in response to potent vasodilators released by immunologic mediators. Two main pathways are thought to be implicated in angioedema. The mast cell pathway in which preformed mediators, such as histamine, rapidly formed mediators, leukotrienes and prostaglandins, are released from mast cells through IgE or direct activation. This is the most common pathway among children, with food, medications, and infections commonly implicated. The second pathway is the kinin pathway, most notably affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and hereditary forms of angioedema, which ultimately results in the formation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. Angioedema is being encountered with increasing frequency, particularly among children and is important to recognize and treat for its life-threatening associated manifestations such as anaphylaxis and airway obstruction. Although angioedema is still not fully understood, we have broadened our understanding of the possible causes and clinical course of angioedema. An understanding of these potential causes and mechanisms by which angioedema can occur may guide the clinician in determining the need for diagnostic testing and the extent of treatment.

### Hereditary angioedema [^112vRaBu]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that usual results from a decreased level of functional C1-INH and clinically manifests with intermittent attacks of swelling of the subcutaneous tissue or submucosal layers of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Laboratory studies and radiographic imaging have limited roles in evaluation of patients with acute attacks of HAE except when the diagnosis is uncertain and other processes must be ruled out. Treatment begins with assessment of the airway to determine the need for immediate intervention. Emergency physicians should understand the pathophysiology of HAE to help guide management decisions.

### Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor: an updated international consensus paper on diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment [^111WnBGW]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Angioedema is defined as intermittent, localized, and self-limited swelling of the subcutaneous and/or submucosal tissue. Multiple sites may be involved. It may occur in isolation, accompanied by hives (also known as wheals) or as part of a systemic allergic reaction. Angioedema may occur at any age developing spontaneously or in response to a triggering factor. Symptoms may persist for a few hours or may last days, resolving spontaneously or after treatment. All types of angioedema present with relatively similar signs and symptoms although there are differences between the various forms.

The proximate cause of all angioedema is attributed to increased vascular endothelial permeability. The underlying mechanisms, while heterogeneous and complex, ultimately result in enhanced vascular permeability leading to tissue swelling. Angioedema may result from mediators associated with mast cell activity; excess production of bradykinin due to either activation of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) or direct cleavage of kininogens by non- contact system proteases; reduced catabolism of bradykinin, as in some types of drug-induced angioedema; or intrinsic dysfunction of the vascular endothelium.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) has been recognized for almost 150 years. In 1963, Donaldson reported that HAE patients were characterized by decreased plasma levels of C1INH, a type of HAE now known as HAE-C1INH. Over the last two decades, new types of apparent non-mast cell mediated angioedema with normal quantity and activity of C1INH were described, in some cases with proven genetic pathogenic variants co-segregating with family and individual angioedema expression. While several clinical guidelines and practice parameters regarding this new type of HAE have been published, substantial progress has been made encompassing diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and treatment outcomes.

In the summer of 2023, HAE International (HAEi) and the US HAE Association (HAEA) enlisted 31 HAE with normal C1INH (HAE-nC1INH) global experts to synthesize our current knowledge in the area in order to present a best practice approach to the diagnosis and management of HAE-nC1INH. Preliminary drafts of the findings were presented and discussed in a symposium held on September 1, 2023 in Munich, Germany. The current manuscript reflects four rounds of revisions of these original drafts. Given the paucity of high-level evidence, all recommendations in this paper are based on expert opinion.

### Molecular dambusters: what is behind hyperpermeability in bradykinin-mediated angioedema? [^115zr1dp]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Main features of tissue edema. Pathophysiology, location, and temporal relations are the main features of edema. A few examples are also included under "pathophysiology". Color shading highlights the main topic of the current review — the vascular endothelium

Although several pathophysiological processes can result in edema formation (Fig. 1), we will focus in this review on types of edema where dysregulation of ECs is the leading pathogenetic factor in the impairment of the P/B state. This is the case in bradykinin (BK)- or histamine-mediated angioedema or in capillary leak syndrome (CLS). The active participation of ECs in edema can be observed in inflammatory and infectious diseases (i.e. sepsis, and even in COVID-19). In these conditions, regardless of the active or passive role of endothelium, IVP is transiently induced. By eliminating the underlying pathologic factors, the edema also resolves. However, several distinct diseases cause recurrent elevation of EC permeability leading to angioedema attacks without any sign of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury, severe inflammation, or injury to the endothelium. Wu et al. proposed to name these transient conditions as paroxysmal permeability disorders (PPDs), characterized by the return of the ECs to normal function after resolution of the angioedema attack.

Although the term " angioedema " should be applied to every edematous disease where the primary cause is the damage or dysregulation of vascular endothelium, it is restrictively reserved to mast cell (MC)-mediated and BK-mediated PPDs. In MC-mediated angioedema, where histamine is the main mediator, a great number of other MC-derived factors and secondary factors produced by other cell types also participate in the pathomechanism. Typically, MC-mediated angioedema has a rather instant onset, beginning within minutes after allergen challenge.

As a potent vasoactive oligopeptide, BK has been brought into the focus of research during the exploration of the pathophysiology of angioedema. During an episode of BK-mediated angioedema, BK is overproduced by the uncontrolled activation of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) due to C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency, or is elevated due to reduced breakdown caused by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs).

### Clinical practice statement: what is the emergency department management of patients with angioedema secondary to an ACE-inhibitor? [^116qLh9s]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Angioedema is a complication that has been reported in up to 1.0% of individuals taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is). Importantly, the onset of angioedema can occur anywhere from hours to several years after initiation of therapy with ACE-Is. Although most cases of ACE-I-induced angioedema (ACE-I-AE) are self-limiting, a major clinical concern is development of airway compromise, which can potentially require emergent airway management. The underlying pathophysiology of ACE-I-AE is incompletely understood, but is considered to be due in large part to excess bradykinin. Numerous medications have been proposed for the treatment of ACE-I-AE. This article is an update to the 2011 Clinical Practice Committee (CPC) statement from the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.

Methods

A literature search in PubMed was performed with search terms angioedema and ACE inhibitors from August 1, 2012 to May 13, 2019. Following CPC guidelines, articles written in English were identified and then underwent a structured review for evaluation.

Results

The search parameters resulted in 323 articles. The abstracts of these articles were assessed independently by the reviewers, who determined there were 63 articles that were specific to ACE-I-AE, of which 46 were deemed appropriate for grading in the final focused review.

Conclusions

The primary focus for the treatment of ACE-I-AE is airway management. In the absence of high-quality evidence, no specific medication therapy is recommended for its treatment. If, however, the treating physician feels the patient's presentation is more typical of an acute allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, it may be appropriate to treat for those conditions. Any patient with suspected ACE-I-AE should immediately discontinue that medication.

### How we manage persons with hereditary angioedema [^114DtjHT]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of subcutaneous and mucosal swelling that can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. Several novel therapies introduced since 2008 have dramatically transformed the approach to management. In this review we will discuss the current understanding of the pathophysiology of HAE, diagnostic evaluation of recurrent angioedema without urticaria, and the therapeutic approach to HAE. We advocate taking an integrative approach to care in order to normalize the lives of affected patients.

### A consensus parameter for the evaluation and management of angioedema in the emergency department [^111yKS4p]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite its relatively common occurrence and life-threatening potential, the management of angioedema in the emergency department (ED) is lacking in terms of a structured approach. It is paramount to distinguish the different etiologies of angioedema from one another and more specifically differentiate histaminergic-mediated angioedema from bradykinin-mediated angioedema, especially in lieu of the more novel treatments that have recently become available for bradykinin-mediated angioedema. With this background in mind, this consensus parameter for the evaluation and management of angioedema attempts to provide a working framework for emergency physicians (EPs) in approaching the patient with angioedema in terms of diagnosis and management in the ED. This consensus parameter was developed from a collaborative effort among a group of EPs and leading allergists with expertise in angioedema. After rigorous debate, review of the literature, and expert opinion, the following consensus guideline document was created. The document has been endorsed by the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM).

### Histaminergic angioedema [^117FCcej]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Angioedema is frequently categorized into histamine- or bradykinin-mediated disease. It is critical to determine the underlying mediator of symptoms as it directs treatment. Histaminergic angioedema is the most frequent cause of angioedema. It is classified as either acute (lasting < 6 weeks) or chronic (symptoms > 6 weeks). It is further classified into angioedema presenting with or without urticaria. Some patients with acute angioedema may have disease that becomes chronic. Mast cells and basophils are central to the underlying pathophysiology of histamine-mediated angioedema. The underlying treatments of histamine-mediated angioedema are antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine.

### Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor: an updated international consensus paper on diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment [^113sXK6J]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and Forward-Looking Statement

The ability to unambiguously diagnose HAE-nC1INH currently relies on excluding other causes and identifying any underlying mutation; however, clinicians may not have access to gene sequencing. Many if not most patients with possible HAE-nC1INH do not have a demonstrated pathologic mutation. Even without an identified mutation, a presumptive diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH made by an expert physician is sufficient. Since these patients are at risk of serious morbidity and mortality, treatment needs to be available even for a presumptive diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH.

The inability to make definitive diagnoses severely limits our ability to conduct clinical trials to elucidate treatment options. Thus, we recommend that concerted efforts be made to validate accurate biomarkers that can improve diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Since HAE-nC1INH is a rare disease, national or international registries will be essential for learning more about the natural history and response to treatment. The introduction of new techniques into genetic testing has increased the number of genes identified, and biorepositories create the means for analysis of recently identified genes in stored DNA samples of the patients.

### Practical algorithm for diagnosing patients with recurrent wheals or angioedema [^113ZjydN]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic urticaria is a common disorder characterized by recurrent wheals, angioedema, or both. Several differential diagnoses need to be considered in patients presenting with wheals and/or angioedema. These include rare diseases such as autoinflammatory syndromes and urticarial vasculitis in patients with recurrent wheals and bradykinin-mediated angioedema in patients with recurrent swellings. AIM AND RESULT: In order to not miss these conditions, we have developed a symptom-based diagnostic algorithm for the management of patients with wheals and/or angioedema.

Discussion and Conclusion

By asking the right questions and performing a limited diagnostic workup as suggested here, this algorithm may help to establish the right diagnosis and treat patients early and more effectively.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — biopsy and evaluation — Although skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases, it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders, and biopsy is rarely indicated when lesions are typical of urticaria with duration < 24 hours without bruising or purpura; biopsy might be indicated when mastocytosis or urticarial vasculitis is suspected. Most often acute urticaria is self-limiting and resolves in less than 6 weeks, and extensive evaluation for causes not suggested by history or examination is not cost-effective and has not been associated with improved outcomes.

### Angioedema [^116AGAwm]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Angioedema is a potentially life-threatening occurrence that is encountered by critical care providers. The mechanistic understanding of angioedema syndromes has improved in recent years, and novel medications are available that improve outcomes from these syndromes. This clinically focused review will describe the underlying genetics, pathophysiology, classification and treatment of angioedema syndromes, with an emphasis on the novel pharmacologic agents that have recently become available for acute treatment.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was conducted with the MeSH terms angioedema, acquired angioedema, hereditary angioedema type III, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema.

Study Selection

Selected publications describing angioedema, clinical trials, diagnosis, management, and genetics were retrieved (reviews, guidelines, clinical trials, case series), and their bibliographies were also reviewed to identify relevant publications.

Data Extraction

Data from the relevant publications were reviewed, summarized and the information synthesized.

Data Synthesis

The data obtained were used to describe the current state of diagnosis and management of various angioedema syndromes.

Conclusions

Angioedema is a life-threatening syndrome with multiple subtypes, each with a distinct pathophysiology. We present an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and suggested management of various subtypes of angioedema. Securing the airway remains the most important intervention, followed by administration of both established and more novel pharmacologic interventions based on disease pathology.

### Angioedema [^114cEXHw]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Although first described more than 130 years ago, the pathophysiology, origin, and management of the several types of angioedema are poorly understood by most dermatologists. Although clinically similar, angioedema can be caused by either mast cell degranulation or activation of kinin formation. In the former category, allergic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced angioedema are frequently accompanied by urticaria. Idiopathic chronic angioedema is also usually accompanied by urticaria, but can occur without hives. In either case, an autoimmune process leading to dermal mast cell degranulation occurs in some patients. In these patients, histamine-releasing IgG anti-FcepsilonR1 autoantibodies are believed to be the cause of the disease, removal or suppression by immunomodulation being followed by remission. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema is unaccompanied by hives, and is caused by the inhibition of enzymatic degradation of tissue bradykinin. Hereditary angioedema, caused by unchecked tissue bradykinin formation, is recognized biochemically by a low plasma C'4 and low quantitative or functional C'1 inhibitor. Progress has now been made in understanding the molecular genetic basis of the two isoforms of this dominantly inherited disease. Recently, a third type of hereditary angioedema has been defined by several groups. Occurring exclusively in women, it is not associated with detectable abnormalities of the complement system. Angioedema caused by a C'1 esterase inhibitor deficiency can also be acquired in several clinical settings, including lymphoma and autoimmune connective tissue disease. It can also occur as a consequence of specific anti-C'1 esterase autoantibodies in some patients. We have reviewed the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of these different subtypes of angioedema.

Learning Objective

After completing this learning activity, participants should be aware of the classification, causes, and differential diagnosis of angioedema, the molecular basis of hereditary and non-hereditary forms of angioedema, and be able to formulate a pathophysiology-based treatment strategy for each of the subtypes of angioedema.

### Radiologic manifestations of angioedema [^1115urAz]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The major role of imaging of angioedema in the head and neck is to evaluate for the presence of upper airway obstruction and exclusion of other causes. Glossomegaly with low attenuation is commonly present in head and neck angioedema. Angioedema may involve the gastrointestinal tracts and more rarely the genitourinary system. Angioedema of the visceral organs is often accompanied by adjacent fluid, and the involvement may be multifocal or asymmetric (may not always be diffuse or concentric). As the clinical presentation can mimic surgical and inflammatory causes of abdominal pain, the exclusion of these aetiologies is an important role in the imaging evaluation for visceral organ involvements in patients who present with angioedema in any organ system.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria, and if urticaria of less than 6 weeks' duration has features suggesting it might progress, patients should be periodically re-evaluated until a diagnosis is clarified. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and although many cases are infectious, extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing in the presence of significant dermatographism, and skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases though it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines are rapidly acting but can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills compared with second-generation agents, patients should be warned about drowsiness or impaired performance, and in poor responders a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating triggers and forming an effective plan.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^115PGyLE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — trigger identification and avoidance — Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by a detailed history and eliminated, if possible; management should focus on identifying specific triggers based on history with focused testing and symptomatic relief. A delayed syndrome has been recognized with acute urticaria/angioedema with a delay of 3 to 6 hours after ingestion of beef, pork, lamb, or venison. Medication-induced disease requires careful history: ACE inhibitors can cause angioedema after months or even years of therapy, and over-the-counter aspirin or NSAIDs (including aspirin-like remedies) can be associated with acute relapsing urticaria/angioedema; aspirin and NSAIDs should be avoided, as feasible, with substitution of an equally efficacious alternative not commonly associated with urticaria.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^115kZYoM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) diagnosis and management algorithm — patients with a history suggestive of chronic urticaria and/or angioedema are first assessed for angioedema; if present, "Consider medications, C1INH syndromes, or conditions that mimic angioedema". If not and the "history, review of systems, and physical examination" are not consistent, "Consider alternative diagnoses (see Differential Diagnosis Section)". When the history suggests a physical component, "Does the history suggest physical urticaria? Is there a physical component to the urticaria and/or" and the action is to "Consider appropriate challenge testing for physical urticaria". If vasculitis is suggested, "If skin biopsy diagnostic for vasculitis, manage vasculitis. If biopsy negative go to box 10". If "history, physical examination, and/or basic laboratory tests" indicate an underlying cause, "Evaluate and manage specific conditions", otherwise proceed with "Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema" and ensure "Periodic reassessment for underlying etiology and response to therapy".

### Differences and similarities in the mechanisms and clinical expression of bradykinin-mediated vs. mast cell-mediated angioedema [^1154qc1j]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Angioedema (AE) is defined as a transient localized swelling due to extravasated fluid. In clinical terms, AE is often a chronic disease with swellings that occur more than once rather than a solitary episode of swelling. The latter are mostly allergic reactions, for example, in the context of anaphylaxis due to allergen exposure. Here, we focus on AE forms that manifest with recurrent swellings, as they are the ones that are challenging for patients and physicians, and we use the term AE to refer to these recurrent forms of AE.

AE virtually always involves the lower layers of the skin (dermis) and the highly vascular subcutis or the mucous membranes, lasting from a few hours up to several days. In most cases, angioedema occurs spontaneously, but may be induced by various "triggers". In patients with AE, i.e. repeated angioedema attacks for longer than 6 weeks, swelling episodes are separated from each other by symptom-free intervals of a variable duration. Angioedema of the skin is non-pitting, frequently asymmetric, mostly non-pruritic, and can be rather painful. Depending on its location, AE can cause disfigurement, physical dysfunctionality, pain, or obstruction of airways, thereby impairing patients' quality of life.

AE is commonly classified as mast cell mediator-induced AE (MCM-AE), bradykinin (BK)-mediated AE (BK-AE), and AE of unknown cause, based on the underlying pathogenesis. Here, we describe differences and similarities in the mechanisms and clinical features of MCM-AE and BK-AE.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^1137JuhP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to pathogenesis, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, and most patients with HAE have a positive family history of angioedema

- HAE is caused by mutations in the serine protease inhibitor C1 resulting in a serine protease inhibitor C1 functional deficiency

- most cases of HAE result from a deficiency of the serine protease inhibitor C1 inhibitor

- primary mediator of swelling in patients with HAE is bradykinin.

### Current and prospective targets of pharmacologic treatment of hereditary angioedema types 1 and 2 [^1126Nmi1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease that causes episodic attacks of subcutaneous and submucosal edema, which can be painful, incapacitating, and potentially fatal. These attacks are mediated by excessive bradykinin production, as a result of uncontrolled activation of the plasma kallikrein/kinin system, which is caused by a C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction in HAE types 1 and 2, respectively. For many years, treatment options were limited to therapies with substantial adverse effects, insufficient efficacy, or difficult routes of administration. Increased insights in the pathophysiology of HAE have paved the way for the development of new therapies with fewer side effects. In the last two decades, several targeted novel therapeutic strategies for HAE have been developed, for both long-term prophylaxis and on demand treatment of acute attacks. This article reviews the advances in the development of more effective and convenient treatment options for HAE and their anticipated effects on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The emergence of these improved treatment options will presumably change current HAE guidelines, but adherence to these recommendations may become restricted by high treatment costs. It will therefore be essential to determine the indications and identify the patients that will benefit most from these newest treatment generations. Ultimately, current preclinical research into gene therapies may eventually lead the way towards curative treatment options for HAE. In conclusion, an increasing shift towards the use of highly effective long-term prophylaxis is anticipated, which should drastically abate the burden on patients with hereditary angioedema.

### Biomarkers in hereditary angioedema [^112rsS9f]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

In daily practice, clinicians taking care of patients with HAE are faced with several challenges, such as (i) large inter- and intra-familial heterogeneity in the clinical manifestations of the disease; (ii) early diagnosis of unpredictable oncoming angioedema attacks; (iii) a differential diagnosis of HAE subtypes; and (iv) objective assessment of disease severity, which may guide therapeutic decisions. These challenges are the driving force behind the current efforts to identify measurable biomarkers of HAE. Finding such biomarkers could facilitate the diagnosis and prediction of an upcoming attack, as well as help to monitor disease activity, discriminate between high and low responders to a specific drug, or select the best candidates for a given treatment.

This review represents a clinician's perspective and constitutes an attempt to answer the question: to what extent biomarker discovery can help overcome the above challenges? In the broadest sense, any measurable parameter may serve as a biomarker, including clinical features or radiographic findings, but the scope of this review is to discuss only potential laboratory biomarkers that involve essential biological processes, from nucleic DNA to mediators of effector mechanisms.

### Radiologic manifestations of angioedema [^111cRHuN]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Angioedema was first described by J.L. Milton in 1876. First named angioneurotic oedema by Quinckein 1882, it is sometimes referred to as Quincke's oedema. There are various causes of angioedema. The incidence of angioedema varies with its causes. For example, the estimated incidence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema is 0.1 to 1.0% and that of hereditary angioedema (HAE) ranges from 0.002 to 0.01%. It is clinically characterised as episodic localised and transient oedematous swelling, most commonly affecting superficial regions such as the face, genitals, and extremities. If angioedema only affected the superficial regions, imaging evaluation would not be necessary. Angioedema, however, may affect any part of the body, and intra-abdominal involvement can even occur without cutaneous involvement. Angioedema can also present with life-threatening respiratory distress when the upper airway is involved. Angioedema involving the gastrointestinal tract may present as an acute abdominal pain resulting in unnecessary laparotomy. Although the diagnosis of angioedema is clinical, awareness of this entity and its characteristic imaging findings by radiologists will aid in raising the suspicion for angioedema, which may warrant further clinical workup and prevent unnecessary surgery. Additionally, for patients with known previous history of angioedema who have abdominal pain, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the study of choice to evaluate for possible visceral involvement as well as to rule out other pathology.

The purpose of this pictorial review is to present imaging findings of angioedema involving the various organs. Differential diagnoses and complications of angioedema are discussed.

### Angioedema and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: are demographics a risk? [^117F3qzM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) has become the leading cause of acquired angioedema. Previous studies have suggested that certain patient populations may be at a higher risk for ACEI-induced angioedema. The objective of this study was to evaluate any demographic associations.

Study Design

A retrospective chart review.

Materials and Methods

Angioedema patients from 1999 to 2004 treated at a tertiary care hospital were reviewed. Demographics, inciting factors, and comorbid conditions were examined.

Results

One hundred eighty-two patients met inclusion criteria. Sixty-three percent of patients with angioedema had ACEI triggers. Eighty-one percent of all ACEI angioedema occurred in black patients. Of all angioedema patients, 70% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62%-78%) of black patients noted an ACEI as the inciting agent compared with 44% (95% CI, 30%-59%) in other patient groups. Black patients were 3.03 times more likely to have angioedema from an ACEI than all other patient groups (95% CI, 1.54–5.94).

Conclusion

This study represents the largest series of patients with angioedema. Although retrospective in nature, the data show that black patients are at a higher risk for ACEI-induced angioedema.

### Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor: an updated international consensus paper on diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment [^116tceJr]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) has been recognized for almost 150 years. The newest form of HAE, where C1 inhibitor levels are normal (HAE-nC1INH), was first described in 2000. Over the last two decades, new types of apparent non-mast cell–mediated angioedema with normal quantity and activity of C1INH have been described, in some cases with proven genetic pathogenic variants that co-segregate with angioedema expression within families. Like HAE due to C1INH deficiency, HAE-nC1INH patients are at risk of serious morbidity and mortality. Therefore, proactive management and treatment of HAE-nC1INH patients after an expert physician diagnosis is critically important. The underlying pathophysiology responsible for the angioedema has also been clarified in some of the HAE-nC1INH types. While several clinical guidelines and practice parameters including HAE-nC1INH have been published, we have made substantial progress in our understanding encompassing diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and treatment outcomes. HAE International (HAEi) and the US HAE Association (HAEA) convened a symposium of global HAE-nC1INH experts to synthesize our current knowledge in the area. Given the paucity of high-level evidence in HAE-nC1INH, all recommendations are based on expert opinion. This review and expert opinion on the best practice approach to diagnosing and treating HAE-nC1INH will support physicians to better manage patients with HAE-nC1INH.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) — clinical features and natural history — has relatively prolonged attacks involving the extremities, abdomen, genitourinary tract, face, oropharynx, larynx, or combinations, with disease severity highly variable and episodic rather than continuous; onset most often begins during childhood and frequently worsens around puberty, and HAE is an autosomal dominant disease with most patients having a positive family history of angioedema. Attacks generally follow a stereotypical pattern in which swelling worsens over 24 hours and resolves over the following 48 hours, might be preceded by a prodrome, and are associated with significant potential morbidity and mortality; precipitants are often unknown, though stress and trauma are recognized.

### Angioedema: etiology, pathophysiology, current and emerging therapies [^115h5Arv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Angioedema (AE) is characterized by nonpitting edema of the dermis and subcutaneous layers. The most common sites of involvement are the tongue, lips, face, and throat; however, swelling can also occur in the extremities, genitalia, and viscera. Life-threatening airway swelling can also occur. AE may be allergic or nonallergic. The overall lifetime incidence of AE is reported to be as high as 15%.

Objective

This article summarizes the etiology, pathophysiology, and current treatment of several forms of nonallergic AE (including hereditary, acquired, and idiopathic AE) and focuses on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEi-AE), which is responsible for 30%-40% of all AE seen in United States emergency departments.

Discussion

Although the triggers, which are primary biologic mechanisms, and treatments for ACEi-AE may differ from those of the hereditary and acquired forms of AE, the clinical effects of ACEi-AE are mediated through a shared pathway, the kallikrein-kinin system. Thus, although current therapeutic options for ACEi-AE are limited, recent advances in the treatment of hereditary AE (HAE) appear promising for improving the outcomes of patients with ACEi-AE.

Conclusions

New HAE medications that correct imbalances in the kallikrein-kinin system may prove safe and efficacious in the treatment of ACEi-AE.

### Angioedema as a systemic disease [^113mR272]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Angioedema is a clinical entity defined as self-limiting edema localized in the deeper layers of the skin and mucosa and lasting for several days. Angioedema can be provoked by bradykinin and/or mast cell mediators, including histamine. Four types of acquired and three types of hereditary angioedema have been identified. The most obvious form of angioedema associated with other systemic disease is acquired angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency. It is characterized by acquired consumption of C1 inhibitor and various underlying disorders, such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rectal carcinoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Suspected cases need an accurate differential diagnosis to exclude all other types of acquired and hereditary angioedema.

### Hereditary and acquired angioedema: problems and progress: proceedings of the third C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency workshop and beyond [^115RXuk5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare but life-threatening condition, manifests as acute attacks of facial, laryngeal, genital, or peripheral swelling or abdominal pain secondary to intra-abdominal edema. Resulting from mutations affecting C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), inhibitor of the first complement system component, attacks are not histamine-mediated and do not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids. Low awareness and resemblance to other disorders often delay diagnosis; despite availability of C1-INH replacement in some countries, no approved, safe acute attack therapy exists in the United States. The biennial C1 Esterase Inhibitor Deficiency Workshops resulted from a European initiative for better knowledge and treatment of HAE and related diseases. This supplement contains work presented at the third workshop and expanded content toward a definitive picture of angioedema in the absence of allergy. Most notably, it includes cumulative genetic investigations; multinational laboratory diagnosis recommendations; current pathogenesis hypotheses; suggested prophylaxis and acute attack treatment, including home treatment; future treatment options; and analysis of patient subpopulations, including pediatric patients and patients whose angioedema worsened during pregnancy or hormone administration. Causes and management of acquired angioedema and a new type of angioedema with normal C1-INH are also discussed. Collaborative patient and physician efforts, crucial in rare diseases, are emphasized. This supplement seeks to raise awareness and aid diagnosis of HAE, optimize treatment for all patients, and provide a platform for further research in this rare, partially understood disorder.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) treatment structure — The treatment of HAE can be classified into 2 approaches: treatment of acute attacks and prophylactic treatment (short-term and long-term). All patients with HAE, irrespective of their past history, are at risk for severe angioedema attacks, and patients with HAE should have an established plan in place regarding how to respond to a severe attack. Historical surveys suggest a mortality rate in patients with HAE caused by laryngeal angioedema of approximately 30% or higher.

### Hereditary angioedema: a review of the current and evolving treatment landscape [^112zVKJt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease characterized by sudden and often unprovoked episodes of swelling that can be potentially life-threatening when it involves the upper airway. The treatment options for both acute episodes of HAE and LTP, used to minimize the frequency and severity of angioedema attacks, were limited historically to very few options, had considerable side effects, and/or had considerable burden of treatment. Fortunately, through the elucidation of the pathophysiology of HAE, the development of newer targeted therapies has been possible both for acute therapy and long-term prophylaxis and even more are on the horizon. Because of the rapid development of these therapies, it can be challenging for clinicians to keep abreast of newer and developing treatments for HAE. This review article will outline the current and potential future treatments for HAE. It will also highlight important considerations when treating special HAE patient populations including women and pediatric patients.

### Urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis [^116ToR1z]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Urticaria and, to a lesser extent, angioedema are common occurrences in the pediatric population. There are multiple causes of acute and chronic urticaria and angioedema. Most causes are benign, although they can be worrisome for patients and their parents. An allergist should evaluate acute urticaria and/or angioedema if there are concerns of an external cause, such as foods or medications. Chronic urticaria and angioedema can severely affect quality of life and should be managed aggressively with antihistamines and immunomodulators if poorly controlled. Chronic symptoms are unlikely to be due to an external cause. Anaphylaxis is a more serious allergic condition characterized by a systemic reaction involving at least 2 organ systems. Anaphylaxis should be initially managed with intramuscular epinephrine. Patients who experience anaphylaxis should be evaluated by an allergist for possible causes; if found, avoidance of the inciting antigen is the best management. All patients should also be given an epinephrine autoinjector and an action plan. Foods are a common cause of anaphylaxis in the pediatric population. New evidence suggests that the introduction of highly allergic foods is safe in infancy and should not be delayed. In addition, the early introduction of foods such as peanuts may help prevent the development of food allergies.

### How angioedema quality of life questionnaire can help physicians in treating C1-inhibitor deficiency patients? [^1123yCR7]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Angioedema (AE) with C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-AE) belongs to the group of bradykinin (BK)-mediated AEs. These AEs are rare, potentially life-threatening, and characterized by recurrent angioedema episodes. They can be further divided into hereditary and acquired AEs. Hereditary AE with C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

Acquired AE with C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH-AAE) is mostly developed due to an underlying disease (mostly lymphomas) where a consumption of the C1-INH protein and/or formation of anti-C1-INH autoantibodies cause decreased C1-INH quantity and function. Clinical manifestations of C1-INH-AE might be easily misdiagnosed, resulting in a diagnosis delay of years, or even decades.

### Gastrointestinal manifestations, diagnosis, and management of hereditary angioedema [^113P6HTS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common conditions in clinical practice and yet a challenging complaint to accurately diagnose due to the vast number of possible etiologies. When other health care providers cannot identify the cause of abdominal pain, gastroenterologists are often looked upon to help solve the diagnostic dilemma. Consequently, it is incumbent upon gastroenterologists to be well versed in the diagnosis and management of not only common but also rare causes of abdominal pain. One such uncommon but well-described cause of abdominal pain is angioedema of the intestinal tract due to hereditary angioedema. Acute onset, recurrent abdominal pain of varying severity is its most common presenting symptom, and misdiagnosis can not only lead to unnecessary surgical procedures but also death. The purpose of this review is to raise awareness among gastroenterologists about hereditary angioedema as a potential cause of recurrent, unexplained abdominal pain.

### Roles of immune cells in hereditary angioedema [^111AnkV4]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Angioedema is a self‐limiting tissue swelling due to periodic increase in vascular permeability caused by the release of bradykinin (BK) and/or other cell–derived mediators. Recurrent swellings are localized to the skin and/or to the upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Angioedema can be hereditary or acquired. The most common form of hereditary angioedema (HAE) is caused by deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1‐INH‐HAE), but HAE can also occur with normal levels of C1‐INH (nl‐C1‐INH‐HAE).

C1-INH is a protein of the complement system which is a critical component of both the innate and adaptive immunity. The immune system is typically divided in two branches: innate and adaptive, although these distinctions are not completely exclusive. The fundamentals of HAE (or angioedema) have been extensively reviewed previously. In this paper, we focus our discussion on the roles played by the immune system in the pathophysiology of angioedema.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) acute attacks — standard allergy medications are not recommended: Summary Statement 15 states epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are not efficacious and not recommended for the treatment of HAE (C). Unlike allergic or most idiopathic angioedema, HAE swelling involves bradykinin generation; there is no evidence that corticosteroids or antihistamines have any beneficial effect, and epinephrine might provide only transient benefit without altering the attack's course.

### Urticaria and angioedema across the ages [^113U2be5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) and angioedema can occur at any age. Although most CU with or without angioedema occurs in adults, it can also present in children or the elderly and can complicate pregnancy and breast-feeding. The presentations of CU and angioedema are different in children, middle-aged adults, and older patients as are the differential diagnoses. Therefore, the management of CU and angioedema in these different age groups and special populations needs to take into account the age-specific features of urticaria and angioedema. Here, we describe the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of CU and angioedema in children, middle-aged adults, and older patients. This review focuses on CU with or without angioedema and does not discuss acute urticaria or bradykinin-mediated angioedema.

### The spectrum and treatment of angioedema [^111SAmKh]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Angioedema manifests as episodes of localized swelling in the dermis and submucosa. The key to successful management is detection and avoidance of triggers, early recognition of attacks, and aggressive airway management when warranted. Review of a patient's medication list may identify drugs that include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers as the cause. Initial treatment in a patient presenting with most forms of angioedema includes antihistamines and glucocorticoids if required. Epinephrine should be administered if there is concern for laryngeal edema. Patients who have a known history of hereditary angioedema should receive C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate or fresh-frozen plasma.

Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor (C1INH) — diagnosis and pathophysiology — currently lacks commonly agreed diagnostic criteria; some kindreds appear to require high estrogen levels for angioedema to manifest, and increased bradykinin signaling can cause this form. Drugs developed for patients with HAE with normal C1INH levels have been reported effective in some patients.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria/angioedema is "acute" if it spans less than 6 weeks in duration, and in generalized cases a patient might merit administration of immediate emergency treatment (eg, epinephrine) to manage laryngeal obstruction. A comprehensive history and physical examination should be performed to identify a cause, documenting potential triggers and their timing, and a comprehensive review of systems should be carried out to assess for related disorders; physical examination should focus on lesion extent and dermatographia and include examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, lymph nodes, lungs, heart, abdomen, and musculoskeletal system. Findings from history and examination might serve to focus evaluation on a clear trigger for acute urticaria/angioedema, and a limited laboratory diagnostic evaluation might include CBC with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, TSH, and renal and liver profiles. Initial treatment is to remove or avoid factors that induce urticaria/angioedema, and once identifiable triggers have been eliminated, evidence supports the use of antihistamines as first-line therapy for persistent symptoms. Second-generation antihistamines are designed through chemical modifications.

### Non-histaminergic angioedema: focus on bradykinin-mediated angioedema [^117SH7Yk]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a result of increased vascular permeability, with subsequent extravasation of intravascular fluid into the surrounding tissues. Angioedema may be mediated by histamine, bradykinin or other mediators. Histaminergic angioedema generally presents with urticaria and/or pruritus and will respond to conventional treatment with antihistamines, corticosteroids or epinephrine. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which includes hereditary angioedema (HAE types I, II and III), acquired C1-INH deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema does not typically present with urticaria/weals and does not respond to conventional agents such as antihistamines or corticosteroids. In recent years, several agents that prevent the generation or activity of bradykinin have been developed for the treatment of HAE types I and II and are also being evaluated in other types of bradykinin-mediated angioedema. These agents have the potential to improve outcomes for patients with different forms of bradykinin-mediated angioedema.

Annotation 12 — Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema and periodic reassessment: Management entails realistic expectations, daily use of medications, appropriate avoidance measures, and regular follow-up, with periodic reassessment to determine response to therapy and to evaluate clinical changes over time; further work-up might be needed to rule out underlying causes or development of concomitant conditions, and a more detailed evaluation might be warranted for selected patients. If a biopsy is considered, consider conditions that might require special testing and coordinate this with a dermatopathologist, and objective assessments of the percentage of the body covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial visit and each subsequent visit are also important. Complicating factors, such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or an ACE inhibitor in a patient with episodic angioedema, are examples of medications that might compromise patient outcomes, and lack of salutary response to antihistamines taken regularly can also suggest that further evaluation for an alternative condition is warranted.

### Creating a comprehensive treatment plan for hereditary angioedema [^115mHBMw]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has changed dramatically in recent years because of the availability of several HAE-specific medications. This paradigm shift in therapy provides the opportunity to dramatically improve the care of HAE patients, but has increased the complexity of treatment. Patient education and communication with health care providers is crucial. Early treatment of HAE attacks has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, highlighting the importance of rapid and reliable treatment. This review summarizes the current evidence for best practices in HAE management, and suggests practical steps toward developing a comprehensive treatment plan.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) long-term prophylaxis selection — Summary Statement 21: The need for long-term HAE prophylaxis must be individualized based on the patient's situation. (D). The goal of long-term prophylaxis is to decrease the frequency and severity of HAE attacks, and not all patients with HAE require long-term prophylaxis, so the decision must be individualized. As an alternative (or in addition) to prophylactic management, on-demand treatment with an HAE-specific agent (Table E2) for attacks should be considered for management of patients with HAE.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic urticaria and angioedema based on molecular biology, pharmacology, and proteomics [^113MH1h1]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis of urticaria and angioedema has been based on the phenotype as either acute or chronic depending on the duration of more than 6 to 8 weeks, respectively. Additional subdivisions include poorly defined terms such as idiopathic, spontaneous, or autoimmune. In this article, the author suggests that an increased understanding of the acquired and innate immune system and data from novel proteomic technology have blurred the lines between these categories of diagnosis. Specific molecular pathways and response to specific medications should be incorporated in classification and diagnosis schemes.

### Managing chronic urticaria and recurrent angioedema differently with advancing age [^111rSW99]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Angioedema and urticaria affect people of all ages. Accurate diagnosis and optimum management is essential for healthy aging. Older people continue to experience mast cell-mediated urticaria and angioedema, with a higher prevalence of autoimmune and a lower prevalence of autoallergic disease. Bradykinin-mediated angioedemas are more common in the elderly because of their association with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) treatment. Acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency, another bradykinin-mediated angioedema, occurs predominantly in older people, whereas hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency continues to cause symptoms, even in old age. Drug-induced angioedemas disproportionately affect older people, the most frequent users of ACEIs, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Second-generation antihistamines with omalizumab if required are effective and well tolerated in older people with mast cell-mediated urticaria. For bradykinin-mediated angioedemas, these drugs are ineffective. C1-inhibitor replacement or blockade of kallikrein or the bradykinin B2 receptor of the contact pathway is required to treat hereditary angioedema and may be considered in other bradykinin-mediated angioedemas, if supportive treatment is insufficient. For aspirin-related angioedema and urticaria, alternative medications or, exceptionally, desensitization may be required.

Regarding specific circumstances for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to patients with ACEi-associated angioedema, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that angioedema associated with ACEis is likely due to impaired degradation of bioactive peptides, such as bradykinin.

### Angioedema phenotypes: disease expression and classification [^116p1pY1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Due to marked heterogeneity of clinical presentations, comprehensive knowledge of angioedema phenotypes is crucial for correct diagnosis and choosing the appropriate therapeutic approach. One of the ways to a meaningful clinical distinction can be made between forms of angioedema occurring "with or without wheals". Angioedema with wheals (rash) is a hallmark of urticaria, either acute or chronic, spontaneous or inducible. Angioedema without wheals may still be manifested in about 10% of patients with urticaria, but it may also occur as a separate entity. Several classifications of angioedema as part of urticaria were published over time, while a latest one, released in 2014 (HAWK group consensus, see below), provided a classification of all forms of "angioedema without wheals" distinct from urticaria, which will be the focus of the present review. At this time, the HAWK consensus classification is the best in terms of covering the pathophysiology, mediators involved, angioedema triggers, and clinical expression. According to this classification, three types of hereditary angioedema (genetic C1-INH deficiency, normal C1-INH with factor XII mutations, and unknown origin) and four types of acquired angioedema (C1-INH deficiency, related to ACE inhibitors intake, idiopathic histaminergic, and idiopathic non-histaminergic) are presented. We will review the distinctive clinical features of each phenotype in details.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and other drug-associated angioedema [^115yJduD]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, β-lactam antibiotics, non-β lactam antibiotics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the most common classes of drugs that cause angioedema. Drug-induced angioedema is known to occur via mechanisms mediated by histamine, bradykinin, or leukotriene, and an understanding of these mechanisms is crucial in guiding therapeutic decisions. Nonallergic angioedema occurs in patients with genetic variants that affect metabolism or synthesis of bradykinin, substance P, prostaglandins, or leukotrienes, or when patients are taking drugs that have synergistic mechanisms. The mainstay in treatment of nonallergic drug-induced angioedema is cessation of the offending agents.

Section 1: Classification and Diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH

Classification of Recurrent Angioedema Without Hives

Recurrent angioedema without hives encompasses a range of diagnoses with markedly different prognoses and treatments. Several different classification schemes of angioedema have recently been proposed. When evaluating a patient with angioedema, two of the most important criteria to consider are (1) whether the mechanism of swelling is from mast cell activation or another cause (especially bradykinin but potentially including other mast cell–independent mediators or mechanisms affecting vascular permeability) and (2) whether it is hereditary or acquired.

Mast cell–mediated angioedema can result from type I hypersensitivity reactions (antigen bound to specific IgE on mast cells), direct mast cell activation, or as part of chronic urticaria. While chronic urticaria most often includes hives, a significant minority (~ 10%) of these patients present only with angioedema. Mast cell–mediated angioedema without hives may be a separate disorder than chronic urticaria.

A number of drugs can cause angioedema through a variety of mechanisms in the absence of specific IgE. The drugs most commonly associated with angioedema include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, other kininase (such as neprilysin or dipeptidyl peptidase IV [DPPIV]) inhibitors, tissue plasminogen activators, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

HAE includes a group of rare genetically transmitted disorders characterized by recurrent angioedema without hives. It should be recognized that hives are common and can occur coincidentally in patients with a separate diagnosis of recurrent angioedema. Biochemical abnormalities in HAE were first identified in 1962 and 1963 and subsequently shown to be autosomal dominant with high penetrance. HAE-C1INH is caused by pathogenic variants in the gene encoding C1INH (SERPING1) resulting in reduced functional levels of C1INH and leading to dysregulated production of bradykinin.

### Phenotype standardization of angioedema in the head and neck region caused by agents acting on the angiotensin system [^1155P2cm]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a potentially life-threatening adverse reaction to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. To study the genetic etiology of this rare adverse event, international consortia and multicenter recruitment of patients are needed. To reduce patient heterogeneity, we have standardized the phenotype. In brief, it comprises swelling in the head and neck region that first occurs during treatment. It should not coincide with urticaria or have another likely cause such as hereditary angioedema.

Angioedema triage by urticaria phenotype — when to evaluate for C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency: The pattern of swelling, particularly whether angioedema occurs with or without urticaria, is diagnostically important, urticaria is not a feature of HAE, patients with recurrent angioedema without coexisting urticaria merit evaluation for C1INH deficiency, and most cases of recurrent angioedema with concomitant urticaria or pruritis are responsive to antihistamines, are histamine mediated, and are best considered within the spectrum of chronic urticaria, with episodes lacking a consistent temporal association possibly considered a separate condition.
