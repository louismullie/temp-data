## Question

What is the optimal age to start screening for breast cancer in the general population?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal age to start routine breast cancer screening in average-risk women, seeking a synthesis of major guidelines and evidence, and a clear reasoning process with self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "average risk" and the scope of recommendations. Then, I should review the most authoritative guidelines and their evolution. Next, I will examine the evidence base for starting at 40 versus 45 or 50, including modeling and observational data. After that, I need to weigh benefits against harms and consider equity and risk-adapted approaches. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and clarify intervals and stopping criteria, while double-checking areas of controversy and uncertainty.

> Let me first confirm the target population and scope so I don't conflate high-risk pathways with average-risk screening. Average risk refers to women without a personal history of breast cancer, known pathogenic variants such as BRCA, prior chest irradiation, or a lifetime risk above 20 percent, and the central question here is routine screening initiation age for this group, not supplemental MRI or intensified protocols for high-risk women [^112SjnVL] [^111Wnmki].

> Next, I should review the major guidelines and their current positions, and I need to be careful to distinguish older versus updated recommendations. The American College of Radiology and Society of Breast Imaging recommend annual mammography beginning at age 40 for average-risk women and continuing without a hard upper age limit, emphasizing mortality reduction and earlier-stage detection with annual screening [^111BpqKv]. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists historically offered screening starting at 40 with shared decision-making, but in 2024 updated to recommend beginning at age 40 for all average-risk individuals, reflecting rising incidence in the 40s and the need to address disparities [^111AeshD] [^11263qBB]. The American Cancer Society recommends starting at 45 with annual screening, while allowing women aged 40 to 44 to begin annually if they prefer after counseling, and then transitioning to biennial screening at 55 with the option to continue annually if desired [^112SjnVL] [^111u9eL9]. The USPSTF, in its 2024 update, recommends biennial screening from ages 40 to 74 for average-risk women, moving from its prior emphasis on individualized decisions in the 40s to a universal start at 40, largely to mitigate early-onset mortality disparities, especially among Black women [^112uZgBu] [^1161ZMKt] [^116Z9RwC]. The Women's Preventive Services Initiative advises initiating screening no earlier than 40 and no later than 50, at least biennially and up to annually, and continuing through at least 74, with decisions beyond that based on health status and preferences [^115wE8Lp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the evidence supporting earlier initiation, particularly at 40. Modeling and observational data consistently show that starting at 40 averts additional deaths compared with starting at 50, with the USPSTF estimating about 1.8 additional breast cancer deaths averted per 1000 women screened over a lifetime when biennial screening begins at 40 versus 50, and with a larger absolute benefit for Black women, reflecting higher early-onset mortality burden [^116Z9RwC]. The ACR cites approximately a 40 percent mortality reduction with regular screening from 40, and multiple analyses note that annual screening in the 40s detects more cancers at smaller sizes and earlier stages, translating into better surgical options and treatment efficacy, though at the cost of more false positives and overdiagnosis [^111BpqKv] [^113hk2S4]. I should double-check the interval question too; evidence suggests that in premenopausal women, annual intervals yield more favorable tumor characteristics than biennial, supporting annual screening in the 40s when women elect to start then [^113hk2S4].

> I will now examine the balance of benefits and harms to ensure the recommendation is proportionate. Earlier initiation increases false positives and benign biopsies. The USPSTF estimates roughly 60 percent more false positives and about 2 additional overdiagnosed cases per 1000 women over a lifetime when starting at 40 versus 50, while annual screening compared with biennial increases false positives and overdiagnosis by roughly 50 percent, though it also increases lives saved and life-years gained [^114S3M89]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of false positives. Cumulative 10-year false-positive probabilities are high, around 61 percent with annual and 42 percent with biennial screening when starting at 40, but these figures are similar whether screening starts at 40 or 50, indicating that the main driver is frequency rather than starting age per se [^115gdY2K] [^116jnLi6]. Overdiagnosis remains contested and difficult to quantify precisely, but modeling estimates a modest increase with earlier or more frequent screening, and guideline panels generally frame this as a trade-off against mortality reduction and earlier-stage detection [^116dmG4N] [^112X673z].

> But wait, what if a one-size-fits-all age is not optimal for all populations; I need to consider equity and risk-adapted strategies. Multiple analyses show that Black women reach population mortality risk thresholds several years earlier than White women, supporting earlier screening initiation to address early-onset mortality disparities, with race-adapted modeling suggesting starting around 6 to 8 years earlier depending on the benchmark used, while some Asian and Pacific Islander groups may reach similar risk later, arguing for a more personalized approach where feasible [^115W88Ye] [^111hgxQC] [^115n1vkc]. Risk-adapted models using family history, reproductive factors, and benign breast disease also demonstrate that women with higher risk reach average population risk thresholds years earlier, supporting earlier initiation for those subgroups, though implementation requires validated tools and accessible risk assessment infrastructure [^1159k7qa] [^114bBuRn] [^117XtR6y].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit, while acknowledging areas of legitimate disagreement. For average-risk women, the most defensible, guideline-concordant starting age is 40 years, with annual screening in the 40s to optimize detection of biologically more aggressive, faster-growing cancers, and then transitioning to biennial screening at 55 with the option to continue annually based on preferences and risk, continuing as long as health is good and life expectancy is at least 10 years, which aligns with ACR/SBI, the updated ACOG position, and the 2024 USPSTF recommendation, while the ACS approach of starting at 45 with an option to begin at 40 remains reasonable but slightly less protective for early-onset disease [^111BpqKv] [^111AeshD] [^112uZgBu] [^112SjnVL]. I should confirm interval guidance: annual in the 40s is favored by radiology societies and supported by interval-cancer data, whereas biennial from 50 onward is acceptable and more efficient, though with some reduction in benefit; shared decision-making should incorporate these trade-offs explicitly [^113hk2S4] [^114PTzJb].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the USPSTF still endorsed individualized decisions for 40 to 49, but I should correct that. The 2024 USPSTF update now recommends universal biennial screening from 40 to 74, moving away from the prior individualized stance for the 40s, largely to mitigate early-onset mortality disparities, so my earlier mental note needs updating to reflect this change [^1161ZMKt] [^112uZgBu]. I also need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing beyond average risk; for women with more than 20 percent lifetime risk or known pathogenic variants, earlier and more intensive screening with MRI is indicated, which is outside the scope of this average-risk recommendation but important to remember in clinic [^111Wnmki].

> Next, I should review stopping rules and modality considerations so the recommendation is complete. Screening should continue through at least 74 years, and decisions beyond 75 should be individualized based on health status and life expectancy, with many societies endorsing continuation if life expectancy exceeds 10 years, while the USPSTF cites insufficient evidence for routine screening beyond 75, emphasizing shared decision-making in older adults [^112SjnVL] [^114L13HJ] [^1128s8yR]. I need to check modality guidance for average risk; mammography remains the primary test, with digital breast tomosynthesis acceptable, and clinical breast examination is not recommended for routine screening in average-risk women due to low yield and increased false positives, reinforcing reliance on mammography-based programs [^116Efq2G] [^111n8qAY].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with the weight of evidence and current guideline convergence. For average-risk women, start screening at age 40 with annual mammography through the 40s, transition to biennial at 55 with the option to continue annually, and continue screening through 74, with decisions beyond 75 based on health and life expectancy, while integrating shared decision-making to weigh benefits, harms, and individual preferences, and considering earlier initiation for higher-risk subgroups to address disparities where feasible [^111BpqKv] [^111AeshD] [^112uZgBu] [^112SjnVL].

The optimal age to start breast cancer screening in the general population is **age 40** for average-risk women, with annual mammography providing the greatest mortality reduction and earlier-stage detection [^111BpqKv] [^117JWNTd]. This balances benefits and harms because, although false positives and overdiagnosis increase with earlier screening, the absolute mortality benefit is greatest when screening begins at 40 [^114S3M89] [^116Z9RwC]. Biennial screening from 50–74 is reasonable for women who prioritize fewer false positives, but **annual screening from 40–49 is preferred** for those prioritizing maximal mortality reduction, especially in higher-risk groups [^1152SscC] [^113hk2S4].

## Current guidelines and recommendations

| **Organization** | **Recommended starting age** | **Screening interval** | **Additional notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| American College of Radiology (ACR) | 40 years | Annual | Continues past 74 years without upper age limit unless comorbidities limit life expectancy [^111BpqKv] |
| American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) | 40 years | Annual or biennial | Shared decision-making encouraged [^114mMcvf] |
| American Cancer Society (ACS) | 45 years (strong); 40–44 optional | Annual 45–54; biennial ≥ 55 | Continue as long as health is good and life expectancy ≥ 10 years [^111u9eL9] |
| U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) | 40 years | Biennial | Evidence insufficient for ≥ 75 years [^1128s8yR] |

---

## Evidence supporting screening at age 40

- **Mortality reduction**: Annual screening from 40 reduces breast cancer mortality by ~29% [^112cjM3u] [^115VRx8V].
- **Earlier detection**: Screening in the 40s detects more early-stage cancers, enabling less invasive treatments and better outcomes [^111BpqKv].
- **Disparities**: Earlier screening addresses higher mortality in Black women and other underserved groups [^115W88Ye] [^116Z9RwC].

---

## Potential harms and limitations

- **False positives**: Higher with annual screening, causing anxiety and unnecessary biopsies [^114S3M89] [^115gdY2K].
- **Overdiagnosis**: Small risk of detecting indolent cancers that would not cause symptoms [^116dmG4N] [^114S3M89].
- **Radiation exposure**: Minimal but cumulative with repeated screenings [^117PgRvq].

---

## Balancing benefits and harms

Annual screening from 40 offers the **greatest mortality benefit** but increases false positives and overdiagnosis; biennial screening from 50 reduces these harms but may miss faster-growing cancers in younger women [^114S3M89] [^113hk2S4]. Shared decision-making is essential to align screening with patient values and risk tolerance [^114jW2nH].

---

## Special considerations

- **High-risk women**: Earlier initiation with annual MRI and mammography is recommended for those with BRCA mutations or strong family history [^111Wnmki].
- **Dense breasts**: Annual screening and adjunct imaging (ultrasound or MRI) may be considered [^111Wnmki].
- **Ethnic disparities**: Earlier screening may be warranted for Black and other high-risk ethnic groups [^115W88Ye] [^116Z9RwC].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The optimal age to start breast cancer screening in the general population is **40 years**, with annual mammography providing the greatest mortality benefit. Biennial screening from 50–74 is acceptable for women prioritizing fewer false positives, but annual screening from 40–49 is preferred for those prioritizing maximal mortality reduction, especially in higher-risk groups.

Importance

Although current guidelines highlight the need for earlier screening in women at increased risk of breast cancer in China, data on risk-adapted starting ages of screening are limited.

Objective

To explore the risk-adapted starting age of breast cancer screening in China, with comprehensive consideration of breast cancer risk factors.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter community-based cohort study was conducted under the framework of the Cancer Screening Program in Urban China. Data were collected from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018, for unscreened community-dwelling women aged 40 to 74 years without a history of cancer, kidney dysfunction, or severe heart, brain, or lung disease. Data analysis was performed from October 1, 2021, to August 16, 2022.

Exposures

Baseline characteristics associated with breast cancer, including first-degree family history of breast cancer, benign breast disease, breastfeeding, age at menarche, and body mass index.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes included breast cancer diagnosis and age at diagnosis. Risk-adapted starting age of screening was defined as the age at which women with different levels of breast cancer risk attained a 10-year cumulative risk level similar to women aged 50 years in the general population.

Results

Of the 1 549 988 women enrolled in this study, 3895 had breast cancer (median follow-up, 4.47 [IQR, 3.16–6.35] years). Participants were divided into different risk groups according to breast cancer risk scores (driven by risk factors including first-degree family history of breast cancer, benign breast disease, breastfeeding, age at menarche, and body mass index). Using the 10-year cumulative risk of breast cancer at age 50 years in the general population as a benchmark (2.65% [95% CI, 2.50%-2.76%]), the optimal starting age of screening for women with high, medium, or low risk of breast cancer was identified as 43, 48, or after 55 years, respectively. An online calculator was developed to calculate an individual's optimal starting age of screening.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study identifies the risk-adapted starting age of breast cancer screening based on the principle of equal management of equal risks, which may inform updates of current screening guidelines.

### Update to breast cancer screening guidelines-WTCHP… [^114gAWCJ]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

United States Preventative Services Task Force Update Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines May 17, 2024 On April 30, 2024, the United States Preventative Services Task Force updated their recommendations for breast cancer screening. They now recommend that all women get screened every other year starting at age 40 and continuing through age 74. The World Trade Center Health Program bases its coverage for cancer screenings on the recommendations of the USPSTF. This means that members eligible for breast cancer screenings can now get them covered by the Program starting at age 40 through age 74. Before April 30, 2024, the USPSTF recommended breast cancer screenings starting at age 50 through age
74. Learn more about cancer screenings covered by the Program.

### An optimization framework to guide the choice of thresholds for risk-based cancer screening [^116M3MoT]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we developed and applied an optimization algorithm to help evaluate risk-based screening thresholds. It may be used to establish when risk models are good enough for health gains to be theoretically possible from risk-stratified screening compared to the current screening programmes. The framework could be used for other breast cancer risk models by using estimates of their distribution of risk in the population. It could be applied to other cancer types by adapting the model for advanced cancer incidence. It is intended as a first step to help define risk-based strategies that have the greatest chance of success on reducing the population health burden of cancer, that would be considered further in health-economic modelling and real-world evaluations.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: a recommendation from the Women's Preventive Services Initiative [^114jW2nH]. WPSI (2024). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for breast cancer screening emphasize shared decision-making and equity: "Decisions regarding when to initiate screening, how often to screen, and when to stop screening should be based on a periodic shared decision-making process involving the woman and her health care clinician". "The shared decision-making process assists women in making informed decisions and includes, but is not limited to, a discussion about the benefits and harms of screening, an assessment of the woman's values and preferences, and consideration of factors such as life expectancy, comorbidities, and health status". "Discussion and education related to screening should be culturally and linguistically congruent, particularly for patients experiencing health inequities". For higher-risk individuals, "Women considered at high risk of breast cancer (eg, previous diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer, known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, previous high-dose radiation to the chest) may require additional testing and closer follow-up, which are beyond the scope of this recommendation".

### Benefits and harms of annual, biennial, or triennial breast cancer mammography screening for women at average risk of breast cancer: a systematic review for the European commission initiative on breast cancer (ECIBC) [^1127WmwG]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer (BC) is the second most prevalent cancer in the world and the most frequent among women. In the European Union, 404,920 women were diagnosed with BC and 98,755 women died during 2018. Despite these high rates, the mortality risk of BC has decreased over the last decades due to improvements in treatment, services quality, and to early diagnosis linked to the implementation of population-based screening programmes. However, there is still ongoing research and debate on how to best implement BC screening programmes, including which is the optimal mammography screening interval.

Published recommendations on mammography screening frequencies vary among organisations. The National Health Service Breast Screening Program (NHSBSP) of the United Kingdom, recommends screening every 3 years to women aged 50–70 (47–73 in England). The United States Prevention Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends biennial mammography for women aged 50–74 and making a case by case decision for women in their 40s. The American Cancer Society recommends annual screening between the ages of 45 and 54 (with the option of starting annual screening between 40 and 44), and screening every two years from age 55 or continue annually if the woman is in good health and expected to live ten more years.

Previous studies have suggested that the balance between benefits and harms for different screening intervals might vary depending on the age subgroup. A modelling study found that for every 1000 women aged 50–74, biennial screening avoided seven BC deaths, while annual screening had similar benefits but caused more harms. Observational data from the US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registries, observed that premenopausal women undergoing biennial screening had more BC lesions with less favourable prognostic characteristics compared to those having annual screening.

In 2015, the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC) was launched to develop the European Guidelines on Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis. This article describes the systematic review that informed the recommendations about mammography screening intervals for women of average breast cancer risk in three separate age subgroups. During the guideline development process, the Guidelines Development Group (GDG) made detailed considerations about the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, values and preferences, equity, acceptability and feasibility; these considerations are described in the published methodology and summary of recommendations.

### Age to begin and intervals for breast cancer screening: balancing benefits and harms [^1114xuz6]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Screening mammography has been widely used for breast cancer detection and has been found to decrease mortality, but debate continues. The purpose of this article is to review screening recommendations and the benefits and perceived harms of earlier and more frequent screening.

Conclusion

Annual mammography beginning at age 40 decreases mortality. Clinicians should educate women and preserve recommendations for early and annual screening.

Results

Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines

If women of average breast cancer risk were screened according to the USPSTF guideline (vs no screening), the models project an average of 118 life-years gained (model range = 103–133), 7 (model range = 6.4–6.9) breast cancer deaths averted, 15 (model range = 12.1–16.9) overdiagnoses, and 920 (model range = 918–921) false-positive mammograms per 1000 women screened over their lifetimes vs no screening. If the ACS or ACR guidelines were followed, there were 61% or 178% more mammograms, respectively, than in the USPSTF guideline due to early starting ages and more frequent screening, resulting in substantial increases in benefits but also in harms (Table 2).

### Evidence of benefit from mammography screening of average-risk women ages 40–49 years: science, metrics, and value judgments [^115VRx8V]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

The majority of randomized control trials and service-based screening studies of women ages 40–49 years demonstrate reductions in mortality of 29%-48% when long-term outcome is assessed. Annual screening is preferable in these younger women due to faster tumor-doubling times. Advances in mammography technique and breast ultrasound may allow even better results in the future.

### Use of breast cancer risk factors to identify risk-adapted starting age of screening in China [^114bN5Jo]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This cohort study examined the risk-adapted starting age of breast cancer screening in China by using CanSPUC population-based national cancer screening program data, with more than 1 million women eligible. Women with low breast cancer risk were proposed to start screening after age 55 years, whereas those with medium or high risk were proposed to begin screening at age 48 or 43 years, respectively. We also generated an online tool to calculate an individual's optimal starting age and to support decision-making in breast cancer screening.

In this study, breast cancer risk factors used for risk division included first-degree family history of breast cancer, benign breast disease, breastfeeding, age at menarche, and BMI. A family history of breast cancer is a well-demonstrated risk factor, and remains a major factor for screening and prevention counseling. Individuals with benign breast disease are also reported to have a higher risk of breast cancer. A meta-analysisshowed that Chinese women with benign breast disease had a 2.68 times greater risk of breast cancer (OR, 2.68 [95% CI, 2.06–3.49]) than those without the disease. Evidence suggests that breastfeeding is inversely associated with breast cancerand exerts a notable protective effect against hormone receptor-negative breast cancers. Younger age at menarche is also associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. A meta-analysis of 117 studies showed a 5.0% reduction in breast cancer risk for every year older at menarche. Furthermore, the results of a meta-analysis of studies in East Asian women showed that obesity is independently associated with increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Although all of these factors were considered in the China Guideline for the Screening and Early Detection of Female Breast Cancer, the recommended starting age of screening for women at average and increased risk was based on expert opinion and lacked population-based evidence in Chinese women. Evidence of a risk-adapted starting age of screening is needed to determine populations at high risk and promote screening of these individuals, which can further aid in efficient allocation of limited medical resources, especially in developing countries such as China.

### Screening for breast cancer in average-risk women: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^112MVT8d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this guidance statement is to provide advice to clinicians on breast cancer screening in average-risk women based on a review of existing guidelines and the evidence they include.

Methods

This guidance statement is derived from an appraisal of selected guidelines from around the world that address breast cancer screening, as well as their included evidence. All national guidelines published in English between 1 January 2013 and 15 November 2017 in the National Guideline Clearinghouse or Guidelines International Network library were included. In addition, the authors selected other guidelines commonly used in clinical practice. Web sites associated with all selected guidelines were checked for updates on 10 December 2018. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to evaluate the quality of guidelines.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is all asymptomatic women with average risk for breast cancer.

Guidance Statement 1

In average-risk women aged 40 to 49 years, clinicians should discuss whether to screen for breast cancer with mammography before age 50 years. Discussion should include the potential benefits and harms and a woman's preferences. The potential harms outweigh the benefits in most women aged 40 to 49 years.

Guidance Statement 2

In average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years, clinicians should offer screening for breast cancer with biennial mammography.

Guidance Statement 3

In average-risk women aged 75 years or older or in women with a life expectancy of 10 years or less, clinicians should discontinue screening for breast cancer.

Guidance Statement 4

In average-risk women of all ages, clinicians should not use clinical breast examination to screen for breast cancer.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^111n8qAY]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) average-risk screening — clinical breast examination (CBE): The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination (CBE) for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). The evidence review found a lack of evidence showing any benefit of a CBE alone or in conjunction with screening mammography, and there is moderate-quality evidence that adding CBE to mammography screening increased the false-positive rate; although the addition of CBE will detect a small number of additional breast cancers (ie, 2%-6%) compared with mammography alone, CBE is not recommended for breast cancer screening among average-risk, asymptomatic women at any age. Recognizing time constraints in a typical clinical visit, clinicians should use this time instead for ascertaining family history and counseling women regarding being alert to breast changes and the potential benefits, limitations, and harms of screening mammography.

### The current status of risk-stratified breast screening [^117XtR6y]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Rather than analysing the effects of altering screening intensity or avoiding screening in low-risk women, a large Swedish cohort with linkage to several national databases (n > 5,000,000 women) was used to assess whether earlier screening starting ages could be appropriate for some women. By using 10-year cumulative risk estimations, the risk level of the 'average' 50-year-old woman that would be offered screening was calculated as a benchmark. The ages at which other women would attain the same 10-year risk were compared, based on patterns of family history or personal reproductive history (parity and age at first birth). Both studies found that either approach could identify women who, despite not being eligible to start age-based screening, had the same 10-year risk estimate as 50-year-old women who would be invited to screen, or indeed may only attain that same threshold of risk after age 50 years. For example, women who had their first baby aged under 25 years met the benchmark aged 51 years, whereas women who had four births by age 25 years met this at 59 years of age. Furthermore, women with one first-degree relative diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 40 years met the average risk of women starting age-based screening at age 36 years. Therefore, despite debate around the benefits of universally expanding screening to younger age groups such as the lack of long-term effect seen in Age UK, selected women with selected risk factors may be suitable for earlier or delayed commencement of early detection strategies. The optimal way to assess risk would require elucidation as reliance on two albeit important risk factors may inadequately capture risk.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112SjnVL]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society breast cancer screening guideline (2015) for average-risk women — Women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (Strong Recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation), and women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation), and should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). The target population is women at average risk — women without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age.

### Race and ethnicity-adjusted age recommendation for initiating breast cancer screening [^115n1vkc]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

Using the latest available BC mortality information from a large, nationwide database, this cross-sectional study provided evidence-based race and ethnicity–specific starting ages of BC screening. These had substantial variations, ranging from 8 years earlier in Black females to 11 years later in Asian and Pacific Islander females compared with what is recommended. To prevent mortality due to early-onset BC before the recommended age of mass screening, the starting age for the general population could be decreased from 50 to 45 or 40 years like what is done for colorectal cancer screening in the US. However, this would come with a heavy burden to medical resources and a possible increase in potential harms associated with early screening in women at low risk before age 50 years. Instead, health policy makers may consider the alternative, risk-adapted approach in which individuals, such as Black females, who are at high risk are screened earlier. If the cost of more intensive screening in individuals at high risk matters and if the US seeks to generate guidelines that are associated with equity in mortality risk across racial and ethnic groups, the initial screening may be postponed in individuals, such as non–Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islander females, at low risk. This may decrease potential harms associated with unnecessary screenings in this population. This may be an important step toward a more optimized, equitable, and personalized BC screening and may help mitigate the current long-standing disparity of early-onset BC mortality in populations, especially Black females, at increased risk.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACR 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain annual mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2D images) in average-risk females (< 15% lifetime risk of breast cancer) beginning at age 40. Consider obtaining breast ultrasound in females with dense breasts, taking into account the balance between increased cancer detection and the increased risk of a false-positive examination.

False-positive outcomes with all-digital screening mammography by age — cumulative 10-year rates for at least 1 false-positive finding were similar whether screening began at age 40 years or at age 50 years. Based on all-digital, nonoverlap screening, there was an inverse relationship between age and false-positive findings per 1000 screening examinations among women aged 40 to 89 years; for example, false-positive findings per 1000 were 121.2 at ages 40 to 49 vs 93.2 at ages 50 to 59, which differed by only 28 examinations per 1000 women, and recommendations by biopsy per 1000 women differed by less than 1 per 1000 (16.4 vs 15.9).

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2015 breast cancer screening — women at average risk: The ACS endorses beginning annual screening mammography at age 45 years and transitioning to biennial screening at age 55 years, while retaining the option to continue annual screening. The guideline development committee (GDC) recommends that women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually, that women aged 40 to 44 years who choose to be screened should do so annually, and that women aged 55 and older should transition to biennial screening but also have the opportunity to continue screening annually. The GDC concluded that women aged 40 to 44 years should have the choice to begin screening mammography at age 40 years or before age 45 years, based on their preferences and their consideration of the trade-offs.

Breast cancer screening overdiagnosis and program aims: The panel characterizes overdiagnosis as contested but affirms its existence while acknowledging uncertainty in magnitude, stating that "The issue of overdiagnosis is controversial", and that "The evidence review judged the evidence for the existence of overdiagnosis as high, but evidence for estimating the magnitude of overdiagnosis as low". Programmatically, "The main goal of mammography screening programs is to reduce breast cancer mortality by reducing the incidence rate of advanced breast cancer", recognizing that "A screening test that is successful in detecting small invasive cancers also will detect some precursors", and that "this likely does result in some overdiagnosis, but in other instances, it advances the time of diagnosis of a progressive lesion".

### Race and ethnicity-adjusted age recommendation for initiating breast cancer screening [^114aZgPY]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

We believe that when fairness and optimization of resource allocation to reduce BC mortality is the aim of BC screening, health policy makers should pursue equity not just equality. Equality in the context of BC screening means that everyone is screened from the same age regardless of risk level. On the other hand, equity or risk-adapted screening means that everyone is provided screening according to their individual risk level. We believe that a fair and risk-adapted screening program may also be associated with optimized resource allocation.

The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women aged 40 to 49 years make an individual decision regarding screening after discussing risks and benefits of screening with their primary care practitioners. However, practicitioners would need evidence-based information on race and ethnicity–stratified starting ages of screening when individuals from minority race and ethnicity populations come to them for screening consultation.

This study used the most recent and largest nationwide cancer mortality data available in the US, with very high completeness and low rates of ill-defined causes of death, which may indirectly indicate high quality in cause-of-death data. A major strength of this study was the focus on BC death vs solely incidence. Many incidence-based calculators that seek to inform screening recommendations fail to explicitly capture increased mortality rates experienced by Black women despite slightly lower to equivalent incidence compared with White women. In a worst-case scenario, if most of the increased mortality at younger ages in Black women was due to fast-growing triple-negative cancers that were detected between screens among regular screeners, earlier screening without decreasing the interval between screenings would not be expected to decrease mortality in that subpopulation. However, earlier screening could be effective if slower-growing, screenable BCs were also occurring in Black women at younger ages. Therefore, clinical trials may be warranted to investigate whether changing screening guidelines may alter the trajectory of the disease and have a population impact. Although a previous studyfound that the percentage of triple-negative BC among Black females was approximately 15% compared with approximately 7% in White females and the worst-case scenario in which most BC cancers in Black females are of the fast-growing triple-negative type is not found clinically, this study provides information that may be needed to design such a trial. Another strength of this study was the provision of risk-adapted starting ages of BC screening for major race and ethnicity groups in the US, including American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, and White females.

### Race and ethnicity-adjusted age recommendation for initiating breast cancer screening [^111hgxQC]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

In women, breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death in the US, and the deadliest cancer in 4 southern and 2 midwestern US states and globally. BC screening from age 50 years was associated with a reduction in BC mortality. The US Preventive Services Task Force also recommends starting BC screening from age 50 years. There is a substantial disparity in BC mortality between Black and White individuals, and this disparity has remained stable since 2011 after widening over the past 3 decades. The death rate in Black women has remained 40% higher than that of White women despite this population having an incidence rate equal to the mean US rate. In particular, this disparity is magnified among Black women aged younger than 50 years, with a death rate double that of White women. However, there is currently insufficient data to make specific recommendations for different racial and ethnic populations.

The current one-size-fits-all policy to screen the entire female population from a certain age may be neither fair and equitable nor optimal. In a 2021 article in Nature, Newsomeexpressed that equity in cancer screening must be improved and that one size does not fit all. Newsomealso wrote that fixing the substantially lower screening rate for breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancer in the Black and Hispanic populations may dramatically improve the death rate from cancer. The current situation is an example of what happens when race and ethnicity are not considered in guidelines. This may pose a significant risk for greater harm to a group already at increased risk. To optimize the benefit of screening, risk-adapted starting ages of screening based on known and readily available risk factors, such as race and ethnicity, may be recommended. We aimed to provide evidence for risk-adapted starting age of screening by race and ethnicity.

### Screening for breast cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MthJP]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for breast cancer in the general population.

Methods

The USPSTF examined the evidence on the efficacy of 5 screening modalities in reducing mortality from breast cancer: film mammography, clinical breast examination, breast self-examination, digital mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging in order to update the 2002 recommendation. To accomplish this update, the USPSTF commissioned 2 studies: 1) a targeted systematic evidence review of 6 selected questions relating to benefits and harms of screening, and 2) a decision analysis that used population modeling techniques to compare the expected health outcomes and resource requirements of starting and ending mammography screening at different ages and using annual versus biennial screening intervals.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends against routine screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years. The decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take into account patient context, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms. (Grade C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women between the ages of 50 and 74 years. (Grade B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of clinical breast examination beyond screening mammography in women 40 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF recommends against clinicians teaching women how to perform breast self-examination. (Grade D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess additional benefits and harms of either digital mammography or magnetic resonance imaging instead of film mammography as screening modalities for breast cancer.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain screening mammography every 1 or 2 years based on an informed, shared decision-making process including a discussion of the benefits and harms of annual and biennial screening and incorporating patient values and preferences in females at average risk of breast cancer. Consider obtaining biennial screening mammography, particularly after age 55 years, to reduce the frequency of harms, as long as patient counseling includes a discussion that with decreased screening comes some reduction in benefits.

### Race and ethnicity-adjusted age recommendation for initiating breast cancer screening [^114PzYYe]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. The higher mortality in Black females may be associated with their lower level of access to screening and treatment. While this could be true for BC mortality in general, this cannot justify the higher mortality of early-onset BC in Black females younger than the recommended age of mass screening. This suggests that an earlier screening of Black females may still be associated with reduced early-onset disparity. BC mortality depends on many factors, such as differences in distribution of breast size and density, quality of screening tests, host tumor microenvironment, treatment access and quality, competing mortality, distribution of phenotype prevalence of BC, tumor grading and staging at diagnosis, initiation of BC treatment, type of treatment received, barriers to health care access, poverty level, biological and genetic differences in tumors, and prevalence of risk factors associated with the periods during and after cancer treatment, and other factors. However, making everything too complex may lead to doing nothing. One can try to start from a first scientific step (like race and ethnicity–adapted screening) and evaluate and build more complex steps along the way and reevaluate. Otherwise, the racial and ethnic disparity of early-onset BC mortality may continue or even widen again.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112oTWjo]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Breast cancer is a leading cause of premature mortality among US women. Early detection has been shown to be associated with reduced breast cancer morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To update the American Cancer Society (ACS) 2003 breast cancer screening guideline for women at average risk for breast cancer.

Process

The ACS commissioned a systematic evidence review of the breast cancer screening literature to inform the update and a supplemental analysis of mammography registry data to address questions related to the screening interval. Formulation of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence and judgment (incorporating values and preferences) about the balance of benefits and harms.

Evidence Synthesis

Screening mammography in women aged 40 to 69 years is associated with a reduction in breast cancer deaths across a range of study designs, and inferential evidence supports breast cancer screening for women 70 years and older who are in good health. Estimates of the cumulative lifetime risk of false-positive examination results are greater if screening begins at younger ages because of the greater number of mammograms, as well as the higher recall rate in younger women. The quality of the evidence for overdiagnosis is not sufficient to estimate a lifetime risk with confidence. Analysis examining the screening interval demonstrates more favorable tumor characteristics when premenopausal women are screened annually vs biennially. Evidence does not support routine clinical breast examination as a screening method for women at average risk.

Recommendations

The ACS recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (strong recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (qualified recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (qualified recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (qualified recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (qualified recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (qualified recommendation).

Conclusions and Relevance

These updated ACS guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for breast cancer screening for women at average risk of breast cancer. These recommendations should be considered by physicians and women in discussions about breast cancer screening.

Breast cancer remains the most common nonskin cancer among women and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Early detection through screening and advances in treatment have contributed to a 39% mortality reduction in the United States since 1990.

Recommendation 2 — screening continuation in older women states that women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). Breast cancer incidence continues to increase until ages 75 to 79 years, and 26% of breast cancer deaths each year are attributable to a diagnosis after age 74 years; none of the RCTs included women 75 years and older, although observational studies have observed a reduction in breast cancer mortality associated with mammographic detection among women aged 75 years and older. The guideline notes that the reduced life expectancy associated with being older decreases the likelihood of screening benefit in some women.

### Factors associated with mammography screening choices by women aged 40–49 at average risk [^1158Mz3M]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not recommend routine mammogram screening for women aged 40–49 years at average risk for breast cancer. We aimed to assess the extent to which women were following guideline recommendations and to examine whether guideline awareness and other individual-level factors were associated with adherence. Materials and Methods: We surveyed a nationally representative panel of 383 U.S. women aged 40–49 years at low risk for hereditary breast cancer in October 2019. Results: Only 29% of women reported not having initiated screening mammography. Most women (80%) were unaware of the USPSTF screening guideline related to age of initiation and frequency of mammography. Being aware of the recommendation to initiate screening at age 50 increased the odds of not initiating screening (odds ratio [OR] = 6.70, p < 0.001), whereas being older than 45 years (OR = 0.22, p < 0.001) and having a primary care doctor decreased the odds of not initiating screening (OR = 0.25, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Mammogram screening in excess of USPSTF recommendations is prevalent among U.S. women aged 40–49 years. Efforts are needed to increase women's awareness of the rationale for guidelines and the opportunities to discuss with providers whether delaying mammograms is appropriate.

### Does screening… [^1141svA9]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women 50 to 74 years of age. The ACS recommends annual screening mammography starting at 45 years of age and transitioning to biennial screening at 55 years of age. 31 This recommendation is based on multivariable analyses suggesting that women in the younger age group are more likely than older women to have advanced stage cancer when screened biennially rather than annually.
31. At What Age Should Breast Cancer Screening Be Discontinued. Women at average risk should continue screening mammography through 74 years of age. 3, 26, 29–31, 33 Starting at 75 years of age, women should be involved in shared decision-making based on overall health status and life expectancy according to ACOG recommendations. 3 The ACS and NCCN recommend continued screening after 75 years of age if life expectancy is at least 10 years, and the ACR recommends continued screening if life expectancy is at least five to seven years.

38, 39 What Are the Screening Recommendations for Patients at Increased Risk. ACS recommends that women with a 20% or higher lifetime risk of breast cancer be offered annual mammography and magnetic resonance imaging, typically starting at 30 years of age. 32 For high-risk women 25 to 29 years of age, ACOG recommends a clinical breast examination every six to 12 months and annual breast MRI with contrast. For patients 30 years and older, ACOG recommends annual mammography and MRI with contrast. 40 The NCCN recommends that women with a lifetime risk of more than 20% have breast self-awareness and receive a clinical breast examination every six to 12 months starting at 21 years of age. Annual breast MRI is recommended starting at 25 years of age with annual screening mammography starting at 30 years.

33 Women younger than 25 years with a history of chest radiation should have breast self-awareness and receive a clinical breast examination every six to 12 months starting 10 years after radiation therapy. Once these women are 25 years old, annual breast MRI is recommended, then screening mammography starting at 30 years of age. 33 The USPSTF states that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of using MRI for breast cancer screening, and the AAFP supports this finding. 26, 29.

### Collaborative modeling of the benefits and harms associated with different U.S. breast cancer screening strategies [^1152SscC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy persists about optimal mammography screening strategies.

Objective

To evaluate screening outcomes, taking into account advances in mammography and treatment of breast cancer.

Design

Collaboration of 6 simulation models using national data on incidence, digital mammography performance, treatment effects, and other-cause mortality.

Setting

United States.

Patients

Average-risk U.S. female population and subgroups with varying risk, breast density, or comorbidity.

Intervention

Eight strategies differing by age at which screening starts (40, 45, or 50 years) and screening interval (annual, biennial, and hybrid [annual for women in their 40s and biennial thereafter]). All strategies assumed 100% adherence and stopped at age 74 years.

Measurements

Benefits (breast cancer-specific mortality reduction, breast cancer deaths averted, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years); number of mammograms used; harms (false-positive results, benign biopsies, and overdiagnosis); and ratios of harms (or use) and benefits (efficiency) per 1000 screens.

Results

Biennial strategies were consistently the most efficient for average-risk women. Biennial screening from age 50 to 74 years avoided a median of 7 breast cancer deaths versus no screening; annual screening from age 40 to 74 years avoided an additional 3 deaths, but yielded 1988 more false-positive results and 11 more overdiagnoses per 1000 women screened. Annual screening from age 50 to 74 years was inefficient (similar benefits, but more harms than other strategies). For groups with a 2- to 4-fold increased risk, annual screening from age 40 years had similar harms and benefits as screening average-risk women biennially from 50 to 74 years. For groups with moderate or severe comorbidity, screening could stop at age 66 to 68 years.

Limitation

Other imaging technologies, polygenic risk, and nonadherence were not considered.

Conclusion

Biennial screening for breast cancer is efficient for average-risk populations. Decisions about starting ages and intervals will depend on population characteristics and the decision makers' weight given to the harms and benefits of screening.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to describe screening updates for women with average and high risk for breast cancer, compare different screening strategies, and describe new approaches in risk prediction, including radiomics. CONCLUSION. All women are at substantial risk for breast cancer. For women with average risk, annual mammography beginning at 40 years old maximizes the life-extending benefits and provides improved treatment options. Women at higher risk need earlier and more intense screening. Delaying initiation or decreasing frequency of mammographic screening adversely affects breast cancer detection.

### Race and ethnicity-adjusted age recommendation for initiating breast cancer screening [^115W88Ye]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Breast cancer (BC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, and there is a substantial disparity in BC mortality by race, especially for early-onset BC in Black women. Many guidelines recommend starting BC screening from age 50 years; however, the current one-size-fits-all policy to start screening all women from a certain age may not be fair, equitable, or optimal.

Objective

To provide race and ethnicity-adapted starting ages of BC screening based on data on current racial and ethnic disparities in BC mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nationwide population-based cross-sectional study was conducted using data on BC mortality in female patients in the US who died of BC in 2011 to 2020.

Exposures

Proxy-reported race and ethnicity information was used. The risk-adapted starting age of BC screening by race and ethnicity was measured based on 10-year cumulative risk of BC-specific death. Age-specific 10-year cumulative risk was calculated based on age group-specific mortality data without modeling or adjustment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Disease-specific mortality due to invasive BC in female patients.

Results

There were BC-specific deaths among 415 277 female patients (1880 American Indian or Alaska Native [0.5%], 12 086 Asian or Pacific Islander [2.9%], 62 695 Black [15.1%], 28 747 Hispanic [6.9%], and 309 869 White [74.6%]; 115 214 patients died before age 60 years [27.7%]) of any age in the US in 2011 to 2020. BC mortality per 100 000 person-years for ages 40 to 49 years was 27 deaths in Black females, 15 deaths in White females, and 11 deaths in American Indian or Alaska Native, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific Islander females. When BC screening was recommended to start at age 50 years for all females with a 10-year cumulative risk of BC death of 0.329%, Black females reached this risk threshold level 8 years earlier, at age 42 years, whereas White females reached it at age 51 years, American Indian or Alaska Native and Hispanic females at age 57 years, and Asian or Pacific Islander females 11 years later, at age 61 years. Race and ethnicity-adapted starting ages for Black females were 6 years earlier for mass screening at age 40 years and 7 years earlier for mass screening at age 45 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study provides evidence-based race-adapted starting ages for BC screening. These findings suggest that health policy makers may consider a risk-adapted approach to BC screening in which individuals who are at high risk are screened earlier to address mortality due to early-onset BC before the recommended age of mass screening.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^113hk2S4]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Breast cancer screening interval — trial, modeling, and registry data describe age- and interval-specific effects. A meta-analysis found that the benefit of an invitation to screening was not related to screening intervals among women aged 50 to 69 years, but among women randomized before age 50 years a mortality reduction was observed only with invitation at intervals less than 24 months (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.94) and not at intervals of 24 or more months (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.72–1.50). Mathematical models suggested that annual intervals are associated with detection of fewer tumors at larger and more lethal sizes and estimated more cancer deaths averted than biennial screening, but with higher rates of false-positive examinations and biopsies; screening every other year maintained an average of 81% of the mortality benefit of annual screening with about half the number of false-positive results. In observational analyses, premenopausal women were more likely to have large tumor size (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.07–1.37) and poor prognosis tumors (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00–1.22) when screened at 23 to 26 months compared with 14 to 18 months.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116Z9RwC]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Age to start screening — Collaborative modeling estimated that compared with biennial screening from ages 50 to 74 years, biennial screening starting at age 40 years until 74 years would lead to 1.8 additional breast cancer deaths averted (median, 6.7 vs 8.2, respectively, across 6 models) per 1000 women screened over a lifetime for all women. Models also estimated that for Black women, biennial screening starting at age 40 years would result in 1.8 additional breast cancer deaths averted (median, 9.2 deaths averted for screening from ages 50 to 74 vs 10.7 deaths averted, across 4 models) per 1000 women screened. Epidemiologic data show that in women aged 40 to 49 years the incidence rate of invasive breast cancer increased at an average of 2.0% annually between 2015 and 2019, and these factors led the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to conclude that screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years has a moderate benefit by reducing the number of breast cancer deaths.

### Breast cancer screening recommendations inclusive of all women at average risk: update from the ACR and society of breast imaging [^111BpqKv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer remains the most common nonskin cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths, and the leading cause of premature death in US women. Mammography screening has been proven effective in reducing breast cancer deaths in women age 40 years and older. A mortality reduction of 40% is possible with regular screening. Treatment advances cannot overcome the disadvantage of being diagnosed with an advanced-stage tumor. The ACR and Society of Breast Imaging recommend annual mammography screening beginning at age 40, which provides the greatest mortality reduction, diagnosis at earlier stage, better surgical options, and more effective chemotherapy. Annual screening results in more screening-detected tumors, tumors of smaller sizes, and fewer interval cancers than longer screening intervals. Screened women in their 40s are more likely to have early-stage disease, negative lymph nodes, and smaller tumors than unscreened women. Delaying screening until age 45 or 50 will result in an unnecessary loss of life to breast cancer and adversely affects minority women in particular. Screening should continue past age 74 years, without an upper age limit unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy. Benefits of screening should be considered along with the possibilities of recall for additional imaging and benign biopsy and the less tangible risks of anxiety and overdiagnosis. Although recall and biopsy recommendations are higher with more frequent screening, so are life-years gained and breast cancer deaths averted. Women who wish to maximize benefit will choose annual screening starting at age 40 years and will not stop screening prematurely.

The guideline notes that "the quality of the evidence for a quantitative estimate of the magnitude of overdiagnosis was judged to be low", and that overdiagnosis "represents the greatest possible harm associated with screening because it would result in overtreatment".

### Use of breast cancer risk factors to identify risk-adapted starting age of screening in China [^112SyfpY]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation of Risk-Adapted Starting Age of Breast Cancer Screening

Women with low, medium, or high breast cancer risk (aged > 55, 48, or 43 years, respectively) reached 10-year cumulative breast cancer risk equal to that of women with average risk at age 50 years in the general population (Figure 2 and Table 2). Comparable results were found in the 2-fold cross-validation analysis. As a result, 10-year cumulative risk curves for women with different risk levels in both the development and validation data sets were analogous across age (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). We also developed an online tool to calculate an individual's starting age of breast cancer screening.

Sensitivity Analysis

Using 10-year cumulative risk at age 45 years as an alternative risk benchmark, our proposed breast cancer risk stratification demonstrated consistent breast cancer incidence trends in unscreened women in the CanSPUC cohort. As a result, risk equal to that of women at average risk at age 45 years in the general population was achieved 3 years later in the low-risk group and 1 and 3 years earlier in the medium-risk and high-risk groups, respectively (Table 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement).

### Trade-offs between harms and benefits of different breast cancer screening intervals among low-risk women [^116EQAap]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). Medium credibility.

There is general consensus that biennial screening from ages 50–74 years is effective in reducing breast cancer mortality and has a favorable balance between benefits and harms. Risk-based screening has been proposed to improve the efficiency of screening, because it has the potential to lead to a more favorable harm to benefit ratio at the population level. Most studies of risk-based screening have focused on women at increased risk for whom more intense screening than biennial might be considered. Few studies have assessed the harms and benefits for women at decreased risk (lower than average, ie, a relative risk [RR] < 1). Women with lower-than-average risk of breast cancer are expected to have a less favorable harm to benefit ratio from untargeted screening, suggesting that less intense screening strategies than biennial screening might be appropriate for this group.

The proportion of women at low risk in the population is substantial; for example, 34% of US women aged 40–74 years have a 5-year risk of developing breast cancer below 1.00% based on the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) risk model. Established factors that are associated with substantially decreased risk for breast cancer include fatty breasts, young age at first birth (younger than 20 years), and young age at menopause (younger than 40 years) with relative risks of 0.6–0.7; these factors apply to 8%, 12%, and 13% of US women, respectively. Factors associated with a more modest decrease in risk, such as 3 or 4 full pregnancies (RR = 0.84) and age at menopause between 45 and 49 years (RR = 0.86), are even more common, with 39% and 24% of US women aged 50–79 years reporting those factors, respectively.

Breast density has also received attention as an important factor that influences risk of developing breast cancer, as well as affecting the balance between benefits and harms of screening, because low breast density not only leads to a reduced risk for developing disease but also increases the sensitivity of mammography. The aim of this study was to assess the benefits and harms of screening by breast cancer risk, breast density, and screening interval among women aged 50–74 years with lower-than-average risk levels using collaborative modeling. Study results are intended to inform discussions about risk-based screening guidelines and practice.

### Use of breast cancer risk factors to identify risk-adapted starting age of screening in China [^113n9F2M]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study reports the risk-adapted starting age of breast cancer screening in China. In addition, we developed a website to calculate an individual's optimal starting age of screening, which may support the decision-making process and inform the update of current breast cancer screening guidelines. Our findings contribute to the principle of equal management of equal risks in breast cancer prevention and may help narrow the focus to women at high risk. Doing so may optimize the allocation of limited screening resources, especially in developing countries like China. Future research on risk-adapted screening methods and screening intervals is needed.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^116ZTVC4]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) average-risk screening — older age, health, and life expectancy: Health and life expectancy, not simply age, must be considered in screening decisions, and a significant proportion of women 75 years and older are in good health and can be expected to live considerably longer than 10 or more years. Based on 2010 US Life Tables, approximately 50% of 80-year-old women and 25% of 85-year-old women will live at least 10 years, and an older woman's life expectancy exceeding 10 years is generally defined as having greater than a 50% probability of surviving 10 years. For women who are healthy and have at least a 10-year life expectancy, individualized decisions about screening mammography should be considered, and the GDG recommends that women should continue screening as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer.

### Trends in breast cancer screening: impact of U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations [^112spL68]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although there is general agreement among various guidelines on benefits of routine screening mammography, the age of screening initiation and the optimal frequency of the test remain controversial. In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against routine breast cancer screening in women aged younger than 50 years. In this study, screening mammography guideline adherence among U.S. women is explored by examining patterns in rates of mammography age of initiation and utilization in years prior to and following the 2009 USPSTF guideline implementation.

Methods

U.S. population-based data from the 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys were used to measure the overall proportion and rate of change in the proportion of women who underwent screening mammography within the last year, by age and survey year. Data were accessed and analyzed in July 2014.

Results

Rates of mammography screening were lower in 2010 and 2012 compared with 2007 and 2008 (p < 0.0001). The rate of screening initiation at age 40 years increased over time and was the highest in the years following USPSTF guideline changes (p = 0.012).

Conclusions

These data support no perceptible change in U.S. women's patterns of screening mammography age at initiation within 3 years of the USPSTF guideline revision. Whether this finding reflects a delayed effect of guideline revision in population trends or rather health provider practice and patient preference for more frequent screening is unclear and requires further investigation.

### Is It the era for personalized screening? [^114FMb7q]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer screening is a recognized tool for early detection of the disease in asymptomatic women, improving treatment efficacy and reducing the mortality rate. There is raised awareness that a "one-size-fits-all" approach cannot be applied for breast cancer screening. Currently, despite specific guidelines for a minority of women who are at very high risk of breast cancer, all other women are still treated alike. This article reviews the current recommendations for breast cancer risk assessment and breast cancer screening in average-risk and higher-than-average-risk women. Also discussed are new developments and future perspectives for personalized breast cancer screening.

Despite some controversy in recent years, the majority of experts agree on the evidence for effectiveness of breast screening by mammography for women aged 50 years and above, but for those under 50 years, the picture is much less clear. However, the issue remains of importance both to policy makers and to individual women; although the incidence of breast cancer is lower at younger ages, the life years lost due to cancers diagnosed below 50 years amount to a third of all those lost due to the disease.

### Beyond mammography: new frontiers in breast cancer screening [^115pxGWt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Breast cancer screening remains a subject of intense and, at times, passionate debate. Mammography has long been the mainstay of breast cancer detection and is the only screening test proven to reduce mortality. Although it remains the gold standard of breast cancer screening, there is increasing awareness of subpopulations of women for whom mammography has reduced sensitivity. Mammography also has undergone increased scrutiny for false positives and excessive biopsies, which increase radiation dose, cost, and patient anxiety. In response to these challenges, new technologies for breast cancer screening have been developed, including low-dose mammography, contrast-enhanced mammography, tomosynthesis, automated whole breast ultrasound, molecular imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging. Here we examine some of the current controversies and promising new technologies that may improve detection of breast cancer both in the general population and in high-risk groups, such as women with dense breasts. We propose that optimal breast cancer screening will ultimately require a personalized approach based on metrics of cancer risk with selective application of specific screening technologies best suited to the individual's age, risk, and breast density.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^117TZMnZ]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society breast cancer screening guideline — recommendation strength and user interpretation are defined using GRADE: "The GDC chose to assess recommendations as 'strong' or 'qualified', in accordance with GRADE guidance". "A strong recommendation conveys the consensus that the benefits of adherence to the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects", whereas "Qualified recommendations indicate there is clear evidence of benefit but less certainty about either the balance between benefits and harms, or about patients' values and preferences, which could lead to different decisions (Table 1)". Table 1 interprets strong recommendations for patients as "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not" and for clinicians as "Most individuals should receive the recommended course of action. Adherence to the recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator". For qualified recommendations, patients: "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action but many would not. Patient preferences and informed decision making are desirable for making decisions", and clinicians: "Clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for different patients and that clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", with the additions that "Decision aids may be useful to help individuals in making decisions consistent with their values and preferences" and "Clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working toward a decision".

Box 2 Summary of the key recommendations of the ENVISION

Assessment of breast cancer risk
Risk-assessment tools should be validated using prospective cohorts in the context in which they will be used and for each population ancestry.
Risk-assessment tools that enable better predictions of breast cancer subtype-specific risk and risk in women of non-European descent need to be developed and validated.
Discovery research to identify additional genetic variants and new markers is required to improve risk stratification.
The trade-off between the accuracy of comprehensive models and their usability at the population level should be evaluated.
Algorithm transparency should be ensured, with explicit reporting of the assumptions made.

Breast cancer prevention
Ways to better select high-risk women predisposed to breast cancer of poor prognosis need to be developed.
Clinically relevant surrogate markers (reflecting the field defect in breast tissues) that provide early indications of the effectiveness of the preventive measures in reducing incidence of breast cancer of poor prognosis need to be identified.
Programmes should incorporate healthy lifestyle recommendations for women at all risk levels.
Prevention-specific drug doses, schemes and schedules need to be defined, and rational drug repositioning strategies should be explored.
Better and early assessment of the acceptability of new preventive interventions is required.

Risk-stratified early detection
Discovery research is required to identify and validate early detection markers that can differentiate progressive from non-progressive breast cancers.
Develop risk-stratified early detection strategies underpinned by understanding of how the natural course of breast cancer, sensitivity of the test (for example, mammography) and the probability of overdiagnosis vary according to risk levels.
Optimize variables related to risk assessment (which risk factors to include, what age to start screening, how often to screen, and so on) and risk stratification (how many risk groups to specify and the risk threshold for each group), thus resulting in a cost-effective, feasible, acceptable and equitably accessible early detection programme.
Modelling studies can be used to inform on long-term population outcomes and the optimal design of risk-stratified early detection programmes.
Pragmatic randomized study designs, such as randomized health service studies, should be used to generate evidence on the effectiveness of risk-stratified early detection approaches in a given setting.

### Breast cancer screening: common questions and answers [^113AKxYP]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in women and accounts for 30% of all new cancers in the United States. The highest incidence of breast cancer is in women 70 to 74 years of age. Numerous risk factors are associated with the development of breast cancer. A risk assessment tool can be used to determine individual risk and help guide screening decisions. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend against teaching average-risk women to perform breast self-examinations. The USPSTF and AAFP recommend biennial screening mammography for average-risk women 50 to 74 years of age. However, there is no strong evidence supporting a net benefit of mammography screening in average-risk women 40 to 49 years of age; therefore, the USPSTF and AAFP recommend individualized decision-making in these women. For average-risk women 75 years and older, the USPSTF and AAFP conclude that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Cancer Society state that screening may continue depending on the woman's health status and life expectancy. Women at high risk of breast cancer may benefit from mammography starting at 30 years of age or earlier, with supplemental screening such as magnetic resonance imaging. Supplemental ultrasonography in women with dense breasts increases cancer detection but also false-positive results.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^114wf3dd]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2015 breast cancer screening for women at average risk — key age bands and modalities are: Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation). Women should undergo regular screening mammography beginning at age 45 years (Strong Recommendation), and women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). Clinical breast examination is not recommended for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). All women should become familiar with the potential benefits, limitations, and harms associated with breast cancer screening. Average-risk women were defined as those without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age. In contrast, ACS, 2003 guidance stated: Begin annual mammography screening at age 40 years; For women in their 20s and 30s, it is recommended that clinical breast examination be part of a periodic health examination, preferably at least every 3 years; Asymptomatic women aged 40 years and older should continue to receive a clinical breast examination as part of a periodic health examination, preferably annually.

Breast cancer accounts for almost 1 in 4 cancers in U.S. women, and screening mammography reduces breast cancer mortality. However, when to start screening mammography remains controversial. A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2002 showed a 15% relative risk reduction among women aged 40–49; however, only one of the included trials was specifically designed to address this issue. Additionally, the analysis did not provide a comprehensive review of the harms associated with screening mammography. Questions also remained about the effectiveness of mammography in older women, and the utility of clinical and self breast exams.

What these studies add.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force updated the 2002 meta-analysis regarding mammography benefit in women aged 40–49 to include two new sources of data. Pooling these data with those from the previous meta-analysis resulted in a 15% relative risk reduction (95%CI 0.75–0.96) in breast cancer mortality among women aged 40–49 years. However, this was balanced with a high number needed to invite to prevent one breast cancer death (1904: 95%CI 929–6378) and a high false positive rate in this age group (97.8 per 1000 screened). Evidence was insufficient regarding the benefits of mammography in women older than 70 and the clinical breast exam; breast self-exam did not have any net benefit. A model of the effectiveness of various mammographic screening strategies for reducing breast cancer mortalityfound that the most efficient models initiated screening at age 50 with a biennial interval. Starting screening at age 40 reduced breast cancer mortality by an additional 3% but resulted in more false-positives, whereas biennial screening over the age of 50 retained 81% of the benefit achieved with annual screening.

How should I change my practice?.

Screening mammography for women aged 40–49 should not be reflexive. Biennial screening retains the same benefits as annual screening and should be recommended for women over 50 years. The benefits of clinical breast exam, and of mammography in women over 70 years, remain inconclusive.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114S3M89]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF breast cancer screening — screening interval and starting age effects are quantified as follows: Biennial screening led to a 5% absolute decrease in 10-year cumulative false-positive biopsy rate compared with annual screening. Collaborative modeling estimates that a strategy of screening annually from ages 40 to 74 years would result in about 50% more false-positive results and 50% more overdiagnosed cases of breast cancer compared with biennial screening. Modeling also estimated that lowering the age to start screening to 40 years from 50 years would result in about a 60% increase in false-positive results and 2 additional overdiagnosed cases of breast cancer (range, 0 to 4) per 1000 women over a lifetime of screening. In contrast, screening biennially from ages 40 to 74 years would lead to 14 overdiagnosed cases of breast cancer per 1000 persons screened over the lifetime of screening, with a very wide range of estimates (4 to 37 cases) across models.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ductal carcinoma in situ, more specifically with respect to breast cancer screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain screening mammography every 1 or 2 years based on an informed, shared decision-making process including a discussion of the benefits and harms of annual and biennial screening and incorporating patient values and preferences in females at average risk of breast cancer. Consider obtaining biennial screening mammography, particularly after age 55 years, to reduce the frequency of harms, as long as patient counseling includes a discussion that with decreased screening comes some reduction in benefits.

INTRODUCTION

Organized population-based screening has a prominent role in early detection of breast cancer in many countries, and reduction of breast cancer mortality has followed adoption of such screening programmes. Yet, the programs have also generated much controversy around the balance of benefits and harms, particularly regarding the age of initiation and screening interval. Instead of the one-size-fits-all regimen, increasing evidence suggests that cost-efficiency and the benefit-harm balance could be improved by risk-tailored screening, giving the opportunity to personalize the start and stop ages, and the screening interval. Such risk-tailored surveillance has long been used for specific subgroups, such as carriers of pathogenic variants (PVs) in moderate- or high-risk breast cancer susceptibility genes (eg, BRCA1 and PALB2), and with accumulation of early-onset breast cancer in the family.

In addition to moderate- and high-risk variants in susceptibility genes, breast cancer has a polygenic inheritance where many common variants across the genome jointly contribute to disease risk. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) combine such information into a single metric of inherited disease susceptibility. Compared with individuals with an average breast cancer PRS, a high PRS confers an up to three- to five-fold risk increase to breast cancer, with a lifetime risk of over 30%. The breast cancer PRS also considerably modifies the risk conferred by moderate- and high-risk variants. Previous studies show that breast cancer PRS offers opportunities for risk-tailored surveillance, but there is limited evidence on impact of PRSs for identifying high-risk women for stratified screening on the basis of population-based screening data.

In Finland, biennial screening is offered free for all women between age 50 and 69 years through a nationwide screening program. We estimate the impact of PRS in this screening setting, comparing the effect of PRS in risk stratification to family history (FH) and known moderate- to high-risk PVs in breast cancer susceptibility genes. FinnGen combines genomewide genotyping to nationwide health registries, including the Mass Screening Registry, allowing assessment of PRS in the breast cancer screening context starting from the initiation of a nationwide breast cancer screening program in 1992.

### Race and ethnicity-adjusted age recommendation for initiating breast cancer screening [^111mwDnw]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

One should also note that regardless of race and ethnicity, cancers occurring in young female patients are inherently more aggressive. Triple-negative cancers play a role; however, other subtypes may also be aggressive. For fast-growing cancers, only lowering the mammography screening age may be associated with a less effective intervention due to aggressive interval cancers. Therefore, screening in younger females may need to be more sensitive and more frequent. However, a studyfound that the increased risk of false positives from earlier screenings may be balanced by the benefits of earlier BC detection, at least in young Black females between ages 40 and 50 years. This is the only racial or ethnic group in our study that needed an earlier screening.

Our analysis could not consider the competing risk of death from non-BC deaths owing to limitations in aggregated data, although this should not have substantial influence around age 50 years or younger, which was the focus of our study. No stratified analyses by molecular subtype, stage, or treatment were conducted owing to limited data on treatment or limited necessity of such analyses. The outcome in this study was BC-specific mortality, which considers only life-threatening types of this disease. The intention of this study was to provide a race and ethnicity–specific age recommendation for initiating BC screening. Given that current widely used screening modalities are able and intended to detect all invasive BC types and are not specific for any particular histology or stage, no analysis was needed by molecular subtype or stage.

The risk level found for cancer death is known to be associated with mode of detection. US Mortality Data includes a mix of female patients with no screening, infrequent screening, or regular screening prior to diagnosis, and this may be associated with racial and ethnic differences in risk of mortality. This is an inherent issue that could not be fixed in this database given that there were no data for mode of detection or past screening history. However, given that there is currently no consensus about BC screening before age 50 years, the conclusion from mortality before age 50 years in Black females, which was the focus of our study, may not have been substantially affected by this issue.

In brief, although there are more risk factors that could be used for a more optimal risk-adapted screening, the limited availability of comprehensive large, population-based, individual long-term data has always been a barrier. However, changing guidelines based on readily available risk factors, such as race and ethnicity, is possible and may be the first, yet important step toward a personalized and fair screening program.

Methods

Structured question and outcome prioritisation

The clinical question ' Should an annual, biennial or triennial screening frequency be used for screening asymptomatic women ?' was prioritised by the GDG (Box 1: Structured clinical question). This review focused on the three age subgroups for which the European Guidelines previously issued recommendations for screening (45–49, 50–69, and 70–74 years old). The GDG prioritised the outcomes using a 1–9 scale (7–9 critical; 4–6 important; 1–3 of limited importance).

Box 1 PICO structured clinical question

Data sources and searches

We initially searched MEDLINE (via PubMed, October 2016), EMBASE (via Ovid, October 2016) and CENTRAL (via The Cochrane Library, October 2016) databases using pre-defined algorithms for individual studies. We updated our initial search in MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE (via Ovid) in April 2020 (Supplementary Table S1: Protocol Systematic Review, Supplementary Table S2: Search strategy).

Study selection

We included studies published in English of the following designs: (I) randomised clinical trials (RCTs), (ii) observational studies such as cohorts, time trend (before-after), or analysis of population surveillance registries, and (iii) decision analytic models (hereafter referred to as modelling studies) (Supplementary Tables S3a and 3b). All studies included at least two screening intervals in one of the age groups of interest; screening intervals from observational studies should had been defined based on at least two examinations prior to diagnosis; modelling studies should have assumed 100% adherence to the screening programmes and applied no discounting to the effects. Due to sparse empirical evidence in the 45–49 age subgroup, we included RCTs and observational studies that recruited women from 40 to 49.

We excluded studies of women at high risk for breast cancer, i.e. having known susceptibility gene mutations (BRCA1/BRCA2), a history of previous breast cancer or lobular neoplasia, exposure to chest irradiation (other than diagnostic imaging over that anatomical area) or having a direct family member with breast cancer.

Pairs of reviewers (CCA, MP), after calibration, assessed eligibility and reviewed the full text of the selected references. Discrepancies were resolved either by consensus or with the help of a third reviewer.

Implications for practice and research

Our findings may have different implications for practice depending on the age group, the balance between benefits and harms, available resources for public health services, and how women value the different outcomes. In the case of women invited to an opportunistic screening programme (or considering screening) a shared decision-making process to carefully explain the pros and cons of each decision is warranted. Similarly, given the low certainty of evidence and the variability and uncertainty of how women value outcomes at stake, guideline panellists are likely to formulate conditional recommendations, as opposed to strong ones. The scope of this review is determined by the European Breast Guidelines screening recommendations; thus, policy makers should note that we did not include modelling estimates for women between the ages of 40 and 44 as screening is not suggested in this age group. Also, readers should be careful when interpreting the effects of screening intervals across the different age groups, as comparisons are limited by the small number of screening rounds in the 45 to 49 and 70 to 74 age groups, compared to the 50–69 age group.

Recommendations about mammography screening intervals will also depend on the magnitude and relative importance of potential harms. Narayan, et al. assessed to what extent harms should decrease in order to make a screening interval with an unfavourable balance of benefits and harms acceptable. They found that for annual screening a reduction of 31% false positive results would be required to support a recommendation in favour of starting at 50, although this was in the context of false positive rates prevailing in the US. Policy makers should probably consider implementing interventions to improve mammography performance, mitigating concerns about potential harms. For example previous studies suggest that comparing mammograms with prior exams can significantly reduce the recall rate while maintaining the same detection rate.

Several research priorities were identified during this review, with feedback from the GDG experts, such as need for: (i) empirical research on the effectiveness of the different screening intervals due to the current very low certainty of evidence; ii) cost-effectiveness studies using unitary costs from different settings, and in particular for women aged 45 to 49, iii) assessment of alternative imaging modalities, iv) tailored screening according to risk vs population screening. For example, previous research has highlighted that breast density influences both mammography accuracy and risk of developing breast cancer.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to do not continue or discontinue screening based on age alone. Decide on discontinuing screening mammography beyond age 75 years based on a shared decision-making process informed by the females health status and longevity.

### Use of breast cancer risk factors to identify risk-adapted starting age of screening in China [^116Gj2vB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. First, the age of 40 years recommended by certain guidelines was not explored due to the limitation of the starting age in this study. Second, although 5 factors were selected for risk division in our study according to clinical and statistical significance, more key variables associated with breast cancer (eg, mammographic density,) should be collected and used for risk division in future research. In addition, risk-adapted starting age in our study was defined as the age at which women with different risk levels attained a 10-year cumulative risk comparable to the average risk for women at the recommended age in the general population. The cost-effectiveness of this approach was not taken into consideration and should be assessed in further studies. In addition, external validation should also be conducted. Screening methods such as mammographyand clinical breast examinationare proven to be effective for breast cancer screening. Screening strategies include not only the starting age of screening but also screening methods and screening intervals, which should be investigated for risk-adapted breast cancer screening in the future to detect women at high risk for breast cancer. Doing so helps to focus limited resources on these individuals, especially in developing countries such as China.

American Cancer Society (ACS) evidence synthesis for average-risk women reports that screening mammography in women aged 40 to 69 years is associated with a reduction in breast cancer deaths across a range of study designs. Estimates of the cumulative lifetime risk of false-positive examination results are greater if screening begins at younger ages because of the greater number of mammograms, as well as the higher recall rate in younger women. The quality of the evidence for overdiagnosis is not sufficient to estimate a lifetime risk with confidence. Analysis examining the screening interval demonstrates more favorable tumor characteristics when premenopausal women are screened annually vs biennially. Evidence does not support routine clinical breast examination as a screening method for women at average risk.

TABLE 1.
Study Characteristics and Associations Between Breast Cancer and PRS, PVs, and FH

Figure 2 and the Data Supplement (Fig S1) show lifetime risks of breast cancer for the risk factors and their combinations, and indicate when each group reaches a 2% cumulative incidence, aligning with the population's average at the start of organized screening at age 50 years. This age provides a guideline for when to begin screening on the basis of individual risk. Groups of high PRS, PV carriers, or positive FH reached this 2% prevalence at age 42 years, while women with high PRS and FH or PV reached it at age 38 years. By contrast, women without PVs or FH who have a low PRS reached a similar risk level two decades later, at age 62 years. The estimates are calibrated to the general population (see the Data Supplement for details).

### Personalizing breast cancer screening based on polygenic risk and family history [^1158yLjG]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). Medium credibility.

Routine mammography screening starting at age 45 or 50 years has been shown to reduce population breast cancer mortality for women at average risk. It remains uncertain whether the current screening guidelines are optimal for individual women considering the variability in breast cancer risk at any given age. The American Cancer Society (ACS) and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend that women discuss their individual risk and screening options with their healthcare providers before the age of 45 or 50 years, yet there are limited data to inform such discussions. Risk-based screening has been proposed as a way to inform decisions about the starting age and frequency of screening for women at different levels of risk. Recent discoveries in the field of breast cancer genetics may hold the potential to guide risk-based screening strategies. The risk of developing breast cancer approximately doubles for women with a first-degree family member with breast cancer. Approximately 20% of the familial risk is attributable to high or moderate penetrance mutations in genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, and CHEK2. The remaining 80% is due to a combination of more common variations in the DNA sequence (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]). Currently, about 313 common SNPs have been identified as being associated with breast cancer risk. Although these individual variants are associated with small to modest increased risk, their combined effects considered as a polygenic risk score (PRS) could be useful in targeting screening strategies based on risk.

Two ongoing trials, My Personal Breast Screening and the Women Informed to Screen Depending on Measures of Risk trial, are presently testing age-based vs risk-based screening approaches that include genetic markers and family history information, but results are not expected until 2024–2025. A recent study in the United Kingdom modeled the use of PRS to determine the cost-effectiveness of screening women triennially above a certain risk threshold. However, to our knowledge, there are no studies that have compared the impact of screening strategies tailored to risk based on family history of breast cancer and polygenic risk combined. To fill this clinical gap, 2 established Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network models that were used to inform the current USPSTF breast cancer screening guidelines were used to estimate the lifetime effects of screening based on family history status and polygenic risk. The results are intended to support conversations between women and their healthcare providers about the benefits and harms of starting screening before the age of 50 years. The findings could also provide data to inform policy discussions about risk-tailored screening guidelines.

Key Points

Question

At what age should women with varying levels of breast cancer risk start screening?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1 549 988 women in China, participants were divided into groups according to breast cancer risk scores (driven by risk factors including first-degree family history of breast cancer, benign breast disease, breastfeeding, age at menarche, and body mass index). Using the 10-year cumulative risk of breast cancer at age 50 years in the general population as a benchmark, the optimal starting age of screening was identified as 43, 48, or after 55 years for women with high, medium, or low risk, respectively.

Meaning

These results identify the risk-adapted starting age at which to begin screening in women with varying levels of breast cancer risk in China, which may inform updates of current screening guidelines.

### Breast cancer screening for women at higher-than-average risk: updated recommendations from the ACR [^111Wnmki]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Early detection decreases breast cancer death. The ACR recommends annual screening beginning at age 40 for women of average risk and earlier and/or more intensive screening for women at higher-than-average risk. For most women at higher-than-average risk, the supplemental screening method of choice is breast MRI. Women with genetics-based increased risk, those with a calculated lifetime risk of 20% or more, and those exposed to chest radiation at young ages are recommended to undergo MRI surveillance starting at ages 25 to 30 and annual mammography (with a variable starting age between 25 and 40, depending on the type of risk). Mutation carriers can delay mammographic screening until age 40 if annual screening breast MRI is performed as recommended. Women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 or with personal histories of breast cancer and dense breasts should undergo annual supplemental breast MRI. Others with personal histories, and those with atypia at biopsy, should strongly consider MRI screening, especially if other risk factors are present. For women with dense breasts who desire supplemental screening, breast MRI is recommended. For those who qualify for but cannot undergo breast MRI, contrast-enhanced mammography or ultrasound could be considered. All women should undergo risk assessment by age 25, especially Black women and women of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, so that those at higher-than-average risk can be identified and appropriate screening initiated.
