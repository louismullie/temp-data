## Question

Is knee aspiration appropriate for hematoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether knee aspiration is appropriate for a hematoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes a knee hematoma and whether we are dealing with intra-articular hemarthrosis versus extra-articular hematoma. Then, I should verify the indications and contraindications for aspiration in each scenario. Next, I will review the evidence base and guideline positions, including AAOS and sports medicine guidance. After that, I need to check safety considerations, especially infection and anticoagulation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note when image guidance is helpful.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. A knee hematoma can be either an intra-articular hemarthrosis, which is bleeding into the joint space, or an extra-articular soft-tissue hematoma, which is bleeding confined to subcutaneous or periarticular tissues; aspiration is an intra-articular procedure, so it is appropriate for hemarthrosis but not for extra-articular hematomas unless the collection is actually a fluid collection amenable to image-guided drainage, which is a different procedure altogether [^ef4ba8e7] [^d9768044].

> Now, I should verify the indications for aspirating a traumatic knee hemarthrosis. The AAOS clinical practice guideline for ACL injuries states that physicians may consider aspirating painful, tense effusions after knee injury, acknowledging that evidence is limited and based on consensus; the rationale includes potential pain reduction, improved early range of motion, and theoretical reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, with the main harm being infection risk, which is low but real [^eea6bc86] [^732db016] [^752d7884]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: yes, this is a consensus recommendation due to sparse high-quality data, so shared decision-making is key [^eea6bc86].

> Next, I should review the evidence beyond guidelines. A randomized controlled trial of acute knee effusions showed that aspiration provided only temporary improvement in pain and function, with reaccumulation within a week and no long-term benefit, suggesting that aspiration is reasonable for short-term symptom relief but should not be expected to change medium-term outcomes; this tempers enthusiasm for routine aspiration in all cases [^4cf9db2d]. Hold on, I should also consider emerging data: a recent randomized study of preoperative aspiration before ACL reconstruction did not reduce revision or arthrofibrosis rates, though it delayed the time to arthrofibrosis, implying no clear disease-modifying benefit from aspiration alone [^f40b796d].

> I will now examine diagnostic indications, because sometimes aspiration is appropriate even if therapeutic benefit is modest. In the setting of acute knee swelling after trauma, aspiration can clarify whether the effusion is purely hemorrhagic or if there is concern for infection, crystal disease, or other pathology; this is particularly relevant when the diagnosis is uncertain or when anticoagulation complicates the picture, and guidelines endorse aspiration for unexplained effusions or when infection is suspected [^29524a44] [^3c82ecd7]. Let me reconsider the anticoagulation point: multiple series suggest that aspiration can be performed safely in anticoagulated patients when clinically indicated, though holding anticoagulation and ensuring normalization of clotting parameters is prudent when feasible [^48288623] [^8d6946d1].

> But wait, what if the "hematoma" is extra-articular rather than intra-articular. I should confirm that aspiration is not indicated for a simple subcutaneous or periarticular hematoma; in those cases, management is conservative with RICE, compression, and observation, and attempting needle aspiration risks dry tap or worsening bleeding without benefit, so I need to ensure we are not mixing these entities up [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions: if there is a liquefied, organized collection or a Morel-Lavallée lesion, image-guided drainage may be appropriate, but that is a different clinical problem than a routine hematoma [^cc0a3c48].

> Next, I should review safety and technique. The main risks of intra-articular aspiration are iatrogenic infection and, in anticoagulated patients, bleeding; infection risk is low in native joints when aseptic technique is used, and large series show very low infection rates after aspiration, though vigilance remains necessary [^ed8cf11d] [^ffef954e]. I need to ensure best practice: use sterile technique, consider ultrasound guidance to improve accuracy and reduce attempts, and use larger-bore needles for viscous bloody fluid to maximize yield and minimize clogging [^6a4cba7c] [^f1e1c49e]. Let me double-check the guidance strength: multiple systematic reviews and society statements support ultrasound guidance for improved accuracy and patient-centered outcomes in knee arthrocentesis, which is particularly helpful in obese patients or when landmarks are obscured [^f1e1c49e] [^70a6a7ca].

> I should also consider special contexts. In patients with hemophilia or other bleeding disorders, aspiration may be indicated for large, painful hemarthroses after factor replacement and under hematology guidance, but this requires coordinated care to avoid rebleeding and infection; similarly, in postoperative knees with suspected infection, aspiration is a cornerstone of diagnosis and should not be delayed when infection is on the table [^b61d410a]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: in anticoagulated patients, I should confirm that clotting parameters are optimized when possible, but if the diagnosis hinges on synovial fluid, aspiration can proceed with caution given the low complication rates reported in observational cohorts [^48288623].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize a practical approach. Aspiration is appropriate for intra-articular hemarthrosis when the effusion is large, tense, and causing significant pain or mechanical limitation, when the diagnosis is uncertain and infection or crystal disease must be excluded, or when anticoagulation-associated hemarthrosis persists despite correction of coagulopathy; it is not indicated for extra-articular hematomas, which should be managed conservatively [^eea6bc86] [^29524a44] [^48288623]. I need to ensure patients understand that benefits are often short-term and that recurrence is common, so expectations should be calibrated accordingly [^4cf9db2d].

> Final answer: Yes, knee aspiration is appropriate for intra-articular hemarthrosis when clinically indicated for symptom relief, diagnostic clarification, or facilitation of rehabilitation, but it is not appropriate for extra-articular hematomas; use aseptic technique and consider ultrasound guidance to optimize safety and yield, and individualize decisions in patients on anticoagulation or with bleeding disorders [^eea6bc86] [^f1e1c49e] [^48288623] [^d9768044].

Knee aspiration is appropriate for **hemarthrosis** when the effusion is large, tense, and causing significant pain or restricted motion, as it provides rapid relief and improves function [^eea6bc86] [^4cf9db2d]. It is also indicated when the diagnosis is unclear — to distinguish hemarthrosis from infection, crystal arthropathy, or other causes — and when anticoagulation is present, after correcting coagulopathy to reduce pain and enable rehabilitation [^8d6946d1] [^48288623]. Routine aspiration of small, non-tense hemarthroses is not recommended, and **ultrasound guidance** improves accuracy and safety, especially in obese patients or when landmarks are obscured [^f1e1c49e] [^70a6a7ca]. The main risks are infection and rebleeding, which are minimized with aseptic technique and careful patient selection [^ed8cf11d] [^48288623].

## Indications for knee aspiration in hemarthrosis

Knee aspiration is **indicated in the following scenarios**:

- **Large, tense effusions**: Significant pain, swelling, and restricted range of motion due to hemarthrosis [^eea6bc86] [^4cf9db2d].

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Differentiate hemarthrosis from infection, crystal arthropathy, or other causes of joint effusion [^29524a44] [^7cc7041e].

- **Anticoagulation-related hemarthrosis**: After correcting coagulopathy, to relieve pain and facilitate rehabilitation [^8d6946d1] [^48288623].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

While knee aspiration is generally safe, certain **contraindications and precautions** should be considered:

- **Overlying skin infection**: Avoid aspiration to prevent introduction of infection into the joint [^29524a44].

- **Uncorrected coagulopathy**: Increased risk of bleeding; correct coagulopathy before aspiration [^48288623].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Consider patient preference, comorbidities, and risk of complications [^11535b01].

---

## Clinical benefits of knee aspiration in hemarthrosis

Knee aspiration provides **several clinical benefits**:

- **Pain relief**: Immediate reduction in intra-articular pressure and inflammation [^4cf9db2d].

- **Improved range of motion**: Facilitates rehabilitation and functional recovery [^eea6bc86].

- **Diagnostic clarity**: Enables analysis of synovial fluid to confirm diagnosis and guide management [^29524a44].

---

## Potential risks and complications

Knee aspiration carries minimal risks, including:

- **Infection**: Rare but serious complication; strict aseptic technique is essential [^ed8cf11d].

- **Rebleeding**: Particularly in patients with coagulopathy; correct coagulopathy before aspiration [^48288623].

- **Temporary discomfort**: Mild pain or discomfort at the aspiration site [^ff90670c].

---

## Role of ultrasound guidance

Ultrasound guidance significantly improves the **accuracy and safety** of knee aspiration, particularly in patients with obesity, anatomical variations, or difficult landmarks [^f1e1f49e] [^70a6a7ca]. It allows real-time visualization of the needle trajectory, ensuring accurate placement within the joint cavity and reducing the risk of complications [^482bc0be].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus support selective use of knee aspiration in hemarthrosis. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) recommends considering aspiration for **painful, tense effusions** after knee injury, particularly in the context of ACL injuries [^eea6bc86] [^732db016]. Similarly, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) emphasize the role of image-guided aspirations for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes [^cd97277f] [^70a6a7ca].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Aspiration indicated?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Large, tense hemarthrosis with significant pain and restricted motion | Yes | Symptomatic relief and improved function [^eea6bc86] [^4cf9db2d] |
| Diagnostic uncertainty (infection, crystal arthropathy) | Yes | Confirm diagnosis and guide management [^29524a44] [^7cc7041e] |
| Anticoagulation-related hemarthrosis after correcting coagulopathy | Yes | Reduce pain and facilitate rehabilitation [^8d6946d1] [^48288623] |
| Small, non-tense hemarthrosis without significant symptoms | No | Unnecessary intervention with potential risks |

---

Knee aspiration is appropriate for **hemarthrosis** when the effusion is large, tense, and symptomatic, or when diagnostic clarification is needed. It provides rapid pain relief, improves function, and aids diagnosis, with minimal risks when performed correctly. Ultrasound guidance enhances accuracy and safety, especially in challenging cases.

Aspiration of the knee — anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that physicians may consider aspirating painful, tense effusions after knee injury, with Quality of Evidence: Consensus and Strength of Option: Consensus. The rationale states that no relevant articles have been published in the last 20 years regarding the benefit of aspiration in acutely injured knees. Potential benefits include that acute knee aspiration has the potential to decrease pain and improve early range of motion (ROM) in ACL injured knees and may also decrease the presence of cytokines which may be implicated in the cascade progressing to osteoarthritis following ACL tear, whereas a potential harm is that aspiration of the knee has the potential to introduce infection in an acutely injured knee. Outcome importance is listed as unclear, and resource use is described as minimal cost, and minimal use of resources to perform aspiration. Acceptability notes that if there are positive clinical implications, knee aspiration would be an acceptable treatment for acutely ACL injured knees when indicated. Feasibility notes that knee aspiration in acute ACL tears, if indicated, would be feasible in many situations and that prospective, randomized trials will be needed to determine the effect of aspiration of the hematoma following acute ACL tear in reducing pain and/or improving clinical outcome.

### Knee joint aspiration and injection [^29524a44]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Knee joint aspiration and injection are performed to aid in diagnosis and treatment of knee joint diseases. The knee joint is the most common and the easiest joint for the physician to aspirate. One approach involves insertion of a needle 1 cm above and 1 cm lateral to the superior lateral aspect of the patella at a 45-degree angle. Once the needle has been inserted 1 to 1 1/2 inches, aspiration aided by local compression is performed. Local corticosteroid injections can provide significant relief and often ameliorate acute exacerbations of knee osteoarthritis associated with significant effusions. Among the indications for arthrocentesis are crystal-induced arthropathy, hemarthrosis, unexplained joint effusion, and symptomatic relief of a large effusion. Contraindications include bacteremia, inaccessible joints, joint prosthesis, and overlying infection in the soft tissue. Large effusions can recur and may require repeat aspiration. Anti-inflammatory medications may prove beneficial in reducing joint inflammation and fluid accumulations.

Orthopaedic surgeons frequently use aspirations and injections to both diagnose and treat disorders of the lower extremity. Comprehensive knowledge of regional anatomy, procedural indications, and appropriate techniques are essential. Clinicians must be well versed in a range of musculoskeletal aspiration and injection techniques, including patient positioning, equipment needs, injectable solutions, aspirate analysis, and potential complications. Safe and effective aspiration and injection techniques for the lower extremity, including the hip, knee, foot, and ankle, are reviewed. Image guidance modalities include fluoroscopy, ultrasonography, CT, and MRI.

The on-call orthopaedic surgeon is faced with a wide array of orthopaedic pathology for which intra-articular aspiration, injection, and/or nerve/hematoma block may be used. Efficient use of these diagnostic and therapeutic modalities affords better patient care and a more effective on-call period. Often, these interventions are the rate limiting factor in a reduction or diagnosis. In this review, we describe joint aspirations, saline load tests, hematoma blocks, and nerve blocks in detail to include their indications, techniques, related pharmacology, pearls, and pitfalls.

TIMING AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS TECHNIQUE Position of Patient The patient is placed in the lateral recumbent position with the knee flexed 20 to 30 degrees. Palpation of Landmarks Along the lateral thigh, follow the course of the iliotibial band across the femoral condyle to its insertion at Gerdy's tubercle. Approach and Needle Entry The needle is inserted at the point of maximal tenderness in the region of the lateral condyle. INDICATIONS Bursitis is manifested by swelling and tenderness anterior to the patella and can be the result of acute trauma. 25, 26 Bursitis-related prepatellar swelling must be differentiated from an intra-articular effusion. Aspiration of an inflamed bursa can be performed for relief of discomfort associated with a bursitis. If the symptoms of prepatellar bursitis are recurrent, corticosteroid injection may be performed.

TIMING AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Aspiration of the prepatellar bursa may be performed acutely for relief of swelling and discomfort. Corticosteroid injection can be performed in cases of chronic or persistent bursitis after a trial of more conservative therapy. Approach and Needle Entry Aspiration and injection are performed by placing the needle directly into the fluid-filled bursa from the side. Before injection with a corticosteroid, fluid should be aspirated from the bursa. If injecting, a hemostat is used to hold the needle in place while changing the syringe. Follow-Up Following aspiration of the prepatellar bursa, a pressure dressing should be applied, and the patient should remain in the supine position for several minutes. Following injection, the joint or injected region may be put through passive range of motion. The patient should remain in the office for 30 minutes after the injection to monitor for any adverse reactions.

In general, patients should avoid strenuous activity involving the injected region for several days. Patients should be cautioned that they may experience worsening symptoms during the first 24 to 48 hours related to a possible steroid flare, which can be treated with ice and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients should be instructed against the application of heat. A follow-up appointment should be scheduled within three weeks.

### Aspiration of the knee prior to anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction delays the onset of arthrofibrosis [^f40b796d]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aspiration of a posttraumatic hemarthrosis has been postulated to improve pain and reduce the burden of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that accumulate in the aftermath of an acute anterior cruciate ligament injury. However, the clinical implications of routine aspiration have not been fully investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of routine preoperative aspiration on (1) the development of arthrofibrosis and (2) overall revision surgery rate following ACL reconstruction (ACLr).

Methods

The population of interest for this study was individuals with an isolated (ie, without notable concurrent ligamentous or chondral injury) ACL rupture indicated for ACLr, with or without concurrent meniscal pathology. Patients were randomized to either routine preoperative care or in-office aspiration of their traumatic effusion upon initial presentation. Patients underwent routine diagnostic arthroscopy at the time of ACLr to evaluate for concurrent chondral or meniscal pathology. Patients underwent standard postoperative rehabilitation and follow-up care.

Results

Eighty-seven patients were enrolled in this study, with 46 patients (53%) undergoing preoperative aspiration. At a mean follow-up of 2.54 ± 1.34 years, 14 of 87 patients (16%) underwent revision surgery for any reason and 10 patients (11.5%) underwent débridement of arthrofibrosis. Preoperative aspiration was not markedly associated with a decreased rate of revision surgery or arthrofibrosis. However, aspiration was markedly associated with a longer time to débridement for arthrofibrosis (125 vs. 457 days; P = 0.0029).

Conclusion

Preoperative aspiration does not modify rates of subsequent surgery following ACLr. Arthrofibrosis developed markedly later in patients who were aspirated preoperatively, possibly as a result of decreased intra-articular inflammation.

Future research priorities include that "There is a possibility that slightly better range of motion in patients with drains could decrease manipulation under anesthesia", that "A well-designed prospective study would be helpful to see if the use of drains could decrease the incidence of arthrofibrosis", and the role of tranexamic acid, as "Tranexamic acid has been very effective in reducing blood loss after knee arthroplasty", with "Further research is needed to see if tranexamic acid use alone can reduce the hematoma formation and increase range of motion which will completely eliminate the perceived need for use of the drain".

### ESSKA and EBJIS recommendations for the management of infections after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R): prevention, surgical treatment and rehabilitation [^7b21b6d2]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Prevention

Risk factors for infection after ACL-R include previous corticosteroid injection, concomitant surgical procedures and young age. A 3-day skin and nasal universal decolonization prior to ACL-R is suggested in all hospitals in which it can be implemented, taking into account that this recommendation may not be cost-effective. For intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis, one single dose of a cephalosporin 30–60 min before ACL-R is recommended. In cases of type 1 allergy to penicillins or cephalosporins, prior knee infection, antibiotic therapy or known MRSA carriage prophylaxis with one dose of 1 g of vancomycin (or 15 mg/kg, max. 2500 mg) can be used. Postoperative antibiotic (either intravenous or oral) is unnecessary.
What is the role of preoperative knee aspiration with regard to development of infections after ACL-R?

In cases of native joints, the risk of infection is very low (< 0.01% after arthrocentesis), although it is supposedly higher in cases of knee hemarthrosis after injury due to the inflammatory response. Therefore, aspiration is indicated only in cases of limited range-of-motion (ROM), the inability to activate quadriceps muscle or unbearable pain caused by hemarthrosis. Corticosteroids have been described as risk factors for infection after ACL-R in the first part of the ESSKA and EBJIS recommendations and should be avoided in patients scheduled for ACL-R. There is no data regarding the optimal timing to safely perform ACL reconstruction following a corticosteroid injection. According to the systematic review by Baums et al. the risk of periprosthetic joint infection is not increased when total knee arthroplasty is postponed for 6 months after the last corticosteroid injection. Based on the latter study and the recommendations of Conen et al. for native joints, we would recommend postponing surgery (if possible) for 6 months if the patient received a corticosteroid injection before injury. However, relevant evidence is needed to support this statement. The indication for ACL surgery will primarily depend on degree of instability, symptoms and the risk of developing concomitant pathologies.

### Preoperative diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection: role of aspiration [^0be3ce02]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to illustrate how total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) aspiration by the radiologist can assist the health care team in determining the presence or absence of periprosthetic joint infection.

Conclusion

The increasing incidence of periprosthetic TKA and THA infection, as well as the changing role of aspiration for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection, will likely increase demand for this important procedure in the future.

### Editorial commentary: the current evidence in support of tranexamic acid in arthroscopic surgery is poor [^99eb26df]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been used to treat severe bleeding events for nearly 60 years and is on the list of World Health Organization essential medicines. Initially, it was described to treat heavy menstrual bleeding, but it is now used for a variety of applications. In orthopedic surgery, TXA is commonly used to reduce bleeding after total joint arthroplasty and spine surgery. The use of TXA for joint arthroplasty has been principally endorsed by various orthopedic societies, but they have also criticized a lack of evidence for high-risk patients with a history of pulmonary embolus, vascular stents, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and other cardiac, respiratory, or vascular conditions. TXA may also reduce bleeding complications in arthroscopic surgery, and the findings of recent meta-analyses suggest that intravenous application reduced drainage output and the need for knee joint aspiration and reduced knee swelling. It also had a positive short-term effect on clinical and functional outcomes. However, high risk of bias, low-study quality, and heterogeneity substantially reduced the quality of evidence and the validity of the study conclusions. In my opinion, on the basis of the current evidence, the routine use of TXA in arthroscopic surgery is not recommended.

### Effectiveness of aspiration in knee joint effusion management: a prospective randomized controlled study [^4cf9db2d]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Knee effusion is a common symptom in various knee disorders of both traumatic and non-traumatic aetiology. Although intra-articular aspiration is a widespread treatment approach, its beneficial effect has not been confirmed by a randomized controlled study. The purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of joint aspiration in acute knee effusion, in relation to traumatic or non-traumatic aetiology.

Methods

One hundred and sixty-seven consecutive patients with acute knee joint effusion were allocated in a randomized controlled fashion into two groups. In the first group, joint aspiration was performed, while in the second group, no aspiration was performed. Range of motion, pain relief, use of analgesics and oedema were evaluated post management. The Knee Society Score and the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Evaluation Form were also obtained. In addition, a subgroup analysis of our results in relation to the presence of trauma or not was performed.

Results

Aspiration exhibited a temporary improvement in all clinical parameters evaluated, especially in the post-traumatic effusion. However, this improvement lasted only for the first week, due to the early re-accumulation of the effusion. There was no difference between the different groups regarding the clinical outcome in neither trauma or non-trauma patients at the end of the follow-up period. Aspiration aided in earlier establishment of the diagnosis in the non-trauma cases of effusion.

Conclusions

Aspiration resulted in only temporary improvement of the outcome in the treatment of traumatic or not traumatic knee effusion. Aspiration is suggested in effusions of unknown origin in order to establish the diagnosis and for immediate clinical relief. However, aspiration should be performed with consideration in the presence of trauma.

### Spontaneous atraumatic knee haemarthrosis [^0718cbf2]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Spontaneous knee haemarthrosis is a rare condition, most prevalent in the elderly with osteoarthritis. Recent reports have proposed that the source of bleeding is the peripheral arteries supplying the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus. In this case, a 62-year-old active man presented with acute postero-lateral left knee pain and swelling with limited weight bearing or movement of the knee. No recent history of trauma but history of lateral compartment dominant osteoarthritis and arthroscopic partial lateral meniscectomy of left knee. Aspiration showed a large haemarthrosis and following an MRI scan displaying large areas of full thickness chondral loss, complex tearing of lateral meniscus and loose bodies, the patient had an arthroscopy, washout, debridement of osteochondral tibial defect and diathermy of suspected bleeding point. This report supports the peripheral arteries supplying the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus as the source of bleeding in spontaneous haemarthrosis of the knee.

### Management of haemarthrosis in patients on oral anticoagulants [^8d6946d1]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The current published literature advises anticoagulant-associated haemarthrosis should be managed by applying RICE principles, holding anticoagulation and considering aspiration of the affected joint. The lack of consensus for the management of anticoagulation-associated haemarthrosis is reflected in the range of strategies described here. Holding anticoagulation did not have a significant impact on the length of patient stay in this observational study. This study highlighted the infrequent use of aspiration as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in our institution. We conclude that aspiration should be used as a diagnostic tool to exclude infection or crystal arthropathy when the diagnosis is unclear. It can also be used as a therapeutic tool when the patients' anticoagulation has been held and their clotting function has returned to normal. Future prospective work would be valuable to help guide clinical practice and aid in developing formal practice guidelines.

### Accuracy and efficacy of intra-articular knee injections / aspirations under ultrasound versus landmark guidance: a systematic review [^f1e1c49e]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To review the current literature on the accuracy and efficacy of ultrasound (US)- and landmark (LM)-guided intra-articular knee injections.

Methods

A systematic review was performed following the Cochrane process from April 2023 to August 2023 utilizing PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. Branched logic was used to include articles containing terms regarding the knee AND ultrasound AND injections. Two authors screened studies for eligibility, and any disagreement was resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. Risk-of-bias assessments were performed.

Results

A total of 13 studies were included in the review. Cumulative accuracies amounted to 95.4% (356/373) versus 82.0% (268/327) for US-guided and LM-guided intra-articular knee injections/aspirations, respectively. All but one study looking at efficacy showed significantly improved outcomes in the US-guided injection/aspiration groups.

Conclusions

This systematic review provides data to support that US-guided intra-articular knee injections/aspirations are more accurate and efficacious than LM-guided intra-articular knee injections/aspirations.

Level Of Evidence

Level I - systematic review.

This Summary of Recommendations of the AAOS Management of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries: Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guideline contains a list of evidence-based prognostic and treatment recommendations (Table 1). Discussions of how each recommendation was developed and the complete evidence report are contained in the full guideline at. Readers are urged to consult the full guideline for the comprehensive evaluation of the available scientific studies. The recommendations were established using methods of evidence-based medicine that rigorously control for bias, enhance transparency, and promote reproducibility. An exhaustive literature search was conducted resulting initially in more than 1,100 papers for full review. The papers were then graded for quality and aligned with the work group's patients, interventions, and outcomes of concern. For CPG PICO (ie, population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) questions that returned no evidence from the systematic literature review, the work group used the established AAOS CPG methodology to generate one companion consensus statement that physicians may consider aspirating painful, tense effusions after knee injury with likely or confirmed ACL tear.

The Summary of Recommendations is not intended to stand alone. Medical care should be based on evidence, a physician's expert judgement, and the patient's circumstances, values, preferences, and rights. A patient-centered discussion understanding an individual patient's values and preferences can inform appropriate decision-making. The recommendations regarding the treatment of ACL tears are primarily focused on younger, more active individuals. Recommendations regarding surgical treatment are principally based on literature studying ACL tears as an isolated ligamentous injury rather than a multiligamentous injury (except for isolated ACL and MCL injury). A variety of mitigating circumstances, particularly related to patient age, preinjury activity, symptoms, and desired level of postinjury activity, may also be factors in the shared decision-making process.

A Strong recommendation means that the quality of the supporting evidence is high. A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the quality/applicability of the supporting evidence is not as strong. A Limited option means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. A Consensus option means that expert opinion supports the guideline recommendation, although there is no available realistic evidence that meets the inclusion criteria of the guideline's systematic review.

### The use of injectable orthobiologics for knee osteoarthritis: a formal ESSKA-ORBIT consensus. part 2-cell-based therapy [^1077c75b]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

QUESTION 5

Could CBT for knee OA be used during the inflammatory phase when joint effusion is present (following effusion aspiration)?

Current clinical evidence is lacking regarding the injection of CBT during the inflammatory phase in knee OA, as well as with regard to effusion aspiration prior to CBT injection.

However, multiple basic science studies have shown anti‐inflammatory properties of CBT, which could support the rationale for its use during the inflammatory phase. While evidence is lacking with regard to the optimal timing of CBT injection for knee OA when effusion is present, the consensus group recognizes that when present, effusion aspiration is likely beneficial in pain improvement and relieving functional limitations and also avoids dilution of the injected CBT product. In addition, it could aid in replacing the inflammatory infiltrate in the knee with a more favourable one with anti‐inflammatory properties.

Grade of recommendation: D

Rating Score: Mean 8.1 ± 0.9; Median: 8 (6–9) Appropriate with relative agreement

This statement is valid for both POC‐ and Expanded‐CBT.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in remote environments: 2014 update [^09ac988b]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society acute pain guidelines — local and regional anesthesia: Local anesthesia can provide a safe and effective means of analgesia for the injured patient in the wilderness, with nerve blocks used for fractures, soft tissue trauma, and procedures including removal of foreign bodies and suturing; attention needs to be paid to avoid intravascular injection by aspiration before injection and to stay within recommended dosing to avoid life-threatening toxicity. With appropriate expertise, regional blocks that can be provided include digital block, hematoma block, intercostal block, and distal nerve block, and prehospital femoral nerve blocks for femur fracture have been shown to be a safe and effective method of acute pain control when performed by experienced physicians. Recommendation: Local anesthetics are a safe and effective option for controlling acute pain in the remote or wilderness setting. Recommendation grade: 1B.

### Emergency joint aspiration: a guide for radiologists on call [^11bcb271]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis is a disabling and possibly life-threatening disease that requires early diagnosis for optimal management. It is important that clinical and imaging features of septic arthritis be promptly identified. In addition, because other disease entities may have characteristics similar to those of septic arthritis, analysis of a needle biopsy specimen may be necessary for differential diagnosis. Radiologists may be asked to perform emergent aspiration of a possibly infected joint. It is important that those who perform aspiration procedures be familiar with a safe and effective imaging-guided arthrocentesis technique that is tailored to the individual patient and the specific joint affected.

### Does a simple needle stick from a preoperative knee aspiration or non-steroidal injection influence total knee arthroplasty infection risk? A retrospective database analysis [^759f1aa1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-articular injections (IAI) of corticosteroids administered within six months before total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have been linked to an increased risk of post-TKA infection. The local immunosuppressive response to undissolved corticosteroids and disruption of the joint's physical barrier are proposed mechanisms to augment the risk of infection. However, it remains unclear whether simple aspirations with or without non-corticosteroid injection medications pose similar risks. This study explored the association between the timing of non-corticosteroid IAIs administered before TKA and the increased risk of infection.

Methods

A national claims database containing > 42 million inpatient records was queried to retrieve TKA claims between 2017 and 2022. Patient records were examined during the perioperative period for IAI treatments. These include platelet-rich plasma (PRP), stem cell therapy, ketorolac, and simple aspiration without corticosteroids. Patient records were stratified based on the timing of the most recent injection, distinguishing between six-month, three-month, and one-month intervals. The primary outcome assessed was the incidence and risk of infections necessitating surgical debridement within one year of the index TKA procedure.

Results

A total of 232,342 patient records were retrieved, of which 8,019 (3.5%) patients received prior IAI within six months of TKA. The rate of infection requiring surgical debridement was the highest in patients receiving aspiration/injection within one month of their index (7.6%), followed by those receiving IAI within three months (4.6%) and six months (2.2%), with the lowest incidence in those who had not received injections within six months (1.4%) (Table 2).

Conclusions

Even when immunosuppressive medications, such as corticosteroids, are removed, the odds of infection remain high in patients receiving IAIs/aspiration before TKA, particularly when administered within three months of the procedure. Therefore, surgeons should consider postponing surgery for up to three months, regardless of the content of IAIs.

### Early return to surgery for evacuation of a postoperative hematoma after primary total knee arthroplasty [^81ae5fab]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Development of a postoperative hematoma is a reported complication after primary total knee arthroplasty. However, little is known about the clinical outcomes in patients who require surgical evacuation of an acute hematoma. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and long-term sequelae of postoperative hematomas requiring surgical evacuation.

Methods

From 1981 to 2004, 17,784 primary total knee arthroplasties were performed at our institution. Forty-two patients (forty-two knees) returned to the operating room within thirty days of the index arthroplasty for evacuation of a postoperative hematoma. A case-control study, with forty-two patients matched one-to-one with forty-two control subjects, was performed to attempt to identify risk factors for the development of postoperative hematoma requiring surgical evacuation.

Results

The rate of return to surgery within thirty days for evacuation of a postoperative hematoma was 0.24% (95% confidence interval, 0.17% to 0.32%). For patients undergoing postoperative hematoma evacuation, the two-year cumulative probabilities of undergoing subsequent major surgery (component resection, muscle flap coverage, or amputation) or having a deep infection develop were 12.3% (95% confidence interval, 1.6% to 22.4%) and 10.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.2% to 20.2%), respectively. In contrast, for knees without early hematoma evacuation, the two-year cumulative probabilities were 0.6% (95% confidence interval, 0.5% to 0.7%) and 0.8% (95% confidence interval, 0.6% to 0.9%), respectively (p < 0.001 for both outcomes). A history of a bleeding disorder was identified as having a significant association with the development of a hematoma requiring surgical evacuation (p = 0.046).

Conclusions

Patients who return to the operating room within thirty days after the index total knee arthroplasty for evacuation of a postoperative hematoma are at significantly increased risk for the development of deep infection and/or undergoing subsequent major surgery. These results support all efforts to minimize the risk of postoperative hematoma formation.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^70156f55]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Performance standards and indications for ultrasound guidance — For all ultrasound-guided procedures, the usual standards for interventional procedures apply, including review of prior imaging, appropriate informed consent, site marking as appropriate, use of a local anesthetic as appropriate, and use of aseptic technique. Common procedures performed using ultrasound guidance include injection or aspiration of joints, tendons, or tendon sheaths; aspiration of cysts, fluid collections, and abscesses; peripheral nerve blocks/perineural injections; lavage and aspiration of tendon calcifications; fine-needle aspiration and biopsy; and foreign body retrieval. In general, ultrasound guidance is indicated during these procedures when accuracy is paramount for diagnosis, to ensure therapeutic efficacy or procedural success, or to reduce procedural risk.

### The painful total knee arthroplasty [^fba02319]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

There are many causes of residual pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Evaluation and management begins with a comprehensive history and physical examination, followed by radiographic evaluation of the replaced and adjacent joints, as well as previous films of the replaced joint. Further workup includes laboratory analysis, along with a synovial fluid aspirate to evaluate the white blood cell count with differential as well as culture. Advanced imaging modalities may be beneficial when the diagnosis remains unclear. Revision surgery is not advisable without a clear diagnosis, as it may be associated with poor results.

### Recurrent hemarthrosis after total knee arthroplasty [^711d4a7f]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The importance of the current report lies in the recognition of an arteriography as a possible tool to identify the cause of the hemarthrosis and subsequently in the acceptation of a treatment algorithm for unexplained hemarthrosis after total knee arthroplasty.

Recurrent hemarthrosis after total knee arthroplasty occurs in less than 1%, but if it is does occur it seriously jeopardizes the postoperative outcome. Rapid diagnosis and adequate treatment are crucial to avoid permanent limitations of movement.

There are various causes of recurrent hemarthrosis. Intraoperative injury to the vessels may go unnoticed. Another frequent cause of recurrent hemorrhaging is the entrapment of synovial tissue or Hoffa's fat pad-Impingement between the prothetic joint components. This produces the classical signs of ischemia and symptoms may be interpreted as deep crural thrombosis.

Unexplained recurrent hemarthrosis after total knee arthroplasty should be treated in stages: In every case needle aspiration for relief of pain and stiffness should be performed at first, also to confirm the diagnosis. Aspiration of the effusion followed by conservative methods (cooling, elevation, and rest) will prevent in most cases further hemorrhage. If conservative treatment is not successful, as next step a femoral arteriography should be considered to obtain further clarification. Femoral arteriography is a very profitable investigation in the search for the source of bleeding and immediate embolization (arteriovenous fistulae, aneurysms). Embolization of the source of bleeding via the in situ catheter is a straightforward and effective method. In our presented case, the third hemarthros could probably have been prevented when we would have taken this step before the arthroscopic evaluation. The embolization has significant advantages compared to an arthroscopic or open surgical revision: local anesthesia only, minimal risk of infection and subsequent rapid mobilization of the knee, which is essential for the clinical outcome. If embolization is unsuccessful, arthroscopy is the next step, because it is both a diagnostic and a therapeutic instrument. Entrapped tissue and any sources of bleeding can then be localized and treated, using a vaper. If this approach is unsuccessful an open synovectomy is indicated; thus only when the cause of recurrent hemarthrosis remains unclear after the previously mentioned steps have been conducted.

### Use and safety of corticosteroid injections in joints and musculoskeletal soft tissue: guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^18ac70f9]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Knee intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) — landmark versus ultrasound guidance performance is summarized: Accuracy for landmark-based approaches was 75% with the anteromedial approach and 93% with the lateral-midpatellar approach. In a randomized comparison of knee aspiration followed by IA CSI, USG injections resulted in greater improvement in pain indexes and better patient satisfaction and quality of life scales after 4 weeks, and USG knee joint aspiration and injection resulted in significantly less procedural pain, less extravasation of fluid, and improved needle joint decompression; similar positive and improved clinical outcomes were noted at 6 months, but USG did not offer better accuracy in the knee joint than landmark techniques.

### Is single-stage revision according to a strict protocol effective in treatment of chronic knee arthroplasty infections? [^b362029d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

A decision to perform surgery was based on either growing a microorganism from the tissue aspiration/biopsies or presence of a sinus tract communicating with the prosthesis. A microorganism was identified preoperatively in all single-stage patients and in 65 of the two-stage patients, whereas the remaining nine patients were identified postoperatively only despite the presence of a discharging sinus in five patients. The remaining four patients had compelling evidence of PJI with elevated inflammatory markers, loose prostheses, and purulence on aspiration of the joints despite the absence of an isolated microorganism.

We graded all patients according to a standardized protocol for chronic hip and knee PJIs based on the criteria previously set out by Haddad et al. and considered them for either a single- or two-stage revision procedure accordingly (Table 1). The indications for using a single-stage approach during the period in question included (1) insignificant bone loss (eg, Anderson Type I and II defects) or a soft tissue defect that could be closed primarily; (2) nonimmunosuppressed hosts: patients who are not rheumatoid or diabetic or on immunosuppressant medication and did not have ongoing sepsis elsewhere or chronic disease such as anemia or cancer; and (3) isolation of a single low virulent organism preoperatively, which is sensitive to bactericidal antibiotic treatment. Hence, we excluded polymicrobial infections and multiresistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and included appropriate patients only after discussion with our microbiologist colleagues. If patients had any of the contraindications (Table 1), they underwent a two-stage revision instead.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European society of musculoskeletal radiology (ESSR)-part V, knee [^15c2bb59]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Interventional procedures around the knee are widely utilized to treat different musculoskeletal conditions. Some of these interventions (e.g. injections or aspirations) are often performed without image guidance, particularly by orthopedists. However, image guidance ensures correct needle position for optimal medication delivery, avoiding injuries to adjacent neurovascular bundles. Currently, image guidance for musculoskeletal procedures around the knee has not been incorporated into established guidelines, due to sparse and contentious evidence on its clinical impact in the literature. Moreover, the choice of the procedure is debatable, as new approaches, such as the use of hyaluronic acid (HA) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), have been recently introduced to treat both joint and tendon conditions. Accordingly, the Ultrasound (US) and Interventional Subcommittees of the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR), together with its Research Committee, initiated in 2019 a collaborative task dedicated to reviewing the existing literature on image-guided musculoskeletal interventional procedures in the lower limb and providing evidence for its clinical indications. This paper reports the list of statements provided by an expert panel of the ESSR and obtained by a Delphi process on published literature evaluating image-guided interventions around the knee.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^482bc0be]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound-guided joint aspiration and injection — technique selection states that ultrasound guidance for needle placement into a joint may be performed using a direct or indirect technique, where during the direct technique, the clinician uses real-time ultrasound guidance to place the needle into the joint, and in the indirect technique, the needle is not visualized entering the joint in real time; although the use of either technique may be appropriate in specific clinical circumstances, the direct technique is preferred due to the ability to visualize the needle in real time throughout the procedure.

### Is there an optimal cutoff for aspiration fluid volume in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection? [^0af77c59]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection is often challenging in the setting of low aspiration volumes, or in the presence of infection with a slow-growing organism. We sought to determine if an optimal threshold of aspiration fluid volume exists when cultures from the preoperative aspiration are compared to intraoperative cultures.

Methods

All revision total hip and knee arthroplasty procedures over 5 years at our institution were reviewed. Cases were excluded if they underwent joint lavage during aspiration, had an antibiotic spacer in place, were suspected of adverse local tissue reaction to metal debris, did not have an accurate aspiration volume recorded, or if there were no aspiration or operative cultures available. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate aspiration volume for identifying cases with identical aspiration and culture results.

Results

A total of 857 revision cases were reviewed, among which 294 met inclusion criteria. There were 45 cases (15.3%) with discordant aspiration and operative cultures. The mean aspiration volume for identical cases was significantly higher than for discordant cases (19.1 vs 10.2 mL, P = 0.02). The proportion of slow-growing organisms was significantly greater among discordant compared to identical operative cultures (52.4% for discordant cases vs 8.2% for identical cases, P < .001). The optimal cutoff value for predicting identical cultures was 3.5 mL for typical organisms and 12.5 mL for slow-growing organisms.

Conclusion

Aspiration cultures are more likely to correlate with intraoperative cultures with higher aspiration volumes, and the optimal aspiration volume is higher for slow-growing organisms.

### Are orthopaedic residents competent at performing basic nonoperative procedures in an unsupervised setting? A "Pop quiz" of casting, knee arthrocentesis, and pressure checks for compartment syndrome [^cb4700bb]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Many patient care procedures are routinely performed by orthopaedic residents while not directly supervised by attending physicians. However, resident competence to perform these procedures is often presumed and not confirmed by objective measures. The purpose of this study was to formally evaluate 3 basic pediatric orthopaedic procedures commonly performed without attending supervision.

Methods

All orthopaedic residents (n = 20) were asked to complete 3 procedures (placement and removal of a short arm cast, aspiration of a knee joint, and compartment pressure checks of a leg) under direct attending supervision. Attending faculty developed a checklist for each procedure, listing the appropriate steps required and criteria with which to assess the final results. Scores were calculated, including means and SDs. Change in score by postgraduate year level was determined by simple linear regression.

Results

The mean score for short arm cast application and removal was 6.2 of a total possible score of 8, with an average 1.1 increase in score per year of training (P < 0.001). Uneven cast padding and lack of full thumb motion were the most common reasons for losing points. Knee joint aspiration had an average score of 6.2 of 7, with an average increase in score of 0.3 per year of training (P = 0.046). Lack of equipment preparation and not donning gloves in a sterile manner were the most common reasons for losing points. Measure of leg compartment pressures had an average score of 9.7 of 12, with an average increase in score of 0.5 per increase in year of training (P = 0.087). Injecting an inappropriate amount of fluid and not recording measurements were the most common reasons for losing points.

Conclusions

The ability of a resident to appropriately perform certain procedures without direct supervision improves with advancing level of training. The most junior residents might not appropriately be placing short arm casts, aspirating knee joints, or checking compartment pressures of the leg.

### Value of ultrasound before joint aspiration [^4eaef7c4]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to illustrate and discuss the value of ultra-sound screening before joint aspiration.

Conclusion

Before joint aspiration, ultrasound assessment of the overlying and surrounding soft tissues requires little time and is relatively inexpensive. Bursal fluid collections, soft-tissue abscesses, and other fluid collections that would be undetected with fluoroscopy or blind aspiration can thus be identified. Ultrasound screening before joint aspiration can aid diagnosis and decrease the risk of iatrogenic complications.

### 1, 000 consecutive cases of laser-assisted liposuction and suction-assisted lipectomy managed with local anesthesia [^0298e2a6]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Advances in suction-assisted lipectomy (SAL) include improved instrumentation, better understanding of fluid dynamics, and an improved concept of appropriate indications. The tumescent technique uses subcutaneous injection of isotonic fluid containing vasoconstrictive and analgesic agents and is proved to be safe, with low morbidity and mortality rates. Laser-assisted liposuction (LAL) using local infiltration of an anesthetic and no general anesthesia or sedation has been developed, with claims of fat destruction and skin tightening. This study aimed to review 1,000 consecutive cases of LAL and SAL performed with the patient under local anesthesia and to determine whether this represents a safe technique with few complications.

Methods

During a period of 22 months, 581 consecutive patients (486 females and 95 males) underwent 1,000 LAL/SAL operations, 545 of whom had multiple procedures performed. None of the patients had a body mass index (BMI) higher than 30 kg/m². The patients ranged in age from 18 to 62 years. The fat aspirate ranged from 50 to 1,400 ml. Patients were given an oral sedative, an antibiotic, and an analgesic. Ringer's lactate solution containing lidocaine and epinephrine was injected into the subcutaneous space. The 1,064-nm and/or 1,320-nm neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used for laser lipolysis followed by SAL using standard and/or power-assisted liposuction (PAL) cannulas. The treated areas included the neck, triceps, male breast, midback, flanks, axilla, abdomen, mons pubis, thighs, presacrum, and knees. No patient was administered intravenous sedation or general anesthesia.

Results

The average number of areas treated was 1.8, and no major complications or mortalities were observed. There were three burns, two infections, one hematoma, and one seroma. A total of 73 secondary procedures were performed (7.3%). No tertiary procedures were required.

Conclusion

For appropriately selected patients, comparable results can be obtained with an excellent safety profile and short recovery period using LAL and SAL with the patient under local anesthesia. The awake patient is able to participate in body positioning and to provide physiologic monitoring. No major complications occurred in this series. The burn and hematoma complications occurred in the first 25 cases and may have been related to a learning curve. One case of cellulitis occurred in the triceps region, and a second infection occurred in the abdomen. Both responded to antibiotics. Altogether, 73 touch-up procedures (7.3%) were performed. The amounts of fat removal were comparable with the volumes obtained using traditional liposuction. In conclusion, this series demonstrated that LAL/SAL using local anesthesia is a safe procedure for selected patients, with acceptably low morbidity and revision rates.

### Diagnostic testing… [^ef4ba8e7]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

10 Recent research using clinical decision rules for the use of radiography in acutely injured knees has identified historical and examination criteria that reduce the need for radiography. 11 These criteria include the inability to bear weight, presence of effusion and ecchymosis. If all these clinical criteria were absent, the sensitivity for excluding fracture was 100 percent. Other groups have developed similar rules, the most well-known being the "Ottawa rule, " which has similar sensitivity.
12. Diagnostic Testing Arthrocentesis can be used as a diagnostic tool and a therapeutic procedure. Knee swelling within four to six hours of injury is indicative of hemarthrosis. Not all effusions require aspiration, although drainage of the bloody effusion provides symptomatic relief, improves examination accuracy and confirms injury severity.

Arthrocentesis should be performed in patients with knee effusion without a history of trauma and with a clinical suspicion of infectious etiology. Arthrocentesis can be accomplished quickly and easily with minimal patient discomfort. The knee is prepared in sterile fashion and anesthetized with local anesthetic to facilitate the use of a large-bore needle. The choice of the site of aspiration is a matter of operator preference. Accepted locations include the level of the joint line, 1 cm medial or lateral to the patellar tendon, with the patient seated. Alternatively, a location 2 cm medial or lateral to the anterior-superior patella can be used, with the patient supine. An 18-gauge needle is needed for aspiration of the viscous or bloody fluid. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication.

The fluid obtained from arthrocentesis should be sent for analysis, although a hemarthrosis associated with acute injury is often evacuated only for patient comfort. A hemarthrosis without associated trauma may well be the result of hemophilia, synovioma, pigmented villonodular synovitis or oral anticoagulant therapy. 3 suggest an inflammatory process. More importantly, serum laboratory testing often reveals markers of rheumatic disease. Radiographs often reveal a specific pattern based on the disease process. Rheumatoid arthritis leads to characteristic marginal erosions and osteopenia about the affected joint.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European society of musculoskeletal radiology (ESSR)-part V, knee [^70a6a7ca]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Intra-articular US-guided procedures around the knee joint, such as arthrocentesis and intra-articular injections, are more accurate than palpation-guided procedures, resulting in improved fluid aspiration and injection therapeutic outcome(s).

Level of evidence, 1

Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100%

A systematic review reported that image-guided and particularly US-guided knee injections are more accurate than palpation-guided procedures. A randomized trial also reported superior accuracy of the US-guided technique performed by trainees as compared with palpation-guided procedures performed by experienced clinicians. Accuracy rates were high (95–100%) and similar when injecting the joint through in-plane superolateral, mid-lateral, and mid-medial approaches. Accuracy rates were also high (95%) using an out-of-plane technique with mid-lateral and mid-medial approaches — although some authors reported that an out-of-plane mid-medial approach could result in decreased accuracy. Similarly, accuracy rates of US-guided knee arthrocentesis have been reported to be superior to palpation guidance. Most studies reported superior injection benefits and + 183% improved joint aspiration with improved 2-week outcome using US-guided rather than palpation-guided procedures. Randomized trials comparing US-guided and palpation-guided corticosteroid intra-articular injections reported pain reduction at 2-week follow-up, 107% increase in the responder rate, and 36% increase in therapeutic duration with subsequent cost reduction, using US guidance. In knee osteoarthritis treated with HA injections, the use of US guidance resulted in enhanced functional and pain-score improvement after 6 and 12 weeks, with long-term decreased knee arthroplasty rate when compared to palpation guidance. In emergency settings, both blind and US-guided arthrocentesis were successful, although the latter led to higher volume aspiration for novice practitioners.
2 US-guided knee joint injections of corticosteroid-anesthetic give short-to-midterm pain relief and functional improvement in inflammatory arthritis. Although similar outcomes may be observed in osteoarthritis, efficacy is controversial, and alternative analgesic therapies (such as oxygen-ozone) have been proposed, but evidence supporting their use remains limited.

### Injections of the hip and knee [^3c82ecd7]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Hip and knee injections are useful diagnostic and therapeutic tools for family physicians. This article reviews anatomic landmark-guided and ultrasound-guided injections and aspiration techniques for greater trochanteric pain syndrome, the hip joint, the knee joint, the pes anserine bursa, and the iliotibial band. Indications for injections include acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis; overuse; and traumas. Joint aspirations may be performed to aid in the diagnosis of unexplained effusions and to relieve pain. Technique, injectant, and follow-up timing depend on the physician's comfort, experience, and preference. Infections of the skin or soft tissue are the primary contraindications to injections. The most common complications are local inflammatory reactions to the injectant. These reactions usually cause soreness for 24 to 48 hours, then spontaneously resolve. Follow-up after injections is usually scheduled within two to six weeks.

### Ultrasound of musculoskeletal hematomas: relationship of sonographic appearance to age and ease of aspiration [^395bfc46]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided aspiration of musculoskeletal hematomas, evaluate the associations between the sonographic appearance of hematomas and their age with ease of aspiration, and determine if there is an optimal time frame for aspiration.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective search of our radiology database was conducted using the keywords "hematoma" and "aspiration" for procedures performed from January 1, 2008, through September 28, 2017, by three fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists. Associations between the ease of aspiration and echotexture of the hematoma and between the ease of aspiration and age of the hematoma were assessed with a marginal ordinal logistic regression model to account for patient-level clusters. Pairwise comparisons of the ease of aspiration between the different echotextures were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Tukey-Kramer method. This same method was also used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for the age of the hematoma and ease of aspiration and decompression. Clinical follow-up was assessed for infection and symptomatic relief.

Results

The cohort was composed of 148 patients (77 male and 71 female patients) with a mean age of 48 years (age range, 16–80 years). One hundred patients underwent clinical follow-up: There were no instances of infection and all patients reported symptomatic relief. Marginal proportional odds model showed an OR of 3.77 when comparing the ease of aspiration between hypoechoic hematomas and hematomas showing the other echotextures combined (i.e., complex, heterogeneous, echo-genic), which was statistically significant (p = 0.010). The OR of the ease of aspiration in relation to the age of a hematoma for each additional week was 1.03 with a p value of 0.547, which shows that there is no correlation between the age of the hematoma and ease of aspiration.

Conclusion

Ultrasound-guided aspiration of hematomas is a safe and effective procedure. The sonographic appearance of a hematoma is unrelated to its age. Although a hematoma with a hypoechoic appearance is easier to aspirate than hematomas with other echotextures, the appearance and age of a hematoma should not dissuade one from trying to aspirate it.

### When polyethylene exchange is appropriate for prosthetic knee instability [^3f1ba623]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Prosthetic knee instability is a common cause of patient dissatisfaction and early failure after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Technical considerations account for most of these problems. The symptoms of prosthetic knee instability include catching, giving way, anterior knee pain, pes bursitis, and the inability to trust the knee in daily activities. Recurrent effusions are common with a predominance of red blood cells on aspiration. Whereas prosthetic knee instability is a common cause of patient dissatisfaction after knee replacement, strategies to manage such instability are dependent on the recognition of the presenting instability pattern. Some instability patterns require full revision, whereas others can be managed by polyethylene exchange (PE) only.

Whether PE only is ever appropriate in the treatment of such patients remains controversial. Babis et alreviewed 27 cases of isolated poly exchange for periprosthetic knee instability and found 12 of these 27 cases to have persistent pain. They concluded that "isolated tibial insert exchange should be undertaken with caution". Jensen et al. reported on 27 patients quoting 80% survival, whereas Brooks et al. and Konrads et al. reported success rates of 71% and 72%, respectively.

Such mediocre results with isolated poly exchange were echoed by Baker et alwho reviewed 45 knees treated with isolated poly exchange for prosthetic instability. At an average follow-up of nearly 5 years, only 58% had successful clinical results. They concluded that "if selected appropriately, isolated liner exchange can significantly improve the function". Intuitively, its use should be dictated by the type of instability pattern present; however, no instability classification system exists which would guide the appropriate use of PE only. Therefore, these less than optimal results may be related to the inappropriate use of this treatment alternative rather than the treatment alternative itself.

This study classifies a series of patients where PE only was used to manage an unstable TKA and reports on the results of this treatment alternative.

### Morel-lavallée lesion: what you need to know [^cc0a3c48]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The Morel-Lavallée lesion (MLL) is a rare closed degloving injury resulting from traumatic shearing forces that separate subcutaneous tissue from underlying fascia, creating a cavity filled with blood, lymph, and inflammatory exudate. Typically occurring in regions where skin can glide significantly over rigid structures, such as the thigh, MLLs present as fluctuant, boggy, sometimes painful lesions, which result from disrupted lymphatic and vascular structures. The lesion evolves through an inflammatory cascade leading to eventual encapsulation by dense fibrotic tissue. While the diagnosis is primarily clinical, imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, assists in confirming lesion presence, assessing chronicity, and differentiating MLLs from other pathologies such as bursitis, hematomas, and sarcomas. Treatment strategies range from conservative approaches, including compression and aspiration for smaller lesions, progressing to minimally invasive procedures, such as percutaneous drainage and sclerotherapy, to operative intervention involving open drainage and debridement for larger, recurrent, or infected collections. Future advancements in standardized treatment guidelines, novel imaging modalities, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation are crucial for improving early recognition, therapeutic outcomes, and minimizing morbidity associated with MLLs.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic injection of the hip and knee [^fd171bf3]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Joint injection of the hip and knee regions is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the family physician. In this article, the injection procedure for the greater trochanteric bursa, the knee joint, the pes anserine bursa, the iliotibial band, and the prepatellar bursa is reviewed. Indications for greater trochanteric bursa injection include acute and chronic inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, repetitive use, and other traumatic injuries to the area. For the knee joint, aspiration may be performed to aid in the diagnosis of an unexplained effusion and relieve discomfort caused by an effusion. Injection of the knee can be performed for viscosupplementation or corticosteroid therapy. Indications for corticosteroid injection include advanced osteoarthritis and other inflammatory arthritides, such as gout or calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. Swelling and tenderness of pes anserine or prepatellar bursae can be relieved with aspiration and corticosteroid injection. Persistent pain and disability from iliotibial band syndrome respond to local injection therapy. The proper technique, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up are essential for effective outcomes.

### Joint and soft tissue injections [^ff90670c]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Joint and soft tissue injections can be divided into two primary categories: diagnostic and therapeutic. Diagnostic injections facilitate a diagnosis by using a local anesthetic to identify the site of pain or through fluid aspiration for analysis. Therapeutic injections are categorized by the type of injectate and include corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, dextrose prolotherapy, and platelet-rich plasma. Diagnostic and therapeutic injections are most accurate under direct visualization. Corticosteroid injections help treat adhesive capsulitis and tenosynovitis but are not recommended for intratendinous injections. Hyaluronic acid has limited benefits for knee osteoarthritis. Dextrose prolotherapy injections treat tendinopathy and degenerative joint pain. Platelet-rich plasma injections effectively treat common extensor tendinopathy and knee arthritis; however, the evidence does not support its use for other soft tissue injuries. Preparation for injections includes patient education, consent, proper patient positioning, and obtaining the necessary supplies. Local infection, fractures, and allergy to injection substrates are contraindications to joint and soft tissue injections. Potential complications include pain, swelling, and redness. Corticosteroid injections into soft tissue may cause atrophy and depigmentation, and repeated injections can cause cartilage and tendon degeneration. Optimizing conservative, noninjection treatments, such as oral and topical analgesics, activity modification, or rehabilitation, is also important.

### Subcutaneous versus intraarticular indwelling closed suction drainage after TKA: a randomized controlled trial [^8d933cb8]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

TKA can involve substantial bleeding, and the issue regarding whether vacuum drainage should be used during TKA continues to be debated as both methods have disadvantages.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore asked whether subcutaneous indwelling vacuum drainage is advantageous over intraarticular indwelling vacuum drainage in terms of blood drainage, bleeding-related complications, and functional outcomes in primary TKA.

Patients and Methods

We randomized 111 patients undergoing TKAs to have either a subcutaneous indwelling or an intraarticular indwelling catheter and compared the two groups for blood loss (hemoglobin decrease, transfusion requirements, hypotension episode), incidence of wound problems (requirements for dressing reinforcement, oozing, hematoma, hemarthrosis, ecchymosis, infection), and functional outcomes (recovery of motion arc, American Knee Society, WOMAC, and SF-36 scores) at 12 months after surgery.

Results

The mean vacuum drainage volume was less in the subcutaneous indwelling group than in the intraarticular indwelling group (140 mL versus 352 mL). The groups were similar in terms of decreases in hemoglobin after 2 and 5 days (3.0 versus 3.3 g/dL and 3.3 versus 3.7 g/dL, respectively), allogenic transfusion requirements (4% versus 11%), incidence of wound problems, and functional scores.

Conclusions

The data suggest subcutaneous indwelling closed-suction drainage is a reasonable alternative to intraarticular indwelling closed-suction drainage and to no suction drainage.

### Evaluation of painful total knee arthroplasty [^bc964730]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2004). Low credibility.

Numerous conditions exist that may cause pain following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that can be categorized into articular versus nonarticular etiologies. To critically evaluate the painful TKA, the treating physician must perform a thorough history and physical examination, as well as both laboratory and radiographic testing. Laboratory analysis is directed to differentiate septic versus aseptic etiologies of knee pain and commonly includes assessment of white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and knee aspiration for cell count and cultures. Available radiographic tools include plain radiographs, stress views, arthrography, nuclear scanning, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. In cases of unexplained pain, reoperation is unwise and frequently associated with suboptimal results. Periodic repeat evaluations are recommended until the etiology of pain is clearly determined.

### Clinical and molecular associations with outcomes at 2 years after acute knee injury: a longitudinal study in the knee injury cohort at the Kennedy (KICK) [^c26c4a2d]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Results

184 individuals were assessed for eligibility between Nov 1, 2010, and Nov 28, 2014. 34 (18%) were excluded; one exceeded the age limit of 50 years, one had knee injury more than 8 weeks before screening, and 32 declined to take part (appendix p 22). The remaining 150 individuals were recruited at a median of 17 days (range 1–59, IQR 9–26) after knee injury. 145 individuals in our study underwent knee surgery that included washout at a median of 17 days (maximum 51 days) after injury (appendix p 2).

Before injury, 114 (76%) of 150 participants were sports professionals (ie, Tegner activity score of ≥ 9), and the remaining participants were active amateur sportspeople (ie, a Tegner score of 6–8; table 1). 143 (95%) participants sustained their injury during sporting activity, predominantly football or rugby. 75 (50%) of 149 participants had a medium-to-large clinical effusion detected clinically at their baseline assessment. Of the 136 participants who had synovial fluid aspirated at baseline, 50 (37%) had moderate or severe blood staining consistent with haemarthrosis (appendix p 6). 99 (66%) of 150 participants had knee x-rays during the baseline period: 64 (43%) of 150 participants had KLG 0 or 1 and 35 (23%) had KLG 2. The remaining 51 (34%) individuals had no evidence of established knee osteoarthritis on MRI at baseline.

### Editorial commentary: synovial fluid white blood cell is the gold standard to detect infection after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: don't hesitate to aspirate [^9476234d]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Infection after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction can have devastating consequences, including potential graft loss, arthrofibrosis, chondral destruction or chondrolysis, and secondary osteoarthritis. Early detection and aggressive management are imperative to improve the chances of infection eradication, graft retention, and to decrease the risk of chondral loss. One must have a high index of suspicion and not shy away from working up a possible infection. Synovial fluid aspiration and cell count, specifically white blood cell count, is the gold standard to diagnose postoperative infection.

### Closed suction drainage for hip and knee arthroplasty. A meta-analysis [^9487fd8f]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The use of closed-suction drainage systems after total joint replacement is a common practice. The theoretical advantages for the use of drains is a reduction in the occurrence of wound hematomas and infection. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine, on the basis of the evidence from randomized controlled trials, the advantages and adverse effects of surgical drains.

Methods

All randomized trials, as far as we know, that compared patients managed with closed-suction drainage systems and those managed without a drain following elective hip and knee arthroplasty were considered. The trials were identified with use of searches of the Cochrane Collaboration with no restriction on languages or source. Two authors independently extracted the data, and the methods of all identified trials were assessed.

Results

Eighteen studies involving 3495 patients with 3689 wounds were included in the analysis. The pooled results indicated that there was no significant difference between the wounds treated with a drain and those treated without a drain with respect to the occurrence of wound infection (relative risk, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.47 to 1.14), wound hematoma (relative risk, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 4.07), or reoperations for wound complications (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.13 to 1.99). A drained wound was associated with a significantly greater need for transfusion (relative risk, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.19 to 1.72). Reinforcement of wound dressings was required more frequently in the group managed without drains. No difference between the groups was seen with respect to limb-swelling, venous thrombosis, or hospital stay.

Conclusions

Studies to date have indicated that closed suction drainage increases the transfusion requirements after elective hip and knee arthroplasty and has no major benefits. Further randomized trials with use of larger numbers of patients with full reporting of outcomes are indicated before the absence of any benefit, particularly for the outcome of wound infection, can be proved.

### Methylprednisolone acetate (medroloan SUIK) [^e114e5ff]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Suitable sites for intra-articular injection are the knee, ankle, wrist, elbow, shoulder, phalangeal, and hip joints. Since difficulty is not infrequently encountered in entering the hip joint, precautions should be taken to avoid any large blood vessels in the area. Joints not suitable for injection are those that are anatomically inaccessible such as the spinal joints and those like the sacroiliac joints that are devoid of synovial space. Treatment failures are most frequently the result of failure to enter the joint space. Little or no benefit follows injection into surrounding tissue. If failures occur when injections into the synovial spaces are certain, as determined by aspiration of fluid, repeated injections are usually futile.

If a local anesthetic is used prior to injection of methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension, the anesthetic package insert should be read carefully and all the precautions observed.

2. Bursitis. The area around the injection site is prepared in a sterile way and a wheal at the site made with 1 percent procaine hydrochloride solution. A 20 to 24 gauge needle attached to a dry syringe is inserted into the bursa and the fluid aspirated. The needle is left in place and the aspirating syringe changed for a small syringe containing the desired dose. After injection, the needle is withdrawn and a small dressing applied.

### Diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections of the hip and knee [^b61d410a]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

No preferred test for diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection exists, and the algorithm for the workup of patients suspected of infection remains unclear. The work group evaluated the available literature to determine the role of each diagnostic modality and devise a practical algorithm that allows physicians to reach diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection. Ten of the 15 recommendations have strong or moderate evidence in support. These include matters involving erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level testing, knee and hip aspiration, and stopping the use of antibiotics prior to obtaining intra-articular cultures. The group recommends against the use of intraoperative Gram stain but does recommend the use of frozen sections of peri-implant tissues in reoperation patients in whom infection has not been established, as well as multiple cultures in reoperation patients being assessed for infection. The group recommends against initiating antibiotic treatment in patients with suspected infection until after joint cultures have been obtained, but recommends that prophylactic preoperative antibiotics not be withheld in patients at lower probability for infection.

### False-positive cultures after native knee aspiration: true or false [^ed8cf11d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Synovial fluid aspiration is a routine practice used by most orthopaedic surgeons to aid in the diagnosis of joint infection. In patients for whom there is a low pretest probability of infection, a positive culture-particularly if it is a broth-only culture-may be considered a contaminant, especially if the bacterial species are skin pathogens. To our knowledge no study has evaluated the incidence of contamination of aspirations from the native knee.

Questions/Purposes

What is the frequency of false-positive cultures among knee aspirations of the native knee?

Methods

Two hundred patients, with a total of 200 knees, with the diagnosis of degenerative osteoarthritis undergoing a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were identified for this study. None of these patients had symptoms, signs, or laboratory studies to suggest the presence of joint infection; a positive culture in this population therefore would be considered contaminated. Thirty-two (16%) patients were excluded secondary to a dry aspiration. One patient was enrolled in the study but did not have the knee aspirated and another patient's specimen was accidentally discarded. Each knee was aspirated under sterile conditions before performing the TKA. The fluid was sent for cell count and culture. If insufficient fluid was obtained for both cell count and culture, culture was performed rather than cell count.

Results

There were no false-positive cultures (zero of 166 [0%]) in aspirations of native knees.

Conclusions

Our study would indicate that when done properly under sterile technique, cultures taken from knee arthrocentesis in patients without prosthetic joints should not be affected by perceived contaminant species. A positive specimen finding on culture should raise a strong suspicion of bacterial septic arthritis. Future studies should include more specimens as well as knees with prior TKA to help further identify the rate of false-positive cultures in knee arthrocentesis in both populations.

### Total knee arthroplasty infection: significance of delayed aspiration [^e49bbb15]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2002). Low credibility.

The records of 35 patients with total knee arthroplasty infection were reviewed to investigate the significance of delayed aspiration and the success of treatment. In 13 patients, aspiration was performed within 3 months after the onset of symptoms of infection. The median duration of treatment was 243 days, and infection was arrested in all patients. In 22 patients, aspiration was performed > 3 months after the onset of symptoms. The duration of treatment was significantly longer in these patients (P < .001). Persistent infection was recorded in 8 patients, and amputation of the involved leg was done in 3 patients. Aspiration within 3 months after the onset of symptoms of infection significantly reduced the duration of treatment and increased the chances of successfully arresting infection.

Cross-sectional imaging — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography for suspected orthopaedic surgical site infection: There is a lack of data overall; two moderate quality MRI studies in suspected knee prosthesis infection showed moderate-strong "rule in" agreement but poor-moderate "rule out" agreement. Metallic implants can cause significant artifacts that limit detection of adjacent bone and soft tissue infection on MRI as well as on CT, and cross-sectional imaging can potentially be useful to identify soft-tissue fluid collections or to guide aspiration/biopsy, with the value of a given exam considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Tumors masquerading as hematomas [^e438a8e5]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Suboptimal patient management can occur when malignant soft tissue tumors with internal hemorrhage masquerade as simple hematomas. We retrospectively reviewed 31 patients with malignancies who had diagnostic delays averaging 6.7 months (range, 1.0–49.3 months). The diagnoses included soft tissue sarcomas (27), metastatic cancers (three), and lymphoma (one). History of subcutaneous ecchymosis was positive in only five patients (three of whom had trauma), negative in 18, and unknown in eight. Ecchymosis was present in two patients, absent in 20, and unknown in nine. Previous treatments included observation and reassurance (21), aspiration (11), incision and drainage (10), unplanned resections (seven), physical therapy (seven), medication administration (six), and arthroscopy (one). Interpretations of initial MRI (21) and ultrasound (four) did not raise suspicion of underlying cancers. Traumatic hemorrhage usually causes subcutaneous ecchymosis. However, intratumoral hemorrhage often is contained by a pseudocapsule, which prevents fascial plane tracking and subcutaneous ecchymosis, thus providing a diagnostic clue. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound studies may not accurately diagnose questionable lesions. Diagnostic delay or inappropriate treatment may result if patients do not receive appropriate followup, biopsy (usually open), or referral whenever the diagnosis is in doubt.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^6a4cba7c]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound-guided joint procedures — equipment and preprocedure evaluation indicate that clinicians should consider using a small-footprint (hockey stick) transducer in the wrist-hand and ankle-foot region if available, and clinicians should physically examine the target joint before aspiration or injection to identify and localize any intra-articular fluid, with preliminary ultrasound scanning seeking to localize intra-articular fluid. Multiple approaches are typically available to enter a joint using ultrasound guidance, clinicians should recognize that many ultrasound-guided joint aspirations and injections do not use the same approaches as traditional non–image-guided techniques, and the choice of joint entry site is situation specific and depends on patient position and regional anatomy, localization of fluid (if any), the proximity of neurovascular structures, and clinician preference. Whereas ultrasound-guided joint injections may be performed with small-gauge needles, larger-gauge needles are recommended for aspiration (eg, 20 gauge or larger).

### Point-of-care ultrasound-guided drainage of joint effusions in the pediatric emergency setting: a case series [^7b5018a2]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Literature supporting the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for both identification and aspiration of effusions in large joints in the pediatric emergency department (PED) is sparse. We collected a case series of five patients who presented to the PED from August 2020 to December 2020 with an effusion in the hip, shoulder, knee, or elbow identified and aspirated under POCUS performed by pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physicians. POCUS confirms effusion location and size and visualization of a completely evacuated effusion. POCUS can also guide the decision to start antibiotics earlier in the course of illness, can prevent unnecessary transfers for formal sonographic imaging or for potentially unnecessary radiographic imaging. This series supports the role of a PEM physician and POCUS guidance in the identification and aspiration of large-joint effusions.

### Results of laboratory evaluation of acute knee effusion after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: what is found in patients with a noninfected, painful postoperative knee? [^805a1f7e]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Infection after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a rare and potentially devastating complication. No normative data have been reported for knee aspiration after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the early postoperative period.

Hypothesis

Determining normative laboratory data from a retrospective review of noninfected early postoperative anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction knee effusions will allow for the calculation of an aspirate white blood cell (WBC) threshold value indicative of infection.

Study Design

Case series (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

A 2-year retrospective chart review of 151 anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction patients was performed. Thirty-one noninfected patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria and 1 infected patient had laboratory data collected, including peripheral blood and knee effusion aspirate analyses. Laboratory data from pertinent published studies of infected knees after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were combined with the data of our 1 infected patient, establishing a historical control group. Data were analyzed and results were then compared. Infected aspirate WBC threshold value statistics were then calculated.

Results

Analysis of noninfected knee effusion aspirates revealed a mean WBC count of 9600/uL (standard deviation [SD], 15 200), and a mean of 66% polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells (SD, 34). Aspirate WBC 98% confidence interval (CI) was 2800/uL to 16 200/uL, and the 98% CI for PMN cells was 58% to 84%. Aspirate WBC count > 16 200/uL is 86% sensitive, 92% specific, and has a positive likelihood ratio of 10.4 as an indicator of infection.

Conclusion

Benign effusion after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is common and is associated with elevated inflammatory markers. When concerned, knee aspiration after anterior cruciate ligament surgery gives the highest yield to differentiate between a painful effusion and a septic knee in the early postoperative period while awaiting definitive culture results. The authors report confidence intervals defining the range of cell count variables for noninfected patients requiring aspiration, specifically WBC and PMN, and suggest a WBC threshold value of > 16 200/uL be used as an indicator of infection. On the basis of comparison with historical control data, the authors believe these data are significant and will be reliable for clinical use.

### Current variation in joint aspiration practice for the evaluation of pediatric septic arthritis [^34d833b0]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have shown that the accuracy of intra-articular aspiration can vary widely depending on the joint in question and the technique used. Our results confirm wide variations in aspiration practices across different anatomic locations, with orthopaedic residents being primarily responsible for aspirations in more superficial joints (knee, ankle, elbow, and wrist) using anatomic landmarks. Previous studies have shown landmark based techniques to have an intra-articular accuracy rate for needle placement between 67% and 91% in the knee,77% to 100% for the ankle, and 25% to 100% for the elbow. The addition of imaging guidance, be it fluoroscopy or ultrasonography, has been shown to further improve these accuracy rates.

In comparison, the hip and shoulder aspirations showed higher rates of attending radiologist and/or surgeon participation with associated increased rates of image guidance. Leopold et al.demonstrated that landmark-based hip injections have questionable accuracy and safety. In the current study, 94.4% of institutions reported using image guidance, with 50% using ultrasound and 44.4% fluoroscopy. Ultrasound guidance has been shown in adult patients to be safe and accurate for intra-articular placementand has found growing utilization for the evaluation of the painful pediatric hip.

Unlike adult patients, using local or no anesthesia is rarely sufficient in pediatric patients depending on the joint in question. As such, moderate sedation was the most commonly used anesthetic used for all joints, except the hip where a general anesthetic was most commonly used. Superficial joints with high rates of minimal or no anesthetic usage are performed almost exclusively in the ED, whereas hip aspirations are more likely to occur in either the OR or radiology suite. Phillips and Kattapurampreviously showed the efficacy of hip aspirations performed by radiologists, with the benefit of lower costs and shorter hospitalization in adult patients. Kocher et alproposed a tiered, algorithmic approach for the painful, pediatric hip with recommendations for the location of aspiration, either ED or OR, based on patient symptoms, but their study did not comment on the use of interventional radiology suites. Further study comparing techniques regarding culture yields, patient satisfaction, time, and cost could guide optimal protocols.

### Approach to knee effusions [^e52b3622]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of an intra-articular knee effusion requires an extensive differential diagnosis and a systematic diagnostic approach. Pediatric knee effusions occur most commonly as acute hemarthroses after traumatic injury. However, the knee joint is susceptible to effusions secondary to a wide variety of atraumatic causes. Special attention is required in the atraumatic effusion to distinguish features of infectious, postinfectious, rheumatologic, hematologic, vasculitic, and malignant disease. This review discusses the various etiologies of both traumatic and atraumatic pediatric knee effusions highlighting the historical, physical examination, and laboratory characteristics to aid the emergency provider in diagnosis and initial management.

The majority of patients included in this study had their anticoagulation held temporarily which is in keeping with the published literature. There was no significant difference in length of stay between patients in whom the anticoagulant was continued and patients in whom it was held. Warfarin was the most common anticoagulant prescribed to patients in this study. A single aspiration was performed in 5 patients representing less than 20% of the cohort. No patients underwent repeated aspiration, and no adverse effects following aspiration were reported.

The majority of patients in the literature received some aspect of the basic rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE) principles. In one case report, the affected joint was immobilised for 3 months due to ongoing pain, but there was no evidence to support this practice.

Joint aspiration is widely used as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the management of an acute haemarthrosis. There remains no clear evidence to guide which patients would benefit most from joint aspiration. Our recommendation, and current practice in our institution, is to aspirate if the diagnosis is unclear in order to exclude infection or a crystal arthropathy. We also believe it can be safely used as a therapeutic tool when the patient's anticoagulation has been held, and their clotting status has returned to normal. This is supported in the literature, and the majority of studies recommend careful and selective aspiration.-

The diagnostic qualities of aspiration and the improvement in patient's symptoms post-aspiration are well documented.- The complications of joint aspiration are primarily the risk of introducing infection and bleeding, particularly in the presence of concurrent anticoagulation use. Previous work demonstrates that aspirating a joint of an anticoagulated patient is safe. A large cohort study investigating complications following joint injections for patients on warfarin concluded that in their series of 2084 injections performed with an INR range of 1.7–5.5, no complications were observed. Ultrasound may be used to confirm the diagnosis of a haemarthrosis, particularly in cases where aspiration is not possible. Despite the potential benefits of aspiration, it was only performed in 5 of the patients included in our study.- This low rate of aspiration may be due to the perceived risk of introducing infection or causing further bleeding.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on percutaneous catheter drainage of infected fluid collections [^0c4efbaa]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Abnormal fluid collections occur throughout the body and represent a wide range of pathologies, including abscesses, pseudocysts, cysts, lymphoceles, seromas, bilomas, hematomas, urinomas, and infected neoplasms. Appropriate management often depends on clinical presentation, location, type of collection, early response to treatment, and the presence of complicating factors such as fistulas, septations, and increased viscosity. Physicians should carefully review clinical and imaging findings and make evidence-based recommendations for the best treatment, which may include antibiotics, needle aspiration, percutaneous drainage, endoscopic drainage, or surgical drainage. This paper addresses percutaneous catheter drainage and alternative treatment options for the management of fluid collections and is the result of evidence-based consensus by the ACR Appropriateness Criteria Expert Panel on Interventional Radiology.

### Low risk of acute iatrogenic periprosthetic joint infection after prosthetic joint aspiration [^ffef954e]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Synovial fluid analysis is an essential tool in diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, concern exists that aspiration may introduce infection into a noninfected joint. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of iatrogenic PJI following diagnostic knee aspiration done within 6 months of the primary TKA.

Methods

Between 2017 and 2021, the senior surgeon performed over 4,000 primary TKAs and aspirated 155 knees in 137 patients for whom there was a suspicion for PJI within 6 months of their primary TKA. There were 22 knees diagnosed as infected from the initial aspiration and therefore were excluded from the study. The remaining 133 aspirates in 115 patients who were negative for infection were followed for 6 months for signs and symptoms of PJI to elucidate whether aspiration introduced infection into an initially noninfected joint.

Results

There were 70 of 133 knees (52.6%) aspirated between 0 and 6 weeks after index TKA, 40 of 133 (30.1%) between 6 weeks and 3 months, and 23 of 133 (17.3%) between 3 and 6 months. At final follow-up, none of the 133 initially noninfected knees exhibited evidence of subsequent iatrogenic PJI or had subsequent surgery for infection.

Conclusion

While joint aspiration is a procedure with inherent risks, this study shows that the rate of iatrogenic PJI is extremely low (0%). Therefore, if infection is suspected, the surgeon should consider joint aspiration, even in the initial postoperative period, as the risk for introducing infection is far outweighed by the risk of missing an infection.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^ed81ba3a]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline — acceptability, feasibility, and future research for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis notes that intra-articular treatments are a commonly utilized approach and that there should be no issues implementing this recommendation because it does not influence a major change in clinical practice and provides further evidence to support and guide these practices. These recommendations do not interfere with other interventions or clinical practice and are deemed very feasible in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. For future work, future research in this area should embrace detailed osteoarthritis characterization including sub-group analyses and osteoarthrosis severity stratification; using clinically relevant outcomes and controls for bias are warranted along with cost-effectiveness analysis; and specifically for platelet rich plasma, it will be of outmost importance to include comprehensive platelet rich plasma characterization and description of platelet rich plasma preparation protocol.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^e1e3218b]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

It is important to discern that all PRP is not equivalent. Factors at minimum that can affect the final PRP product include volume of blood aspirated, baseline platelet count, patient health status and comorbidities, patient medications, anticoagulant of choice, centrifugation parameters, and inclusion/exclusion of leukocytes. Not distinguishing for this variability, we have summarized below the gross evidence evaluating the use of PRP for knee-related pathology.

The combined data from the reviews discussed support PRP's excellent safety profile. A total of 26 studies (n = 1051) that reported adverse events demonstrated non-significant differences between other conservative treatments and PRP injection. The other reviews show agreement that PRP-treated patients did not display significant increased adverse events or additional side effects.PRP intra-articular knee injection is safe with comparable risk factors to other conservative treatment for knee osteoarthritis.
Intra-articular PRP: Several systematic reviews have analyzed the available literature regarding PRP specifically focusing on symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. In 2017, Dai et al evaluated the efficacy of PRP for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis compared to saline control and hyaluronic acid. Meta-analysis of 10 RCTs (n = 1069) revealed that at 6 months post injection, PRP and hyaluronic acid had similar effects with respect to pain relief and functional improvement. However, at 12 months, PRP was associated with significantly better pain relief and functional improvement as measured by the WOMAC that exceeded the minimal clinically important difference. When comparing PRP to saline, PRP intervention was more effective for pain relief and functional improvement at 6 and 12 months with scores that again exceeded the minimal clinically important difference.

### Ultrasound-guided intra-articular knee injection in an obese patient [^becb5664]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

A 35-yr-old woman was referred to our outpatient clinic for a right intra-articular knee aspiration and injection. She had a medical history notable for lymphedema and morbid obesity (Fig. 1). Her body mass index was recently calculated at greater than 60 kg/m². She had a history of four previous nonguided knee joint injections performed elsewhere that provided no significant improvement in pain. On physical examination, it was difficult to localize common knee joint bony landmarks, including the medial and lateral borders of the patella (Fig. 2). Consequently we opted to utilize ultrasound guidance for the knee joint injection via the technique described herein.

### Comparison of endoscopic evacuation, stereotactic aspiration, and craniotomy for treatment of basal ganglia hemorrhage [^4f07af5f]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In the medium and large hematoma subgroups, the mortality of the stereotactic aspiration group was significantly higher than that of the endoscopic aspiration group. In the large hematoma subgroup, a trend towards improved survival was observed in the endoscopic aspiration group compared with the craniotomy group (OR = 8.721, 95% CI, 0.933 to 81.551). This suggested that, with hematoma volumes ≥ 40 mL, stereotactic aspiration is not the ideal choice. With hematoma volumes ≥ 80 mL, endoscopic aspiration may be the optimal surgical choice among the three different techniques. These results may help to better define the appropriate indication for each technique; however, further prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm the findings of this study.

This study has several limitations. First, owing to the retrospective nature of the study, the possibility of selection bias cannot be excluded, and some data were not uniformly ascertained. Second, potential methodological limitations might have influenced the results. Third, this study was carried out at a single center and may have limited generalizability. Multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of different surgical techniques.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^a300226c]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound-guided joint aspirations and injections — definition and indications — are defined as procedures in which ultrasound is used to guide a needle into a joint for the purpose of delivering a diagnostic or therapeutic agent or for aspirating fluid, and specifications in this section also apply to periarticular bursas (eg, subacromial bursa in the shoulder and greater trochanteric bursa in the hip). General indications for needle placement into a joint include but are not limited to delivery of diagnostic or therapeutic agents into the joint, removal of fluid before injection of a diagnostic or therapeutic agent, fluid sampling for diagnostic purposes, and removal of fluid for symptomatic relief. Specific indications for ultrasound-guided needle placement into a joint include but are not limited to a failed palpation-guided procedure; diagnostic aspiration in the setting of clinically absent or minimal effusion; diagnostic injection where accurate injectate placement is critical for diagnosis; inability to precisely localize the target using palpation or surface landmarks due to body habitus, congenital, postsurgical, or posttraumatic deformity, or deep location of the target structure (eg, hip joint); therapeutic injection in which therapeutic benefit is predicated on accurate placement; relatively high risk of complications that can be mitigated by ultrasound guidance, including avoidance of inadvertent tendon injection to reduce rupture risk, proximity to neurovascular structures or organs at risk, and bleeding risk secondary to anticoagulants or bleeding diathesis; and in select patients with significant apprehension about arthrocentesis to ameliorate procedure-related pain and/or anxiety. General procedural contraindications apply as discussed earlier in this document.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^76879fba]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound-guided aspiration — fluid can be aspirated from the target area for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes using ultrasound guidance while avoiding neurovascular structures. In suspected infection, fluid should be sent for analysis and culture because the ultrasound appearance of fluid is an unreliable indicator of infection, and the viscosity of the fluid cannot be predicted by its ultrasound appearance. Use of larger-gauge needles and lavage with sterile normal saline, sterile water, or a local anesthetic can be performed to reduce viscosity and facilitate aspiration, although lavage should be used with caution in suspected cases of infection, as the lavage fluid will dilute bacteria and cells and may inhibit bacterial culture. During aspiration the clinician should reposition the needle to avoid needle clog and optimize fluid aspiration, and in ganglia or other septated fluid collections the clinician can guide the needle into additional compartments to optimize the yield.

### Towards prevention of post-traumatic osteoarthritis: report from an international expert working group on considerations for the design and conduct of interventional studies following acute knee injury [^aae5355d]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2019). Medium credibility.

Imaging

Baseline and longitudinal evaluation should differentiate pre-existing degenerative from acute traumatic structural joint damage. The contralateral knee may subsequently be affected, therefore differentiating index from control knee is important. Considerations around type of imaging and its frequency include evidence of specific outcome performance metrics, feasibility and cost. Where trials are multi-center, MRI protocols need to be carefully designed (for example, compositional imaging may be challenging in a multi-center setting, and magnet strength should be considered in the context of ACL reconstruction and metal artefact). Selection of imaging biomarker (semi-quantitative or quantitative) requires understanding of the validity, reliability and responsiveness of each measure. MRI techniques that assess early cartilage changes may be useful. Measures of synovial or fat pad inflammation may be important for anti-inflammatory therapeutics and MRI techniques that quantify synovitis may be considered. Early changes in 3D bone shape seen after injury which predict subsequent OA warrant further study as a potential surrogate endpoint.

Molecular biomarkers

These were noted to be under development as stratifiers and as outcome measures: none were yet sufficiently evidence-based to act as independent surrogate measures as either an early OA diagnostic, prognostic or patient selection aid for interventional studies. Irrespective of target, to accelerate therapeutic advances, it is important that bio-samples be collected in all cohorts and clinical trials where possible. DNA storage would allow the international community to work collaboratively to identify novel genetic predictors of outcome.

Synovial fluid was highlighted as a potentially important biosample, showing biologically important molecular changes after injury and after intervention; synovial fluid molecular changes are likely to have increased utility compared to serum. Contralateral aspiration of synovial fluid was controversial, as the contralateral knee is not always a good control and it is difficult to aspirate normal joints. It is important that non-surgical studies access synovial fluid to avoid bias towards surgical intervention studies. In some cohorts, serum/plasma/urine may be available prior to the injury (e.g. participants in a biobank or military cohorts): measuring change within an individual was noted as analytically powerful. Regarding biomarker choice, the most qualified biomarkers to date, e.g. CTX-II, could be included if cartilage matrix catabolism is a target; synovial inflammation or bone biomarkers, or specific cytokine measurements may be relevant depending on target.

Functional outcomes

Symptoms of instability could be more reliable than any examination-based measures. However, their sensitivity to change compared with existing measures such as pain should be evaluated further.

### The unstable knee: wobble and buckle [^547af53f]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Instability after total knee replacement (TKR) accounts for 10% to 22% of revision procedures. All patients who present for evaluation of instability require a thorough history to be taken and physical examination, as well as appropriate imaging. Deep periprosthetic infection must be ruled out by laboratory testing and an aspiration of the knee must be carried out. The three main categories of instability include flexion instability, extension instability (symmetric and asymmetric), and genu recurvatum. Most recently, the aetiologies contributing to, and surgical manoeuvres required to correct, flexion instability have been elucidated. While implant design and patient-related factors may certainly contribute to the aetiology, surgical technique is also a significant factor in all forms of post-operative instability.

### Managing auricular hematoma: an emergency medicine narrative review [^22b34090]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Auricular hematoma is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department among patients presenting with trauma to the ear. It may result in several complications such as perichondritis and cauliflower ear if not managed appropriately.

Objective

This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of the evaluation and management of auricular hematoma.

Discussion

Auricular hematoma is most commonly associated with shearing or blunt trauma to the ear, resulting in formation of a hematoma within the subperichondrial space. This hematoma obstructs the nutrient supply from the perichondrium to the avascular cartilage. Without a nutrient supply, the ear is at risk for infection, necrosis, and fibrocartilaginous deposition causing cauliflower ear. If a fluctuant hematoma is present within the cartilaginous auricle within 7 days of injury, evacuation should be offered. Prior to the procedure, analgesia should be performed using an auricular block. The hematoma can then be evacuated via needle aspiration or incision and drainage followed by a bolster compression dressing to prevent reaccumulation of blood within this potential space. Despite limited data, 7–10 days of antibiotics are currently recommended with coverage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eg, fluoroquinolones in adults, amoxicillin-clavulanate in children). This may mitigate the risk of perichondritis. Patients should be reevaluated at 24–48 hours and abstain from contact sports for at least 2 weeks.

Conclusion

Emergency clinicians must be knowledgeable regarding the evaluation and management of auricular hematoma, including the various drainage techniques.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^84457ca0]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Surgical interventions — minimally invasive (MIS) evacuation of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): For patients with supratentorial ICH of > 20- to 30-mL volume with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores in the moderate range (5–12), minimally invasive hematoma evacuation with endoscopic or stereotactic aspiration with or without thrombolytic use can be useful to reduce mortality compared with medical management alone (COR 2a, LOE B-R). For patients with supratentorial ICH of > 20- to 30-mL volume with GCS scores in the moderate range (6–12) being considered for hematoma evacuation, it may be reasonable to select minimally invasive hematoma evacuation over conventional craniotomy to improve functional outcomes (COR 2b, LOE B-R). For similar patients, the effectiveness of minimally invasive hematoma evacuation with endoscopic or stereotactic aspiration with or without thrombolytic use to improve functional outcomes is uncertain (COR 2b, LOE B-R).

### Sonographically guided posteromedial approach for intra-articular knee injections: a safe, accurate, and efficient method [^c3b8341f]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis of the knee can be a debilitating and extremely painful condition. In patients who desire to postpone knee arthroplasty or in those who are not surgical candidates, percutaneous knee injection therapies have the potential to reduce pain and swelling, maintain joint mobility, and minimize disability. Published studies cite poor accuracy of intra-articular knee joint injections without imaging guidance. We present a sonographically guided posteromedial approach to intra-articular knee joint injections with 100% accuracy and no complications in a consecutive series of 67 patients undergoing subsequent computed tomographic or magnetic resonance arthrography. Although many other standard approaches are available, a posteromedial intra-articular technique is particularly useful in patients with a large body habitus and theoretically allows for simultaneous aspiration of Baker cysts with a single sterile preparation and without changing the patient's position. The posteromedial technique described in this paper is not compared or deemed superior to other standard approaches but, rather, is presented as a potentially safe and efficient alternative.

### Diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection-an algorithm-based approach [^863d2098]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains one of the most challenging and devastating modes of failure after total hip and knee arthroplasties. Despite the profound urgency and impact of PJI on an individual and societal basis, historically, there have not been standardized definitions of and diagnostic algorithms for infection after total joint arthroplasty.

Methods

In a recent symposium, the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons put forth a standardized approach to the prevention, diagnosis, and management of the patient with a suspected PJI.

Results

This review article summarizes these findings, and reviews the algorithmic approach to the diagnosis of PJI.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of PJI is easily made in our experience in 90% of patients by getting an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein followed by selective aspiration of the joint if these values are elevated or if the clinical suspicion is high. Synovial fluid obtained should be sent for a synovial fluid white blood cell count, differential, and cultures.

### ACR-SIR-SPR practice parameter for specifications and performance of imageguided drainage / aspiration of abscesses and fluid collections [^62e7c2f4]. SIR (2023). High credibility.

Specifics of the procedure — image-guided percutaneous aspiration: All image-guided percutaneous procedures involving aspiration of fluid collections with or without percutaneous catheter drainage are performed for specific indications, and the examination or procedure should therefore be tailored accordingly. For diagnostic aspirations, initial placement of a small needle (ie, 18–22 gauge) or centesis catheter is advised when appropriate. Diagnostic percutaneous fluid aspiration may lead to therapeutic placement of a percutaneous drainage catheter using modified Seldinger or trocar techniques for definitive drainage.

### Delayed symptomatic presentation of epidural hematoma after epidural catheter anesthesia: case report [^2c8afcd7]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

The authors present a case report of a 70-year-old woman who presented with delayed symptoms of epidural hematoma after epidural catheter anesthesia.

Objective

We intend to report a unique case of delayed presentation of epidural hematoma after epidural catheter anesthesia.

Summary Of Background Data

The authors present a case of a 70-year-old woman who received epidural anesthesia via spinal catheter infusion before right knee replacement surgery. After an unremarkable postoperative course, she presented 6 weeks later with worsening middle and lower back pain, prompting a workup and lumbar MR imaging. MRI of her lumbar spine demonstrated a lower thoracic epidural fluid collection with significant radiographic mass effect on the thoracic spine. The fluid was diagnosed as chronic breakdown of an initially asymptomatic epidural hematoma. Symptomatic epidural hematoma formation after epidural block is rare but commonly reported in the literature. The incidence of asymptomatic hematoma formation is probably much higher and unrecognized.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of a case seen at our institution.

Results

A persistent epidural fluid collection in a normocoagulable patient presenting with symptoms of back pain more than a month after spinal block has not been reported in the literature.

Conclusion

In the absence of focal neurologic symptoms, conservative therapy and observation are appropriate.

### The effect of aspiration and corticosteroid injection after ACL injury on postoperative infection rate [^95479322]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Injecting bioactive substances into the knee is common in orthopaedic practice, and recently it has been shown to mitigate risk factors for posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Therefore, understanding the influence of these injections on postoperative infection rate is imperative.

Hypothesis

Postinjury aspiration and corticosteroid injection (CSI) of the knee before anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) would not increase the risk of postoperative infection.

Study Design

Cohort Study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

All patients between the ages of 10 and 65 years who underwent primary bone-patellar tendon-bone ACLR by 1 fellowship-trained sports medicine orthopaedic surgeon between January 1, 2011, and September 8, 2020, at 1 of 2 major academic centers were evaluated for inclusion. A total of 693 patients were included, with 273 patients receiving postinjury and preoperative aspiration and CSI. A postoperative infection was defined as a patient returning to the operating room for an intra-articular washout. The intervals-measured in days-between the CSI and ACLR and between ACLR and the final follow-up were recorded. To further evaluate the infection risk in each cohort (total cohort; aspiration and injection cohort; no aspiration and injection cohort), the upper 95% confidence bound for the infection risk was calculated for each cohort.

Results

There were no postoperative infections in the 693 patients included in this study. The upper 95% confidence bounds were 0.4%, 1.1%, and 0.7% for the total cohort, the cohort that underwent aspiration and injection, and the cohort that did not, respectively. The median number of days between the surgical date and that of the aspiration and injection was 34 days, and the mean follow-up for the entire cohort was 337.4 days (95% CI, 307.6–367.3).

Conclusion

Postinjury and preoperative aspiration and CSI is a safe intervention that can be used before ACLR. Future studies with larger sample sizes, longer patient follow-ups, and multiple surgeons would be helpful to both better understand infection risk and better identify the influence of CSI on preventing posttraumatic osteoarthritis.

### Evaluation for septic arthritis of the native adult knee is aided by multivariable assessment [^7cc7041e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evaluation of suspected septic arthritis of the native adult knee is a common diagnostic dilemma. Pre-aspirate criteria predictive of septic arthritis do not exist for the adult knee and investigations of aspiration results (cell count, differential, gram stain and crystal analysis) have been limited to univariate analyses. Given numerous clinical variables inform the risk of septic arthritis, multivariable analysis that incorporates all clinically available information is critical to allowing accurate decision-making.

Methods

We retrospectively identified 455 cases of potential septic arthritis of a native adult knee at a tertiary health system from 2012 to 2017, of which 281 underwent aspiration. We recorded demographics, comorbidities, history, exam, laboratory, and radiographic data. Among aspirated cases, we performed univariate analyses of all variables for association with septic arthritis followed by multivariable logistic regression analysis.

Results

Septic arthritis was confirmed in 61 of 281 patients who underwent aspiration. Independent associations of risk for septic arthritis included synovial fluid WBC ≥ 30,000 (Odds Ratio 90.8, 95% Confidence Interval 26.6–310.1, p < 0.001), bacteria reported on synovial fluid gram stain (OR 21.5, 95% CI 3.9–119.2, p < 0.001), duration of pain > 2 days (OR 6.9, 95% CI. 2.3–20.9, p < 0.001), history of septic arthritis at any joint (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.1–23.4, p = 0.039), clinical effusion (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.2–20.0, p = 0.030). Independent associations protective against septic arthritis included presence of synovial fluid crystals (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.1–0.4, p < 0.001). The multivariable model was highly accurate in discriminating between septic and aseptic cases (AUC = 0.942). A web-based tool was created to aid clinical decision-making.

Conclusion

When evaluating for septic arthritis of a native adult knee, several independent associations were identified for variables related and unrelated to joint aspiration. The associated multivariable model discriminated very well between patients with and without septic arthritis, outperforming previous univariate assessments. A web-based tool was created that estimates the probability of septic arthritis based on this model. This may aid decision-making in complex clinical scenarios.
