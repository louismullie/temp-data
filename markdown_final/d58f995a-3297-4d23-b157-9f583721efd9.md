## Question

Diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of ureaplasm parvum

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of Ureaplasma parvum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism's taxonomy and microbiology. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts where U. parvum behaves as a pathogen versus a commensal. Next, I will examine pathophysiology across syndromes, followed by diagnostic strategies and their limitations. After that, I need to review treatment options by clinical scenario, including neonatal, adult genitourinary, and invasive disease. Finally, I should consider controversies, guideline positions, and synthesize practical recommendations with appropriate caveats and evidence quality assessments.

> Let me first confirm the microbiology and taxonomy so I don't misattribute disease associations. Ureaplasma parvum is a member of the Mycoplasmataceae family, lacks a cell wall, and is among the smallest free-living bacteria; historically grouped within Ureaplasma urealyticum biovars, it is now recognized as a distinct species with serovars 1, 3, 6, and 14, and it commonly colonizes the human urogenital tract as a commensal in sexually active adults [^115YHte4] [^112SU9Yx] [^116JyKYh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pathogenicity. I need to check the clinical contexts where U. parvum is most convincingly implicated. In perinatal medicine, U. parvum is frequently isolated from amniotic fluid and placentas in preterm births and is associated with chorioamnionitis, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants; mechanistic and interventional data suggest a causal role in some settings, though colonization is common and not uniformly pathogenic [^113qC8fu] [^1123VsLp] [^1129LKJv] [^114Vinwf]. In adults, invasive infections are rare but documented, including septic arthritis, prosthetic joint infection, and endocarditis, particularly in immunocompromised hosts or when standard cultures fail and molecular methods reveal the organism [^112HxF34] [^114ja68W] [^114An5y5] [^1136K3Th].

> I will now examine pathophysiology in pregnancy and prematurity, where the signal is strongest. Ascending vaginal colonization can breach cervical barriers, especially with cofactors like bacterial vaginosis or specific serovars, triggering chorioamnionitis and preterm labor; U. parvum serovar 3 has been specifically linked to very early spontaneous preterm birth, and coinfections with Candida albicans may further elevate risk, suggesting synergy rather than sole causation [^112FTbp6] [^111GTiC1] [^1137iwrM]. In preterm infants, respiratory tract colonization can drive a proinflammatory cascade with cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, impairing alveolar development and contributing to BPD; maternal azithromycin in a primate model improved fetal hemodynamics and reduced inflammatory markers, supporting biologic plausibility for treatment effects [^115HDroz] [^1123shaW].

> Wait, let me verify the adult pathophysiology beyond pregnancy. For urethritis, the weight of evidence suggests U. urealyticum at high loads may cause a subset of nongonococcal urethritis, whereas U. parvum is generally not established as a urethral pathogen; persistent detection after therapy is common and not necessarily linked to ongoing symptoms, complicating interpretation of treatment failure [^114JTk2S] [^114bF4G4]. For invasive disease, hematogenous spread from mucosal colonization can seed joints and prosthetic material, and biofilm formation may facilitate chronicity and treatment recalcitrance, explaining culture-negative scenarios that require molecular diagnostics for resolution [^112ua8gn] [^114ndPUH].

> Next, I should review diagnostic strategies and their pitfalls. Culture is slow and insensitive due to fastidious growth requirements, whereas PCR provides rapid, species-specific detection and can quantify organism burden; multiplex and high-resolution melt assays enable differentiation of U. parvum from U. urealyticum and even serovar typing, though clinical utility of serotyping remains limited by extensive horizontal gene transfer and mosaicism among strains [^112adnXo] [^113pAE8M] [^116JyKYh] [^11268j4a]. But wait, what if the lab reports "Ureaplasma species" without differentiation? I should double-check whether the assay used can distinguish U. parvum from U. urealyticum, because management implications and pathogenic potential differ, and guidelines discourage routine testing in asymptomatic individuals given high colonization prevalence [^116Gwzym].

> I need to ensure I'm aligning treatment with the clinical context and the best available evidence. In preterm neonates with respiratory tract colonization, a 3-day course of intravenous azithromycin at 20 mg/kg daily eradicated Ureaplasma in a randomized trial and improved Ureaplasma-free survival, but did not significantly reduce BPD overall; however, subgroup signals and meta-analytic data suggest potential benefit in Ureaplasma-positive infants, warranting cautious, context-specific use and further trials [^112h56pC] [^115wTrZk] [^1112N8gN]. Let me reconsider the adult genitourinary setting: routine screening or treatment of asymptomatic colonization is not recommended; if symptomatic urethritis is present, treat according to established NGU protocols targeting Chlamydia, Mycoplasma genitalium, and other recognized pathogens, reserving Ureaplasma-directed therapy for selected cases with high organism burden and compatible clinical findings [^116Gwzym] [^114JTk2S] [^111XLhhc].

> For invasive infections, I should confirm antimicrobial choices that cover cell wall–less organisms. Beta-lactams are ineffective; doxycycline, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones are appropriate options, with combination therapy considered in severe or refractory cases; case series and reports support doxycycline plus a fluoroquinolone for deep infections, and molecular confirmation can guide targeted therapy when cultures are negative [^112ua8gn] [^117CckKA]. Hold on, I should verify dosing: for adults with suspected Ureaplasma-associated NGU, doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days is a standard regimen, though persistent detection after therapy is not uncommon and may reflect colonization rather than treatment failure [^116jLZih] [^114bF4G4].

> I should double-check guideline positions to avoid overtesting and overtreatment. The CDC STI guidelines do not recommend routine testing for Ureaplasma in cervicitis or urethritis and emphasize evaluation for established pathogens; similarly, IDSA/ASM guidance advises against routine Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma testing in asymptomatic individuals due to high colonization and limited actionable outcomes, reserving molecular diagnostics for well-selected scenarios or persistent unexplained disease [^111XLhhc] [^116Gwzym]. For pregnancy, Cochrane reviews conclude insufficient evidence that treating vaginal Ureaplasma prevents preterm birth, reinforcing a conservative approach outside of research or specific clinical indications [^114mfbwq] [^115d4c4A].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations while acknowledging uncertainties. In preterm infants with documented lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization, a short course of azithromycin can eradicate the organism and may improve infection-related outcomes, though routine BPD prevention is not yet established; decisions should be individualized and ideally made in consultation with neonatology and infectious diseases specialists [^112h56pC] [^1112N8gN]. In adults, avoid screening asymptomatic individuals; treat symptomatic urethritis per NGU guidelines and consider Ureaplasma-specific therapy only when there is strong evidence of pathogenic involvement, high organism burden, and failure of standard regimens; for invasive disease, use doxycycline or fluoroquinolone-based regimens with molecular confirmation when cultures are negative [^116Gwzym] [^112ua8gn] [^1136K3Th]. Finally, I need to ensure that diagnostic workflows prioritize PCR-based detection when Ureaplasma is suspected, interpret results in clinical context, and communicate the distinction between colonization and infection to avoid misattribution and unnecessary antibiotics [^112adnXo] [^116Gwzym].

Ureaplasma parvum is a **commensal of the urogenital tract** [^112SU9Yx] that can cause disease in vulnerable hosts, especially preterm infants, via **ascending infection** and inflammation [^113qC8fu] [^1123VsLp]. Diagnosis relies on **PCR** [^112adnXo] because culture is slow and insensitive [^113oQTKH]; **azithromycin** is first-line therapy for colonized preterm infants [^112h56pC], while doxycycline or moxifloxacin are used for adults with symptomatic infection [^112ua8gn]. Treatment of asymptomatic colonization is not recommended [^notfound], and **eradication does not consistently reduce BPD** [^1112N8gN], so management should be individualized [^notfound].

---

## Microbiological characteristics

U. parvum **lacks a cell wall**, rendering it inherently resistant to beta-lactams and vancomycin [^112ua8gn]. It is **fastidious** and grows slowly, requiring specialized media and conditions [^113pAE8M].

---

## Pathophysiology

U. parvum is a common urogenital commensal [^114G2nxN]; **pathogenicity is context-dependent** and increases with host vulnerability, high organism load, and co-infections [^1123VsLp]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Ascending infection**: Vaginal colonization can ascend to cause chorioamnionitis, PPROM, and preterm birth [^113qC8fu] [^113F5g3i].

- **Inflammation**: Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) drive preterm labor and neonatal lung injury [^113J8r2Z] [^112BDPbc].

- **Biofilm formation**: Facilitates persistence and antibiotic tolerance, especially on medical devices [^114ndPUH].

- **Immune modulation**: May impair host defenses, increasing susceptibility to secondary infections [^1123VsLp].

---

## Clinical manifestations

U. parvum is linked to **distinct clinical syndromes**:

| **Clinical context** | **Manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Pregnancy | - Chorioamnionitis [^1123VsLp] <br/> - PPROM [^1172xUXx] <br/> - Preterm birth [^1123VsLp] <br/> - Spontaneous abortion [^notfound] |
| Neonates | - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^1123VsLp] <br/> - Pneumonia [^113J8r2Z] <br/> - Sepsis [^113qC8fu] <br/> - Meningitis [^112hnoH2] |
| Adults | - Urethritis (rare) [^notfound] <br/> - Prostatitis <br/> - PID <br/> - Infertility [^notfound] <br/> - Septic arthritis (rare) [^112HxF34] <br/> - Endocarditis (rare) [^114An5y5] |

---

## Diagnosis

Accurate diagnosis requires **molecular methods**, as culture is insensitive:

- **PCR**: Rapid, sensitive, and specific; preferred for detection and differentiation from U. urealyticum [^112adnXo] [^113pAE8M].

- **Culture**: Slow (3–5 days), less sensitive; reserved when PCR is unavailable [^115YHte4].

- **Sample types**: Vaginal/endocervical swabs, amniotic fluid, placental tissue, neonatal respiratory samples, blood, and CSF [^112FTbp6] [^1137iwrM] [^1129LKJv].

---

## Treatment

Treatment depends on **clinical context**, host factors, and antibiotic susceptibility:

- **Neonates**: Azithromycin 20 mg/kg IV daily for 3 days [^112h56pC] eradicates respiratory colonization [^1133Ufuh]; eradication does not consistently reduce BPD [^1112N8gN].

- **Adults**: Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7–14 days [^116jLZih] [^115u1afc]; moxifloxacin 400 mg PO/IV daily for 7–14 days if doxycycline is contraindicated or resistance is suspected [^114bF4G4].

- **Pregnancy**: Treat only if symptomatic or if infection is documented; avoid routine treatment of asymptomatic colonization [^116Gwzym] [^115d4c4A].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **reducing risk factors** and **avoiding overtreatment**:

- **Screening**: Not recommended for asymptomatic individuals due to high colonization prevalence [^116Gwzym].

- **Infection control**: Strict aseptic technique during obstetric and neonatal procedures [^notfound].

- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Avoid unnecessary treatment of colonization to limit resistance [^116T8WR7].

---

U. parvum is a **commensal with conditional pathogenicity**; **PCR-based diagnosis** and **context-driven therapy** are essential, with azithromycin for colonized preterm infants and doxycycline or moxifloxacin for symptomatic adults [^113pAE8M] [^112adnXo] [^112h56pC] [^114bF4G4] [^111RFdLa].

### Perinatal infections with Ureaplasma [^113qC8fu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Ureaplasma species are increasingly recognized as relevant pathogens in prenatal, perinatal and postnatal morbidity. They are commonly found as commensals on the mucous membranes of the lower urogenital tract of pregnant women, but when ascending, they can cause bacterial vaginosis, chorioamnionitis, premature birth and postnatal morbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and early-onset neonatal sepsis and meningitis. The detection of Ureaplasma species is challenging and is not covered by routine diagnostics, and current empiric antibiotic treatment in neonates suspected of infection is not directed against Ureaplasma species. The aim of this review is to discuss the pathophysiology of Ureaplasma infections, the clinical consequences and the current difficulties in diagnosis and treatment by providing an overview of the current literature.

### Ureaplasma – are you sitting comfortably? [^112SU9Yx]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

The role of Ureaplasma spp. in human disease has been controversial, as these bacteria are commonly isolated as part of the normal genital tract flora. Ureaplasma has been shown to have a causal role in urogenital infections and is associated with significant foetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality when infection occurs during the perinatal period. Although rare, invasive Ureaplasma infection (meningitis, renal abscess, mediastinitis and arthritis) has also been reported in both adults and children. This review outlines the unique microbiological features and various clinical presentations of Ureaplasma infection. It also discusses the treatment options, which in the neonatal period can be particularly challenging.

### The role of Ureaplasma species in prenatal and postnatal morbidity of preterm infants: current concepts [^1123VsLp]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma species are considered commensals of the adult urogenital tract. Yet, in pregnancy, Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum have been associated with chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. In preterm infants, Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization has been correlated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of other complications of prematurity. Controversies on the impact of Ureaplasma exposure on neonatal morbidity, however, remain, and recommendations for screening practices and therapeutic management in preterm infants are missing.

Summary

In this review, we outline clinical and experimental evidence of Ureaplasma-driven fetal and neonatal morbidity, critically examining inconsistencies across some of the existing studies. We explore underlying mechanisms of Ureaplasma-associated neonatal morbidity and discuss gaps in the current understanding including the interplay between Ureaplasma and the maternal urogenital tract and the preterm airway microbiome. Ultimately, we highlight the importance of adequate diagnostics and review the potential efficacy of anti-infective therapies.

Key Messages

There is strong evidence that perinatal Ureaplasma exposure is causally related to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and there are conclusive data of the role of Ureaplasma in the pathogenesis of neonatal central nervous system infection. Observational and experimental findings indicate immunomodulatory capacities that might promote an increased risk of secondary infections. The burden of Ureaplasma exposure is inversely related to gestational age - leaving the tiniest babies at highest risk. A better knowledge of contributing pathogen and host factors and modulating conditions remains paramount to define screening and treatment recommendations allowing early intervention in preterm infants at risk.

### Ureaplasma: pathogen or passenger in neonatal meningitis? [^112hnoH2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The significance of Ureaplasma species as pathogens in neonatal meningitis remains contentious. Using an illustrative case of a premature infant with Ureaplasma parvum meningitis, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid cultures and both specific and 16s rDNA polymerase chain reaction, we discuss the epidemiology of Ureaplasma species, the difficulties involved in diagnosis and establishing pathogenicity, and the challenges in defining appropriate treatment.

### Ureaplasma infection and neonatal lung disease [^115HDroz]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Infection with the ureaplasmas may occur in utero or perinatally in prematurely born infants. For some infants, infection with these organisms triggers a vigorous pro-inflammatory response in the lungs and increases the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). At present, there is insufficient evidence from clinical trials to determine whether antibiotic treatment of Ureaplasma has any influence on the development of BPD and its comorbidities. Future investigation in the context of well-designed, adequately powered controlled clinical trials should focus on determining whether treatment of ureaplasmal infection lessens lung inflammation, decreases rates of BPD, and improves long-term, neurodevelopmental outcome.

### Chorioamnionitis: from pathogenesis to treatment [^117XQbJU]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Chorioamnionitis refers to inflammation of the amniochorionic membrane, and is a significant cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity. Chorioamnionitis most often occurs as a result of ascending infection, and is commonly associated with premature rupture of the membranes. Chorioamnionitis is generally the result of a polymicrobial infection, with Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Gram-negative anaerobes being frequent causative organisms. The mainstay of treatment includes antimicrobial agents, antipyretics, expedition of delivery and supportive care. Further research is required to identify mechanistic pathways and early biomarkers that accurately predict women at higher risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, and that can thus lead to the development of additional treatment and prevention strategies.

### Advances in the understanding and treatment of male urethritis [^116fZK4v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are well-documented urethral pathogens, and the literature supporting Mycoplasma genitalium as an etiology of urethritis is growing. Trichomonas vaginalis and viral pathogens (herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and adenovirus) can cause urethritis, particularly in specific subpopulations. New data are emerging regarding the potential role of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria in urethritis, although results are inconsistent regarding the pathogenic role of Ureaplasma urealyticum in men. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma parvum do not appear to be pathogens. Men with suspected urethritis should undergo evaluation to confirm urethral inflammation and etiologic cause. Although nucleic acid amplification testing would detect N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis (or T. vaginalis if utilized), there is no US Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical test for M. genitalium available in the United States at this time. The varied etiologies of urethritis and lack of diagnostic options for some organisms present treatment challenges in the clinical setting.

### Complicated pediatric pneumonia due to Ureaplasma PARVUM: a CASE REPORT [^114G2nxN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Ureaplasma parvum, a facultative anaerobic commensal of the urogenital tract, can cause extragenital disease in neonates and immunocompromised individuals. Extragenital detection of U. parvum disease is severely limited by conventional diagnostic techniques. We describe the first case of complicated pneumonia secondary to U. parvum in an immunocompetent pediatric host outside the neonatal period, identified by next-generation sequencing.

### The significance of Ureaplasma urealyticum as a pathogenic agent in the paediatric population [^115Gm4Ld]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ureaplasma urealyticum is a frequent commensal in the lower genital tract of sexually active women. It may be transmitted perinatally from the colonized mother to her offspring, often resulting in prematurity and neonatal disease. The microorganism also sustains a causative role for infectious diseases in older children.

Recent Findings

U. urealyticum infection can be diagnosed by culture, polymerase chain reaction, and the detection of specific antibodies. Neonatal infection has been implicated in various pathological conditions including pneumonia, chronic lung disease, central nervous system disorders, sepsis, osteomyelitis and even death. Older children may present with wheezing, pneumonitis, pertussis-like syndrome and different forms of arthritis. Large well-designed trials have demonstrated that the regular administration of antibiotics to vaginally colonized women are not beneficial in terms of preventing preterm labour. Macrolide-containing antibiotic regimens are, however, recommended for preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Erythromycin treatment of ureaplasma respiratory colonized premature infants shows no reduction in the incidence of chronic lung disease. Treatment of central nervous system infections, sepsis and arthritides includes tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and anti-inflammatory agents, respectively.

Summary

This review covers recent evidence concerning the role of U. urealyticum as a pathogen during childhood. It also includes an evaluation of contemporary diagnostic techniques and optimal therapeutic approaches.

### And its role in adverse perinatal outcomes: a review [^113oQTKH]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Human Ureaplasma species are the most common microbes found in amniotic fluid and in the placenta after preterm birth, and have previously been correlated with chorioamnionitis, preterm labor, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, among other adverse birth and neonatal outcomes. Although these correlations exist, there still remains little explanation as to whether Ureaplasma plays a pathogenic role in the development of neonatal disease. In addition, Ureaplasma species are not usually identified on routine culture as they require special culture methods because of their fastidious growth requirements. Treatment of Ureaplasma with macrolides has been shown to effectively eradicate the bacteria in pregnant women and infants. However, it is unclear whether this leads to improved neonatal morbidity and mortality, or whether these generally represent commensal organisms. This review will synthesize the current perspectives about the proposed mechanisms of pathogenicity of Ureaplasma bacteria, its links to poor neonatal outcomes, and the role of screening and treatment in current clinical practice.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^114uyobz]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), usually considered as a conditional pathogen, belongs to the genus Ureaplasma and the family Mycoplasmataceae in the order Mycoplasmatales. A meta-analysis found that UU, but not undifferentiated Ureaplasma infections or U. parvum, has been shown to be the pathogen of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU). Moreover, UU is easy to be implanted in urethra, but not necessarily cause urethritis, quite a few patients with these infections are not aware of their infections because they may be asymptomatic, even whether it is pathogenic and the impact on fertility is still uncertain. The incidence of UU was reported inconsistently, a study of 19,098 infertile men and 3368 fertile men found that 10.22% and 3.65% of UU infertile and fertile men's urethra specimens, and 3.16% and 0.89% of MH specimens, UU infection will significantly affect sperm quality, and there is a significant relationship between UU infection and male infertility. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that there was a significant relationship between UU and Mycoplasma hominis with male infertility, and compared with the global average, the UU-positive rate was significantly higher in both the infertility group and the control group in China, while the positive rate was significantly lower in Mycoplasma hominis. Similarly, UU infection can directly affect sperm, cause leukocyte-mediated inflammatory response, and affect sperm by producing ROS.

### Ureaplasma species: role in neonatal morbidities and outcomes [^1129LKJv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2014). Low credibility.

The genital mycoplasma species, Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum are the most common organisms isolated from infected amniotic fluid and placentas, and they contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth and neonatal morbidities. In our institution, almost half of the preterm infants of less than 32 weeks gestation are Ureaplasma-positive in one or more compartment (respiratory, blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid), indicating that these organisms are the most common pathogens affecting this population. This review will focus on the compelling epidemiological and experimental evidence linking perinatal Ureaplasma species exposure to important morbidities of prematurity, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis.

### Ureaplasma parvum genotype, combined vaginal colonisation with Candida albicans, and spontaneous preterm birth in an Australian cohort of pregnant women [^1122hjhS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

PTB is now recognised as the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years in the developed world, with intrauterine infection being causally associated with ~40% of all PTBs. In particular, the births of the earliest gestational ages, which are associated with the greatest mortality and morbidity, are much more likely to be the consequence of intrauterine infection and/or inflammation (up to 80%). There is, therefore, a need to be able to predict which women are at a high risk of PTB, based on factors other than previous clinical history alone, so that appropriate treatment may be provided to those who would benefit. This is especially relevant for women in their first pregnancy. Despite the body of research that has been conducted into the presence and significance of genital Ureaplasma, Mycoplasma and Candida spp. colonisation during pregnancy, there is very little information available on the relationship between specific lifestyle practices, such as smoking and sexual activity, and vaginal colonisation. However, it has been well established that tobacco use increases susceptibility to bacterial infection and a strong association has been documented between smoking and BV. Furthermore, some genital Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma spp. are deemed to be sexually transmitted infections.

In addition, the vast majority of previous studies that have looked at genital Ureaplasma, Mycoplasma and Candida spp. have focused on collection of clinical samples at a single time point. This approach provides no data on the colonisation dynamics of a particular organism and this is likely to be of significance in terms of implementing diagnostic assays for the detection of women at risk of PTB. It is highly likely that all of the above information combined, will not only increase our understanding of these organisms during pregnancy, but importantly, will allow us to establish useful microbial biomarkers. These, combined with patient-specific qualitative data, will improve our ability to predict women at an increased risk of PTB who would benefit from anti-microbial treatment. Due to previous descriptions of variation in the vaginal microbiota as a result of ethnic, cultural and social factors, it is likely that microbial colonisation status and PTB risk are strongly population-dependent.

### Ureaplasma and BPD [^114Vinwf]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Ureaplasma is an organism with low virulence and is a commensal of the lower genito-urinary tract in females. From here, it can gain entry in the amniotic fluid to cause inflammation in the amniotic compartment during pregnancy. Ureaplasma spp. are the most common organisms isolated from women with chorioamnionitis. Ureaplasma spp. are associated with increased risk for preterm labor and morbidity in the preterm neonate. However, there is some controversy regarding the importance of Ureaplasma in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This article will review the microbiology of Ureaplasma, host innate immune responses, and the pathology of lung injury in animal models of Ureaplasma chorioamnionitis. We will review epidemiological studies of Ureaplasma and BPD in preterm infants and efficacy of antibiotics in preventing preterm labor and BPD.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111XLhhc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Etiology

C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae is the most common etiology of cervicitis defined by diagnostic testing. Trichomoniasis, genital herpes (especially primary HSV-2 infection), or M. genitalium (,–) also have been associated with cervicitis. However, in many cases of cervicitis, no organism is isolated, especially among women at relatively low risk for recent acquisition of these STIs (e.g. women aged > 30 years). Limited data indicate that BV and frequent douching might cause cervicitis. The majority of persistent cases of cervicitis are not caused by reinfection with C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae; other factors might be involved (e.g. persistent abnormality of vaginal flora, M. genitalium, douching or exposure to other types of chemical irritants, dysplasia, or idiopathic inflammation in the zone of ectopy). Available data do not indicate an association between group B streptococcus colonization and cervicitis. No specific evidence exists for a role for Ureaplasma parvum or Ureaplasma urealyticum in cervicitis.

Diagnostic Considerations

Because cervicitis might be a sign of upper genital tract infection (e.g. endometritis), women should be assessed for signs of PID and tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae with NAAT on vaginal, cervical, or urine samples (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). Women with cervicitis also should be evaluated for concomitant BV and trichomoniasis. Because sensitivity of microscopy for detecting T. vaginalis is relatively low (approximately 50%), symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative wet-mount microscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing (i.e. NAAT, culture, or other FDA-cleared diagnostic test) (see Trichomoniasis). Testing for M. genitalium with the FDA-cleared NAAT can be considered. Although HSV-2 infection has been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing (i.e. PCR or culture) for HSV-2 is unknown. Testing for U. parvum, U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, or genital culture for group B streptococcus is not recommended.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116Lq8ka]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Future directions for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — the guideline highlights that A better understanding of rUTI pathophysiology will greatly aid in our ability to design more effective, mechanistically-based treatments, that Relying on results from the urinary dipstick test, including leukocyte esterase and nitrate, lacks the necessary level of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic accuracy, and that Currently, there are no symptoms that are definitively predictive of acute cystitis, and no good quality evidence that can support a specific pathogen. It states Urine culture results or any other current methods of bacterial detection do not reflect any aspect of the host response and calls for defining initiatives for algorithms to predict treatment and partnering with our primary care colleagues and patients to provide education regarding rUTI definitions, evaluation, and treatment. It notes Advanced molecular technologies give a more complete characterization of genitourinary microbes and that PCR and NGS-based diagnostic tests have some enticing preliminary studies suggesting their utilization may facilitate equivalent or even better clinical outcomes than standard urine culture while decreasing the time to diagnosis and reducing empiric antibiotic prescriptions, while cautioning These early studies, however, are complicated by some methodological limitations and a high risk of bias and More data are needed before identifying what role these tests play in UTI diagnostics.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^1133Ufuh]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Respiratory tract colonisation with the genital mycoplasmas Ureaplasma parvum and U. urealyticum is an independent risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely low gestational age infants.
The azalide antibiotic azithromycin has anti-inflammatory properties and exhibits high potency against Ureaplasma isolates in vitro.
Open-label pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics studies of single and multiple dose aizithromycin indicate that 20 mg/kg x3 days was most effective in eradicating respiratory tract Ureaplasma in preterms.

What this study adds?

In this randomised clinical trial that included 121 infants < 29 weeks' gestation, Ureaplasma -free survival was significantly higher in the azithromycin compared with the placebo group.
Ureaplasma was eradicated in all colonised infants assigned to azithromycin compared with 16% in colonised infants assigned to placebo.
Since neonatal mortality and morbidity was concentrated in infants with lower respiratory tract Ureasplasma colonisation, this population should be targeted in future phase III randomised controlled trial.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^1172xUXx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication in premature infants and remains prevalent in extremely preterm infants despite great advances in perinatal care. The pathogenesis of BPD is unclear and multifactorial, including but not restricted to oxygen toxicity, mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury and infection/inflammation. Ureaplasma spp. has been reported as one of the earliest microbiotas colonized in the airway of premature infants, potentially contributing to the inflammatory and fibrotic profile of BPD. Ureaplasma spp. has two species, Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum, with 14 known serovars. Both species were linked with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), chorioamnionitis and preterm labor. The association between Ureaplasma and BPD was first discussed by Holtzman et al. in 1989, who concluded that there was not enough evidence to prove the association. Several studies also investigated the association between Ureaplasma and BPD, yielding conflicting findings. Castro-Alcaraz and colleagues found the pattern of Ureaplasma colonization may be related to BPD, given that infants with persistent Ureaplasma had an increased risk of BPD. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, pulmonary colonization with Ureaplasma increased the risk of BPD by three folds in premature infants. However, a recent randomized trial reported that the eradication of Ureaplasma by azithromycin failed to decrease the risk of BPD. Although the trial was underpowered to detect a difference in BPD due to funding problems, it indirectly supports the idea that Ureaplasma was not associated with BPD. Noticeably, the detection and diagnosis criteria of Ureaplasma and BPD vary greatly among these studies, which may partially explain the elusive association between Ureaplasma and BPD.

In clinical practice, we observed that infants at a radiographically infectious status display a different respiratory clinical course than those with colonization alone. Inspired by Castro-Alcaraz and colleagues who found the pattern of Ureaplasma colonization was essential, this study aims to investigate the association between the proven infection of Ureaplasma with BPD and to evaluate the effect of azithromycin treatment on BPD.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114JTk2S]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

M. genitalium is associated with symptoms of urethritis and urethral inflammation and accounts for 15%–25% of NGU cases in the United States. Among men with symptoms of urethritis, M. genitalium was detected in 11% of those with urethritis in Australia, 12%–15% in the United Kingdom, 15% in South Africa, 19% in China, 21% in Korea, 22% in Japan, and 28.7% in the United States (range: 20.4%–38.8%). Data are inconsistent regarding other Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species as etiologic agents of urethritis. The majority of men with Ureaplasma infections do not have overt disease unless a high organism load is present.

### Periprosthetic joint infection withdetected by 16S rRNA PCR [^1136K3Th]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Usual culture methods to identify pathogenic bacteria can be unsuccessful, particularly when working with fastidious organisms. We present a case of early periprosthetic knee joint infection with Ureaplasma parvum only identified using 16S ribosomal RNA PCR. This case represents the impact molecular methods of bacterial identification can have on clinical care allowing for more targeted antimicrobial therapy; something which is imperative in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance.

### The role of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma in adverse pregnancy outcomes [^113F5g3i]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Genital mycoplasmas are frequently found in the vaginal flora across socioeconomic and ethnic groups and have been demonstrated to be involved in adverse perinatal outcomes. Both Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma spp cause inflammation potentially leading to spontaneous preterm birth and PPROM as well as postdelivery infectious complications and neonatal infections. Herein we have provided an overview of the existing literature and supportive evidence for genital mycoplasma's role in perinatal complications. Future research will need to focus on clearly delineating the species, allowing for discrimination of their effects.

### An unusual and difficult to detect cause of infection in two trauma patients [^112ua8gn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Understanding optimal antimicrobial selection is limited by lack of standardized methods and clinical breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Additionally, clinical data on the treatment of these organisms are limited to case reports and series, with limited data on clinical or microbiological response. Beta-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin are inactive because they target the cell wall. Myoplasma and Ureaplasma spp. are generally susceptible to agents that inhibit protein synthesis. Fluoroquinolones, which are bactericidal against mycoplasmas should be considered for empiric treatment. Doxycycline should also be considered, although resistance may be increasing. It is reasonable to use combination therapy (eg, moxifloxacin and doxycycline).

### Efficacy of standard therapies against Ureaplasma species and persistence among men with non-gonococcal urethritis enrolled in a randomised controlled trial [^114bF4G4]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 (UU-2), but not Ureaplasma parvum (UP), has been associated with non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), but little is known about species-specific responses to standard therapies. We examined species-specific treatment outcomes and followed men with treatment failure for 9weeks.

Methods

From May 2007 to July 2011, men aged ≥ 16 attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Seattle, Washington, with NGU (urethral discharge or urethral symptoms plus ≥ 5 polymorphonuclear leucocytes /high-powered field) enrolled in a double-blind, randomised trial. Participants received active azithromycin (1g) + placebo doxycycline or active doxycycline (100mg twice a day ×7days) + placebo azithromycin. Ureaplasma were detected in culture followed by species-specific PCR. Outcomes were assessed at 3, 6 and 9weeks. At 3weeks, men with persistent Ureaplasma detection received 'reverse therapy' (e.g., active doxycycline if they first received active azithromycin). At 6weeks, persistently positive men received moxifloxacin (400mg×7days).

Results

Of 490 men, 107 (22%) and 60 (12%) were infected with UU-2 and UP, respectively, and returned at 3weeks. Persistent detection was similar for UU-2-infected men initially treated with azithromycin or doxycycline (25% vs. 31%; p = 0.53), but differed somewhat for men with UP (45% vs. 24%; p = 0.11). At 6weeks, 57% of UU-2-infected and 63% of UP-infected men who received both drugs had persistent detection. Failure after moxifloxacin occurred in 30% and 36%, respectively. Persistent detection of UU-2 or UP was not associated with signs/symptoms of NGU.

Conclusions

Persistent detection after treatment with doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin was common for UU and UP, but not associated with persistent urethritis.

Trial Registration Number

NCT00358462.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^116T8WR7]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Similarly, asymptomatic carrying of Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) and Mycoplasma hominis (MH) is common, most people will not develop into diseases, and there is not enough evidence to prove that it is beneficial to detect and treat these infections, so it is not recommended to carry out routine detection and treatment for asymptomatic or symptomatic men and women. On the other hand, some studies suggest that the presence of UU and MH is related to the abnormal sperm parameters, sperm vitality and Progressive motility of UU infected men were significantly lower than those of uninfected men, and the mean sperm concentration was also lower. The relationship between UU infection and sperm quality or male fertility is also debated.

Therefore, we designed this study to find more evidence of the effect of asymptomatic leukocytospermia and UU infection on sperm quality and whether antibiotic therapy is beneficial.

### Rare case ofseptic arthritis in an immunocompetent patient [^112HxF34]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Mycoplasmatacea family comprises two genera: Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma Ureaplasma parvum (previously known as U. urealyticum biovar 1) commonly colonises the urogenital tract in humans. Although Ureaplasma species have well-established pathogenicity in urogenital infections, its involvement in septic arthritis has been limited to prosthetic joint infections and immunocompromised individuals. We present a rare case of native right knee infection due to U. parvum identified using next-generation sequencing of microbial cell-free DNA testing and confirmed with PCR assays. This rare case of Ureaplasma septic arthritis was diagnosed using newer next-generation DNA sequencing diagnostic modalities and a literature review of prior cases, antibiotic coverage and antimicrobial resistance is incorporated as part of the discussion.

### Antibiotics for Ureaplasma in the vagina in pregnancy [^114mfbwq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm birth is a significant obstetric problem in high-income countries. Genital infection including ureaplasmas are suspected of playing a role in preterm birth and preterm rupture of the membranes. Antibiotics are used to treat women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes and results in prolongation of pregnancy and lowers the risks of maternal and neonatal infection. However, antibiotics may be beneficial earlier in pregnancy to eradicate potentially causative agents.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to assess whether antibiotic treatment of pregnant women with ureaplasma in the vagina reduces the incidence of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (April 2003).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared any antibiotic regimen with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with ureaplasma detected in the vagina.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers independently assessed eligibility and trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

One trial involving 1071 women was included. Of these, 644 randomly received antibiotic treatment (174 erythromycin estolate, 224 erythromycin sterate, and 246 clindamycin hydrochloride) and 427 received placebo. This trial did not report data on preterm birth. Incidence of low birthweight less than 2500 grams was only evaluated for erythromycin (combined) (n = 398) compared to placebo (n = 427) and there was no statistically significant difference between those treated and those not treated (relative risk (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.07). In regards to side-effects sufficient to stop treatment, data were available for all women, and there were no statistically significant differences between any antibiotic (combined) and the placebo group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.85).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to show whether giving antibiotics to women with ureaplasma in the vagina will prevent preterm birth.

### Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^116Ry7Lq]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum may colonize the human genital tract and have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Chorioamnionitis, spontaneous preterm labour and preterm premature rupture of membranes are significant contributors to neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, as these bacteria can reside in the normal vaginal flora, there are controversies regarding their true role during pregnancy and thus the need to treat these organisms.

Recent Findings

We review here the recent data on the epidemiology of mycoplasmas and their clinical role during pregnancy. The association of these organisms with preterm labour has been suggested by many observational studies, but proof of causality remains limited. PCR is an excellent alternative to culture to detect the presence of these organisms, but culture allows antibiotic susceptibility testing. Whether antimicrobial treatment of mycoplasma-colonized pregnant patients can effectively reduce the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes warrants further investigations.

Summary

The role of Mycoplasma spp. and U. urealyticum in adverse pregnancy outcomes is increasingly accepted. However, sole presence of these microorganisms in the vaginal flora might be insufficient to cause pathological issues, but their combination with other factors such as bacterial vaginosis or cervical incompetence may be additionally needed to induce preterm birth.

### Vaginal Ureaplasma parvum serovars and spontaneous preterm birth [^112FTbp6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma species (spp) are the bacteria most often isolated from the amniotic cavity of women with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes; thus, the link between intrauterine Ureaplasma spp infection and adverse pregnancy outcome clearly is established. However, because vaginal Ureaplasma spp colonization is very common in pregnant women, the reason that these microorganisms cause ascending infections in some cases but remain asymptomatic in most pregnancies is not clear. Previous studies suggested an association between vaginal colonization with Ureaplasma parvum as opposed to U urealyticum and preterm delivery. However, because of the high frequency of vaginal Ureaplasma spp colonization during pregnancy, additional risk factors are needed to select a group of women who might benefit from treatment.

Objective

To further identify pregnant women who are at increased risk for preterm delivery, the aim of the present study was to investigate U parvum serovar-specific pathogenicity in a large clinical cohort.

Study Design

We serotyped 1316 samples that were positive for U parvum using a high-resolution melt polymerase chain reaction assay, and results were correlated with pregnancy outcome.

Results

Within U parvum positive samples, serovar 3 was the most common isolate (43.3%), followed by serovar 6 (31.4%) and serovar 1 (25.2%). There was a significantly increased risk for spontaneous preterm birth at very low (< 32 weeks gestation; P < .005) and extremely low (< 28 weeks gestation; P < .005) gestational age in the group with vaginal U parvum serovar 3 colonization compared with the control group of pregnant women who tested negative for vaginal Ureaplasma spp colonization. This association was found for neither serovar 1 nor serovar 6. The combination of vaginal U parvum serovar 3 colonization and diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy or a history of preterm birth further increased the risk for adverse pregnancy outcome.

Conclusion

Colonization with U parvum serovar 3, but not serovar 1 or serovar 6, in early pregnancy is associated with preterm delivery at very and extremely low gestational age. The combination of U parvum serovar 3 colonization and a history of preterm birth or bacterial vaginosis further increases the risk for spontaneous preterm birth at low gestational age and may define a target group for therapeutic intervention studies.

### Ureaplasma parvum prosthetic joint infection detected by PCR [^114ja68W]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

We describe the first reported case of Ureaplasma parvum prosthetic joint infection (PJI) detected by PCR. Ureaplasma species do not possess a cell wall and are usually associated with colonization and infection of mucosal surfaces (not prosthetic material). U. parvum is a relatively new species name for certain serovars of Ureaplasma urealyticum, and PCR is useful for species determination. Our patient presented with late infection of his right total knee arthroplasty. Intraoperative fluid and tissue cultures and pre- and postoperative synovial fluid cultures were all negative. To discern the pathogen, we employed PCR coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). Our patient's failure to respond to empirical antimicrobial treatment and our previous experience with PCR/ESI-MS in culture-negative cases of infection prompted us to use this approach over other diagnostic modalities. PCR/ESI-MS detected U. parvum in all samples. U. parvum-specific PCR testing was performed on all synovial fluid samples to confirm the U. parvum detection.

### Maternal azithromycin therapy for Ureaplasma parvum intraamniotic infection improves fetal hemodynamics in a nonhuman primate model [^1123shaW]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma parvum infection is a prevalent cause of intrauterine infection associated with preterm birth, preterm premature rupture of membranes, fetal inflammatory response syndrome, and adverse postnatal sequelae. Elucidation of diagnostic and treatment strategies for infection-associated preterm labor may improve perinatal and long-term outcomes for these cases.

Objective

This study assessed the effect of intraamniotic Ureaplasma infection on fetal hemodynamic and cardiac function and the effect of maternal antibiotic treatment on these outcomes.

Study Design

Chronically catheterized pregnant rhesus monkeys were assigned to control (n = 6), intraamniotic inoculation with Ureaplasma parvum (10⁷ colony-forming units/mL, n = 15), and intraamniotic infection plus azithromycin treatment (12.5 mg/kg twice a day intravenously, n = 8) groups. At approximately 135 days' gestation (term = 165 days), pulsed and color Doppler ultrasonography was used to obtain measurements of fetal hemodynamics (pulsatility index of umbilical artery, ductus venosus, descending aorta, ductus arteriosus, aortic isthmus, right pulmonary artery, middle cerebral artery and cerebroplacental ratio, and left and right ventricular cardiac outputs) and cardiac function (ratio of peak early vs late transmitral flow velocity [marker of ventricular function], Tei index [myocardial performance index]). These indices were stratified by amniotic fluid proinflammatory mediator levels and cardiac histology.

Results

Umbilical and fetal pulmonary artery vascular impedances were significantly increased in animals from the intraamniotic inoculation with Ureaplasma parvum group (P < .05). Azithromycin treatment restored values to control levels. Amniotic fluid prostaglandin F2 alpha levels were significantly higher in animals with abnormal umbilical artery pulsatility index (> 1.1) than in those with normal blood flow (P < .05; Spearman ρ = 0.6, P < .05). In the intraamniotic inoculation with Ureaplasma parvum group, left ventricular cardiac output was significantly decreased (P < .001), and more animals had abnormal right-to-left ventricular cardiac output ratios (defined as > 1.6, P < .05). Amniotic fluid interleukin-6 concentrations were elevated in cases of abnormal right-to-left ventricular cardiac output ratios compared with those in normal cases (P < .05).

Conclusion

Fetal hemodynamic alterations were associated with intraamniotic Ureaplasma infection and ameliorated after maternal antibiotic treatment. Doppler ultrasonographic measurements merit continuing investigation as a diagnostic method to identify fetal cardiovascular and hemodynamic compromise associated with intrauterine infection or inflammation and in the evaluation of therapeutic interventions or clinical management of preterm labor.

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis for the prevention of preterm birth [ACTRN12610000607077] [^112BDPbc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Infection and preterm birth

Microbiological studies suggest that intrauterine infections account for 25–40% of preterm births; but this is likely to be an under-estimate because intrauterine infection is difficult to detect with conventional culture techniques. The mechanisms by which intrauterine infections lead to preterm labour relate to activation of the innate immune system. Microorganisms are recognised by pattern-recognition receptors which in turn elicit the release of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Microbial endotoxins and proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the production of prostaglandins, other inflammatory mediators, and matrix-degrading enzymes. Prostaglandins stimulate uterine contractility and initiate labour, while degradation of extracellular matrix in the fetal membranes leads to preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes.

Recognition that it is ascending infection that leads to preterm birth has led to a number of studies that have evaluated the treatment of vaginal infection in pregnancy to reduce preterm birth. To date, most of the intervention trials have found little effect on the rate of preterm birth. Antibiotics prior to pregnancy do not reduce preterm birth. A Cochrane systematic review of the effectiveness of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis to prevent prematurity concludes that there is "little evidence that screening and treating all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis will prevent preterm birth and its consequences". Similarly, antibiotic treatment of vaginal Ureaplasma urealyticum and Chlamydia trachomatis have not significantly reduced preterm birth rates. Finally, there is a possibility that the use of metronidazole to treat trichomoniasis in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of prematurity.

In contrast to these negative results, a recent randomised controlled trial of antenatal screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis and/or trichomoniasis in early pregnancy (15–19 weeks gestation) among over 4 000 asymptomatic pregnant women reduced the spontaneous preterm birth rate by 46%. The benefit appeared to be limited to those women who were treated for asymptomatic candidiasis, however this interpretation is based on post-hoc subgroup analysis of this trial. On the other hand, two observational studies that included Candida in pregnancy, conducted in low socioeconomic populations in the United States in the 1980 s, found no association with preterm birth although one found a significantly increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation among women with candidiasis (aOR 1.94, 95%CI 1.2–3.1). Importantly, in the latter, studies screening was performed later in pregnancy (22–30 weeks gestation) and did not include women with low-level Candida colonisation. Such conflicting results emphasise the need to evaluate interventions with appropriately designed randomised clinical trials.

### Investigation of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species using a molecular method in male patients suffering from urethritis symptoms: a cross-sectional study in the city of antalya [^112mz5G9]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) spread predominantly through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. More than 30 different bacteria, viruses, and parasites are transmitted through sexual contact. The characteristic findings of urethritis include urethral discharge, dysuria, itching, and burning in the anterior urethra. However, not all men with urethritis present with symptoms.

Infectious urethritis is typically caused by a sexually transmitted pathogen; thus, most cases occur in sexually active young men. The most common cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is Chlamydia (C) trachomatis, followed by Mycoplasma (M) genitalium. Ureaplasma (U) spp. and M. hominis may occur as commensals in the lower genital tract in many healthy sexually active adults. The role of ureaplasmas in NGU has long been controversial. U. urealyticum in high bacterial loads might cause a small proportion of male NGU cases, but in most men with U. urealyticum infection/colonization, NGU does not develop. Evidence that M. hominis and U. parvum cause NGU is lacking. Furthermore, almost half of all NGU cases have no specific etiology.

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the fastest and sensitive diagnostic method for gonococcal urethritis and NGU. It allows the use of noninvasive samples, such as first-void urine samples and self-collected swabs. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV recommends the use of nucleic acid amplification tests as the only useful diagnostic method for M. genitalium infection in clinical samples.

Empirical treatment of NGU usually involves doxycycline or as an alternative azithromycin therapy. It is recommended that M. genitalium infection be considered in all patients with persistent urethritis despite initial empirical therapy, and if possible, a test to detect macrolide resistance should be performed. The prevalence of macrolide resistance in M. genitalium limits the usefulness of azithromycin-based regimens.

The main aim of this study was to determine the presence of M. genitalium, M. hominis, U. urealyticum, and U. parvum in male patients with symptoms of urethritis using molecular methods. In addition, this study investigated macrolide resistance in M. genitalium –positive samples. Other pathogenic agents of urethritis, such as Neisseria (N) gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas (T) vaginalis, were also examined in the samples.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^115u1afc]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic sensitivity test showed that the susceptible rate of Cyclolipoerythromycin was 94.74%, Minocycline was 93.68%, and doxycycline was 92.63% (Fig. 1), As doxycycline is inexpensive and easily available, we usually recommend doxycycline for patients who are susceptible to doxycycline and have no history of allergies or contraindications, and choose 7-day or 14-day treatment plan according to the patient's wishes. As a result, 14 UU-positive patients were treated with other sensitive antibiotics due to antibiotic sensitivity tests showing doxycycline resistance or intermediate sensitivity, or for other reasons, and 81 UU-positive patients received doxycycline treatment. We collected 52 patients with a 7-day treatment plan and 29 patients with a 14 day treatment plan with doxycycline, the cure rates were 84.62% and 89.66% respectively, and there was no significant difference between the two treatment plans (p = 0.738). (Table 2). At the same time, we also found that the two treatment plans have no significant difference in semen volume, PH, sperm concentration, PR, total motility and normal morphology for UU cured patients (p = 0.490, p = 0.529, p = 0.995, p = 0.592, p = 0.486 and p = 0.293, respectively). (Table 3).

### Molecular methods for the detection of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma infections in humans: a paper from the 2011 william beaumont hospital symposium on molecular pathology [^112adnXo]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2012). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species are well-known human pathogens responsible for a broad array of inflammatory conditions involving the respiratory and urogenital tracts of neonates, children, and adults. Greater attention is being given to these organisms in diagnostic microbiology, largely as a result of improved methods for their laboratory detection, made possible by powerful molecular-based techniques that can be used for primary detection in clinical specimens. For slow-growing species, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma genitalium, molecular-based detection is the only practical means for rapid microbiological diagnosis. Most molecular-based methods used for detection and characterization of conventional bacteria have been applied to these organisms. A complete genome sequence is available for one or more strains of all of the important human pathogens in the Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma genera. Information gained from genome analyses and improvements in efficiency of DNA sequencing are expected to significantly advance the field of molecular detection and genotyping during the next few years. This review provides a summary and critical review of methods suitable for detection and characterization of mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas of humans, with emphasis on molecular genotypic techniques.

### Azithromycin, Ureaplasma and chronic lung disease of prematurity: a case study for neonatal drug development [^1139gNta]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Ureaplasma has received intermittent attention over the last two decades as a possible contributory factor. In addition, pulmonary inflammation is associated with the development of CLD. The macrolide azithromycin provides an attractive option to determine if it can decrease the development of CLD as it has both anti-inflammatory and anti-infective properties. In this article, the authors review the evidence for the role of Ureaplasma in the development of CLD and the obstacles faced in the development of a drug before it reaches clinical practice.

### High-resolution melt PCR analysis for genotyping of Ureaplasma parvum isolates directly from clinical samples [^116JyKYh]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Ureaplasma sp. infection in neonates and adults underlies a variety of disease pathologies. Of the two human Ureaplasma spp. Ureaplasma parvum is clinically the most common. We have developed a high-resolution melt (HRM) PCR assay for the differentiation of the four serovars of U. parvum in a single step. Currently U. parvum strains are separated into four serovars by sequencing the promoter and coding region of the multiple-banded antigen (MBA) gene. We designed primers to conserved sequences within this region for PCR amplification and HRM analysis to generate reproducible and distinct melt profiles that distinguish clonal representatives of serovars 1, 3, 6, and 14. Furthermore, our HRM PCR assay could classify DNA extracted from 74 known (MBA-sequenced) test strains with 100% accuracy. Importantly, HRM PCR was also able to identify U. parvum serovars directly from 16 clinical swabs. HRM PCR performed with DNA consisting of mixtures of combined known serovars yielded profiles that were easily distinguished from those for single-serovar controls. These profiles mirrored clinical samples that contained mixed serovars. Unfortunately, melt curve analysis software is not yet robust enough to identify the composition of mixed serovar samples, only that more than one serovar is present. HRM PCR provides a single-step, rapid, cost-effective means to differentiate the four serovars of U. parvum that did not amplify any of the known 10 serovars of Ureaplasma urealyticum tested in parallel. Choice of reaction reagents was found to be crucial to allow sufficient sensitivity to differentiate U. parvum serovars directly from clinical swabs rather than requiring cell enrichment using microbial culture techniques.

### Ureaplasma parvum genotype, combined vaginal colonisation with Candida albicans, and spontaneous preterm birth in an Australian cohort of pregnant women [^116YkAJQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Although we have discussed the results of our study in terms of presence/absence of specific bacteria at ~21 weeks GA (primarily as this is of major relevance to allow implementation of suitable treatment regimens for prevention of PTB), our study also examined vaginal samples at two additional time points (~28 weeks and ~36 weeks GA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the dynamics of Ureaplasma spp. Mycoplasma spp. and Candida spp. throughout the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. We demonstrated that detection of all organisms (with the exception of C. glabrata) was very stable throughout the three sampling points, particularly so for M. genitalium and U. parvum. In addition, for U. parvum we also demonstrated that in nearly all cases, the genotype detected at recruitment was maintained throughout the second and third time points. These are very important findings as they demonstrate that detection of these organisms early in the second trimester of pregnancy is highly predictive of their presence both early and late in the third trimester, and provides valuable information for future diagnostic assays aiming to predict women at risk of PTB.

Of significant relevance to use of U. parvum detection assays in future clinical diagnostic applications, we showed near 100% concordance between detection of Ureaplasma spp. in clinical samples using either culture-based or PCR methods, in contrast to some previous authors who reported disparities between the two techniques. It has been well established that Ureaplasma sp. cells are fragile and in order to optimise recovery from clinical samples, special attention needs to be paid to sample collection, storage and transportation, in addition to the media used for culture. Our results are most likely a reflection of our highly stringent sample collection and culture conditions, whereby swabs were immediately placed into UTM media, stored at 4 °C and cultured in 10B broth within 24 h of collection under microaerophilic conditions. This is important, as despite the increased use of molecular methods for detection of Ureaplasma spp. culture is likely to play a key role alongside these in future studies attempting to document virulence traits of strains associated with specific disease phenotypes.

### Mycoplasma endocarditis: two case reports and a review [^114An5y5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

We describe 2 patients with endocarditis for whom blood cultures and cardiac valve cultures were repeatedly sterile. Broad-range eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification performed on cardiac valve specimens from these 2 patients detected DNA of Mycoplasma hominis, for one patient, and of Ureaplasma parvum, for the other patient. Three other cases of infective endocarditis caused by mycoplasmas were identified in the literature. It is important to rule out a diagnosis of mycoplasma endocarditis because the evolution of the disease may be fatal and it requires an adequate and specific antibiotic therapy.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^116Gwzym]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium (M. genitalium) testing and screening — M. genitalium is a recognized pathogen causing nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in males and cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in females, with 15%–25% of infections due to this organism; NAATs are the best option for detection. Currently, 2 NAATs for M. genitalium are FDA cleared (Hologic Aptima M. Gen Assay and Abbott's Alinity STI assay) for use with urine and urethral, penile meatal, endocervical, and vaginal swab samples. Routine screening is not recommended in asymptomatic men or women, and testing should be considered in persistent NGU or PID. Molecular tests for resistance markers to macrolides and fluoroquinolones are not commercially available in the United States, and culture or NAATs for Ureaplasma are not recommended because of the high prevalence of colonization in asymptomatic, sexually active people.

### Neonatal meningitis and subdural empyema caused by an unusual pathogen [^113dby4y]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

We report a case of neonatal meningitis with subdural empyema, caused by Ureaplasma parvum. In this case, diagnosis was made by genus-specific polymerase chain reaction, after regularly used diagnostic techniques failed. This unusual pathogen should be considered in cases that do not respond to therapy and/or where cultures for typical pathogens in neonatal sepsis and meningitis remain negative.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^1142dxhz]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed adult males who visited Guilin People's Hospital due to infertility and performed routine semen analysis and UU screening and treatment for patients with leukocytospermia from April 2017 to December 2019. After excluded patients with systemic diseases, cryptorchidism, chromosome abnormalities, varicocele, male azoospermia, bacteriospermia, as well as patients who drank excessively, smoked heavily, had symptoms of genitourinary tract infection or a history of antibiotic use in recent 4 weeks, 1530 patients and medical records were finally collected. Among them, 295 cases were diagnosed with leukocytospermia, 95 cases were further screened for UU-positive, 81 cases were treated with doxycycline, and 14 cases were treated with other sensitive antibiotics due to antibiotic sensitivity tests showing doxycycline resistance or intermediate sensitivity, or for other reasons. The semen parameters of non-leukocytospermia, leukocytospermia, UU-positive leukocytospermia and UU-negative leukocytospermia groups were compared, and the differences between two treatment plans with doxycycline and the semen parameters before UU treatment and 1 month after UU-cured were compared. The study was approved by the ethical review committee.

### Antibiotics for Ureaplasma in the vagina in pregnancy [^115d4c4A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm birth is a significant perinatal problem contributing to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Heavy vaginal ureaplasma colonisation is suspected of playing a role in preterm birth and preterm rupture of the membranes. Antibiotics are used to treat infections and have been used to treat pregnant women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, resulting in some short-term improvements. However, the benefit of using antibiotics in early pregnancy to treat heavy vaginal colonisation is unclear.

Objectives

To assess whether antibiotic treatment of pregnant women with heavy vaginal ureaplasma colonisation reduces the incidence of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic regimen with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with ureaplasma detected in the vagina.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included one trial, involving 1071 women. Of these, 644 women between 22 weeks and 32 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to one of three groups of antibiotic treatment (n = 174 erythromycin estolate, n = 224 erythromycin stearate, and n = 246 clindamycin hydrochloride) or a placebo (n = 427). Preterm birth data was not reported in this trial. Incidence of low birthweight less than 2500 grams was only evaluated for erythromycin (combined, n = 398) compared to placebo (n = 427) and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.07). There were no statistically significant differences in side effects sufficient to stop treatment between either group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.85).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to assess whether pregnant women who have vaginal colonisation with ureaplasma should be treated with antibiotics to prevent preterm birth. Preterm birth is a significant perinatal problem. Upper genital tract infections, including ureaplasmas, are suspected of playing a role in preterm birth and preterm rupture of the membranes. Antibiotics are used to treat women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes; this may result in prolongation of pregnancy and lowers the risks of maternal and neonatal infection. However, antibiotics may be beneficial earlier in pregnancy to eradicate potentially causative agents.

### A quantitative analysis of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum compared with host immune response in preterm neonates at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^1149CHX2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Multiplex, real-time PCR for the identification of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum was performed on nucleic acids extracted from sequential endotracheal aspirates obtained from preterm neonates born at < 29 weeks of gestation and ventilated for more than 48 h admitted to two level 3 neonatal intensive care units. Specimens were obtained shortly after birth and sequentially up until extubation. One hundred fifty-two specimens (93.8%) contained material suitable for analysis. Ureaplasma spp. were identified in 5 of 13 neonates studied. In most cases, the DNA load of the detected Ureaplasma species was low and decreased over time. In addition, changes in detectable Ureaplasma species DNA did not relate to changes in the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) or respiratory status. All but two blood samples obtained at times of suspected sepsis were culture positive for other microorganisms; the species cultured were typically coagulase-negative staphylococci and were associated with increased levels of CRP (> 10 mg/liter). This study was limited by the small number of patients examined and does not have the power to support or contradict the hypothesis that postnatal lung infection with Ureaplasma parvum is causally related to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or adverse respiratory outcomes after preterm birth. However, in this study, increases in CRP levels were not associated with patients in whom Ureaplasma parvum was detected, in contrast to the detection of other bacterial species.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^113J8r2Z]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study showed that Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia before treatment was not independently associated with BPD development in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants, despite a remarkably higher rate of BPD in infants with Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia compared to those with colonization (44.6% vs. 17.7%). In contrast, an effective azithromycin treatment was significantly associated with decreased risk for BPD in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants [OR 0.011, 95% CI (0.000, 0.250)].

Ureaplasma is smaller than bacteria in diameter and colonizes in the genitourinary tract of pregnant women. Ureaplasma might transmit to the new-borns respiratory tract in the uterus or during delivery, causing interstitial pneumonia and closely associated BPD in premature infants. Some speculations are proposed on the role of Ureaplasma in the pathogenesis of BPD. Phospholipase released by Ureaplasma has long been considered as the virulence factor causing epithelium necrosis. Infants who died from Ureaplasma pneumonia exhibited severe fibrosis, indicating fibroblast involvement. Besides, Ureaplasma infection increased the infiltration of inflammatory cells, releasing cytokines of interleukin 6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF α) and contributing to late-onset sepsis (LOS). These pathophysiological processes justify using interstitial pneumonia as an essential parameter for Ureaplasma infection in the current study. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a persistent association between Ureaplasma and BPD in preterm infants. However, our findings suggest that an infective pattern of Ureaplasma was not independently associated with the onset of BPD.

Since Ureaplasma in broncho alveolar lavage fluids was first reported in 1988, the role of Ureaplasma in morbidities of prematurity, especially in BPD, has drawn the great interest of neonatologists. However, infants tested positive for Ureaplasma are not routinely treated in NICUs, given that no evidence supports that eradication of Ureaplasma reduces the risk for BPD. Several researchers speculated that the pattern of Ureaplasma infection might determine its contribution to BPD. Castro-Alcaraz et al. reported that only persistent Ureaplasma colonization was associated with BPD. Maternal Ureaplasma abundance might increase the risk of BPD. In the current study, we found Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia was not significantly associated with a higher risk of BPD, despite a striking clinical effect being noticed.

### Extensive horizontal gene transfer in ureaplasmas from humans questions the utility of serotyping for diagnostic purposes [^11268j4a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum are sexually transmitted, opportunistic pathogens of the human urogenital tract. There are 14 known serovars distributed between the two species. For decades, it has been postulated based upon limited data that virulence is related to serotype specificity. The results were often inconclusive due to the small sample size and extensive cross-reactivity between certain serovars. We developed real-time quantitative PCRs that allow reliable differentiation of the two species and type strains of each of the 14 serovars. To investigate species and serovar distributions, we typed 1,061 clinical isolates of human ureaplasmas from diverse patient populations. There was only a tenuous association between individual Ureaplasma serovars and certain patient populations. This may in part be explained by the fact that almost 40% of the isolates were genetic mosaics, apparently arising from the recombination of multiple serovars. This explains the extensive cross-reactivity based upon serotyping and the lack of consistent association of given serotypes with disease.

### Ureaplasma parvum serovar 6 may be a novel element in the progression of HPV infection to CIN: a cross-sectional study of 7058 women [^116ZGRBp]. The Journal of Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma parvum (U. parvum) is generally regarded as innocuous, and studies focusing on variations in pathogenicity among U. parvum serovars are inadequate. We elucidated the variations in the pathogenicity of U. parvum serovars in promoting human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

Methods

This cross-sectional study used baseline data from a Chinese multicenter prospective cohort of women of childbearing age undergoing routine cervical cancer screening. We employed multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate the pathogenic effects of specific U. parvum serovars on HPV infection and CIN. Causal mediation analysis was performed to ascertain the direct effects of specific U. parvum serovars on CIN and their indirect implications via HPV infection.

Findings

The final data analysis encompassed 7058 participants. Upon adjusting for confounding factors, a positive association was observed between U. parvum serovars 1, 3, and 6 and HPV infection (OR 1.53, 95%CI 1.15–2.03; OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.06–1.64; OR 2.34, 95%CI 1.90–2.87); however, only participants with U. parvum serovar 6 showed an increased risk of CIN (OR 1.90, 95%CI 1.19–3.02). No substantial correlation was observed between U. parvum serovar 14 and HPV or CIN incidence. HPV infection potentially mediates the influence of U. parvum serovar 6 on CIN, with a mediation proportion of 76.66%.

Interpretations

Our findings suggest that different U. parvum serovars vary in pathogenicity regarding HPV and CIN. Early detection of specific U. parvum serovars, such as U. parvum serovar 6, in HPV-infected individuals may enable early intervention therapies and reduce the risk of CIN development.

### Ureaplasma parvum genotype, combined vaginal colonisation with Candida albicans, and spontaneous preterm birth in an Australian cohort of pregnant women [^111GTiC1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

We did not detect a significant association between the presence of vaginal Candida spp. alone and PTB, a result that contradicts four previous studies and a recent systematic review, although we did observe a trend towards significance. This warrants further investigation in a larger cohort of women. However, when vaginal colonisation by U. parvum was accompanied by C. albicans (the most commonly detected Candida spp. in our study), the odds ratio (OR) for risk of PTB increased marginally from 3.32 (U. parvum alone) to 3.77 (both organisms). Stratifying U. parvum by genotype, additional increases in risk were seen when C. albicans was combined with U. parvum genotype SV6, with the OR rising from 4.17 to 5.16. Both organisms have previously been associated with increased PTB risk, while colonisation of amniotic fluid by C. albicans has been linked to severe fetal injury; however, no previous studies have looked at the effects of combined asymptomatic vaginal colonisation and pregnancy outcome, particularly regarding U. parvum genotype. Further research is warranted, firstly to confirm our novel findings in a larger cohort, and second to attempt to uncover what factors may be responsible for this association. If our findings are confirmed, then detection of these two organisms during the early second trimester of pregnancy could prove to be a useful indicator of women at a high risk of infection-associated PTB and therefore targets for antimicrobial therapy.

### PCR methods in clinical investigations of human ureaplasmas: a minireview [^115YHte4]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Human ureaplasmas are small, cell-wall-deficient organisms that are implicated in many human infections. Due to their small size and fastidious growth requirements, ureaplasmal infections are hard to diagnose clinically, and ureaplasmal disease is difficult to study in clinical samples. Standard culture methods for ureaplasmas are technically challenging, and 3 to 5 days are required to identify this pathogen. PCR methods have been increasingly used in the diagnosis of these infections and in the study of this pathogen in human specimens from multiple sites. These methods have theoretical advantages over traditional culture methods. Organism identification can occur in the presence of low numbers of bacteria, and viability is not necessary. Rapid identification of organisms within 24 h is also possible. In addition, subtyping of isolates can be performed faster with PCR methods than with culture methods. The use of PCR methods in translational research in multiple human ureaplasmal diseases will be reviewed in this paper, and their usefulness will be compared to culture methods.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^114QKPAN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonisation is an independent risk factor for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Evidence from clinical studies, and experimental infection models, established lung Ureaplasma as proinflammatory and profibrotic, contributing to BPD alone or when combined with inflammatory stimuli such as hyperoxia or mechanical ventilation. Whether eradicating Ureasplasma from the developing lung will reduce the risk for BPD is unknown.

Since azithromycin exhibits high potency against clinical Ureaplasma isolates in vitroand immunomodulatory properties, it is an appropriate therapeutic candidate to eradicate Ureaplasma and reduce inflammation-mediated BPD in preterm infants. We conducted open-label, pilot studies characterising the population pharmacokinetics, safety and microbiological efficacy of intravenous 10 and 20 mg/kg single dose and 20 mg/kg x3d multidose azithromycin in 24–28 week gestation infants. In the open-label, uncontrolled 20 mg/kg multidose study, azithromycin eradicated Ureaplasma and appeared safe, with no deaths or serious adverse events attributed to the drug. We performed the current pilot (phase IIb) randomised clinical trial to test: (1) the feasibility of recruitment and Ureaplasma detection; (2) whether the 3-day azithromycin regimen was safe and was more effective than placebo to eradicate Ureaplasma in colonised infants; and (3) whether azithromycin would be beneficial or harmful in the subgroups of Ureaplasma -positive and Ureaplasma -negative infants. Respiratory outcomes were explored as potential endpoints for a later phase III trial.

### Intrauterine detection of Ureaplasma species after vaginal colonization in pregnancy and neonatal outcome [^1137iwrM]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The identification of risk factors for ascending U.spp. infections remains challenging. Previous studies could not consistently demonstrate why these commensals can lead to ascending infections with colonization of the amniotic membranes and the placenta but stay clinically silent in most cases, and approaches to explain a potential pathomechanism are controversial. Much work has been done into investigating the pathogenicity of different Ureaplasma biovars or serovars, the composite of the vaginal microbiome or coinfections with other bacteria. In our previous study, we found that U. parvum serovar 3 was associated with the highest risk of preterm birth and this risk was significantly increased if colonization with U. parvum was accompanied by bacterial vaginosis. Payne et al. who screened pregnant women for vaginal U.spp. and Candida spp. found that the odds ratio for preterm birth increased when Candida albicans was found alongside with U. parvum compared to U. parvum alone, while Farr et al. found that vaginal candidosis alone is no significant risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth. Our current data showed higher rates of vaginal candidosis in women with ascending U.spp. infection compared to women without ascending infection, however, numbers are small and data were not statistically significant. These findings are in line with the hypothesis that alterations of the vaginal microbiome, e.g. a Lactobacillus -poor microbiome, accompanied by a high abundance of U.spp. as described by DiGiulio et al. might increase the risk for ascending infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This could be explained by the protective effect of a healthy, mainly lactobacilli-driven microbiome in keeping an acid milieu and preventing other organisms to overgrow and ascend into the intrauterine department. In a paper on ascending bacterial infection, the group by Romero proposed that the risk for ascending infection is not dependent on the type of bacteria present in the vagina but on the capacity of the cervix to control them, and that this anatomical and immunological barrier is altered in the presence of viral infections. Similarly, Pavlidis et al. demonstrated the crucial role of the cervical epithelium as a barrier against ascending infection in a mouse model.

### Doxycycline [^111RFdLa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of doxycycline and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Treatment:

Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections:

Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae.
Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Psittacosis (ornithosis) caused by Chlamydophila psittaci.
Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence.
Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum.
Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis.

Doxycycline is also indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms:

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114Q2PUV]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Follow-Up

Men should be instructed to return to their health care providers if their symptoms do not improve < 72 hours after treatment. Signs and symptoms of epididymitis that do not subside in < 3 days require reevaluation of the diagnosis and therapy. Men who experience swelling and tenderness that persist after completion of antimicrobial therapy should be evaluated for alternative diagnoses, including tumor, abscess, infarction, testicular cancer, TB, and fungal epididymitis.

Management of Sex Partners

Men who have acute sexually transmitted epididymitis confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be instructed to refer all sex partners during the previous 60 days before symptom onset for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). If the last sexual intercourse was > 60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be evaluated and treated. Arrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. EPT is an effective strategy for treating sex partners of men who have or are suspected of having chlamydia or gonorrhea for whom linkage to care is anticipated to be delayed (see Partner Services). Partners should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners are treated and symptoms have resolved.

Special Considerations

Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions

The risk for penicillin cross-reactivity is negligible between all third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone) (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy). Alternative regimens have not been studied; therefore, clinicians should consult an infectious disease specialist if such regimens are required.

HIV Infection

Men with HIV infection who have uncomplicated acute epididymitis should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV. Other etiologic agents have been implicated in acute epididymitis among men with HIV, including CMV, salmonella, toxoplasmosis, U. urealyticum, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma species, and Mima polymorpha.

### Azithromycin for preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1112N8gN]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Azithromycin has anti-Ureaplasma and anti-inflammatory properties that might help reduce lung injury in preterm infants.

Objective

To test the efficacy and safety of prophylactic or therapeutic azithromycin in preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants with unknown or proven Ureaplasma status.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library until 13 September 2020. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted the data. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to yield pooled relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We used the Cochrane GRADE methodology for summarizing the results.

Results

We included five randomized clinical trials. The meta-analysis revealed no significant differences in BPD (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.71, 1.19; low-quality evidence), death (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.52, 1.10; low-quality evidence), and BPD or death (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.74, 1.10; low-quality evidence). However, a significantly lower BPD or death (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70, 0.99) and a trend toward lower BPD (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66, 1.03) with azithromycin therapy was noted in Ureoplasma positive neonates. No differences in secondary outcomes were noted, except for significantly lower supplemental oxygen days with azithromycin (MD, -6.06; 95% CI, -7.40, -4.72; moderate-quality evidence). The test for subgroup differences between short (< 7 days) and long (> 7 days) course of azithromycin were nonsignificant for all the outcomes.

Conclusion

Low-quality evidence suggests azithromycin therapy reduces BPD or death in preterm infants with positive Ureoplasma, but not in all preterm infants.

What is the diagnosis?

Answer:

Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma species infections.

Case 1 had a Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum pelvic collection and metalware infection, and left hip septic arthritis (culture and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] positive). We propose that instrumentation of the genitourinary tract with a urinary catheter led to hematogenous metastatic seeding of these organisms. He was managed with doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, and his fevers subsided and pain improved.

Case 2 had a M. hominis and Ureaplasma species retroperitoneal urinoma likely secondary to the ongoing urinary leak. The patient was commenced on doxycycline and demonstrated clinical improvement.

### Detection of sexually transmitted infection agents in pregnant women using multiplex polymerase chain reaction method [^114ndPUH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of STIs requires rapid, reliable, and effective diagnostic methods to ensure positive outcomes for both individual and public health. As a result, there has been a significant global increase in the use of PCR-based methods. The prevalence of Ureaplasma spp. in pregnant women varies widely (8–93%) depending on diagnostic methods, highlighting its global presence. In this study, Ureaplasma spp. was the most common STI pathogen, followed by C. trachomatis and M. hominis, with co-infection of Ureaplasma spp. and M. hominis being the most frequent. This contrasts with findings from other PCR-based studies. The variability of detected infectious agents depends on factors such as geographical location, population characteristics, individual behaviors, diagnostic methods used, the sample collection process, and the design of multiplex PCR kits. Disease prevalence may vary by region, and access to healthcare services can differ. Population characteristics include age, immune status, and socioeconomic factors, while behavioral factors encompass sexual practices and contraceptive methods. Additionally, the sensitivity of diagnostic techniques, sampling methods, and the pathogens targeted in PCR kits can directly influence infection detection rates. Although Ureaplasma spp. is part of the normal genital flora, it is also associated with infertility and non-gonococcal urethritis. In vitro studies have shown that U. parvum forms biofilms, contributing to chronic and mixed bacterial infections. Additionally, Ureaplasma spp. has been linked to pregnancy complications such as premature rupture of membranes, amniotic fluid infections, preterm birth, and low birth weight.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^111HibKD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition

The primary outcome is bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), diagnosed as an oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or discharge. Secondary outcomes included hospital death, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), duration of invasive and non-invasive ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen and hospitalization. Chest-X-ray (CXR) score, assessed by the total score of three aspects: diffuse granularity, interstitial changes, and emphysema, was used to assess the pulmonary infection status in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants (Table 1). Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia was defined as Ureaplasma Rt-PCR positive with clinical manifestation of CXR score ≥ 2 (Table 1) and an increased leukocyte ≥ 25 × 10⁹/L. Ureaplasma colonization was defined as Ureaplasma Rt-PCR positive with no or mild CXR score < 2, or leukocyte < 25 × 10⁹ /L. Effect of azithromycin treatment was defined as improvement in both CXR (decrease in score) and laboratory leukocyte (less than 20 × 10⁹/L). The diagnostic criteria of Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia are summarized in Table 1. The CXR was assessed by one neonatologist and one radiologist, who was blinded to the study design. The representative photos of CXR were displayed in the Supplemental figure.

Table 1
Algorithm for Ureaplasma associated pneumonia

Diffuse granularity, interstitial changes, and emphysema were assessed independently as none (score 0), mild (score 1), and severe (score 2). A total score was defined as the sum of scores from the three aspects. An infant with a total Chest X-Ray score of more than 2 and a leukocyte more than 25* 10 9 /L was defined as Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia otherwise was colonization.

### Azithromycin for preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely preterm infants: a cohort study [^113BFzkV]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a significant pulmonary morbidity affecting approximately 48%−60% of extremely preterm infants (EPI). Factors contributing to BPD include, but not limited to, antenatal and post‐natal infections, receipt of mechanical ventilation, presence of inflammation, and hyperoxia‐induced injuries. Despite advancements in perinatal care such as antenatal steroids, surfactant replacement, optimized ventilation strategies, and postnatal steroids use, the incidence of BPD has shown minimal change, underscoring the need for innovative interventions in BPD management.

Aberrant regulation of lung inflammation has been considered the most important mechanism for BPD. Thus, anti‐inflammatory therapies offer the potential of preventative and reparative treatment for infants with BPD. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that exhibits both antimicrobial and anti‐inflammatory properties and been used extensively to eradicate Ureaplasma species in preterm infants. Although azithromycin has been proven effective in the treatment of other inflammatory lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), its efficacy on BPD is inconclusive. A meta‐analysis reported azithromycin was associated with a significant reduction in BPD and the duration of supplemental oxygen, however, recent clinical trials have failed to confirm this effect. This discrepancy may be due to the confounding influence of Ureaplasma species infection status in preterm infants. We and others have previously found that different infection statuses of Ureaplasma species might be associated with varying BPD outcomes. Previous studies did not account for the infection status of Ureaplasma species, which may have led to the protective effects of azithromycin being concealed by Ureaplasma species infection, particularly in infants with severe Ureaplasma pneumonia.

Therefore, this study aims to assess the protective effect of azithromycin treatment on BPD in a "clean" cohort, consisting of Ureaplasma species negative infants and those classified as having Ureaplasma species colonization while excluding infants with Ureaplasma species pneumonia.

### Intrauterine detection of Ureaplasma species after vaginal colonization in pregnancy and neonatal outcome [^1119dh96]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

A total of 4,330 pregnant women were enrolled in an earlier prospective observational multi-centre study and screened for vaginal U.spp. colonization in order to investigate a potential association between vaginal U.spp. colonization in early pregnancy and adverse outcome. Ureaplasma spp. colonization was diagnosed via DNA extraction from vaginal swabs and PCR analysis was performed as previously described and published by Mallard et al. Since PCR analyses were performed for study purposes only, no macrolide eradication therapy was performed based on the results.

In the current study, we aimed at investigating the frequency of ascending U.spp. infection in the aforementioned study cohort. Women delivering ≤ 32 weeks of gestational age (wGA) with available data on amniotic and placental colonization as described below were included. Depending on the indication for preterm caesarean delivery, women were divided into two groups: group 1: "spontaneous preterm birth", women with caesarean section after preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM) or preterm labour (PL) with no response to the indicated therapy; group 2: "medically indicated preterm birth", women with caesarean section due to HELLP syndrome, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, or pathologic Doppler ultrasound (Fig. 1).

Patient flow chart.

Intrauterine Infection Screening Program

Based on earlier published data, a comprehensive infection screening program is performed as part of our routine protocol to improve the detection rate of intrauterine infections. During caesarean section ≤ 32 wGA, it is intended to obtain amniotic and placental biopsies under sterile conditions which are analysed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, U.spp. and fungi using culture techniques. Growth of contaminants (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, or Lactobacillus spp.) was considered as negative results. In women delivering vaginally, no amniotic and placental biopsies are obtained.

### Development of a rapid and high-throughput multiplex real-time PCR assay for Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma species [^113pAE8M]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2023). Medium credibility.

Bacterial commensals of the human genitourinary tract, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma species (parvum and urealyticum) can be sexually transmitted, and may cause nongonococcal urethritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma species may also cause severe invasive infections in immunocompromised patients. Current culture-based methods for Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma identification are costly and laborious, with a turnaround time between 1 and 2 weeks. We developed a high-throughput, real-time multiplex PCR assay for the rapid detection of M. hominis and Ureaplasma species in urine, genital swab, body fluid, and tissue. In total, 282 specimens were tested by PCR and compared with historic culture results; a molecular reference method was used to moderate discrepancies. Overall result agreement was 99% for M. hominis (97% positive percentage agreement and 100% negative percentage agreement) and 96% for Ureaplasma species (96% positive percentage agreement and 97% negative percentage agreement). Specimen stability was validated for up to 7 days at room temperature. This multiplex molecular assay was designed for implementation in a high-complexity clinical microbiology laboratory. With this method, > 90 samples can be tested in one run, with a turnaround time of 4 to 5 hours from specimen extraction to reporting of results. This PCR test is also more labor effective and cheaper than the conventional culture-based test, thus improving laboratory efficiency and alleviating labor shortages.

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in women: a 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [^1132XuuX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A Panel of International Experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered as important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

### Randomized clinical trial of extended spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis with coverage for Ureaplasma urealyticum to reduce post-cesarean delivery endometritis [^111t7QPa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if extended spectrum prophylactic antibiotic treatment (with efficacy against Ureaplasma urealyticum) reduces post-cesarean delivery clinical endometritis.

Methods

After cord clamping at cesarean delivery, subjects received prophylaxis with cefotetan. Subjects were then simultaneously randomized (double blind) to receive doxycyline plus azithromycin versus placebo. Post-cesarean delivery endometritis was defined clinically as fever of 100.4F or higher with one or more supporting clinical signs or a physician diagnosis of endometritis plus the absence of a nonpelvic source of fever.

Results

A total of 597 women were enrolled, 301 in the doxycycline/azithromycin group and 296 in the placebo group. The study population was 56% black, 25.5 ± 6.2 years of age, and 43% nulliparous. The groups were similar (P > .05) for black race, parity, maternal age, and most risk factors for post-cesarean delivery endometritis. The frequency of post-cesarean delivery endometritis (16.9% versus 24.7%, P = 0.020), wound infections (0.8% versus 3.6%, P = 0.030), and a combination of these two outcomes (19.0% versus 27.8%, P = 0.019) were significantly lower in the doxycycline/azithromycin group compared with the placebo-treated group. The doxycycline/azithromycin versus placebo groups were dissimilar for maternal leukocytosis (24.9% versus 12.5%, P = 0.042) and frequency of classic uterine incision (7.6% versus 12.5%, P = 0.048). Adjusting for these factors did not alter the risk ratio for post-cesarean delivery endometritis in the active versus placebo-treated group (relative risk 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.43, 0.98). Length of stay was longer in the placebo group overall (104 ± 56 versus 95 ± 32 hours, P = 0.016) and among women with endometritis (146 ± 52 versus 127 ± 46 hours, P = 0.047).

Conclusion

Extended spectrum prophylactic antibiotic treatment (with presumed efficacy against U urealyticum) given to women undergoing cesarean delivery at term shortens hospital stay and reduces the frequency of post-cesarean delivery endometritis and wound infections.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^113fmHbD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

An effective azithromycin treatment was significantly associated with a reduced risk of BPD. These sort of contradictory findings indicate that azithromycin treatment might work by other mechanisms than eradicating Ureaplasma, including but not strict to the anti-inflammatory effect of azithromycin. Viscardi et al. had previously reported that administration of azithromycin at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg for three days effectively eradicated Ureaplasma from the respiratory tract and tended to reduce BPD. However, the effect was not statistically significant, which could be attributed to the under power of the study. The same authors reported an increased rate of death or serious respiratory morbidities in Ureaplasma positive infants (58%) compared to negative infants (21%) in a 2-years-follow-up study of the trial, indicating a compromised lung function in Ureaplasma positive infants.

We acknowledge that the clinical setting regarding Ureaplasma, azithromycin and BPD is highly complicated. The complicated issues include the association between Ureaplasma and BPD, azithromycin and pneumonia resolution, the influence of pneumonia on BPD, the effect of azithromycin on the development of BPD, etc. Addressing these issues would be challenging even in a series of well-designed prospective studies. However, we hope the findings in our study could add to the body of evidence regarding these topics. There could be some confounders compromising the accuracy of CXR assessment. A severe RDS might interfere with the initial assessment of CXR (20% in this cohort), while other concurrent pulmonary infections and PDA might impede the second accurate assessment of CXR. Furthermore, sampling from tracheal aspirates would be more accurate than nasopharyngeal swabs in PCR testing for Ureaplasma.

In summary, we found that radiographic improvement following azithromycin treatment was associated with a reduced risk for BPD in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants. However, these data need to be interpreted with caution since potential confounders might affect the accuracy of the CXR evaluation.

### Intrauterine detection of Ureaplasma species after vaginal colonization in pregnancy and neonatal outcome [^11294SSr]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

A major limitation of our study is the relatively small number of cases, particularly regarding infants with 24-month follow-up data. However, preterm infants included in this study derived from more than 4,000 pregnancies included in the original multi-centre study, which demonstrates the difficulty in obtaining a study group large enough to satisfactorily answer these questions with enough statistical power. Moreover, in this study setting we did not assess intra-amniotic cytokine levels, which does not allow to differentiate between intrauterine U.spp. colonization and intrauterine infection and inflammation. A very recent paper, however, suggests that abundant "colonizers" do not exist in the placenta and the womb in normal, non-pathogenic circumstances.

### Rapid detection of Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma parvum, and Ureaplasma urealyticum organisms in genitourinary samples by PCR-microtiter plate hybridization assay [^117RF54X]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

We present a method for detecting the presence of Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma parvum, and Ureaplasma urealyticum organisms, which are thought to be associated with nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) and other genitourinary infections, in clinical samples. This method consists of PCR amplification of a part of the 16S rRNA gene followed by 96-well microtiter plate hybridization assay using four species-specific capture probes to detect the targets. To test the efficacy of this method, we applied it to the detection of the four species in the urine of patients with NGU. There were no cross-reactions with other human mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas, and the PCR-microtiter plate hybridization assay detected as few as 10 copies of the 16S rRNA gene of each of the four species. Based on these results, this PCR-microtiter plate hybridization assay can be considered an effective tool for the diagnosis of genitourinary infections with mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas.

### Clinical characteristics of bacterial vaginosis among women testing positive for fastidious bacteria [^1157pcMr]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2009). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common lower genital tract infection that may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), subsequent infertilityand preterm birth, and may increase susceptibility to HIV. Although no single agent is known to cause BV and its aetiology is not well understood, bacteria such as Gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasmas, Mycoplasma hominis and anaerobic bacteria are commonly isolated from BV patients. – Until recently, our understanding of BV microbiology largely came from cultivated species and Gram-stained vaginal smear analysis, most notably Nugent's criteria. Recently, cultivation-independent studies using 16S rDNA sequences PCR amplified from vaginal DNA have revealed previously unrecognised bacterial genera associated with BV. Some of these include metronidazole-resistant Atopobium vaginae, Leptotrichia (Sneathia) sanguinegens and Leptotrichia amnionii, and three new species of uncultivated bacteria termed bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB) types 1, 2 and 3.

Nugent's criteriameasure specific Gram-stained bacterial morphotypes. Consequently, organisms that do not Gram stain, such as ureaplasmas and mycoplasmas, are not measured. Ureaplasmas have been associated with BV, although modestly in some studies. High rates of ureaplasma colonisation among patients without clinical disease further complicate interpretation. Moreover, ureaplasmas (formerly designated Ureaplasma urealyticum but termed undifferentiated ureaplasmas herein) have recently been split into two biovars: Ureaplasma parvum, reported to be non-pathogenic in men; and U urealyticum (biovar 2), associated with urethritis. The role of these newly classified ureaplasmas in BV has been little studied. In this analysis, we sought to determine the associations among several fastidious pathogens and BV defined by Gram stain and Amsel's criteria among a population of women with PID.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^113Tji7V]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Study participants

Infants were recruited from seven sites over 37 months (July 2013–August 2016). A total of 982 patients were screened, of whom 434 (44%) were eligible (online supplementary figure 1S). Of 121 randomised, 60 were assigned to azithromycin and 61 were assigned to placebo; 119 (98%) received at least one dose of assigned treatment, one in each treatment group did not receive any doses of assigned treatment and treatment was discontinued in four azithromycin participants (one parent request and three clinical team request). All participants who received < 3 doses were Ureaplasma negative. One placebo-assigned infant who was nasopharyngeal Ureaplasma positive received a single dose of azithromycin due to pharmacy error.

The baseline characteristics of randomised patients and stratified by Ureaplasma status are summarised in table 1. An imbalance in race distribution occurred with 40% non-white in the azithromycin versus 75% in the placebo group. Other baseline characteristics were similar comparing treatment arms for the entire study cohort and when stratified by Ureaplasma colonisation status.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of the study participants for the total cohort and stratified by Ureaplasma status

Forty-four of 121 participants (36%) were Ureaplasma positive at one or more time points with 19 (32%) randomised to azithromycin and 25 (41%) to placebo (table 1 and online supplementary figure 2S). Ureaplasma prevalence was higher in the 24 0–26 6 weeks' gestation stratum compared with 27 0–28 6 weeks (36/83 (43%) vs 8/38 (21%), p = 0.02). Ureaplasma parvum was the most common species detected in both treatment arms (U. parvum, n = 33 (75%); U. urealyticum n = 7 (16%); both species, n = 3 (7%); untyped n = 1 (2%)). The Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50 and MIC 90 for Ureaplasma isolates were 2 µg/mL and 4 µg/mL, respectively. No tested isolate was resistant to azithromycin (MIC ≥ 16 µg/mL).

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^115wTrZk]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Efficacy analysis

The Ureaplasma -free survival was higher in the azithromycin group (92% (95% CI 82% to 97%)) compared with the placebo group (61% (95% CI 48% to 73%)) (p < 0.001) (table 2) and was sustained in analyses stratified by race (online supplementary table 1). For Ureaplasma -positive infants, Ureaplasma -free survival was higher in the azithromycin group (16/19 (84%), (95% CI 60% to 97%)) than in the placebo group (3/25 (12%), (95% CI 3% to 31%)) (p < 0.001) (table 2). The proportion of infants who survived until discharge was similar in each treatment group (92% vs 90%, table 2). All follow-up cultures were negative in the azithromycin group, but 21/25 (84%) of colonised placebo subjects were culture positive at one or more follow-up time point (online supplementary figure S2). Seven azithromycin-assigned participants were PCR positive, but culture-negative post-treatment.

Table 2

Secondary outcomes

Two-thirds (12/19) of participants who met criteria for RAC, failed and were classified as physiological BPD. Three infants did not have a RAC completed so they could not be classified. There were no significant differences between treatment groups for the entire cohort or stratified by Ureaplasma colonisation status (table 2) or race (online supplementary table 1S) in overall survival, physiological BPD-free survival, frequency BPD by any classification or other secondary outcomes.

### Doxycycline monohydrate [^115vpdtL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of doxycycline capsules and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections:

Rocky mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae.

Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.

### Identification of novel microbes associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility [^111nm1zg]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016). Low credibility.

Half or more of women testing positive for these select bacteria had persistent infection 30 days post-cefoxitin/doxycycline treatment. Women who tested positive for all four BV-associated bacteria in the endometrium were nearly four times as likely to experience short-term treatment failure. Moreover, women testing positive for fastidious BV-associated bacteria at baseline were nearly four times more likely than those without these pathogens to develop recurrent PID.

Whether Sneathia spp. and BVAB1 are sensitive to antibiotics is unclear due to the difficulty in culturing these bacteria, yet the high rates of persistent infection post-treatment in our study suggest that cefoxitin and doxycycline constitute suboptimal treatment. A. vaginae has been reported to be susceptible to cefoxitin. Although it was often identified 30 days post-treatment in our study, it was not associated with persistent endometritis. The high rates of U. urealyticum and U. parvum persistence were predictable, as ureaplasmas have been shown to express tetracycline resistancewand contain tet M genes that encode such resistance. w2

Women testing positive for fastidious BV-associated bacteria at PID diagnosis were nearly four times as likely to develop subsequent infertility, even after adjustment for confounders. Our results extend previous culture studies demonstrating that BV categorised by Gram stain is associated with tubal factor infertility among women undergoing in vitro fertilisation. w3

Major strengths of our study are the prospective design and the characterisation of specific BV-associated microorganisms. As our study is limited to four selected BV-associated bacteria measured using targeted qualitative PCR, further research examining concentrations of a broader phylogenetic range of BV-associated microbes among PID and infertility patients using high-throughput sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR assays is warranted. Further, it is possible that transcervical sampling of the endometrium may have resulted in contamination of endometrial biopsy specimens by vaginal or cervical microorganisms. However, as possible contamination would not be expected to differ by the study outcomes, it is unlikely to be a major source of bias. Further, associations between cervical PCR and outcomes should be unaffected. Lastly, our study is limited by the lack of a truly unaffected control group of women. All women enrolled in the PEACH study had clinically suspected PID. Thus, our comparison groups of women with negative PCR comprised women who presented with characteristics consistent with PID. This may have biased our findings towards the null.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^112h56pC]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To test whether azithromycin eradicates Ureaplasma from the respiratory tract in preterm infants.

Design

Prospective, phase IIb randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Seven level III–IV US, academic, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).

Patients

Infants 24 0–28 6 weeks' gestation (stratified 24 0–26 6; 27 0–28 6 weeks) randomly assigned within 4 days following birth from July 2013 to August 2016.

Interventions

Intravenous azithromycin 20 mg/kg or an equal volume of D5W (placebo) every 24 hours for 3 days.

Main outcome measures

The primary efficacy outcome was Ureaplasma -free survival. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, Ureaplasma clearance, physiological bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, comorbidities of prematurity and duration of respiratory support.

Results

One hundred and twenty-one randomised participants (azithromycin: n = 60; placebo: n = 61) were included in the intent-to-treat analysis (mean gestational age 26.2 ± 1.4 weeks). Forty-four of 121 participants (36%) were Ureaplasma positive (azithromycin: n = 19; placebo: n = 25). Ureaplasma -free survival was 55/60 (92% (95% CI 82% to 97%)) for azithromycin compared with 37/61 (61% (95% CI 48% to 73%)) for placebo. Mortality was similar comparing the two treatment groups (5/60 (8%) vs 6/61 (10%)). Azithromycin effectively eradicated Ureaplasma in all azithromycin-assigned colonised infants, but 21/25 (84%) Ureaplasma -colonised participants receiving placebo were culture positive at one or more follow-up timepoints. Most of the neonatal mortality and morbidity was concentrated in 21 infants with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation. In a subgroup analysis, physiological BPD-free survival was 5/10 (50%) (95% CI 19% to 81%) among azithromycin-assigned infants with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation versus 2/11 (18%) (95% CI 2% to 52%) in placebo-treated infants.

Conclusion

A 3-day azithromycin regimen effectively eradicated respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation in this study.

### Intrauterine detection of Ureaplasma species after vaginal colonization in pregnancy and neonatal outcome [^1177QJkB]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preterm birth is the major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Around 40% of preterm births are associated with intrauterine infection, mostly resulting from ascending vaginal infections. Bacteria colonizing the lower vaginal tract are able to ascend into the uterine compartment, where they can subsequently activate local inflammatory pathways. One of these vaginal commensals is Ureaplasma species (U.spp.). The association between intrauterine U.spp. infection and spontaneous preterm birth is well supported by literature. Moreover, the U.spp. -induced inflammatory response might contribute to neonatal injury.

In an earlier multi-centre study, we were able to show that not only intrauterine but also vaginal colonization in early pregnancy, which can be routinely screened for, is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. However, due to the high rate of vaginal colonization in pregnant women, ranging between 30 and 60%, vaginal U.spp. colonization cannot be used as a prognostic marker for preterm delivery.

Scarce data exists on the rate of ascending infection and invasion of the amniotic membranes and placenta after vaginal U.spp. colonization. Therefore, aim of the current study was to analyse the frequency of ascending U.spp. infection in vaginally colonized pregnant women delivering preterm and subsequent short- and long-term outcome of infants.

Diagnosis — women with frequent UTI may experience diagnostic delay if clinicians do not review the UTI history; clinicians should order pretreatment urine cultures to document rUTI (culture-proven UTI ≥ 2 in 6 months or ≥ 3 in 12 months), and although infrequent UTI can be assessed with less rigor and treated empirically, women with frequent UTI who are being formally assessed for rUTI should have detailed symptom assessment and pretreatment urine culture and sensitivity.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^1146BbVG]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definitions and terminology state that a commonly used definition describes urinary tract infection (UTI) as an infection of the lower and/or upper genitourinary tract which is diagnosed based on the presence of a pathogen in the urinary tract and associated symptoms, with limited evidence to support any "gold standard" UTI definition for epidemiologic or clinical research; this statement endorses a clinically useful, culture-based definition for rUTI of at least 2 culture-proven episodes in 6 months, or at least 3 in 1 year, and distinguishes relapse as UTI symptoms with the same uropathogen within 2 weeks of completing appropriate antibiotic therapy versus recurrence beyond the initial 2 weeks or with a different uropathogen.

GI infections training expectations — pediatric gastroenterology trainees require comprehensive exposure to the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections and their complications, should understand host defense mechanisms and microbial virulence, and should have knowledge of the epidemiology, natural history, indications for testing, and current recommendations for testing and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection; trainees should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, its predisposing factors, available diagnostic tests, and currently recommended therapies, be aware of potential emerging pathogens and illnesses related to toxin exposure such as staphylococcal food poisoning, and be able to develop a management plan including rationale for use or avoidance of antibiotics, oral/intravenous rehydration solutions, and advantages and disadvantages of adjunctive therapy such as probiotics; trainees should be able to identify and diagnose infections that can resemble Crohn disease (CD), should be familiar with the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, prevention, and therapy of viral enteric pathogens including rotavirus and caliciviruses such as noroviruses, adenoviruses, and astroviruses, and should be familiar with cytomegalovirus colitis and Epstein-Barr virus–related complications, particularly in the immunocompromised patient; trainees should also be familiar with the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment options for common parasitic infections including giardiasis, Entamoeba histolytica, and cryptosporidium.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113p1GKE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^113TtvaS]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Post hoc analyses

We had previously observed that Ureaplasma -free survival, overall survival, and physiologic BPD-free survival were lower and durations of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen, and postnatal steroid exposure were higher in intubated patients with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization compared to intubated infants without lower tract involvement or non-intubated infants. At follow-up, differences in unfavorable pulmonary outcomes persisted in children who had lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization. Tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -positive infants were discharged to home and supplemental oxygen was discontinued at later PMA and they experienced a higher frequency of the composite outcome death or serious respiratory morbidity at 22–26 months corrected age than tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -negative infants and non-intubated infants (Table 4). There were no differences among the three groups for death or moderate-to-severe NDI. To assess the long-term effect of neonatal lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization in the absence of treatment, we compared outcomes of placebo-treated tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -positive and Ureaplasma -negative infants (Supplemental Table 2). Placebo-treated tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -positive infants were discharged to home at a later PMA. Although the differences were not statistically significant, all-cause mortality (36 vs 9%, p = 0.07) and mortality from respiratory causes (18 vs 0%, p = 0.098) was greater in the Ureaplasma -positive group than for infants assigned to placebo. In patients with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization, death or serious respiratory morbidity was 60% (6/10) in AZM-treated vs 56% (6/11) in placebo-treated infants (p = 0.61; Table 5).

### Urethritis and cervicitis-STI treatment guidelines… [^112Qrdio]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Etiology Multiple organisms can cause infectious urethritis. The presence of gram-negative intracellular diplococci or purple intracellular diplococci on urethral smear is indicative of presumed gonococcal infection, which is frequently accompanied by chlamydial infection. Nongonococcal urethritis, which is diagnosed when microscopy of urethral secretions indicate inflammation without GNID or MB or GV purple intracellular diplococci, is caused by. Diagnostic Considerations Clinicians should attempt to obtain objective evidence of urethral inflammation. If POC diagnostic tests are unavailable, urethritis can be documented on the basis of any of the following signs or laboratory tests:

- Presumed gonococcal infection is established by documenting the presence of WBCs containing GNID in Gram stain or intracellular purple diplococci in MB or GV smears; men should be tested for
- Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine or microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void urine demonstrating ≥ 10 WBCs/HPF. 697, 743, 745). NGU is confirmed for symptomatic men when diagnostic evaluation of urethral secretions indicates inflammation, without evidence of diplococci by Gram, MB, or GV smear on microscopy. Visible discharge or secretions can be collected by a swab without inserting it into the urethra; if no visible secretions, the swab can be inserted into the urethral meatus and rotated, making contact with the urethral wall before removal. Treatment Ideally, treatment should be pathogen based; however, diagnostic information might not be immediately available. Presumptive treatment should be initiated at NGU diagnosis.

Doxycycline is highly effective for chlamydial urethral infections and is also effective for chlamydial infections of the rectum; it also has some activity against. If M. genitalium resistance testing is available it should be performed, and the results should be used to guide therapy. If M. genitalium resistance testing is not available, doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days should be used.

### Syphilis-STI treatment guidelines… [^1167QxR9]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

T. pallidum. The disease has been divided into stages on the basis of clinical findings, which guide treatment and follow-up. Persons who have syphilis might seek treatment for signs or symptoms. Primary syphilis classically presents as a single painless ulcer or chancre at the site of infection but can also present with multiple, atypical, or painful lesions. Secondary syphilis manifestations can include skin rash, mucocutaneous lesions, and lymphadenopathy. Tertiary syphilis can present with cardiac involvement, gummatous lesions, tabes dorsalis, and general paresis. Diagnostic Considerations Darkfield examinations and molecular tests for detecting T. pallidum directly from lesion exudate or tissue are the definitive methods for diagnosing early syphilis and congenital syphilis. Although no T. pallidum direct-detection molecular NAATs are commercially available, certain laboratories provide locally developed and validated PCR tests for detecting T.

pallidum DNA. A presumptive diagnosis of syphilis requires use of two laboratory serologic tests: a nontreponemal test and a treponemal test. When CSF-VDRL is negative despite clinical signs of neurosyphilis, reactive serologic tests results, lymphocytic pleocytosis, or protein, neurosyphilis should be considered. In that instance, additional evaluation by using fluorescent treponemal-antibody absorption or TP-PA testing on CSF might be warranted. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurs most frequently among persons who have early syphilis, presumably because bacterial loads are higher during these stages.

Antipyretics can be used to manage symptoms; however, they have not been proven to prevent this reaction. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction might induce early labor or cause fetal distress in pregnant women; however, this should not prevent or delay therapy.
