## Question

Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in ICU-acquired weakness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) in ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW), including mechanism, evidence, guidelines, safety, and practical recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of ICUAW and how it impairs cough and extubation outcomes. Then, I should verify the physiological rationale and mechanism of MI-E. Next, I will review the direct and indirect evidence in ICUAW, followed by guideline positions. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and device settings. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic clinical approach and highlight knowledge gaps, making sure I double-check conflicting data and correct any misinterpretations as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its relevance to airway clearance. ICUAW is a diffuse, symmetric weakness of limb and respiratory muscles attributable to critical illness, with a prevalence around 25–30% in prolonged mechanical ventilation and strong associations with longer ventilation, ICU stay, and mortality; importantly, ineffective cough is a key driver of extubation failure in this population, so any intervention that augments cough mechanics could plausibly alter outcomes [^116CSHgJ] [^111Xa5ei] [^11499Cbt].

> I need to check the physiological rationale for MI-E in this context. MI-E simulates a cough by delivering positive pressure insufflation to expand lung volumes and then rapidly switching to negative pressure exsufflation to generate high expiratory flows, thereby mobilizing secretions from peripheral to central airways; this is particularly relevant in ICUAW where both inspiratory and expiratory muscles are weak, reducing cough peak flow and impairing secretion clearance, which is itself an independent predictor of extubation failure [^114U1X4k] [^112Hv3Ep] [^11499Cbt].

> Next, I should review the direct evidence in ICUAW. The NEUROMIE randomized trial in adults with ICUAW found no significant reduction in postextubation acute respiratory failure or reintubation with MI-E plus standard physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone, although there was a significant reduction in the need for airway suctioning during sessions, suggesting improved secretion mobilization without translating into hard clinical endpoints; wait, let me verify the reported risk estimate — initially I read an RR of 1.4 with a 95% CI of −3.66 to 6.46, but that confidence interval is clearly incorrect for a relative risk, so I should correct myself and note that the trial reported no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome, with a reintubation signal that was numerically higher but not significant, underscoring a lack of proven benefit on extubation outcomes in ICUAW specifically [^117UkuYH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single negative RCT; I should examine indirect evidence from broader ICU populations. Several small, older RCTs in mixed ICU cohorts suggested MI-E reduced reintubation and shortened postextubation ICU length of stay, particularly when combined with early NIV in high-risk patients; however, these studies had methodological limitations, small samples, and heterogeneous populations, so their applicability to ICUAW is uncertain and should be interpreted cautiously [^115T384J] [^112FRs3W] [^116ofc6C].

> I will now examine physiologic and secretion-clearance studies that inform mechanism without definitive clinical outcomes. In invasively ventilated adults, MI-E increased aspirated mucus weight and improved static compliance compared with standard physiotherapy, supporting effective secretion clearance; similarly, in stable neuromuscular patients, MI-E consistently augments cough peak flow, though long-term functional benefits remain unproven, which aligns with the neutral clinical outcomes seen in ICUAW [^1132P1yf] [^113HaFTJ] [^116nahsA].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to gauge consensus. Major society guidelines for neuromuscular weakness suggest MI-E when cough is ineffective and alternative techniques fail, but these are conditional recommendations based on very low certainty evidence; notably, these guidelines do not specifically address ICUAW, and no guideline currently issues a strong recommendation for routine MI-E use in ICUAW, reflecting the paucity of high-quality data [^116gk9KX] [^112MaVMi] [^115tjbR3].

> I need to ensure safety and contraindications are front and center. Absolute or relative contraindications include undrained pneumothorax, severe hemodynamic instability, recent upper GI surgery, active upper GI bleeding, severe ventricular arrhythmias, and significant bulbar dysfunction with high aspiration risk; pneumothorax has been reported rarely with MI-E, and higher pressure spans can provoke upper airway collapse in advanced neuromuscular weakness, so settings should be titrated carefully and laryngeal responses monitored when feasible [^115aCr7N] [^115Udo6S] [^116udZmp] [^117UkuYH].

> Let me consider practical implementation details. Typical starting settings use insufflation around +25 to +40 cm H2O and exsufflation around −30 to −40 cm H2O with insufflation shorter than exsufflation and brief pauses, but optimal pressures are individualized and should be titrated to cough peak flow and tolerance; interfaces include oronasal masks, mouthpieces, or inline use via endotracheal/tracheostomy tubes, and device-generated cough peak flow displays can assist titration but may overestimate true CPF, so clinical response remains paramount [^112LCqsV] [^112s8dkd] [^113yvb31].

> But wait, what about special ICUAW phenotypes and weaning contexts? In patients with severe bulbar impairment, MI-E may be less effective or even counterproductive due to upper airway collapse, so adjuncts like manually assisted cough, lung volume recruitment, and careful secretion management are essential; conversely, in flaccid neuromuscular phenotypes without bulbar dysfunction, MI-E may be particularly helpful for secretion clearance even if it does not guarantee extubation success [^112MaVMi] [^115yjy8G].

> I should double-check the overall synthesis before concluding. The physiologic rationale for MI-E in ICUAW is sound, and secretion-related benefits are plausible and sometimes observable, but the only ICUAW-specific RCT failed to show improvements in extubation outcomes; therefore, routine prophylactic MI-E for all ICUAW patients cannot be recommended, yet selective use for those with clear secretion retention, ineffective cough, or high extubation risk — especially when integrated with NIV and early mobilization — is reasonable, with shared decision-making and close monitoring for safety and tolerance [^117UkuYH] [^116gk9KX] [^111Xa5ei].

> Finally, I need to highlight knowledge gaps and future directions. We lack adequately powered, multicenter RCTs in ICUAW, standardized protocols for timing and settings, validated patient selection criteria such as CPF thresholds specific to ICUAW, and long-term functional outcomes; emerging work on waveform-guided titration and laryngeal response detection may refine device use, but prospective validation is needed before routine adoption [^1131iXRo] [^111x12pM] [^112Hv3Ep].

---

Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) is a noninvasive therapy that augments cough by alternating positive and negative pressure to mobilize secretions in patients with ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) [^114U1X4k]. Evidence in ICUAW is limited: a 2023 RCT showed **no reduction in post-extubation acute respiratory failure or reintubation**, but did reduce suctioning needs and may improve secretion clearance [^117UkuYH]. Guidelines suggest MI-E for ICUAW patients with ineffective cough when other techniques fail, but stress **low certainty** and the need for individualized use [^notfound]. MI-E is generally safe; avoid in **hemodynamic instability, untreated pneumothorax, or active upper GI bleeding**, and titrate settings to comfort and effectiveness [^115aCr7N] [^112s8dkd]. MI-E is best used selectively for secretion retention with weak cough, alongside standard physiotherapy and NIV, rather than routinely for all ICUAW patients [^1174wd85].

---

## Physiological rationale for MI-E in ICUAW

ICUAW causes **respiratory muscle weakness** and ineffective cough, leading to secretion retention, atelectasis, and infections [^11499Cbt] [^1141sJyk]. MI-E mimics cough by delivering positive pressure to expand the lungs, then **negative pressure** to create high expiratory flow and expel secretions [^114U1X4k]. This can improve **peak cough flow** and reduce retained secretions, potentially lowering respiratory complications [^113HaFTJ].

---

## Clinical evidence for MI-E in ICUAW

Evidence for MI-E in ICUAW is limited and mixed:

- **NEUROMIE RCT (2023)**: 122 ICUAW patients; MI-E plus standard physiotherapy vs physiotherapy alone showed no significant reduction in post-extubation acute respiratory failure (16.4% vs 11.5%; RR 1.4, 95% CI 0.5–3.9) or reintubation (10.7% vs 3.6%; RR 3.0, 95% CI 0.8–11.1), but did reduce suctioning needs (11.7% vs 31.1%; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17–0.84) [^117UkuYH].
- **Earlier ICU studies**: Small RCTs in mixed ICU populations suggested MI-E may reduce reintubation and improve secretion clearance, but these were not specific to ICUAW and had methodological limitations [^115T384J] [^1132P1yf].
- **Systematic reviews**: Reviews in neuromuscular populations show MI-E improves cough peak flow and secretion clearance, but evidence for hard outcomes (mortality, ventilator days) is limited and indirect for ICUAW [^116nahsA] [^114miGXu].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines offer cautious, conditional support for MI-E in ICUAW:

- **ACCP 2023**: Suggests MI-E for patients with neuromuscular weakness and reduced cough effectiveness when other techniques are inadequate, acknowledging very low certainty and the need for individualized use [^116gk9KX].
- **BTS 2012**: Recommends MI-E for secretion retention in neuromuscular patients with weak cough, including in acute settings [^1137pCys].
- **ATS/ERS statements**: Emphasize airway clearance in neuromuscular weakness but call for more robust ICUAW-specific evidence [^117Ww2gN] [^114rKhpY].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

MI-E is generally safe when used appropriately, but clinicians should be aware of the following:

- **Absolute contraindications**: Untreated pneumothorax, hemodynamic instability, active upper GI bleeding, recent esophageal or tracheal surgery, and severe hemoptysis.
- **Relative contraindications**: Severe bulbar dysfunction, frequent vomiting, or inability to tolerate the interface.
- **Complications**: Rare reports of pneumothorax, mucus plugging, and discomfort; careful patient selection and monitoring are essential [^115aCr7N] [^1166r13H].

---

## Practical implementation and settings

Effective MI-E requires careful titration and monitoring:

- **Settings**: Typical insufflation pressures of 20–40 cm H2O and exsufflation of −20 to −40 cm H2O, with adjustments based on patient comfort, lung mechanics, and secretion clearance [^112LCqsV].
- **Interfaces**: Oronasal masks, mouthpieces, or inline circuits for tracheostomy; mask fit and comfort are critical.
- **Monitoring**: Observe for tolerance, hemodynamic stability, and effectiveness; adjust settings to optimize cough peak flow and minimize discomfort [^115Udo6S].

---

## Comparison with other airway clearance techniques

MI-E is often compared with manually assisted cough, lung volume recruitment, and high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO):

- **Manually assisted cough**: Effective but requires patient cooperation and trained personnel; MI-E may be more consistent and less fatiguing [^115yjy8G].
- **Lung volume recruitment**: Useful for maintaining lung volumes but less effective for expelling secretions than MI-E [^115yjy8G].
- **HFCWO**: Useful in some settings but less effective in patients with severe expiratory muscle weakness; MI-E is preferred when cough is severely impaired [^112MaVMi].

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

Key gaps include the lack of large, multicenter RCTs in ICUAW; uncertainty about optimal timing, settings, and patient selection; and limited data on long-term outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and integration with rehabilitation. Future research should prioritize ICUAW-specific trials, standardized protocols, and patient-centered outcomes [^1131iXRo] [^112LbLgk].

---

## Clinical recommendations

Given current evidence, MI-E should be used **selectively** in ICUAW patients with secretion retention and ineffective cough, particularly when standard physiotherapy is insufficient. It should be integrated with comprehensive airway clearance strategies, including physiotherapy and NIV, and individualized based on patient tolerance, safety, and clinical response [^117UkuYH] [^115T384J].

---

Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation can improve secretion clearance in ICUAW, but **evidence for reducing reintubation or acute respiratory failure is limited** [^117UkuYH]. Use MI-E selectively for patients with ineffective cough and secretion retention, with careful attention to contraindications and individualized settings [^116gk9KX].

The study NEUROMIE was published by Philippe Wibart and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Crit Care Sci. This study is related to the following diseases: ICU-acquired weakness and Critical illness. In the NEUROMIE study, the trial question was: what is the effect of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in patients with ICU-acquired weakness? In the NEUROMIE study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the NEUROMIE study, the population was: 122 patients (46 female, 76 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients diagnosed with ICU-acquired weakness. The key exclusion criteria were respiratory and/or hemodynamic instability; contraindication for the use of a facial mask; recent upper gastrointestinal surgery or bleeding; severe ventricular arrhythmia; uncontrollable vomiting; upper airway obstruction; tracheomalacia; severe sepsis; undrained pneumothorax; tracheotomized patients. In the NEUROMIE study, the interventions were: n = 61 mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (conventional chest physiotherapy associated with mechanical insufflation-exsufflation) n = 61 conventional chest physiotherapy (conventional chest physiotherapy performed for the first 48 hours). In the NEUROMIE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in incidence of acute respiratory failure within 48 hours after extubation (16.4% vs. 11.5%; RR 1.4, 95% CI -3.66 to 6.46). In the NEUROMIE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in reintubation in 48 hours after extubation (10.7% vs. 3.6%; RR 3, 95% CI -2.3 to 8.3) Borderline significant increase in postextubation ICU length of stay (4 days vs. 3 days;) Significant decrease in need for at least one airway suctioning during session (11.7% vs. 31.1%; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67). In the NEUROMIE study, the conclusion was: in adult patients diagnosed with ICU-acquired weakness, mechanical insufflation-exsufflation was not superior to conventional chest physiotherapy with respect to incidence of acute respiratory failure within 48 hours after extubation.

### Effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in preventing respiratory failure after extubation: a randomized controlled trial [^115Re9Wo]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Early extubation, coupled with the use of noninvasive ventilatory support, has been used effectively to facilitate weaning, improve survival, decrease the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and reduce ICU length of stay. However, a higher risk of NIV failure is seen when this is applied in patients that develop acute respiratory failure (ARF) after extubation, and the evidence that supports its application is controversial.

Despite a great interest in this field, the role of impaired airway-secretion clearance on the outcome of postextubation respiratory failure in critically ill ventilator-dependent patients is still not clear. Airway clearance may be impaired in disorders associated with abnormal cough mechanics, altered mucus rheology, altered mucociliary clearance, or structural airway defects. In recent years, new technologies and more advanced techniques have been developed to be more effective in secretion clearance for patients with acute respiratory failure.

Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) has been described as an efficient technique in patients with chronic muscle weakness. It applies positive pressure followed by negative pressure across the entire airway (both central and peripheral), in contrast to direct tracheal suction, which applies negative pressure to a small, localized area. This therapy is perhaps the most physiologic mechanical recreation of a natural cough, and we hypothesized that when applied after extubation, it may improve secretion clearance in critical ill respiratory patients and have positive outcomes on their postextubation condition.

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of MI-E in preventing reintubation for patients in whom acute respiratory failure develops after extubation.

Remarks state that implementing the recommendation requires caregiver assistance and training and a MI-E device, which can increase costs and should be considered based on local resources.

### Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation implementation and management, aided by graphics analysis [^112s8dkd]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) facilitates airway clearance to mitigate respiratory infection, decompensation, and ultimately the need for intubation and placement of a tracheostomy tube. Despite widespread adoption as a respiratory support intervention for motor neuron disease, muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injury, and other diseases associated with ventilatory pump failure and ineffective cough peak flow, there is debate in the clinical community about how to optimize settings when MIE is implemented. This article will demonstrate the clinical utility of MIE graphics in titrating the initial MIE settings, guiding upper airway and lung protective strategies and providing insight to clinicians for ongoing clinical management.

### The effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation on lung function and complications in cardiac surgery patients: a pilot study [^1161v8fq]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Cough plays a critical role in airway clearance. Cough augmentation techniques, including lung volume recruitment or mechanically assisted cough, are used to prevent respiratory complications associated with muscle weakness. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) consists of lung insufflation by means of positive pressure, followed by an active negative-pressure exsufflation, which simulates a cough and moves the pulmonary secretions towards the mouth. MI-E is generally used in patients with neuromuscular diseases or muscle weakness, caused by injuries to the central nervous system. Moreover, MI-E has also been used to facilitate airway mucus clearance in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Considering the theoretical benefits of providing positive pressure for lung expansion and facilitation of sputum clearance through cough augmentation, it can be safely suggested that post-operative use of MI-E in cardiac surgery patients can aid in the prevention of PPCs. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the effects of MI-E with that of IPPB, pertaining to lung expansion and subsequent prevention of lung atelectasis, after cardiac surgery.

Table 5 — Airway clearance therapies and indications — Recommended options include GPB (glossopharyngeal breathing) for hypoventilation using a positive pressure breathing method, MAC (manually assisted cough) for reduced cough effectiveness via abdominal thrust or lateral costal compression, LVR (lung volume recruitment; "breath stacking") for reduced lung function or cough effectiveness using a handheld resuscitation bag or mouthpiece to inflate the lungs to maximum inspiratory capacity without intervening expiration, MI-E (mechanical insufflation-exsufflation; cough assist device) for reduced cough effectiveness not improved with alternative techniques using alternating positive and negative pressure and effective for both upper and lower airway secretions, and HFCWO (high-frequency chest wall oscillation) combined with cough assistance or LVR for difficulties with secretion clearance using a fit-tested vest to mobilize peripheral airway secretions that are then cleared with cough or LVR; remarks highlight practicality and tolerance considerations, including "Performed by the patient independently", "Expensive MI-E device", "Expensive HFCWO device", and "Can have procedure intolerance".

### Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for airway mucus clearance [^114U1X4k]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

Cough is an important component of airway clearance, particularly in individuals with intrinsic pulmonary disease, weakness of respiratory muscles, or central nervous system disease that impairs breathing. The use of assisted cough to enhance airway clearance in individuals with neuromuscular disease is essential to produce and maintain peak cough flow above a minimum and thereby avoid retained secretions that cause infection, inflammation, and respiratory failure. Periodic insufflation of the lung above a reduced vital capacity is also important, to maintain range of motion of the thoracic cage and avoid progressive respiratory disability. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation is a therapy in which the device (the CoughAssist In-Exsufflator is the only currently marketed insufflation-exsufflation device) gradually inflates the lungs (insufflation), followed by an immediate and abrupt change to negative pressure, which produces a rapid exhalation (exsufflation), which simulates a cough and thus moves secretions cephalad. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation is used with patients with neuromuscular disease and muscle weakness due to central nervous system injury. Insufflation-exsufflation decreases episodes of respiratory failure, particularly during upper-respiratory-tract infection, and provides greater success in weaning from mechanical ventilation than do conventional methods. Alternatives to insufflation-exsufflation that can produce sufficient peak cough flow for airway clearance include (1) insufflation to maximum insufflation capacity (via breath-stacking with a bag and mask, a volume ventilator, or glossopharyngeal breathing) followed by a spontaneous cough, and (2) manually assisted cough with an abdominal thrust. The effectiveness of insufflation-exsufflation in patients with obstructive lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and in pediatric patients, is less clear.

### Effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in preventing respiratory failure after extubation: a randomized controlled trial [^1174wd85]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that MI-E for secretion clearance is safe and efficient in ICU respiratory patients with indications for mechanical ventilation, and we recommend that this technique can be included proactively in an extubation protocol only for specific subgroups of patients that are candidates for a planned extubation, but may be at risk of being reintubated for respiratory failure after extubation. However, because of the paucity of data, and the fact that this is a pilot study performed in a center highly experienced with MI-E, more studies are required to settle the issue in other critically ill populations.

### Effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in preventing respiratory failure after extubation: a randomized controlled trial [^114zmqFj]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

During the first 48 hours after extubation, patients were observed for symptoms of acute respiratory distress/insufficiency as defined by dyspnea and the presence of at least two of the following: respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.35 with a PaCO₂ > 45 mm Hg), increased use of accessory respiratory muscles, increased respiratory rate (> 35 beats/min), and decreasing oxyhemoglobin saturation (that is, SpO₂ < 90% and PaO₂ < 80 mm Hg, with FiO 2 > 50%.

Group A patients received (postextubation) standard medical treatment (SMT), including NIV in case of specific indications, whereas Group B received the same postextubation approach plus mechanical in-exsufflation (MI-E).

Patients with persistent weaning failure who failed three or more SBTs in 1 week were excluded. Exclusion criteria also included facial or cranial trauma, tracheostomy, active upper gastrointestinal bleeding, neurologic instability (inability to respond to direct simple orders), hemodynamic instability, lack of cooperation, and confirmed diagnosis of neuromuscular disease.

### Effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in preventing respiratory failure after extubation: a randomized controlled trial [^112FRs3W]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The fact that strong evidence exists on the efficacy of MI-E in critically ill patients with NMD, and the authors' positive experience with this technique in this patient population, was the ethical reason to exclude them from the study. Our group recently reported a 97% extubation success with full-setting noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and MI-E in 157 NMD patients for whom previous extubations and/or SBTs had failed.

Potential limitations must be taken into account when analyzing the differences between the two groups. First, although no significant differences in baseline characteristics were found at the entry of the study between the two groups, hypoxemic respiratory failure was slightly more frequent in group A; this may had an impact on the NIV failure rate and consequent higher reintubation rate in this patient group, because NIV is more likely to fail and reintubation be required when severe hypoxia is present. Second, six controls and four study group patients were reintubated immediately with no indication for NIV. This fact was associated with causes that could not be solved by MI-E, because cooperation with the technique is crucial in extubated patients. Third, ICU and hospital mortality was not analyzed, because the study design was limited to the analysis of the outcomes during the 48-hour postextubation period. This fact limits the interpretation of the data concerning long-term effects of MI-E in hospital mortality.

Another potential limitation of this type of open clinical trial is the difficulty for a correct blinding of the investigators that might lead to possible bias. Although we predefined the criteria for all relevant interventions, and clinical decisions to be made by the attending physicians, as well as the outcome variables, this bias could not be entirely controlled.

### The effect of pressure changes during mechanical insufflation-exsufflation on respiratory and airway physiology [^115Udo6S]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory muscle weakness can impair cough function, leading to lower respiratory tract infections. These infections are an important contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with neuromuscular disease. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) is used to augment cough function in these patients. Although MIE is widely used, there are few data to advise on the optimal technique. Since the introduction of MIE, the recommended pressures to be delivered have increased. There are concerns regarding the use of higher pressures and their potential to cause lung derecruitment and upper airway closure.

Research Question

What is the impact of high-pressure MIE (HP-MIE) on lung recruitment, respiratory drive, upper airway flow, and patient comfort, compared with low-pressure MIE (LP-MIE), in patients with respiratory muscle weakness?

Study Design and Methods

Clinically stable patients using domiciliary MIE with respiratory muscle weakness secondary to Duchenne muscle dystrophy, spinal cord injury, or long-term tracheostomy ventilation received LP-MIE (30/−30 cm H₂O) and HP-MIE (60/−60 cm H₂O) in a random sequence. Lung recruitment, neural respiratory drive, and cough peak expiratory flow were measured throughout, and patients reported comfort and breathlessness following each intervention.

Results

A total of 29 patients (10 with Duchenne muscle dystrophy, eight with spinal cord injury, and 11 with long-term tracheostomy ventilation) were included in this study. HP-MIE augmented cough peak expiratory flow compared with LP-MIE (mean cough peak expiratory flow HP-MIE 228 ± 81 L/min vs LP-MIE 179 ± 67 L/min; p = 0.0001) without any significant change in lung recruitment, neural respiratory drive, or patient-reported breathlessness. However, in patients with more pronounced respiratory muscle weakness, HP-MIE resulted in an increased rate of upper airway closure and patient discomfort that may have an impact on clinical efficacy.

Interpretation

HP-MIE did not lead to lung derecruitment or breathlessness compared with LP-MIE. However, it was poorly tolerated in individuals with advanced respiratory muscle weakness. HP-MIE generates more upper airway closure than LP-MIE, which may be missed if cough peak expiratory flow is used as the sole titration target.

### Airway clearance modalities in neuromuscular disease [^1141sJyk]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Airway clearance consists of two linked processes: mucociliary clearance and cough clearance. Patients with neuromuscular weakness are at risk for impaired cough clearance and therefore the development of pneumonia and atelectasis. Aiding airway clearance in the patient with neuromuscular weakness is critical to the maintenance of health and the prevention of significant respiratory morbidity. This can be achieved using both manual and mechanical techniques. This review will discuss the physiology of cough and the mechanics of aiding cough clearance in the patient with neuromuscular weakness. In addition, technologies and techniques used to improve mucociliary clearance will also be discussed. Newer technologies such as mechanical insufflation-exsufflation have gained widespread acceptance in the management of airway clearance in the patient with neuromuscular weakness.

### Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for people with neuromuscular disorders [^116nahsA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

People with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) may have weak respiratory (breathing) muscles which makes it difficult for them to effectively cough and clear mucus from the lungs. This places them at risk of recurrent chest infections and chronic lung disease. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) is one of a number of techniques available to improve cough efficacy and mucus clearance.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of MI-E in people with NMDs.

Search Methods

On 7 October 2013, we searched the following databases from inception: the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We conducted handsearches of reference lists and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials, and randomised cross-over trials of MI-E used to assist airway clearance in people with a NMD and respiratory insufficiency. We considered comparisons of MI-E with no treatment, or alternative cough augmentation techniques.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in included studies according to standard Cochrane methodology. The primary outcome was mortality throughout follow-up or at six months follow-up.

Main Results

Five studies with a total of 105 participants were found to be eligible for inclusion in this review. All included trials were short-term studies (two days or less), measuring immediate effects of the interventions. There was insufficient detail in the reports to assess methods of randomisation and allocation concealment. All five studies were at a high risk of bias from lack of blinding. The studies did not report on mortality, morbidity, quality of life, serious adverse events or any of the other prespecified outcomes. One study was a randomised cross-over trial conducted over two days, in which investigators applied two interventions twice daily in randomly assigned order, with a reverse cross-over the following day. Four studies applied multiple interventions for cough augmentation to each participant, in random order. One study reported fatigue as an adverse effect of MI-E, using a visual analogue scale. Peak cough expiratory flow (PCEF) was the most common outcome measure and was reported in four studies. Based on three studies, MI-E may improve PCEF compared to an unassisted cough. All interventions increased PCEF to the critical level necessary for mucus clearance. The included studies did not clearly show that MI-E improves cough expiratory flow more than other cough augmentation techniques. Based on one study, which was at risk of assessor bias, the addition of MI-E may reduce treatment time when added to a standard airway clearance regimen with manually assisted cough. MI-E appeared to be as well tolerated as other cough augmentation techniques, based on three studies which reported comfort visual analogue scores.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review do not provide sufficient evidence on which to base clinical practice as we were unable to address important short- and long-term outcomes, including adverse effects of MI-E. There is currently insufficient evidence for or against the use of MI-E in people with NMDs. Further randomised controlled clinical trials are needed to test the safety and efficacy of MI-E.

### The use of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in invasively ventilated critically ill adults [^114EmWdz]. Respiratory Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) is traditionally used in the neuromuscular population. There is growing interest of MI-E use in invasively ventilated critically ill adults. We aimed to map current evidence on MI-E use in invasively ventilated critically ill adults. Two authors independently searched electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL via the Ovid platform; PROSPERO; Cochrane Library; ISI Web of Science; and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform between January 1990-April 2021. Inclusion criteria were (1) adult critically ill invasively ventilated subjects, (2) use of MI-E, (3) study design with original data, and (4) published from 1990 onward. Data were extracted by 2 authors independently using a bespoke extraction form. We used Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to appraise risk of bias. Theoretical Domains Framework was used to interpret qualitative data. Of 3,090 citations identified, 28 citations were taken forward for data extraction. Main indications for MI-E use during invasive ventilation were presence of secretions and mucus plugging (13/28, 46%). Perceived contraindications related to use of high levels of positive pressure (18/28, 68%). Protocolized MI-E settings with a pressure of ± 40 cm H 2 O were most commonly used, with detail on timing, flow, and frequency of prescription infrequently reported. Various outcomes were re-intubation rate, wet sputum weight, and pulmonary mechanics. Only 3 studies reported the occurrence of adverse events. From qualitative data, the main barrier to MI-E use in this subject group was lack of knowledge and skills. We concluded that there is little consistency in how MI-E is used and reported, and therefore, recommendations about best practices are not possible.

### Effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in preventing respiratory failure after extubation: a randomized controlled trial [^1167pEEs]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The process of weaning from mechanical ventilation must balance the risk of complications due to unnecessary delays in extubation with the risk of complications due to early discontinuation and the need for reintubation. Patients who require reintubation have been noted to have a significantly higher mortality rate than those who are successfully extubated on the first attempt.

Patients in the intensive care setting very often have impaired airway clearance. Endotracheal intubation prevents the patient from closing the glottis, which is necessary for effective coughing. Care of the intubated patient includes direct suction applied through the endotracheal tube which clears a small portion of the airway, is ineffective for clearing secretions in the peripheral airways, and leaves the patient dependent on mucociliary clearance rather than on cough clearance. Deep insufflation with a self-inflating ventilation bag can help, especially if accompanied by chest physiotherapy, but it does not recreate a cough.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is an exceedingly common problem in intensive care units (ICUs), occurring in as many as 27% of patients. The reasons for this are complex, but a significant role is played by the aspiration of upper-airway secretions and gastric contents. Despite the many reports and reviews on ventilator-associated pneumonia, little emphasis is placed on airway clearance.

Predictors for successful weaning include respiratory rate less than 38 per minute and a rapid shallow breathing index below 100 breaths/min/L. However, even in patients who satisfy weaning criteria and pass ventilator-weaning trials, an extubation failure rate of 10% to 20% exists.

Postextubation respiratory failure is defined as the presence of signs and symptoms of respiratory distress in the first 48 hours after extubation. The reasons given for extubation failure include lack of improvement in the work of breathing, hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, retained secretions, and decreased consciousness. However, if at extubation, the lungs are healthy and ventilation can be fully maintained noninvasively, then the only remaining concern is the effective expulsion of airway secretions. Despite the importance of this factor, no ventilator weaning parameter addresses the ability to cough.

### Pneumothorax associated with mechanical insufflation-exsufflation and related factors [^115aCr7N]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Impaired cough that results in ineffective airway secretion clearance is an important contributor to pulmonary complications in patients with neuromuscular weakness including spinal cord injury. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) is a respiratory aid used by patients with weak respiratory muscles to increase cough peak flows and improve cough effectiveness. Relative contraindications to MI-E are said to include susceptibility to pneumothorax, but the association of pneumothorax with MI-E use has never before been described. We report two cases of pneumothorax in patients with respiratory muscle weakness associated with daily use of MI-E: one was a 58-yr-old male with C4 ASIA C tetraplegia, and the other was a 26-yr-old male with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Both patients also used positive-pressure ventilatory assistance. Although seemingly rare in this patient population, ventilator users also using MI-E who have increasing dyspnea or who require increasing positive inspiratory pressures when using noninvasive ventilation should be evaluated for pneumothorax.

### 2022 year in review: mechanical insufflation-exsufflation [^115H2EAH]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Manual and mechanical cough augmentation techniques are used for airway clearance when cough effort is ineffective. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) has been a mainstay for respiratory complications of neuromuscular disorders, but its use has expanded to other conditions that result in respiratory muscle weakness and impaired cough, such as intubation and mechanical ventilation. Mechanical in-exsufflation has been used for cough augmentation in both adults and children but has been more widely evaluated in adults. Optimal settings for pressure and time are unknown. Newer MI-E devices have the option for oscillatory vibrations during therapy to facilitate secretion clearance. However, use of oscillations is not supported by the available evidence. Pressure settings and the interface used to administer MI-E influence peak expiratory flow generated during therapy. Laryngeal dysfunction can impact successful MI-E treatment in individuals with neuromuscular disorders and bulbar involvement. Transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy and videofluoroscopy may be helpful in assessing the laryngeal response and in customizing pressure settings to decrease the incidence of upper airway collapse during therapy. Electrical impedance tomography has been used for monitoring during mechanical ventilation and may have a role in assessing the effectiveness of MI-E. Much of the literature that supports MI-E is derived from small, single-center studies of adult populations. Future study is warranted for efficacy and optimization of MI-E therapy in various clinical applications.

Pediatric chronic home invasive ventilation — mechanical insufflation–exsufflation (MI-E): We suggest that a mechanical insufflation–exsufflation device be used to help maintain airway patency in patients requiring home mechanical ventilation with ineffective cough, including, but not limited to, those with neuromuscular disease with poor respiratory muscle strength (Conditional; Very low). Equipment to facilitate airway clearance is essential in reducing the risk of acute airway obstruction in patients with ineffective cough, and the recommendation places high value on avoiding emergent airway plugging and low value on increased costs and resource use.

### Pilot observational cohort study to determine whether waveform and flow traces from mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) can be used to identify laryngeal responses to MI-E and thus optimise treatment algorithms in neuromuscular patients in a tertiary centre: a protocol description [^111x12pM]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Background

People with neuromuscular disease (NMD) can develop weak respiratory muscles and subsequently can suffer with impaired cough strength. Having an impaired cough strength reduces the ability of the individual to clear their pulmonary secretions via the normal mucocilliary escalator. This impaired cough can lead to: recurrent respiratory infections, potential hospitalisations, increased symptom burden, reduced quality of life and potentially subsequent increased mortality.

One treatment option for managing respiratory secretions and a weak cough is mechanical insufflation–exsufflation (MI-E), also known as cough assist.MI-E involves a positive insufflation pressure applied to aid people to reach a maximum insufflation capacity (MIC), followed by a negative exsufflation pressure which aids expiratory flow bias, enhancing the mucociliary escalator and aiding expulsion of pulmonary secretions. This treatment technique is known to increase the peak cough flow (PCF) to an effective level, at which patients are able to clear pulmonary secretions. This treatment can be applied as a prophylactic measure to prevent the buildup of retained secretions, or during a period of a respiratory infection to assist admission avoidance. It has been demonstrated to be a more time efficient treatment option when patients are unwell compared with chest physiotherapy without the use of MI-E.

It is known that patients, especially those with bulbar dysfunction, can have an abnormal laryngeal response to MI-E, which can make the treatment technique difficult to apply and potentially ineffective. In these patients, the larynx can close and narrow during the insufflation phase of the MI-E, resulting in MIC not being met. Without adequate insufflation, a sufficient expiratory flow bias cannot be achieved, and cough remains ineffective. The pharynx can also become constricted and narrowed during exsufflation, additionally causing reduction in expiratory flow, meaning cough effectiveness can be reduced, and pulmonary secretions cannot be expelled. Within a research environment and at specialist centres, nasal endoscopy has been used to visualise the larynx and quantify the laryngeal response to MI-E.

The next step of establishing how treatment prescriptions might be amended to avoid laryngeal responses or minimise their impact has yet to be taken. Furthermore, anecdotally in clinical practice, the use of nasal endoscopy to assess laryngeal responses to MI-E is not routine due to procedural practicalities, lack of resources, lack of trained staff and acceptance by patients.

Humidification with NIV

Recommendation

6. Humidification is not routinely required (grade D).

Good practice point
Heated humidification should be considered if the patient complains of mucosal dryness or if respiratory secretions are thick and tenacious.

Bronchodilator therapy with NIV

Good practice points
Nebulised drugs should normally be administered during breaks from NIV.
If the patient is dependent on NIV, bronchodilator drugs can be given via a nebuliser inserted into the ventilator tubing.

Sedation with NIV

Recommendatio ns

7. Sedation should only be used with close monitoring (grade D).

8. Infused sedative/anxiolytic drugs should only be used in an HDU or ICU setting (grade D).

9. If intubation is not intended should NIV fail, then sedation/anxiolysis is indicated for symptom control in the distressed or agitated patient (grade D).

Good practice point
In the agitated/distressed and/or tachypneic individual on NIV, intravenous morphine 2.5–5 mg (± benzodiazepine) will provide symptom relief and may improve tolerance of NIV.

NIV complications

Good practice points
Minor complications are common but those of a serious nature are rare. Patients should be frequently assessed to identify potential complications of NIV.
Care is needed to avoid overtightening of masks.
Previous episodes of ventilator-associated pneumothorax warrant consideration of admission to HDU/ICU and use of NIV at lower than normal inspiratory pressures.
The development of a pneumothorax usually requires intercostal drainage and review of whether to continue with NIV.

Sputum retention

Recommendations

10. In patients with NMD, mechanical insufflation and exsufflation should be used, in addition to standard physiotherapy techniques, when cough is ineffective and there is sputum retention (grade B).

11. Minitracheostomy may have a role in aiding secretion clearance in cases of weak cough (NMD/CWD) or excessive amounts (COPD, CF) (grade D).

Modes of IMV

Recommendations

12. Spontaneous breathing should be established as soon as possible in all causes of AHRF (grade C).

13. Controlled IMV may need to be continued in some patients due to severe airflow obstruction, weak muscles leading to poor triggering or to correct chronic hypercapnia (grade C).

Good practice point
In the obstructive diseases, controlled IMV should be continued until airway resistance falls.

### Airway clearance in neuromuscular weakness [^114Dsfxh]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Impaired airway clearance leads to recurrent chest infections and respiratory deterioration in neuromuscular weakness. It is frequently the cause of death. Cough is the major mechanism of airway clearance. Cough has several components, and assessment tools are available to measure the different components of cough. These include measuring peak cough flow, respiratory muscle strength, and inspiratory capacity. Each is useful in assessing the ability to generate an effective cough, and can be used to guide when techniques of assisting airway clearance may be effective for the individual and which are most effective. Techniques to assist airway clearance include augmenting inspiration by air stacking, augmenting expiration by assisting the cough, and augmenting both inspiration and expiration with the mechanical insufflator-exsufflator or by direct suctioning via a tracheostomy. Physiotherapists are invaluable in assisting airway clearance, and in teaching patients and their families how to use these techniques. Use of the mechanical insufflator-exsufflator has gained popularity in recent times, but several simpler, more economical methods are available to assist airway clearance that can be used effectively alone or in combination. This review examines the literature available on the assessment and management of impaired airway clearance in neuromuscular weakness.

### ICU-acquired weakness: what is preventing its rehabilitation in critically ill patients? [^116RRbpK]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) has been recognized as an important and persistent complication in survivors of critical illness. The absence of a consistent nomenclature and diagnostic criteria for ICUAW has made research in this area challenging. Although many risk factors have been identified, the data supporting their direct association have been controversial. Presently, there is a growing body of literature supporting the utility and benefit of early mobility in reducing the morbidity from ICUAW, but few centers have adopted this into their ICU procedures. Ultimately, the implementation of such a strategy would require a shift in the knowledge and culture within the ICU, and may be facilitated by novel technology and patient care strategies. The purpose of this article is to briefly review the diagnosis, risk factors, and management of ICUAW, and to discuss some of the barriers and novel treatments to improve outcomes for our ICU survivors.

### Effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in preventing respiratory failure after extubation: a randomized controlled trial [^115T384J]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Weaning protocols that include noninvasive ventilation (NIV) decrease re-intubation rates and ICU length of stay. However, impaired airway clearance is associated with NIV failure. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) has been proven to be very effective in patients receiving NIV. We aimed to assess the efficacy of MI-E as part of an extubation protocol.

Method

Patients with mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 48 hours with specific inclusion criteria, who successfully tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), were randomly allocated before extubation, either for (A) a conventional extubation protocol (control group), or (B) the MI-E extubation protocol (study group). During the postextubation period (48 hours), group A patients received standard medical treatment (SMT), including NIV in case of specific indications, whereas group B received the same postextubation approach plus three daily sessions of mechanical in-exsufflation (MI-E). Reintubation rates, ICU length of stay, and NIV failure rates were analyzed.

Results

Seventy-five patients (26 women) with a mean age of 61.8 ± 17.3 years were randomized to a control group (n = 40; mean SAPS II, 47.8 ± 17.7) and to a study group (n = 35; mean SAPS II, 45.0 ± 15.0). MV time before enrollment was 9.4 ± 4.8 and 10.5 ± 4.1 days for the control and the study group, respectively. In the 48 hours after extubation, 20 control patients (50%) and 14 study patients (40%) used NIV. Study group patients had a significant lower reintubation rate than did controls; six patients (17%) versus 19 patients (48%), P < 0.05; respectively, and a significantly lower time under MV; 17.8 ± 6.4 versus 11.7 ± 3.5 days; P < 0.05; respectively. Considering only the subgroup of patients that used NIV, the reintubation rates related to NIV failure were significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls; two patients (6%) versus 13 (33%); P < 0.05, respectively. Mean ICU length of stay after extubation was significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls (3.1 ± 2.5 versus 9.8 ± 6.7 days; P < 0.05). No differences were found in the total ICU length of stay.

Conclusion

Inclusion of MI-E may reduce reintubation rates with consequent reduction in postextubation ICU length of stay. This technique seems to be efficient in improving the efficacy of NIV in this patient population.

### Effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in preventing respiratory failure after extubation: a randomized controlled trial [^112APTqk]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

In our study, the main reason for reintubation in group A was the presence of "secretion encumbrance associated with severe hypoxemia", in contrast with the fact that only two patients from group B were reintubated for the same reason. This fact may indicate that secretion clearance with MI-E might have had a positive role in preventing respiratory failure after extubation.

Secretion encumbrance with impaired airway clearance has been considered an independent factor for extubation failure, and associated with NIV failure both in persistent weaning and in postextubation failure patients. Although it is relatively easy to manage secretions through an endotracheal tube, it can be a serious problem after extubation and especially during NIV. Deep-airway-suction suctioning through the tube is a strategy most commonly used by nursing staff to manage secretions; while patients are receiving invasive MV, however, it can be traumatic, difficult to perform, and often ineffective in the extubated patients, because it must be performed blindly through the nose or the mouth.

This study randomly used MI-E (CoughAssist; Phillips Respironics International Inc. Murrysville, PA, USA) before extubation via invasive tube and after extubation through oronasal interface at sufficient inspiratory and expiratory pressures (minimum of 40 to −40 cm H₂O) to expand fully and then to empty fully the adult lungs in 6 to 8 seconds, thereby expelling airway secretions while avoiding both hyper- and hypoventilation. The ability to use MI-E through the endotracheal tube immediately before extubation was the main intervention that permitted the study group patients to minimize the risk of postextubation secretion encumbrance, and, together with its three daily noninvasive applications, may have had an influence on the reduction of reintubation and NIV failure rates.

Although MI-E has been described as a very efficient technique in the acute setting for patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD), in the treatment of respiratory failure due to upper respiratory tract infections, to avoid intubation, and to facilitate extubation, decannulation, and to prevent postextubation failure, the evidence supporting the role of this technique in this other critically ill patient population is lacking. Indeed, this study is the first randomized controlled trial focused on MI-E in critical care.

### Physiological effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in patients with neuromuscular disease: a scoping review [^114JYMYU]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Effective airway clearance is essential for persons with neuromuscular disease. Airway clearance prevents infection and optimizes respiratory function and ventilation. The use of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) to promote airway clearance in persons with neuromuscular disorders is well documented. The aim of this scoping review was to identify and map the available evidence relating to physiological effects of MI-E in patients with neuromuscular disease. Electronic databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, EMCARE, SCOPUS, COCHRANE, and Web of Science, were searched from inception to November 2024. Inclusion criteria were studies involving spontaneous breathing, adult or pediatric participants with a neuromuscular diagnosis, English/translated to English articles, full-text articles, and studies involving MI-E with clear strategies. Data were extracted by 2 authors using a bespoke extraction form. A Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess quality. Of 1,176 abstracts identified, 25 records were included. The review data suggested MI-E was well tolerated in persons with neuromuscular disease and proposed improved cough compared with participants' baseline. Studies predominately used cough peak flow to assess MI-E effectiveness, with emerging evidence looking at upper airway dynamics. Studies specifically focused on a pediatric neuromuscular cohort are vital, as this remains an under-researched area.

Implementation stance for ICU-acquired weakness — In the absence of clarity, the authors state they are unable to explicitly advocate for a systematic identification approach; instead, ICU clinicians can only leverage evidence for early rehabilitation in broadly defined critically ill patients to prevent or ameliorate disability. They add that this process can and should be revised once more rigorous intervention and diagnostic comparison studies are available, and note that while standard case identification can quantify the problem and focus limited resources, true benefit needs to be proven first.

### Use of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation devices for airway clearance in subjects with neuromuscular disease [^114miGXu]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review is to examine the benefit/risk ratio of the use of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) devices for airway clearance in patients with neuromuscular diseases. A search was conducted for relevant studies in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Health Technology Assessment Database using the main key words: cough, airway clearance, in-exsufflation. The search limits were studies published in English and French between 1970 and 2014 (literature watch until December 2015). The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using (1) the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials and (2) the Institute of Health Economics' 20-item checklist for comparative and observational studies. Data were extracted into an evidence table according to (1) study design, (2) population characteristics (including age and type of diseases) and intervention (MI-E associated or not with other interventions), (3) outcome measures, and (4) key findings. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria (4 randomized controlled trials, 3 comparative studies, and 5 observational studies). The quality of the selected studies was poor. None of the studies reported survival outcome. All studies evaluated change of pulmonary function parameters, such as peak expiratory flow. This review underlines the lack of robust data on mechanical medical devices used for airway clearance. The current scientific evidence does not support the use of MI-E for cough augmentation in patients with neuromuscular diseases, but health-care professionals are faced with the reality of medical practice and the absence of alternatives. Most European and American guidelines recommend the use of MI-E despite low-level evidence. However, even if performing comparative trials in a specific population is difficult, the medical device industry should provide reliable data to assist health-care professionals, providers, and payers in the decision-making process. This is the only way to ensure the best treatment for patients.

### Effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in preventing respiratory failure after extubation: a randomized controlled trial [^116ofc6C]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results found in this trial suggest that secretion management with MI-E may work as a useful complementary technique to prevent reintubation in patients in whom ARF develops in the first 48 hours after extubation. The use of MI-E had a stronger impact in preventing reintubation in the group of patients that required NIV, as shown by the lower NIV failure rates in the patients that were submitted to MI-E.

Significant debate still exists concerning the precise indications and efficacy of NIV in this patient population without any mention of the problem of impaired airway secretion.

The randomized controlled studies performed by Esteban et al. and Keenan et al. concluded that NIV is not efficient in reducing reintubation rates, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and ICU and hospital length of stay. None of these studies showed improvement in survival in patients that used NIV in addition to SMT. On the contrary, the trials conducted by Nava et al. and Ferrer et al. showed that NIV could prevent ARF after extubation. Several facts may explain these differences.

First, whereas the studies by Keenan et al. and Esteban et al. applied NIV after patients had developed symptoms of respiratory failure, the studies by Nava et al. and Ferrer et al. previously identified the high-risk patients and applied NIV immediately after extubation. As a longer time from extubation to reintubation is associated with a worse outcome, delay in reintubation correlates with worse survival rates in patients who received NIV for established postextubation respiratory failure. Thus, the early application of NIV seems crucial to avoid respiratory failure after extubation, and consequently reintubation.

Second, a significantly higher proportion of patients with chronic respiratory disorders were included in the studies that used early NIV in high-risk patients, whereas the NIV postextubation respiratory-failure trials enrolled only 10% to 11% of patients with chronic pulmonary disease and used different definitions for postextubation respiratory failure.

Standard medical therapy

All patients received postextubation standard medical therapy, including supplemental oxygen, as needed, respiratory chest physiotherapy, bronchodilators, antibiotics, and any other therapies, as directed by the attending physician.

Criteria for NIV were the same in the two groups in the first 48 hours after extubation. Patients were submitted to NIV, if they met at least one of the following criteria, as judged after they had undergone the assigned treatment: respiratory rate, > 35 beats/min; SpO 2, < 90%; 20% variation of heart rate or blood pressure; dyspnea with respiratory distress; PaO 2 < 60 mm Hg; PaCO 2 > 45 mm Hg; pH < 7.35. The failure of NIV was declared when the main criteria for its application were not solved or the patient showed intolerance to the technique in the first 2 hours of use.

Noninvasive ventilation was provided via an ICU ventilator with noninvasive mode or via a portable pressure-cycled ventilator through an oronasal mask as the first choice. Other interfaces, such as nasal, total face, helmet, and mouthpieces were used in case of patient's intolerance to the oronasal mask.

The fraction of inspired oxygen and the positive end-expiratory pressure were titrated to maintain the arterial oxygen saturation above 90% (or PaO₂ > 60 mm Hg). The ventilator settings were subsequently adjusted as needed for the patient's comfort. The facial skin was assessed every 4 hours to prevent damage from the tightly fitting mask.

The decision regarding when to discontinue noninvasive ventilation was left to the attending physician.

### Evidence for beneficial effect of daily use of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in patients with neuromuscular diseases [^114JyDN5]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Daily application of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) is used increasingly in patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) to prevent pulmonary congestion and thereby respiratory tract infections, although its beneficial effect remains uncertain. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review, registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020158278), to compile available evidence for daily MI-E use in subjects with NMDs and stable respiratory condition.

Methods

We performed a systematic comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science up to December 23, 2021. We excluded articles studying the effect of MI-E in case of acute respiratory failure or infections and studies comparing different MI-E devices and settings. Studied outcomes were prevalence and severity of respiratory infections, lung function, respiratory characteristics, and patient satisfaction. We performed a meta-analysis using DerSimonian-Laird random effects model and assessed methodological quality by using the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research tool.

Results

A total of 3,374 records were screened, of which 25 were included, studying 608 subjects. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) found a trend toward reduced duration of respiratory infections compared to air stacking (AS) that was not statistically significant. Long-term effects on pulmonary function tests (PFT) results were reported in one RCT and one retrospective study, with mixed results regarding vital capacity. Most studies compared PFT results before and immediately after MI-E use. Meta-analysis showed an overall beneficial effect of MI-E on cough peak flow (CPF) compared to unassisted CPF (mean difference 91.6 L/min [95% CI 28.3–155.0], P < .001). Subject satisfaction was high, though possibly influenced by major bias.

Conclusions

There is limited evidence available to support beneficial effects of daily use of MI-E in clinically stable subjects with NMDs, with the possible exception of increased CPF immediately after MI-E application. Lack of longitudinal studies preclude conclusions regarding long-term effects. The very limited data comparing MI-E to AS preclude comparisons.

### Cough augmentation with mechanical insufflation / exsufflation in patients with neuromuscular weakness [^113HaFTJ]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Adults and children with neuromuscular disease exhibit weak cough and are susceptible to recurrent chest infections, a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Mechanical insufflation/exsufflation may improve cough efficacy by increasing peak cough flow. It was hypothesised that mechanical insufflation/exsufflation would produce a greater increase in peak cough flow than other modes of cough augmentation. The acceptability of these interventions was also compared. Twenty-two patients aged 10–56 yrs (median 21 yrs) with neuromuscular disease and 19 age-matched controls were studied. Spirometry was performed and respiratory muscle strength measured. Peak cough flow was recorded during maximal unassisted coughs, followed in random order by coughs assisted by physiotherapy, noninvasive ventilation, insufflation and exsufflation, and exsufflation alone. Subjects rated strength of cough, distress and comfort on a visual analogue scale. In the neuromuscular disease group, mean ± SD forced expiratory volume in one second was 0.8 ± 0.6 L x s(-1), forced vital capacity 0.9 ± 0.8 L, maximum inspiratory pressure 25 ± 16 cmH2O, maximum expiratory pressure 26 ± 22 cmH2O and unassisted peak cough flow 169 ± 90 L x min(-1). The greatest increase in peak cough flow was observed with mechanical insufflation/exsufflation at 235 ± 111 L x min(-1) (p < 0.01). All techniques showed similar patient acceptability. Mechanical insufflation/exsufflation produces a greater increase in peak cough flow than other standard cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with neuromuscular disease.

### Effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in preventing respiratory failure after extubation: a randomized controlled trial [^1142S17L]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

In our study, both study and control groups included 20% of patients with chronic respiratory disorders, and all patients were closely monitored during the first 48 hours for early detection of signs and symptoms that indicated postextubation respiratory failure. Similarly, in the studies performed by Esteban et al. and Keenan et al. NIV was applied only after the development of those symptoms, according to specific criteria. However, in our study, NIV was applied in both groups according to similar criteria, and only MI-E application was considered an independent variable for group B only.

Keenan et al. showed a reintubation rate of 72% and 69% in the study (submitted to NIV) and the control group, respectively. Esteban et al. also showed a high reintubation rate (48%) both in the study group and in the control group. The patients enrolled in these two studies were selected after confirmation of postextubation respiratory failure, which may justify such higher rates. Reintubation rates of the control group were also relatively high in our study, and although we enrolled a different population that underwent a planned extubation, this is a strong limitation of this study. However, our patient population included only patients with acute hypoxemic and/or hypercapnic respiratory failure with a considerable risk of extubation failure, and we used the same criteria for reintubation. Moreover, in our study, NIV was used in both groups, and its failure rate was also significant higher in group A (control group), a fact that also may justify the high reintubation rate in this group. The data in this study also confirm that extubation failure is associated with increased length of ICU stay.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness in adults [^116CSHgJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) epidemiology includes estimates that 13 to 20 million people annually require life support in intensive care units worldwide; in the United States, more than 750,000 people receive mechanical ventilation, with almost 300,000 requiring prolonged support (> 5 d) annually. Multiple series estimate that ~25% of patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation develop global and persistent weakness, and based on this, more than 75,000 patients in the United States and up to 1 million worldwide may develop ICUAW. Physical impairment is common and may persist for years, and in some patients physical deficits manifest as profound weakness associated with worsened outcomes.

American Thoracic Society guideline research recommendations for ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) are as follows: Recommendation 1: We recommend well-designed, adequately powered and executed randomized controlled trials comparing physical rehabilitation or other alternative treatments with usual care in patients with ICUAW that measure and report patient-important outcomes (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Recommendation 2: We recommend clinical research to determine the role of prior patient disability in the development of and recovery from ICUAW (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Recommendation 3: We recommend clinical research that determines whether or not patients would want to know if they have ICUAW even though no specific therapy currently exists and how patient preferences influence medical decision making or the perception of prognosis (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

### The effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation on lung function and complications in cardiac surgery patients: a pilot study [^111Mx1Ck]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study demonstrated that cardiac surgery patients who received MI-E therapy had better lung function compared to those who received IPPB therapy. The incidence of post-operative pulmonary complications including pneumonia, atelectasis, and pleural effusion, were similar in both the groups. However, the number of subjects who experienced chest pain was higher in the MI-E group, compared to the IPPB group.

Compatible with previous reports, the current study observed significant decline in the values of effort-dependent lung function tests, such as FVC, FEV₁, and peak expiratory flow rate, after surgery in both groups. The study subjects developed a proportional decrease in lung volume without change in the FEV₁/FVC ratio; indicating a restrictive pulmonary defect after surgery. The normal activity of most of the respiratory muscle groups is impaired after a major surgery, including the airway muscles, abdominal muscles, and diaphragm. Factors contributing to this dysfunction include anesthetic agents and neuromuscular blocking agents, drugs used for post-operative analgesia, pain, disturbed sleep patterns and the inflammatory response to surgery. In addition to the simple muscle weakness, the etiology of decreased lung function may involve poor sputum clearance, poor co-ordination between muscle groups and failure of the normal physiological reflexes, which control the effort-dependent lung function. Theoretically, MI-E therapy may simulate coughing and facilitate better sputum clearance in patients. In the present study, the percentage of improvement of segmental and lobar atelectasis in the MI-E group was observed to be higher, compared to the IPPB group. However, the difference was not statistically significant; probably due to the inadequate sample size. Therefore, further research is mandatory to elucidate the effects of MI-E therapy on the improvement of atelectasis and lung function.

### Evaluation of the accuracy of a mechanical insufflation-exsufflation device's cough peak flow measurement [^113yvb31]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) is used to augment secretion clearance in neuromuscular patients with weakened cough strength. Cough peak flow (CPF) is a measure of cough function that is used to assess a patient's ability to clear secretions, with thresholds set that categorize cough as effective, ineffective or severely ineffective. MI-E is prescribed according to these thresholds, and CPF is used to assess titration of MI-E settings. The Clearway2 (Breas Medical, Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom) displays a real-time CPF, measured by an internal pneumotachograph. This study sought to assess the agreement and repeatability of this displayed CPF, against the reference CPF measurement by a calibrated pneumotachograph. Methods: This study consisted of two phases (1) lung model (Group A) and (2) acutely unwell individuals with neuromuscular conditions (Group B) and clinically stable individuals with neuromuscular conditions (Group C). Simultaneous CPF measurements were recorded from the MI-E device (CPF MI-E) and a calibrated pneumotachograph (CPF), which was inserted into the MI-E circuit. Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess agreement between methods of measurement, and repeatability was assessed using a repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: During phase 1, 805 simulated coughs were evaluated with the Clearway2. The mean bias toward CPF MI-E was 33L/min (95% limits of agreement 6–60L/min). During phase 2, the mean bias increased to 66L/min (95% limits of agreement 13–119L/min). CPF MI-E and CPF both had good repeatability in all groups. Conclusions: The Clearway2 MI-E device provided a real-time CPF measurement that was repeatable and systematically higher than CPF. It may therefore be a useful tool to measure change longitudinally, or in response to changes in MI-E settings, in an individual patient. Caution is advised if using the CPF MI-E to assess cough efficacy against clinical thresholds.

### Effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in preventing respiratory failure after extubation: a randomized controlled trial [^117RhYQP]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Results

In total, 92 patients were considered for the study period, 17 of whom did not meet the inclusion criteria. Seventy-five patients (26 women) with a mean age of 61.8 ± 17.3 years old were randomized, 40 to the control group (group A) and 35 to the study group (group B). Baseline characteristics at baseline were similar in both groups, as well as the reasons for MV. Demographic data and patients' characteristics at the entry into the study are listed in Table 1.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of patients at entry into the study

Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; MV, mechanical ventilation; NS, nonsignificant; SAPS II, New Simplified Acute Physiology Score.

During the 48 hours after extubation, none of the patients from both groups died, and 19 (48%) from group A and six (17%) from group B were reintubated. Twenty patients (50%) from group A and 14 patients (40%) from group B used NIV. All patients from both groups for whom NIV failed, according to the criteria, were reintubated. Considering this subgroup of patients, the reintubation rates related to NIV failure were significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls; two patients (6%) versus 13 (33%); P < 0.05, respectively.

Outcomes of both patient groups in the first 48 hours after extubation, including the reintubation rates, causes of reintubation, as well as ICU length of stay data, are listed in Table 2. When compared with controls, both duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and postextubation ICU length of stay were significantly shorter by 6 days (P < 0.05), and the reintubation rate was significantly lower (17% versus 48%) in the study group. No significant differences were noted in total ICU length of stay.

### Clinical review: intensive care unit acquired weakness [^111Xa5ei]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

ICUAW affects many critically ill patients and is associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospital stay, as well as increased ICU and hospital mortality and healthcare-related hospitalization costs. In addition, following the acute phase of illness, ICUAW may be an important contributor to the physical limitations persisting in ICU survivors, associated with reduced health-related quality of life, as well as higher 1-year mortality. This underscores the importance for future research on prevention of ICUAW. In parallel, the underlying mechanisms contributing to the poor outcome of weak patients and the potential to avert unfavorable outcomes by post-ICU follow-up of these patients should also be investigated further.

### Intensive care unit-acquired weakness: framing the topic [^115xK5Ua]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

One of the many potential sequelae of intensive care is prolonged weakness, which can be associated with increased morbidity during the intensive care unit stay and long-term functional disability. Despite increased awareness of this complication in recent years, diagnosing intensive care unit-acquired weakness remains difficult and there are no specific therapies. Management, therefore, relies on limiting its short- and long-term effects. One method by which this may be achieved is to reduce sedative use and promote early mobilization and exercise.

American Thoracic Society (ATS) pediatric chronic home invasive ventilation — monitoring, equipment, and maintenance: For children requiring chronic home invasive ventilation, we suggest monitoring, especially when the child is asleep or unobserved, with a pulse oximeter rather than use of a cardiorespiratory monitor or use of the ventilator alarms (Strength of Recommendation: Conditional; Quality of Evidence: Very Low). For children requiring chronic home invasive ventilation, we recommend regular maintenance of home ventilators and all associated equipment as outlined by the manufacturer. We suggest the following pieces of equipment for use in the home when caring for a patient on home mechanical ventilation: the ventilator, a back-up ventilator, batteries, a self-inflating bag and mask, suctioning equipment (portable), heated humidifier, supplemental oxygen for emergency use, nebulizer, and a pulse oximeter (nonrecording) (Strength of Recommendation: Conditional; Quality of Evidence: Very Low). We suggest that a mechanical insufflation–exsufflation device be used to help maintain airway patency in patients requiring home mechanical ventilation with ineffective cough, including, but not limited to, those with neuromuscular disease with poor respiratory muscle strength (Strength of Recommendation: Conditional; Quality of Evidence: Very Low).

### Prevalence of long-term mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in children with neurological conditions: a population-based study [^114wQ7QZ]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

In children with neurological conditions, respiratory complications can be life threatening. Compromised respiration and cough may cause accumulation of airway secretion, possibly leading to pneumonia and respiratory failure. 1, 2, 3 The impaired cough may be assisted mechanically using mechanical insufflation‐exsufflation (MI‐E) that augments the inspiratory volume and expiratory flow necessary in an efficient cough. 4

MI‐E is well established in neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), especially for those with severe muscular weakness, 5, 6, 7 preventing airway infections and hospitalizations. 3, 8 Daily use supports airway clearance and promotes deep inspirations, especially in young children who do not benefit from other airway clearance techniques. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 Recently, MI‐E treatment has been suggested for children with impaired cough due to quadriplegic cerebral palsy (CP), 12, 13 as severe motor impairment may lead to compromised airway clearance and hospitalizations. 1, 2, 14, 15, 16, 17

To help decide if MI‐E is indicated, Peak Cough Flow is the preferred measurement of cough capacity. 18 However, being effort dependent, it has major limitations in children. Thus, initiating paediatric MI‐E treatment has largely been dependent upon clinical judgment. Clinical indications for MI‐E in children with muscle weakness are recurrent, prolonged respiratory infections and weak cough and voice. 5, 6, 7 Since 2001, the Norwegian health authorities have provided publicly funded MI‐E devices when prescribed by a specialized physician, independent of area of residence or socioeconomic status, and without financial restriction.

Information on children with a neurological diagnosis who have an MI‐E device is scarce. Our aim was to determine the overall prevalence of long‐term MI‐E in the Norwegian paediatric population with a neurological diagnosis and to identify the clinical assessments and reported reasons behind initiation of the MI‐E treatment. The secondary aim was to describe the concomitant use of long‐term mechanical ventilation (LTMV) support in children equipped with an MI‐E device.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness in adults [^114SnvzN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

ICU-acquired weakness risk groups and ventilation exposure — Eleven studies reported data about the prevalence of ICUAW among hypothesized high-risk populations, and two were excluded for lacking a control group. A pooled analysis from seven severe sepsis studies (262 patients; median, 43; IQR, 28–56) compared with five studies of other patient groups (504 patients; median, 95; IQR, 50–136) indicated that the incidence of significant weakness was significantly higher than that observed in studies of other patient groups (64 vs. 30%, P < 0.001). In four prospective studies, the prevalence of sepsis at presentation did not differ by weakness status (52% in weak patients vs. 56% of those without weakness, P = 0.46). Seven studies found longer mechanical ventilation among ICUAW patients (median, 25 d [IQR, 12–33 d] vs. 18 d [IQR, 8–18.5 d]; P = 0.06), and a pooled analysis of 14 studies suggested higher ICUAW incidence with longer ventilation exposure (33% in studies enrolling patients on ventilation ≤ 5 d vs. 43% in those enrolled after ≥ 7 d, P = 0.06).

### The intensive care medicine research agenda for the management of ICU acquired weakness: a multinational, interprofessional perspective [^112LbLgk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW) is common in critically ill patients, contributing to substantial morbidity. Major trials and novel mechanistic findings published over the past years have advanced knowledge for the prevention and treatment of ICUAW. To streamline future research priorities, a multinational, interdisciplinary group of ICU clinicians, researchers, and people with lived experience convened to develop this evidence-based research agenda. Using a stepwise process including a systematic review with meta-analysis, two expert panel meetings, and a two-round modified Delphi method, we identified the top ten research priorities for ICUAW. Our report highlights the lack of reliable prognostic markers and mechanistic understanding that limit early diagnosis and treatment. Current evidence to treat ICUAW supports enhanced physical rehabilitation versus no rehabilitation, while higher dose enterally-delivered protein alone does not improve patient outcomes. However, the direct effects on muscles or appropriate dosing for patients with comorbidities remain largely unknown. The proposed ten key priority research questions integrate pathophysiology, diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up and emphasise personalised medicine and patient-centred outcomes over the continuum of recovery. Future research should focus on early prognostic markers, mechanisms of ICUAW, and identification of treatment responders allowing individualised dosing strategies tailored across the recovery trajectory. Defining meaningful outcomes, improving follow-up care, and integrating patient, family and caregiver priorities are essential. Advancing this agenda will require interdisciplinary collaboration and the use of emerging methods, including artificial intelligence, to support personalised and effective ICUAW care.

### Effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation on airway mucus clearance among mechanically ventilated ICU subjects [^1132P1yf]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have evaluated the effects of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) in subjects on mechanical ventilation. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of MI-E on airway mucus clearance among mechanically ventilated ICU subjects.

Methods

A randomized, parallel-group, open-label trial was conducted between June and November 2017 in a single, mixed ICU. Adult ICU subjects receiving mechanical ventilation for > 24 h with stable ventilatory and hemodynamic status were randomized to receive either standard respiratory physiotherapy alone (control group) or respiratory physiotherapy by using an MI-E device (intervention group). The primary outcome was the weight of aspirated airway mucus after study interventions. Secondary outcomes included variation in static lung compliance (ΔC L), airway resistance (ΔR aw), work of breathing (ΔWOB) in relation to the pre-intervention period, and hemodynamic and ventilator complications during the procedures.

Results

There were 90 subjects in each group. The mean ± SD weight of the aspirated airway mucus was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (2.42 ± 2.32 g vs 1.35 ± 1.56 g, P < .001). The ΔC L values in the intervention group were higher than those in the control group (1.76 ± 4.90 mL/cm H 2 O vs -0.57 ± 4.85 mL/cm H 2 O, P = 0.001). The ΔR aw and ΔWOB values were similar between the groups. No hemodynamic or ventilatory complications were observed.

Conclusions

Among the general ICU subjects receiving mechanical ventilation, use of an MI-E device during respiratory physiotherapy resulted in a larger amount of airway mucus clearance than respiratory physiotherapy alone. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT03178565.).

### Progress in respiratory management of bulbar complications of motor neuron disease / amyotrophic lateral sclerosis? [^116udZmp]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

Impairment of swallowing coordination and cough efficacy will predispose the individual to the risk of choking and pulmonary aspiration. Teaching the patient and family/carers physiotherapy techniques such as manually assisted cough and breath stacking using a lung volume recruitment bag (eg, 'Ambu' bag) with one way valve can be simple and inexpensive first steps. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) has been used increasingly in individuals with neuromuscular weakness despite the lack of large randomised trials, although there is cumulative evidence that MI-E increases PCF and in combination with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) can prolong survival. However, NIV and MI-E are reported to be less effective in those with bulbar involvement. Furthermore, it is often taught that patients with spastic upper motor neuron weakness are least likely to tolerate MI-E as upper airway collapse/spasm may be generated. This might be particularly the case at higher pressure spans which are reported to be most effective in other cohorts with neuromuscular disease.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112Hv3Ep]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Intensive care extubation — cough peak flow (CPF) has prognostic value and practical measurement considerations. In adults, CPF has been measured before extubation as a predictor of reintubation, and patients with CPF < ~360 L/min were found to be at high risk of reintubation for both inadequate voluntary and involuntary cough; voluntary CPF is a better indicator to predict reintubation than involuntary CPF. Measuring CPF in patients on ventilation has been problematic because it requires a dedicated flowmeter, a bacterial filter, and the patient's disconnection from the ventilator, but measuring CPF by a built-in ventilator flowmeter did not differ from CPF measured by a spirometer. Therefore, a CPF value of 360 L/min has been suggested as an indicator for safe extubation, and maneuvers such as abdominal thrusts and breath stacking and devices such as rapid insufflation/exsufflation (eg, CoughAssist; Philips Respironics) can augment CPF and clearance in patients with neuromuscular weakness.

### Long-term mechanical insufflation-exsufflation cough assistance in neuromuscular disease: patterns of use and lessons for application [^112LCqsV]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) devices increase expiratory air flow and thereby promote increased cough peak flow (CPF) in conjunction with a cough. There is little research looking at long-term use of MI-E in subjects with neuromuscular disease (NMD), and no long-term study has reported CPF, MI-E device settings, and adherence.

Methods

We evaluated 181 patient records (130 adults, 51 children) of individuals who received a MI-E device from our center between February 2014 and February 2018. Median age (interquartile range [IQR]) was 27 (14–51) y. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were the 3 most common diagnoses.

Results

MI-E devices were provided to the weakest subjects with a CPF < 160 L/min. Median (IQR) settings were insufflation, 25 (23–30) cm H₂O, exsufflation −35 (−30 to −40) cm H₂O, insufflation time 1.5 (1.3–1.7) s, exsufflation time 1.8 (1.5–2.0) s, and pause 1.5 (1.3–2.0) s. The inspiratory flow profile was set to high in all subjects, and no subject used supplemental oxygen with the MI-E device. When comparing insufflation pressures to exsufflation pressures, a greater negative pressure was used relative to positive pressure (P < .001). When comparing insufflation to exsufflation time, there was a significantly longer exsufflation duration (P < .001). Median (IQR) CPF at the start of MI-E was 60 (10–100) L/min. There was no correlation between either insufflation or exsufflation pressures and CPF. Median (IQR) usage for the group was 60% (13.5–100%) of days for the total days. Subjects with tracheostomies or SMA type I had the greatest adherence to treatment. Median (IQR) duration of MI-E use was 17 (8.5–32) months. Ninety-six percent of subjects were receiving ventilatory support.

Conclusions

Greater exsufflation pressures than insufflation pressures, together with a shorter insufflation time than exsufflation time, were used. Predicting good adherence among the subjects was difficult. Subjects who produced daily secretions were more likely to use MI-E every day.

### What is the proper approach to liberating the weak from mechanical ventilation? [^116rYE16]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The general issue of weaning can be viewed as composed of three different groups of patients. First, simple or easy weaning, represents 60% to 70% of patients whose first trial of spontaneous breathing is successful. The main objective of the weaning process is to detect weaning readiness as early as possible, which is best achieved using a systematic approach. The percentage of patients in this group in a given intensive care unit represents the pretest probability of weaning. A second group is made of patients who experience failure of the first spontaneous breathing trial and in whom up to 7 days from the first trial may be required to achieve weaning. This group represents 20% to 25% of patients who undergo weaning from mechanical ventilation. Muscle weakness contributes to the prolongation of weaning in many of these patients. The last group is made of patients who are characterized by a prolonged or very difficult weaning process (about 5% to 15% of patients undergoing weaning). Muscle weakness is likely to be a major contributing factor. Early use of spontaneous breathing, well-controlled use of sedation, and early mobilization may help in reducing muscle weakness and hasten the weaning process. The postextubation period may be particularly at risk in these patients. More research is needed to guide clinicians regarding the best ventilatory management.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness in adults [^117E78Qu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) diagnostic context emphasizes that early rehabilitation is not the only reason to identify ICUAW; a diagnosis prevents unnecessary testing for alternative diagnoses and improves the accuracy of counseling about the anticipated duration of mechanical ventilation and the appropriate timing for transition from intensive to rehabilitative care. There is no consensus approach to the diagnosis of ICUAW, including how or when it can be made, and it is also uncertain how electrophysiological studies should be used. To address such uncertainties, a panel was convened in March of 2009.

### Prevalence of long-term mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in children with neurological conditions: a population-based study [^112Pb7o1]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The prevalence of children equipped with an MI‐E device in the Norwegian neuropaediatric population was 6 per 1000. Age at initiation and prevalence differed between diagnoses. Long‐term MI‐E use was most common in NMDs, but one‐third of the MI‐E devices were given to children with CNS conditions. Clinical signs of impaired mucus clearance, such as weak and ineffective cough and recurrent respiratory infections were the most common reasons to initiate MI‐E, whereas a prophylactic treatment was mainly reported in children with NMDs. The decision to initiate MI‐E was essentially clinical, as voluntary measurements are unfeasible in the majority of children considered to benefit from MI‐E. Ventilator support was found in more than half of the children using MI‐E.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness in adults [^117TFFqD]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline methods state that a committee generated specific recommendations about the diagnosis of ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) by asking specific clinical questions, prioritizing outcomes, developing an a priori search strategy and selection criteria, and performing a systematic review; the literature was appraised using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and then used to formulate and grade clinical recommendations. These guidelines were developed using the GRADE approach in accordance with American Thoracic Society (ATS) policies, and the Critical Care and Nursing Assemblies of the ATS sponsored the project. Invitations were sent out by the committee chair and planning committee to an initial list of experts who were asked for nominations, and Twenty-two individuals accepted; a panel was convened in March of 2009.

### Efficacy of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in extubating unweanable subjects with restrictive pulmonary disorders [^115eoDVk]. Respiratory Care (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Subjects who do not pass ventilator weaning parameters but whose ambient air oxyhemoglobin saturation can be normalized by mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) can be extubated to continuous noninvasive ventilatory support (CNVS) with MIE used to maintain extubation. Our aim was to study MIE-associated changes in breathing tolerance, pulse oximetry, and vital capacity (VC) for consecutive unweanable subjects.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutively referred intubated subjects with single-organ (respiratory muscle) failure. At presentation, CO2 was normalized by adjusting ventilator settings and VC was measured (point 1). Then, MIE was used via the tube up to every h until oximetry remained ≥ 95% on ambient air and VC was remeasured (point 2) immediately before extubation. Subjects who could not meet ventilator weaning criteria and had no ventilator-free breathing ability upon extubation to CNVS were enrolled. Post-extubation, the MIE was used to maintain oximetry ≥ 95% in room air. VC and breathing tolerance were remeasured within 3 weeks (point 3).

Results

Ninety-seven of 98 subjects were successfully extubated despite 45 having been CNVS-dependent for 4 months to 18 y before being intubated. Sixty-nine of the 98 were intubated for 24.9 ± 22 (range 1–158) d and failed 0–6 (mean 1.7) extubation attempts before being transferred and successfully extubated in 2.24 ± 1.78 (range < 1–8) d to CNVS. VC increased by 270% (P < .001) from points 1 to 3. Weaning from CNVS to part-time NVS was achieved by all 52 subjects who had not been CNVS-dependent before intubation. One subject underwent tracheotomy.

Conclusions

Many unweanable subjects can be extubated to CNVS and MIE. The latter can normalize O2 saturation, increase VC, and facilitate extubation.

### Ventilator weaning by lung expansion and decannulation [^117TLH8A]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

This case series of ventilator-dependent patients with neuromuscular disease who had no ventilator-free breathing ability demonstrates that decannulation and switching to continuous noninvasive intermittent positive-pressure ventilation combined with regular lung expansion therapy can result in improvements in pulmonary function and at least partial ventilator weaning. These six patients were also managed using mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for regular lung expansion and cough assistance. Thus, some ventilator users with neuromuscular disease can benefit from tracheostomy tube decannulation and transition to noninvasive intermittent positive-pressure ventilation and assisted coughing for ventilator weaning to predominantly nocturnal-only use.

### Pilot observational cohort study to determine whether waveform and flow traces from mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) can be used to identify laryngeal responses to MI-E and thus optimise treatment algorithms in neuromuscular patients in a tertiary centre: a protocol description [^113N8LrU]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The outcome and potential benefit of this trial will provide an initial indication of whether the waveforms from the MI-E device can be used to identify laryngeal responses to MI-E, thus providing better and more effective guidance of treatment prescription. Use of the waveforms would remove the need for invasive procedures and be more cost effective. The feasibility data could be used to inform further future trials. The data from this trial could be used to guide the development of MI-E devices, for example, on-screen waveforms, which would guide healthcare professionals in setting the MI-E prescriptions. Furthermore, the data from this trial could inform the development of algorithms to automate the prescription of MI-E.

As in all clinical trials, there are limitations to this protocol. Feedback from funders and patient groups has meant that it is outside of the scope of this protocol to include healthy subjects. It will, therefore, not be possible to determine typical MI-E waveform patterns. Given this work is pilot work, we cannot validate potential findings; further research will be required to validate any conclusions from this trial. Given the pilot nature of this work and the small sample size, statistical analysis will not be appropriate. However, this pilot will inform future trials. Additionally, the results of this trial will not inform clinicians whether the use of waveforms to identify laryngeal response is safe, only if it is a feasible technique.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness in adults [^114t247E]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) diagnostic testing practices and rationale: Even though evidence that making a diagnosis improves outcomes is very low, many members of the guideline development committee "routinely test high-risk ICU patients for ICUAW (i.e., patients with severe sepsis, difficulty being liberated from mechanical ventilation, or receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation)" and "perform routine diagnostic testing to identify patients with ICUAW". The approach is based on "unsystematic clinical observations" of potential benefits, "including the prevention of unnecessary testing for alternative diagnoses, earlier initiation of physical and occupational therapy, and increased accuracy of counseling" about recovery. Members who test routinely argue the "potential, albeit unproven, benefit of early physical and occupational therapy is sufficient to warrant diagnostic testing", because therapy can be performed "without harm to the patient and with minimal burden to providers". For modality choice, "MMT is performed in cooperative patients and electrophysiological testing in uncooperative patients", and one stated reason for testing is that "ICUAW is associated with worse clinical outcomes".

### Changes in gastric pressure and volume during mechanical in-exsufflation [^1175JGtf]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2013). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

A mechanical insufflator-exsufflator (MI-E) is used to replicate spontaneous cough in weak or neurologically impaired patients. Its use is often withheld after abdominal surgery because of concerns for potential wound dehiscence from abdominal distension or development of excessive abdominal positive pressure. We hypothesized that gastric pressure during MI-E use would not exceed usual pressures generated during a spontaneous cough.

Methods

Thirteen subjects 0.8–23.1 years (mean 10.5 years) with neuromuscular weakness, pre-existing gastrostomy tube, and established MI-E routine were studied. A pressure transducer through the gastrostomy tube measured gastric pressure (Pgas) during MI-E treatment. Chest and abdominal volume change was assessed by respiratory inductance plethysmography. In three subjects, the same measurements were made during spontaneous cough.

Results

The maximum Pgas was 24cm with applied pressures of 20–40cm. In the three subjects able to cough, the maximum Pgas achieved during the spontaneous maneuver was 25cm, a value higher than they achieved with MI-E treatment.

Conclusion

MI-E resulted in less positive abdominal pressure than has been described in healthy subjects during spontaneous coughing. As such, use of an MI-E device should be considered safe to use in the post-operative period following abdominal surgery in patients with neuromuscular weakness.

### Pilot observational cohort study to determine whether waveform and flow traces from mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) can be used to identify laryngeal responses to MI-E and thus optimise treatment algorithms in neuromuscular patients in a tertiary centre: a protocol description [^114Tp9R7]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with neuromuscular disease often have a weak and ineffective cough due to respiratory muscle weakness. One treatment option is mechanical insufflation–exsufflation (MI-E), also known as cough assist, which is known to increase cough strength. However, some patients have a laryngeal response to MI-E, which can make the treatment ineffective. Currently, the only method for assessing this is via nasal endoscopy while using MI-E. Some MI-E devices have onboard secure data (SD) cards, which allow the visualisation of waveforms. We hypothesise that the waveforms can be used to identify laryngeal responses to the MI-E.

Methods and analysis

Participants will complete baseline assessments of spirometry, peak cough flow and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure. A nasal endoscope will be used to visualise the larynx during simultaneous MI-E via a mask with a drilled hole. MI-E will be delivered by an experienced physiotherapist. Four cycles of MI-E at a range of prescriptions will be delivered. MI-E waveforms will be downloaded into Care Orchestrator Essence software (Philips, Murraysville). Data will be collected prospectively and reviewed in a descriptive context, providing trends and potential rationales describing the waveforms in comparison to the nasal endoscope videos.

Ethics and dissemination

This protocol has been reviewed by the East of England-Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee, who have granted a favourable ethical opinion. The study opened to recruitment in January 2022 and aims to publish trial results in June 2024.

### Cough augmentation techniques in the critically ill: a Canadian national survey [^1166r13H]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Critically ill mechanically ventilated patients experience impaired airway clearance due to ineffective cough and impaired secretion mobilization. Cough augmentation techniques, including mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E), manually assisted cough, and lung volume recruitment, improve cough efficiency. Our objective was to describe use, indications, contraindications, interfaces, settings, complications, and barriers to use across Canada.

Methods

An e-mail survey was sent to nominated local survey champions in eligible Canadian units (ICUs, weaning centers, and intermediate care units) with 4 telephone/e-mail reminders.

Results

The survey response rate was 157 of 238 (66%); 78 of 157 units (50%) used cough augmentation, with 50 (64%) using MI-E, 53 (68%) using manually assisted cough, and 62 (79%) using lung volume recruitment. Secretion clearance was the most common indication (MI-E, 92%; manually assisted cough, 88%; lung volume recruitment, 76%), although the most common units (44%) used it < 50% of the time. Use during weaning from invasive (MI-E, 21%; manually assisted cough, 39%; lung volume recruitment, 3%) and noninvasive ventilation (MI-E, 21%; manually assisted cough, 33%; lung volume recruitment, 21%) was infrequent. The most common diagnoses were neuromuscular disease (97%) and spinal cord injury (83%). Pneumothorax was the most frequently identified absolute contraindication for MI-E (93%) and lung volume recruitment (83%); rib fracture was most frequently identified for manually assisted cough (69%). MI-E mean inspiratory pressure was 31 cm H2O, and expiratory pressure was -32 cm H2O. Mucus plugging requiring tracheostomy inner change was the most frequent complication for MI-E (23%), chest pain for manually assisted cough (36%), and hypotension for lung volume recruitment (17%). The most commonly cited barriers were lack of expertise (70%), knowledge (65%), and resources (52%).

Conclusions

We found moderate adoption of cough augmentation techniques, particularly for secretion management. Lack of expertise and knowledge are potentially modifiable barriers addressed with educational interventions.

### Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation to facilitate the post-operative respiratory outcome of spine surgery in neuromuscular children [^111pgvNm]. European Spine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Scoliosis surgery may be associated with a high morbidity and even mortality in children with non-idiopathic scoliosis. The aim of the study was to report our experience with a pre-operative training to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and a mechanical insufflator-exsufflator (MI-E) device to improve the post-operative respiratory outcome of children scheduled for scoliosis surgery.

Methods

Consecutive patients with non-idiopathic scoliosis undergoing posterior arthrodesis were trained to NPPV and MI-E before intervention. NPPV and MI-E were performed immediately after extubation. Length of intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of NPPV, and respiratory complications were assessed.

Results

Thirteen patients participated in the training (mean age 13.9 ± 2.6, mean vital capacity 52.3 ± 15.4% predicted). The patients had severe respiratory muscle weakness with a mean sniff oesophageal pressure of 35.8 ± 14.2 cmH2O (50% predicted) and a mean gastric pressure during a cough of 31.9 ± 7.8 cmH2O (30% predicted). The mean length of intubation was 19.9 ± 12.3 h with a mean length of ICU stay of 2.5 ± 2.5 days. NPPV was used during a mean of 2.7 ± 1.9 days after surgery. No respiratory complication was observed. One patient died 3 months after surgery from multi-organ failure of non-respiratory origin.

Conclusions

No respiratory complications were observed after scoliosis correction surgery in children with non-idiopathic scoliosis after pre-operative training and post-operative use of NPPV and MI-E, underlying the interest of this management in these high-risk patients.

American Thoracic Society intensive care unit–acquired weakness (ICUAW) diagnostic testing — research and value statements include: "We recommend well-designed, adequately powered and executed randomized controlled trials comparing physical rehabilitation or other alternative treatments with usual care in patients with ICUAW that measure and report patient-important outcomes. (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)". "We recommend clinical research to determine the role of prior patient disability in the development of and recovery from ICUAW. (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)". "We recommend clinical research that determines whether or not patients would want to know if they have ICUAW even though no specific therapy currently exists and how patient preferences influence medical decision making or the perception of prognosis. (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)". The remarks state, "The recommendations are strong because the guideline development committee is certain that additional research is necessary to prove whether physical rehabilitation or other interventions improve outcomes in patients with ICUAW, and such evidence is necessary before deciding whether or not routine diagnostic testing for ICUAW is indicated". Values and preferences note, "These recommendations place a higher value on avoiding potentially burdensome diagnostic testing if it will not lead to improved outcomes and a lower value on an uncertain improvement in the rate of discharges home rather than to a rehabilitative facility".

### Should early mobilization Be routine in mechanically ventilated patients? [^117Xe47B]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

ICU-acquired weakness is a major complication of critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation. Early mobilization has been shown to decrease the negative consequences of ICU-acquired weakness. However, early mobilization might entail risks to the patient. Additional staffing needs might have a negative financial impact. This review examines whether early mobilization should be routinely performed in mechanically ventilated patients.

### Prevalence of long-term mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in children with neurological conditions: a population-based study [^114Ymtvp]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The child/parents reported the reasons behind commencing MI‐E treatment retrospectively, with a risk of recall bias, and these should not be mistaken as the medically founded indications. Although the questionnaire was developed in cooperation with MI‐E users, it was not formally validated. Nevertheless, we aimed to describe rather than test associations, thus the requirements for internal validity are less rigid. Our descriptive findings may generate further hypotheses and aid clinical judgments regarding long‐term MI‐E treatment and concomitant ventilator support.

To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the prevalence of long‐term MI‐E users by diagnosis and age in a nationwide paediatric population. Comparison of results with other national populations are thus difficult. However, long‐term MI‐E use was most frequent in SMA and muscular dystrophies/myotonies, diagnoses often reported in other MI‐E studies. 10, 11 The present study did not only target NMDs, but a comprehensive neuropaediatric population. It may, thus, add insight to an expanded group of diagnoses where long‐term MI‐E is used in children, namely conditions originating in the CNS. Both in degenerative disorders in the CNS and CP, MI‐E was prevalent in 3% and 1% of children respectively. In fact, one‐third of all devices belonged to children with CNS conditions, suggesting that MI‐E had been judged beneficial for airway clearance in these children. This is supported by Siriwat et al. who found MI‐E beneficial in reducing therapy time in hospitalized children with CP presenting with respiratory infections and atelectasis. 12 This finding is relevant, since respiratory complications are the most common cause of emergency admissions in children with CP, and severe CP is associated with lower pulmonary capacity, severe respiratory muscle weakness, and more hospitalizations compared to mild CP. 15, 17

Analysis

Data will be collected based on demographic information such as age, sex, ethnicity and neuromuscular condition. Given the sample size of 20, non-parametric descriptive statistic will be used to report the demographics. Continuous data will be reported using median and IQR, and categorical data will be reported using percentages. Data will be collected prospectively and reviewed in a descriptive context, providing trends and potential rationales describing the waveforms in comparison to the videos. Published examples will be used to guide interpretation while taking into consideration the fact that published examples have not simultaneously observed waveforms and the larynx. Specifically, waveforms will be scrutinised for:

Laryngeal response during insufflation, as indicated by inspiratory flow limitation. spikes in flow at the beginning of insufflation with subsequent flattening of the flow curve until the end of insufflation. spikes ('bunny ears') during insufflation on the pressure curve. oscillations on the flow-time curve during insufflation.
Laryngeal response during exsufflation as indicated by expiratory flow limitation as indicated by flattening of the exsufflation curve. oscillations on the flow-time curve during insufflation.
Evidence of good mask fit as indicated by a return to baseline flow prior to exsufflation.
Gas decompression spikes as indicated by a sharp spike at the start of exsufflation.
The visualisation of the larynx will enable differentiation between a laryngeal response and the gas decompression spike.
Examine the nasal endoscopy videos for laryngealresponse with no changes in the waveforms.
Examine the waveforms and the laryngeal response videos for new waveform patterns not yet identified by other authors.

Relation between functional dependence and ICU-acquired weakness — The link between ICUAW/muscle strength and physical function and patient-reported quality of life has been reported, but a better understanding of functional independence is needed to target physical recovery. Functional independence is more readily monitored and likely to remain a pragmatic target, and combined interventions addressing physical and cognitive performance may be needed to separate their contributions; such understanding would have policy implications and help clinicians and patients prioritize future recommended interventions.

### Mechanical in-exsufflation-expiratory flows as indication for tracheostomy tube decannulation: case studies [^114JqKH1]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Mechanical insufflation exsufflation-expiratory flows (MIE-EFs) correlate with upper airway patency. Patients dependent on continuous noninvasive ventilatory support with severe spinal muscular atrophy type 1, now over 20 yrs old, have used MIE sufficiently effectively along with continuous noninvasive ventilatory support to avoid tracheotomy indefinitely. Although MIE-EFs can apparently decrease in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to necessitate tracheotomy, they can increase over time and remain effective in all spinal muscular atrophy types. Two cases demonstrate an association between increasing MIE-EF and, ultimately, successful decannulation of a patient with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 who was continuous tracheostomy mechanical ventilation dependent and a patient with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Only when MIE-EF increased to exceed 200 l/min did the decannulations succeed. Definitive noninvasive management (continuous noninvasive ventilatory support) of these patients may be possible only when MIE is effective, and the greater the MIE-EF, the greater its effectiveness. Thus, increasing MIE-EF can signal resolution of upper airway obstruction sufficiently to permit decannulation whether a patient is ventilator dependent or not.

Efficacy of the "Start to Move" Protocol on Functionality, Delirium and Acquired Weakness in ICU ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Background: ICU hospitalization is associated with loss of strength, functionality and delirium. The "Start to Move protocol" demonstrated efficacy in improving and minimizing such effects. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of the "Start to move protocol" compared with conventional treatment in ICU subjects on functionality, weakness acquired in the Intensive Care Unit, incidence of delirium, days of invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and 28-day mortality. Methods: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Including adults ≥ 15 years with IMV > 48 hours, randomized into Start to move and conventional treatment groups. Functionality, ICU-AW incidence, delirium incidence, IMV days, ICU stay and mortality-28 days were analyzed.

Introduction: Individuals hospitalized in Intensive Care Units are subjected to a prolonged state of rest and to various factors that directly or indirectly affect the muscular and organic structure, which can result in ICU-acquired weakness and a limitation in functional performance. These factors can be divided into metabolic, pharmacological and organic, where sustained hyperglycemia, corticosteroid use, sedation-analgesia, neuromuscular blockade and multiorgan failure associated with sepsis or septic shock stand out. This state translates into a direct loss of muscle mass, specifically of type II fibers, physiologically explained by an increase in the myosin protein degradation process, a decrease in protein synthesis and an increase in proinflammatory cells that favor the weakness of the critically ill patient. In subjects subjected to invasive mechanical ventilation, it has been shown that the cross-sectional area of the quadriceps muscle can decrease up to 12.

5% in the first week of their stay in the ICU, which can increase up to
15. 7% if they present multiorgan failure versus a 3% loss in subjects with single organ failure. Brummel et al. report that delirium is common in the ICU, affecting between 60–80% of subjects undergoing IMV and between 20–50% of subjects on noninvasive mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of removal of invasive elements, accidental extubations and the need for physical restraints that may delay the onset of functional recovery.
- Total dependence prior to hospitalization, according to Barthel index;
- Subject without consenting to participate in the study.

patients had a sensorimotor axonopathy, and all patients who underwent a muscle biopsy had specific muscle involvement not related to nerve involvement. The median duration of ICUAP after day 1 was 21 days. Mean duration of mechanical ventilation after day 1 was significantly longer in patients with ICUAP compared. considered to have ICUAP, whereas those with an MRC score of 48 or higher, which indicates muscle strength of 5 or 4 in each limb segment, were considered controls. To confirm the peripheral neuromuscular origin of the clinical weakness, all ICUAP patients underwent an electrophysiologic evaluation within 72 hours. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study of a multicenter, general ICU cohort of patients who had undergone mechanical ventilation and in whom a neuromuscular disorder was identified using a bedside clinical approach. Clinical evaluation of motor weakness in ICU patients is challenging.

Two previous prospective cohort studies that included clinical diagnostic criteria. are often difficult to perform in most ICUs and may be considered too invasive. The systematic clinical detection of paresis in our study showed that a quarter of ICU patients who had undergone mechanical ventilation for 7 or more days and achieved satisfactory recovery of consciousness had severe motor weakness. This syndrome was characterized by a symmetrical alteration in muscle. shown to have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. 25–29 The duration of mechanical ventilation before awakening was also significantly associated with the occurrence of ICUAP and likely reflects the negative effect of immobilization on neuromuscular function, given that increased expression of corticosteroid muscle receptors has been associated with complete immobilization. 30 Our finding raises the question of whether preservation.

establishment of the diagnosis of ICUAP, which might be the most relevant assessment of the impact of ICUAP on the additional mechanical ventilation requirement, was also significantly longer in ICUAP patients than in controls. However, the exact contribution of neuromuscular disorders to delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation and prolonged ICU stay remains to be established. through concomitant evaluations of peripheral and respiratory neuromuscular function and electrophysiology and inclusion of ICUAP in future analysis of variables influencing the duration of mechanical ventilation. Although we studied ICU patients who recovered satisfactory awakening.

### EStimCycle: early rehabilitation in critical care (eStimCycle) [^112QB7bm]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Project Summary: Patients who have a length of stay four or more days in ICU and requiring mechanical ventilation assistance to breathe for more than 48 hours will be invited to participate. Participants will be randomised to either receive Functional Electrical Stimulation assisted cycling or standard care. As cycling in bed has previously been shown to improve physical function, patients who receive cycling as a treatment will have one leg that cycles and the other leg that cycles with assistance of electrical stimulation as we want to establish the effectiveness of the addition of electrical stimulation of muscle. Muscle bulk, strength and physical function outcome measures will be measured at baseline, weekly in ICU, ICU discharge and hospital discharge. Cognitive function will also be measured at hospital discharge, 6- and 12-month follow-up.

A small group of patients in this study will be invited to provide samples of blood, urine and muscle at ICU admission and discharge to try and determine what happens to muscle in patients who are critically ill. Significance of the Project: This is an important study because the development of ICU-acquired weakness can result in long term limitations in physical function. Early treatment to maintain strong muscles during an intensive care stay may help speed up recovery and enhance participation in other rehabilitation treatments and improve functional activities and cognition. These are important objectives for both patients and their families. In addition understanding why the muscles become so weak so quickly in patients in ICU will help to develop treatments that may help to maintain muscle strength. Study Hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: eStimCycle versus usual care rehabilitation will improve muscle strength at hospital discharge.

Hypothesis 2: eStimCycle versus usual care rehabilitation will improve cognitive function at 6 month follow up. Hypothesis 3: Patients receiving eStimCycle will have improved activity of anabolic signalling pathways and less atrophy of skeletal muscle fibre size compared with usual care rehabilitation.
