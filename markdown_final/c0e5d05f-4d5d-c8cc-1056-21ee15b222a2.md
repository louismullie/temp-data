## Question

is albuterol safe to use during pregnancy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether albuterol is safe to use during pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory baseline and what the FDA labeling says. Then, I should verify the human data on major birth defects and miscarriage. Next, I will examine the animal toxicity data and consider relevance to human exposure. After that, I need to review guideline positions and weigh maternal-fetal risks of uncontrolled asthma versus medication risks. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, trimester-specific recommendation and counseling points, including any caveats about route of administration and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. Multiple FDA labels consistently state there are no adequate randomized clinical studies of albuterol in pregnancy, so definitive human safety data are limited, and labels advise use only if benefits outweigh potential risks, which is the classic risk–benefit framework for pregnancy pharmacotherapy [^947a31ec] [^31c81662] [^d1896322] [^45e70e20].

> Wait, let me verify the human safety signals before drawing conclusions. The FDA risk summaries indicate that available epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports do not consistently demonstrate an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage with inhaled albuterol, which is reassuring but not definitive given observational design limits and potential confounding by disease severity [^61db16dd] [^0f0571dd] [^d1896322] [^45e70e20].

> I need to check the animal data carefully. In mice, subcutaneous albuterol produced cleft palate at exposures approximating or below the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose, and in rabbits, oral albuterol caused cranioschisis at high multiples of human exposure; importantly, inhalation studies in rats did not show teratogenicity at substantial exposure multiples, suggesting route and systemic exposure matter for risk interpretation [^31c81662] [^67cc0a79] [^a5ab9c25].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from animals to humans. I should confirm how guidelines translate this. Contemporary guidelines emphasize that the risks of poorly controlled asthma in pregnancy — including preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight, and small-for-gestational-age infants — are well documented and generally outweigh theoretical medication risks, and they recommend maintaining asthma control with usual therapies, including short-acting beta-agonists like albuterol, rather than withholding treatment [^0db180f2] [^831ef179] [^3b417e2d] [^f641f6d3].

> Let me consider route of administration, because this affects systemic exposure. Inhaled albuterol has minimal systemic absorption compared with oral or subcutaneous routes, which reduces fetal exposure and likely mitigates the teratogenic signals seen in animals at high systemic exposures; this pharmacokinetic difference supports the safety of inhaled albuterol in standard doses during pregnancy when clinically indicated [^a5ab9c25] [^31c81662].

> I should double-check specific counseling points. Labels advise restricting use during labor to situations where benefits clearly outweigh risks due to potential beta-agonist effects on uterine contractility, and they note that albuterol is not approved for tocolysis; additionally, patients should be counseled on proper inhaler technique, avoidance of overuse, and enrollment in pregnancy exposure registries to strengthen postmarketing safety data [^61db16dd] [^0f0571dd] [^fbd4606c].

> Next, I should review the practical, trimester-specific approach. In the first trimester, when teratogenic concerns are highest, the balance still favors treating symptomatic asthma with inhaled albuterol as needed because uncontrolled disease poses greater fetal risk; in the second and third trimesters, continue albuterol for rescue therapy and ensure maintenance control with inhaled corticosteroids, as recommended by GINA and BTS/SIGN/NICE guidance, with closer monitoring if control worsens [^0db180f2] [^831ef179] [^f641f6d3].

> But wait, what if the patient needs frequent albuterol use. I need to ensure we escalate controller therapy rather than relying on repeated rescue doses, because increased SABA use signals poor control and higher risks of adverse perinatal outcomes; guidelines explicitly advise prioritizing control and avoiding step-downs during pregnancy, reinforcing the need to treat the asthma, not just the symptoms [^0db180f2] [^831ef179] [^3b417e2d].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. Yes, inhaled albuterol is considered safe to use during pregnancy when clinically indicated, supported by reassuring human observational data, biologically plausible risk mitigation with inhalation route, and strong guideline consensus that the risks of uncontrolled asthma outweigh theoretical medication risks; use the lowest effective dose, avoid oral or subcutaneous routes unless absolutely necessary, and coordinate obstetric and respiratory care to maintain optimal control throughout gestation [^61db16dd] [^0f0571dd] [^0db180f2] [^831ef179] [^f641f6d3].

---

Inhaled albuterol is **safe and recommended** for pregnant patients when clinically indicated, with no consistent evidence of increased major birth defects or miscarriage [^61db16dd] [^0f0571dd]. The benefits of controlling asthma outweigh theoretical risks, and guidelines endorse its use across all trimesters [^0db180f2] [^831ef179]. Use the lowest effective dose and avoid oral or IV routes unless absolutely necessary, as systemic exposure increases fetal risk [^a5ab9c25] [^31c81662]. Monitor for maternal effects (tremor, tachycardia) and adjust therapy as needed [^fbd4606c].

## Safety profile of albuterol in pregnancy

### Human data

- **Epidemiological studies**: Multiple studies and postmarketing data show no consistent increase in major birth defects or miscarriage with inhaled albuterol [^61db16dd] [^0f0571dd].

- **Systematic reviews**: Reviews report no significant association between inhaled albuterol and adverse perinatal outcomes, including congenital malformations, preterm birth, or low birth weight [^notfound].

- **Neurodevelopmental outcomes**: No association between in utero exposure to beta-agonists (including albuterol) and impaired neurodevelopmental milestones in offspring [^4eccd635].

---

### Animal data

In mice, **teratogenic effects** (cleft palate) occurred at exposures ≥ 9 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID) [^61db16dd] [^31c81662]; in rabbits, delayed ossification was observed at doses below the MRHDID [^0f0571dd]. These findings inform risk but are not directly translatable to humans at therapeutic doses.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **GINA 2025**: Recommends short-acting beta-agonists (SABA), including albuterol, as first-line rescue therapy for acute asthma in pregnancy; treat exacerbations aggressively with SABA, oxygen, and early systemic corticosteroids [^c8b23cb1] [^0db180f2].

- **BTS/SIGN/NICE 2024**: Advises that SABA use is safe and should be continued as normal during pregnancy to maintain asthma control [^f641f6d3].

- **ACOG**: Emphasizes maintaining asthma control during pregnancy, with SABA as a key component of therapy [^c80cd53d].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Maternal effects**: Tremor, palpitations, tachycardia, and mild hypokalemia may occur but are generally well tolerated at therapeutic doses [^fbd4606c].

- **Fetal effects**: No consistent evidence of increased congenital anomalies, growth restriction, or preterm birth with inhaled albuterol [^61db16dd] [^0f0571dd].

- **Labor and delivery**: Beta-agonists can theoretically interfere with uterine contractility; restrict use during labor to cases where benefits clearly outweigh risks [^61db16dd] [^0f0571dd].

---

## Route of administration and dosing considerations

Prefer **inhaled albuterol** (MDI or nebulizer) to minimize systemic exposure and fetal risk; avoid oral or IV routes unless absolutely necessary. Use the **lowest effective dose** to control symptoms, typically 1–2 puffs every 4–6 hours as needed.

---

## Monitoring and precautions

Regularly assess **asthma control** and adjust therapy to maintain optimal control and minimize albuterol use [^831ef179]. Educate patients on proper inhaler technique and adherence to therapy [^f75a41fb]. Monitor for maternal adverse effects, especially with frequent use or higher doses [^fbd4606c].

---

## Comparison with alternative bronchodilators

Levalbuterol has **similar safety considerations** to albuterol, with no consistent evidence of increased fetal risk; it may be used if albuterol is not tolerated [^c99e212e]. Ipratropium is **generally considered safe** in pregnancy and may be combined with albuterol for severe exacerbations [^b0dc7aeb].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Major birth defects | No consistent increase with inhaled albuterol [^61db16dd] [^0f0571dd] |
| Miscarriage | No consistent increase with inhaled albuterol [^61db16dd] [^0f0571dd] |
| Preterm birth | No consistent increase with inhaled albuterol [^notfound] |
| Low birth weight | No consistent increase with inhaled albuterol [^notfound] |
| Maternal adverse effects | Tremor, palpitations, tachycardia, mild hypokalemia [^fbd4606c] |

---

Inhaled albuterol is **safe and recommended** for pregnant patients with asthma when clinically indicated, with no consistent evidence of increased major birth defects or miscarriage. The benefits of controlling asthma outweigh theoretical risks, and guidelines endorse its use across all trimesters. Use the lowest effective dose, prefer inhaled routes, and monitor maternal effects.

### Albuterol [^65dc572d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Albuterol tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

During worldwide marketing experience, various congenital anomalies, including cleft palate and limb defects, have been rarely reported in the offspring of patients being treated with albuterol tablets. Some of the mothers were taking multiple medications during their pregnancies. No consistent pattern of defects can be discerned and a relationship between albuterol tablets use and congenital anomalies has not been established.

Use in Labor and Delivery

Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of albuterol tablets for relief of bronchospasm during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk.

 Tocolysis

Albuterol tablets have not been approved for the management of preterm labor. The benefit: risk ratio when albuterol tablets are administered for tocolysis has not been established. Serious adverse reactions, including maternal pulmonary edema, have been reported during or following treatment of premature labor with beta2-agonists, including albuterol tablets.

 Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for albuterol tablets in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in children below 6 years of age have not been established.

Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C

Albuterol has been shown to be teratogenic in mice. A study in CD-1 mice at subcutaneous (sc) doses of 0.025, 0.25, and 2.5 mg/kg (approximately 3/1000, 3/100, and 3/10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m2basis), showed cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 (4.5%) fetuses at 0.25 mg/kg and in 10 of 108 (9.3%) fetuses at 2.5 mg/kg. The drug did not induce cleft palate formation at the lowest dose, 0.025 mg/kg. Cleft palate also occurred in 22 of 72 (30.5%) fetuses from females treated with 2.5 mg/kg of isoproterenol (positive control) subcutaneously (approximately 3/10 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m2basis).

A reproduction study in Stride Dutch rabbits revealed cranioschisis in 7 of 19 (37%) fetuses when albuterol was administered orally at a 50 mg/kg dose (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m2basis).

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Albuterol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

### Ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate [^cae5a063]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Ipratropium bromide

Pregnancy Category B

Reproduction studies in CD-1 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats and New Zealand rabbits demonstrated no evidence of teratogenicity at oral doses up to 10, 100, and 125 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 15, 270, and 680 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m2basis). Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated no evidence of teratogenicity at inhalation doses up to 1.5 and 1.8 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 4 and 10 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m2basis). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of the use of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, albuterol sulfate, or ipratropium bromide in pregnant women. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Labor and Delivery

Oral albuterol sulfate has been shown to delay preterm labor in some reports. Because of the potential of albuterol to interfere with uterine contractility, use of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether the components of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution are excreted in human milk. Although lipid-insoluble quaternary bases pass into breast milk, it is unlikely that ipratropium bromide would reach the infant to an important extent, especially when taken as a nebulized solution. Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for albuterol sulfate in some animals, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution in patients below 18 years of age have not been established.

Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, 62 percent were 65 and over, while 19 percent were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

### Albuterol sulfate (albuterol sulate) [^b6c4e6dc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk: In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of several perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women with asthma should be closely monitored and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal asthma control.

Labor or Delivery: Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of Albuterol Sulfate HFA during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk. Albuterol sulfate HFA has not been approved for the management of pre-term labor. Serious adverse reactions, including pulmonary edema, have been reported during or following treatment of premature labor with beta2-agonists, including albuterol.

Data

Human Data: While available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk, published data from epidemiological studies and case reports have not consistently demonstrated an association with use of albuterol sulfate HFA during pregnancy and major birth defects, specific birth defects, or miscarriage. The available studies have methodologic limitations, including inconsistent comparator groups, definitions of outcomes, and assessment of disease impact.

Animal Data: In a study in pregnant mice, subcutaneously administered albuterol sulfate produced cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 (4.5%) fetuses at an exposure less than the MRHDID for adults (on a mg/m2basis at a maternal dose of 0.25 mg/kg) and in 10 of 108 (9.3%) fetuses at approximately 9 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m2basis at a maternal dose of 2.5 mg/kg). Cleft palate also occurred in 22 of 72 (30.5%) fetuses from females treated subcutaneously with isoproterenol, another beta2-agonist.

Over the past few years, much has been learned that is relevant to the management of asthma in pregnancy. Although the studies that were reviewed here in provide more insight into the mechanisms that are involved and the treatment of asthma during pregnancy, there are more questions to be answered. It is hoped that the updated guidelines, which address the safety of contemporary asthma medications during pregnancy, will be a helpful resource in the treatment of our pregnant asthmatic patients.

Ipratropium is negligibly absorbed systemically following oral inhalation; therefore, maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Published literature, including cohort studies, case control studies and case series, over several decades have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with ipratropium bromide. Available data from published epidemiological studies and postmarketing case reports of pregnancy outcomes following inhaled albuterol use do not consistently demonstrate a risk of major birth defects or, miscarriage. There are clinical considerations with the use of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT in pregnant women [see Clinical Considerations]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, however, animal studies are available with its individual components, ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate.

Based on oral reproduction studies, no evidence of structural alterations was observed when ipratropium bromide was administered to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 340, 68,000 and 17,000 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID) in adults on a mg/m2basis.

When albuterol was administered to pregnant mice during organogenesis there was evidence of cleft palate at doses approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID) [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Consideration

Labor or Delivery

Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT for the treatment of COPD during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk. Serious adverse reactions, including pulmonary edema, have been reported during or following treatment of premature labor with beta2-agonists, including albuterol.

17.3 Dose Indicator

Patients should be informed that albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol has a dose indicator attached to the actuator. When the patient receives the inhaler, new inhaler first shows "200" in the dose indicator window. The dose indicator will show the approximate number of actuations (sprays) of medicine remaining in the inhaler. As you use the inhaler, the dose indicator will typically rotate during every 5 to 7 actuations (sprays) towards the next decreasing number. The dose-indicator window displays the number of sprays left in the inhaler in units of twenty (e.g., 200, 180, 160, etc). When the dose indicator displays "40", where the background changes from white to red to remind the patient to contact their pharmacist for a refill of medication or consult their physician for a prescription refill. The background color will be all red when the indicator approaches 20. The indicator will stop moving at "0". Discard the inhaler once the dose indicator displays "0". Patients should be informed to discard albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol inhaler when the dose indicator displays 0 or after the expiration date on the product, whichever comes first.

17.4 Paradoxical Bronchospasm

Inform patients that albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol can produce paradoxical bronchospasm. Instruct patients to discontinue albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs.

17.5 Concomitant Drug Use

While patients are taking albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, other inhaled drugs and asthma medications should be taken only as directed by a physician.

17.6 Common Adverse Events

Common adverse effects of treatment with inhaled albuterol include palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, tremor, or nervousness.

17.7 Pregnancy

Patients who are pregnant or nursing should contact their physician about the use of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol.

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to asthma medications during pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

Frequency of Use

Inform patients that the action of Albuterol Sulfate HFA should last up to 4 to 6 hours. Do not use Albuterol Sulfate HFA more frequently than recommended. Instruct patients not to increase the dose or frequency of doses of Albuterol Sulfate HFA without consulting the physician. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately if treatment with Albuterol Sulfate HFA becomes less effective for symptomatic relief, symptoms become worse, and/or they need to use the product more frequently than usual.

Priming

Instruct patients to prime Albuterol Sulfate HFA before using for the first time, when the inhaler has not been used for more than 2 weeks, or when the inhaler has been dropped. To prime Albuterol Sulfate HFA, release 4 sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well before each spray. Avoid spraying in eyes.

Cleaning

To ensure proper dosing and to prevent actuator orifice blockage, instruct patients to wash the actuator with warm water and let it air-dry completely at least once a week. Inform patients that detailed cleaning instructions are included in the Patient Information leaflet.

Paradoxical Bronchospasm

Inform patients that Albuterol Sulfate HFA can produce paradoxical bronchospasm. Instruct them to discontinue Albuterol Sulfate HFA if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Concomitant Drug Use

Advise patients that while they are using Albuterol Sulfate HFA, other inhaled drugs and asthma medications should be taken only as directed by the physician.

Common Adverse Effects

Common adverse effects of treatment with inhaled albuterol include palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, tremor, and nervousness.

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

Inform women there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to asthma medications, including Albuterol Sulfate HFA, during pregnancy and that they can enroll in the Pregnancy Exposure Registry by calling 1-877-311-8972 or by visiting https://mothertobaby.org/ongoing-study/asthma [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Discontinuation

Patients could discontinue study treatment or be withdrawn from the study at any time for any reason at their request, on request of the investigator or by the Sponsor. Possible reasons for treatment discontinuation included the onset of AEs, pregnancy and development of ≥ 3 severe exacerbations within a 3-month period or ≥ 5 total severe exacerbation events, or a single severe exacerbation event longer than 20 days. Discontinuation of study treatment was considered if the investigator decided that it was in the best interest of the patient. Moreover, the investigator could discontinue the patient from the study if they were non-compliant with the Clinical Study Protocol (eg, post-randomisation eligibility violation) or were lost to follow-up and no alternative contact information was available (this implied that at least two documented attempts have been made to contact the patient).

Statistical analysis

A sample size of 1000 adult and adolescent patients per treatment group and observation of the first 570 severe exacerbation events provided this study with 87% power to observe a 25% reduction in the risk of severe exacerbation in patients who received at least one dose of albuterol/budesonide versus albuterol, assuming the Hochberg procedurefor multiple testing and a two-sided significance level of 5%.

The primary analysis was for the time-to-first severe asthma exacerbation under the efficacy estimand. A Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted for randomisation stratification factors (age group, region) and the number of severe exacerbations in the 12 months before screening (1, > 1) was applied. The primary treatment comparisons (albuterol/budesonide 180/160 µg vs albuterol 180 µg; albuterol/budesonide 180/80 µg vs albuterol 180 µg) were two-sided, with the 5% overall alpha level controlled using the Hochberg procedure.

Labor and Delivery

Oral albuterol has been shown to delay pre-term labor in some reports. There are presently no well-controlled studies that demonstrate that it will stop pre-term labor or prevent labor at term. Because of the potential for beta agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution for relief of bronchospasm during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk.

Albuterol has not been approved for the management of pre-term labor. The benefit:risk ratio when albuterol is administered for tocolysis has not been established. Serious adverse reactions, including pulmonary edema, have been reported following administration of albuterol to women in labor.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for albuterol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution 1.25 mg and 0.63 mg have been established in pediatric patients between the ages of 2 and 12 years. The use of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution in children age 6 to 12 years and published reports of albuterol sulfate trials in pediatric patients 3 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution in children below 2 years of age have not been established.

8.1 Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C:

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of PROAIR HFA Inhalation Aerosol or albuterol sulfate in pregnant women. During worldwide marketing experience, various congenital anomalies, including cleft palate and limb defects, have been reported in the offspring of patients treated with albuterol. Some of the mothers were taking multiple medications during their pregnancies. No consistent pattern of defects can be discerned, and a relationship between albuterol use and congenital anomalies has not been established. Animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits revealed evidence of teratogenicity. PROAIR HFA Inhalation Aerosol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

In a mouse reproduction study, subcutaneously administered albuterol sulfate produced cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 (4.5%) fetuses at an exposure approximately eight-tenths of the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for adults on a mg/m2basis and in 10 of 108 (9.3%) fetuses at approximately 8 times the MRHD. Similar effects were not observed at approximately one-thirteenth of the MRHD. Cleft palate also occurred in 22 of 72 (30.5%) fetuses from females treated subcutaneously with isoproterenol (positive control).

In a rabbit reproduction study, orally administered albuterol sulfate induced cranioschisis in 7 of 19 fetuses (37%) at approximately 630 times the MRHD.

In a rat reproduction study, an albuterol sulfate/HFA-134a formulation administered by inhalation did not produce any teratogenic effects at exposures approximately 65 times the MRHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

8.2 Labor and Delivery

Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of PROAIR HFA Inhalation Aerosol for relief of bronchospasm during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk.

### Levalbuterol inhalation 0.31mg / 3ml (levalbuterol inhalation) [^52318376]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

During worldwide marketing experience, various congenital anomalies, including cleft palate and limb defects, have been reported in newborns of women treated with racemic albuterol which contains the levalbuterol isomer (active drug substance of Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution). However, since multiple medications were taken during some of the pregnancies and there was no consistent pattern of anomalies, it was not possible to establish a relationship between racemic albuterol use and the occurrence of these congenital anomalies.

In animal studies, oral administration of levalbuterol HCl to pregnant New Zealand White rabbits found no evidence of teratogenicity at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 108 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation [MRDI] dose of levalbuterol HCl for adults on a mg/m2basis).

However, other studies demonstrated that racemic albuterol sulfate was teratogenic in mice and rabbits at doses comparable to the human therapeutic range. Pregnant mice administered racemic albuterol sulfate subcutaneously had a dose-related increased incidence of cleft palate in their fetuses (4.5% of fetuses at 0.25 mg/kg/day or greater, corresponding to approximately 0.3 times the MRDI dose, 9.3% of fetuses at 2.5 mg/kg/day, approximately 3 times the MRDI dose of levalbuterol HCl for adults on a mg/m2basis). The drug did not induce cleft palate formation when administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.025 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.03 times the MRDI dose of levalbuterol HCl for adults on a mg/m2basis). In addition, oral administration of racemic albuterol sulfate to pregnant rabbits resulted in an increased incidence of cranioschisis in fetuses (approximately 215 times the MRDI dose of levalbuterol HCl for adults on a mg/m2basis).

Non-Teratogenic Effects: A study in which pregnant rats were dosed with radiolabeled racemic albuterol sulfate demonstrated that drug-related material is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus.

### Asthma in pregnancy [^c02b71a8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma affects up to 10% of pregnancies and confers risk to both mother and child. Adverse maternal outcomes associated with asthma include preeclampsia, preterm labor, and increased risk of cesarean delivery. Maternal asthma also increases risks of low birth weight and small-for-gestational-age birth weight, as well as pediatric respiratory disease, including neonatal respiratory distress and early-onset asthma. Despite these risks, evidence suggests that both chronic asthma and acute asthma exacerbations remain undertreated in pregnancy. Recent landmark clinical trials in nonpregnant individuals have shown that, even for patients with mild disease, using as-needed inhaled corticosteroids combined with long-acting bronchodilators as rescue therapy dramatically reduces exacerbations. Inhaled corticosteroids are considered safe in pregnancy and are effective in reducing symptoms, preventing exacerbations, and mitigating some adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, inhaled corticosteroids should be included as a mainstay in the treatment regimens of all pregnant women with asthma, preferably with an inhaled corticosteroid and rapid-onset bronchodilator combination inhaler for as-needed use and for daily maintenance use in those with more persistent asthma symptoms or risk factors for complications. Clinicians should actively discourage discontinuation or de-escalation of asthma therapies during pregnancy and educate women on the safety and importance of these medications for both themselves and their offspring. Asthma exacerbations during pregnancy confer additional risk, so they must be promptly recognized and treated with systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators. This Clinical Expert Series article provides an overview of asthma in pregnancy, with a focus on its potential adverse health effects and the core principles of asthma evaluation and treatment in pregnancy.

### Systematic review of the safety of regular preventive asthma medications during pregnancy [^8af26168]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the safety of regular preventive asthma medications during pregnancy.

Data Sources

The following databases were searched from inception to February 2011: Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and CINAHL Plus.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The search was limited to human studies published in the English language. Titles of all articles were screened for relevance. Abstracts of relevant articles were scrutinized to confirm relevance before obtaining full text.

Data Synthesis

Selected articles were read by 2 authors and the accuracy of the data extracted was confirmed.

Results

Thirty-three articles were included in the final review. Small sample size, missing data, inadequate control for confounding factors, and poor documentation of dosage range were common limitations of the studies reviewed. The use of inhaled corticosteroids, cromolyns, and long-acting β(2) agonists during pregnancy was not associated with any particular adverse event, although the fluticasone/salmeterol combination has been associated with poor outcomes in postmarketing studies. Congenital malformations have been reported with leukotriene receptor antagonist exposure during pregnancy, but those women also had exposure to other medications, including oral corticosteroids.

Conclusions

Some negative outcomes of preventive asthma medications have been reported, although their direct link with medication use is inconclusive. Selection of preventive medications for asthma management during pregnancy should be based on an assessment of the risks and benefits of medication use versus the risks of poorly controlled asthma.

### Asthma controller therapy during pregnancy [^5ec65b8b]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to educate physicians on the safety of asthma controller use during pregnancy.

Study Design

A comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, and selected bibliographies identified human gestational studies of asthma controller medications from which maternal and fetal outcomes were obtained. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy category ratings were identified from product package inserts.

Results

Human gestational studies were identified for the inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) beclomethasone, budesonide, and triamcinolone and for cromolyn sodium, theophylline, and salmeterol. Human pregnancy data support an FDA Pregnancy Category B rating for budesonide. Pregnancy Category B ratings for cromolyn, nedocromil, montelukast, and zafirlukast are based primarily on safety in animal reproduction studies. ICSs other than budesonide, theophylline, zileuton, and long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists are Pregnancy Category C.

Conclusion

Human pregnancy data for many asthma controllers are lacking; nonetheless, data support a range of choices among medications rated Pregnancy Category B.

Albuterol sulfate has been shown to be teratogenic in mice. A study in CD-1 mice given albuterol sulfate subcutaneously showed cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 (4.5%) fetuses at 0.25 mg/kg (less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m2basis) and in 10 of 108 (9.3%) fetuses at 2.5 mg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m2basis). The drug did not induce cleft palate formation when administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.025 mg/kg (less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m2basis). Cleft palate formation also occurred in 22 of 72 (30.5%) fetuses from females treated subcutaneously with 2.5 mg/kg isoproterenol (positive control).

A reproduction study in Stride rabbits revealed cranioschisis in 7 of 19 (37%) fetuses when albuterol was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg (approximately 55 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m2basis).

A study in which pregnant rats were dosed with radiolabeled albuterol sulfate demonstrated that drug-related material is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus.

During worldwide marketing experience, various congenital anomalies, including cleft palate and limb defects, have been reported in the offspring of patients being treated with albuterol. Some of the mothers were taking multiple medications during their pregnancies. Because no consistent pattern of defects can be discerned, a relationship between albuterol use and congenital anomalies has not been established.

### Inhaled corticosteroids during pregnancy: a review of methodologic issues [^8aab00c8]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence in the literature that inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are safe for pregnant women with asthma and their infants. Although this is useful information about ICS use during pregnancy, some articles must be viewed cautiously because of lack of power and adjustment for potentially important confounding variables.

Objective

To summarize evidence on the potential effects of ICSs to treat asthma in pregnant mothers and their children with particular focus on study power.

Methods

Studies published before September 1, 2007, and focusing mainly on ICS use for asthma treatment during pregnancy were researched in Pubmed and the Cochrane Library. Post hoc power calculations were completed using data reported in the published articles.

Results

Twenty-three studies that evaluated the associations between ICS use during pregnancy and maternal and/or perinatal outcomes were retained. Only six studies on the association between ICS use and maternal outcomes reported significant results; five studies found significant associations between ICS use and perinatal outcomes. Regarding non-significant results, two studies on maternal outcomes and seven studies on perinatal outcomes had a power higher than 80% to detect a relative risk of 1.5 or a mean birth weight difference of 500 g.

Conclusion

While there currently is some degree of evidence to support the safety of ICS use during pregnancy, this review highlights the limited statistical power of several studies published in this area.

### The safety of asthma medications during pregnancy and lactation: clinical management and research priorities [^e146346b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common underlying diseases in women of reproductive age that can lead to potentially serious medical problems during pregnancy and lactation. A group of key stakeholders across multiple relevant disciplines was invited to take part in an effort to prioritize, strategize, and mobilize action steps to fill important gaps in knowledge regarding asthma medication safety in pregnancy and lactation. The stakeholders identified substantial gaps in the literature on the safety of asthma medications used during pregnancy and lactation and prioritized strategies to fill those gaps. Short-term action steps included linking data from existing complementary study designs (US and international claims data, single drug pregnancy registries, case-control studies, and coordinated systematic data systems). Long-term action steps included creating an asthma disease registry, incorporating the disease registry into electronic health record systems, and coordinating care across disciplines. The stakeholders also prioritized establishing new infrastructures/collaborations to perform research in pregnant and lactating women and to include patient perspectives throughout the process. To address the evidence gaps, and aid in populating product labels with data that inform clinical decision making, the consortium developed a plan to systematically obtain necessary data in the most efficient and timely manner.

### Addressing sex and gender to improve asthma management [^1087e0b5]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of asthma during pregnancy

Pregnancy affects asthma control in many women; approximately one-third of women report symptom worsening, one-third report symptom improvement, and one-third report no noticeable difference. Poor maternal asthma control is associated with adverse outcomes, including increased risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, congenital malformations, perinatal death, and risk of childhood asthma –. In addition, a small reduction in the mother's oxygen levels (e.g. during an asthma exacerbation) can result in severe, life-threatening fetal hypoxia. It is, therefore, vital that pregnant women (and women who are thinking of becoming pregnant) are educated on taking their asthma medications as prescribed and have a plan for managing exacerbations.

However, understandably, many women report being apprehensive about using asthma medication during pregnancy over concerns of teratogenicity, meaning that adherence to medications may decrease. While the safety of most asthma medications (e.g. ICS, SABAs, long-acting beta-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, OCS, and biologics) has not been unequivocally proven in pregnancy, they have now been used successfully for decades. Overall, evidence indicates asthma medications are safe in pregnancy, and their use is justified, as the benefits of good symptom control markedly outweigh the potential risks to mother and baby.

### Neurodevelopmental outcomes among offspring exposed to corticosteroid and B2-adrenergic agonists in utero [^4eccd635]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, we observed no association between the timing of in utero corticosteroid and β2-adrenergic agonist exposure and offspring neurodevelopment milestones during the first 3 years of life. Despite the study's limitations and its low power, these findings suggest that corticosteroids and β2-adrenergic agonists could be considered safe for use by pregnant individuals with asthma and safe for the neurodevelopment of their offspring. Additionally, the findings may inform choices regarding the management of maternal asthma during pregnancy.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^831ef179]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Pregnancy — management and medication safety — Although there is a general concern about any medication use in pregnancy, the advantages of actively treating asthma in pregnancy markedly outweigh any potential risks of usual asthma medications (Evidence A), and use of ICS, beta agonists, montelukast or theophylline is not associated with an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities. Women with asthma who are pregnant or planning pregnancy should be advised not to stop ICS-containing therapy; ICS reduce the risk of exacerbations of asthma during pregnancy (Evidence A), and cessation of ICS during pregnancy is a significant risk factor for exacerbations (Evidence A). One study reported that a treatment algorithm in non-smoking pregnant women based on monthly measurement of fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and symptoms using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) was associated with significantly fewer exacerbations and better fetal outcomes than an algorithm based only on ACQ; however, the ACQ-only algorithm allowed ICS to be stopped and 58% of women in the ACQ-only group were being treated without ICS by the end of pregnancy, and in a subsequent large randomized controlled trial in pregnant women, there was no reduction in exacerbations with FeNO-guided treatment compared with usual care. On balance, a low priority should be placed on stepping down treatment (regardless of the method used to assess control) until after delivery (Evidence D), and ICS should not be stopped in preparation for pregnancy or during pregnancy (Evidence C). Pregnant patients with asthma should be advised that poorly controlled asthma, and exacerbations, provide a much greater risk to their baby than do current asthma treatments, and during pregnancy, monitoring of asthma every 4–6 weeks is recommended; if it is feasible for this to be achieved by pharmacist-clinician collaboration, with monthly telephone monitoring of asthma symptom control. An intervention study with follow-up for 4–6 years reported the prevalence of asthma was over 50% lower in children of women with asthma who took ICS during pregnancy, with the largest reduction when ICS was being taken in early pregnancy (before weeks 12–20).

### Managing asthma during pregnancy and the postpartum period [^35c731c8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in pregnancy and is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Asthma symptoms worsen in approximately 40% of women, and exacerbations requiring medical intervention occur in at least 20% of women. Factors associated with exacerbation and worsening asthma include multiparity, obesity, Black race, exacerbations before pregnancy, and poor asthma control. Exacerbations are associated with further increased risks for poor perinatal outcomes, including low birth weight, preterm birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) status, as well as an increase in the development of asthma in early childhood. Common medications used for asthma, including short-acting β-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids, are considered safe to use in pregnancy. Whereas guidelines generally suggest traditional step therapy for managing asthma in pregnancy, there are alternative models of care and management approaches that may be effective in pregnancy, but require more research. These include single-inhaler maintenance and reliever therapy, treatment adjustment with FeNO, treatable traits personalized medicine approaches, and telemedicine. Little is known about changes to asthma in the postpartum period. However, low adherence to medication and the potential effects of postpartum depression on asthma exacerbation risk warrant further research.

### The efficacy and safety of asthma medications during pregnancy [^71f68c40]. Seminars in Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Asthma may be the most common potentialy serious medical problem to complicate pregnancy. Because severe uncontrolled asthma may cause both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, pharmacological asthma therapy is often necessary during pregnancy. Only 1 published randomized controlled clinical trial has evaluated the efficacy of an asthma medication (inhaled beclomethasone) during pregnancy. Human data bearing on the safety of medications during pregnancy are usually limited to observational studies, because experimental studies on the use of medications during human pregnancy would generally be unethical. Existing observational cohort data do not associate an increased risk of preeclampsia, total congenital malformations, preterm birth, or low birth weight infants with maternal exposures to inhaled beta agonists, theophylline, cromolyn, or inhaled corticosteroids. Maternal use of oral corticosteroids has been associated with reduced birth weight, an increased risk of preeclampsia, and an increased risk of oral clefts (first trimester use). Based on this information, benefit-risk considerations suggest that inhaled asthma medications and theophylline should be used when indicated for the treatment of asthma during pregnancy. Moreover, although some increased risks may be associated with the gestational use of oral corticosteroids, these risks are probably still less than the potential risks to the mother and the fetus of severe uncontrolled asthma. This articles describes recently published consensus recommendations regarding the pharmacological management of asthma during pregnancy.

### Update in the treatment of asthma during pregnancy [^4ea80239]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common potentially serious medical problem to complicate pregnancy. Recent reports suggest that 7 of every 100 pregnant women suffer from asthma during pregnancy. Asthmatic women have been shown to be at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy. This may be secondary to inadequately controlled asthma or perhaps the result of the effects of certain asthma medications taken during pregnancy. The choice to use a specific medication during pregnancy is based on available human and animal data. Much of the information currently available regarding the safety of various asthma medications during pregnancy comes from several large cohort studies. This article reviews the specific aspects of pharmacological therapy during pregnancy as provided in the recommendations of the joint ad hoc committee of the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. This article presents practical strategies for the management of asthma in our pregnant patients.

### An international consensus on the use of asthma biologics in pregnancy [^c42d88e7]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Uncontrolled asthma is associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Asthma biologics reduce exacerbation frequency, are steroid sparing, and improve quality of life in people with severe asthma. However, evidence for the use and safety of asthma biologics during pregnancy is scarce, largely because pregnant women were excluded from clinical trials. To help to support clinical teams, we conducted an international modified Delphi study. 141 panellists from 32 countries who were involved in the care of people with severe asthma completed two rounds of online surveys covering key areas surrounding the use of asthma biologics in pregnancy. The results from this international Delphi study emphasise risk versus benefit discussions and shared clinical decision making, with consensus among panellists that asthma biologics can be used during conception and throughout pregnancy, initiated during pregnancy in line with prescribing criteria for non-pregnant people, and initiated or continued during breastfeeding. Collating data through international registries remains essential to inform clinical guidelines.

Asthma — asthma is more likely to worsen in the second trimester, third trimester or postpartum than in the first trimester. Women with a history of asthma without current symptoms may undergo usual care. Women with current well-controlled asthma should be encouraged to use usual medications and to bring an inhaler with them for their abortion visit, and prophylactic use of an inhaler with nebulized albuterol or metaproterenol before the procedure may be prudent. The facility must be equipped to manage the rare acute asthma exacerbations, and concurrent respiratory infection or inadequately controlled asthma may require delaying the abortion until treatment achieves better control.

Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease in women of childbearing age and during pregnancy. This paper presents a summary of the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline on asthma and pregnancy. The aim of this guideline is to provide structured, where possible, evidence-based recommendations to optimize the management of asthma during pregnancy. The main topics covered in this guideline are preconception counseling, the safety of asthma medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding and risk assessment and monitoring of asthma during pregnancy. Because many caregivers are involved and a uniform approach is desirable, this guideline has been developed in collaboration with all relevant health care providers and patient representatives.

### Safety of asthma and allergy medications in pregnancy [^01b2253c]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Given the unique nature of pregnancy with respect to obtaining safety data regarding medication exposures, developing comprehensive information on the wide variety of medications that might be of clinical benefit during pregnancy is a challenging and on-going task. For many of the most commonly used asthma and allergy medications that were covered in this article, there is at least limited human data are available. Even for relatively well-studied medications, there are many unanswered questions, and few studies exist that are large enough to rule out at least a doubling of risk for specific outcomes, particularly congenital anomalies. This challenge becomes even more daunting when evaluating risks of individual products is considered the optimal goal, as opposed to "lumping" all medication exposures within a class. All of these issues call for more human pregnancy data that are collected more efficiently so that the answers that clinicians and pregnant women need are available more readily. In the meantime, health care providers and pregnant women must work with the information that is available to evaluate the risks and benefits of a particular medication and alternative choices for treatment of asthma or allergy during pregnancy, while considering the potential for adverse effects if the woman with severe or uncontrolled asthma is under-treated. To assist in making a risk/benefit assessment, the clinician can draw on existing resources that provide systematic periodic review of new data on medications in pregnancy as it becomes available, and synthesize the entire body of data on a particular drug into concise summary statements. Two such resources are TERIS (TeratogenInformation System) [38] and Reprotox [39]; both on-line services are managed by experts in the field of teratology. An additional resource for clinicians and pregnant women is the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists [40], a network of risk-assessment counselors in the United States and Canada who specialize in research and the communication of risks that are associated with exposures in pregnancy.

### Beta2-agonists use during pregnancy and perinatal outcomes: a systematic review [^3375c732]. Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Short and long-acting beta2-agonists (SABA and LABA) have a crucial role in asthma management during pregnancy, as stated in the current guidelines.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence on beta2-agonists use during pregnancy and adverse perinatal outcomes.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Six databases were searched before January 1, 2013 for beta2-agonists use during pregnancy and congenital malformations, small for gestational age, mean and low birth weight, gestational age and preterm delivery. Original English language articles were included with no cut-off date. Quality assessment and post-hoc power calculations were performed.

Results

Twenty-one original studies were identified. Four studies reported a significant increased risk of congenital malformations with SABA, while one study reported a significant decreased risk with high doses of SABA. One study reported a significant increased risk of congenital malformations with LABA and four studies reported a significant increased risk of congenital malformations with beta2-agonists (SABA and/or LABA). One study reported a decrease in birth weight centiles among LABA users.

Limitations

All studies reporting significant results, except two, used non-asthmatic women as reference group, making it difficult to differentiate between the effect of the disease from the one of the beta2-agonists. Non-significant results should be interpreted with caution due to the low statistical power of several studies.

Conclusion

Methodological limitations and lack of power of several studies prevent us to conclude on the perinatal safety of beta2-agonists. Until further evidence is available, physicians should continue prescribing them as recommended in the guidelines whenever needed to attain asthma control.

### Acute asthma during pregnancy [^b90e3da1]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

In addition to preventing maternal and fetal hypoxia, the goals of treating acute asthma exacerbation during pregnancy mirror those in the nongravid patient: rapid reversal of airflow obstruction with aerosolized bronchodilators, reduction of likelihood of recurrence by the addition of corticosteroids, and ongoing assessment of mother and fetus. Disposition decisions are multifaceted and must take into account the health and well-being of the pregnant patient and that of her fetus. Discharge planning includes prescription of scheduled 3–2 agonist treatments until symptoms resolve, intensification of daily treatment as needed, prescriptions for systemic and ICSs, as well provision of patient education, a personalized action plan, and close follow-up.

### Relative perinatal safety of salmeterol vs formoterol and fluticasone vs budesonide use during pregnancy [^01cdd204]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Recent asthma guidelines endorse the safety of long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) and of mild and moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) when required to control asthma during pregnancy, yet do not state a preferred medication within each class.

Objective

To estimate the relative perinatal safety with the use of salmeterol and formoterol (LABAs) and that of fluticasone and budesonide (ICSs) during pregnancy.

Methods

A subcohort of pregnancies from asthmatic women was selected from health care administrative databases of Quebec, Canada. Low birth weight (LBW) was defined as weight less than 2,500 g, preterm birth (PB) as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, and small for gestational age (SGA) as a birth weight below the 10th percentile. The effect of treatment with salmeterol vs formoterol and fluticasone vs budesonide on the outcomes was determined with generalized estimating equation models.

Results

The LABA and ICS subcohorts were composed of 547 (385 salmeterol and 162 formoterol users) and 3,798 (3,190 fluticasone and 608 budesonide users) pregnancies, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed for LBW (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44–1.88), PB (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.56–2.23), and SGA (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.67–2.02) newborns between women exposed to salmeterol vs formoterol or between women exposed to fluticasone vs budesonide (LBW: OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.76–1.52; PB: OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.78–1.49; and SGA, OR: 1.10; 95% CI, 0.85–1.44).

Conclusion

This study does not provide evidence of greater perinatal safety for one LABA or one ICS over the other.

### Salbutamol for transient tachypnea of the newborn [^fa717042]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Transient tachypnea of the newborn is characterized by tachypnea and signs of respiratory distress. Transient tachypnea typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm newborns. Although transient tachypnea of the newborn is usually a self-limited condition, it is associated with wheezing syndromes in late childhood. The rationale for the use of salbutamol (albuterol) for transient tachypnea of the newborn is based on studies showing that β-agonists can accelerate the rate of alveolar fluid clearance. This review was originally published in 2016 and updated in 2020.

Objectives

To assess whether salbutamol compared to placebo, no treatment or any other drugs administered to treat transient tachypnea of the newborn, is effective and safe for infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age with this diagnosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2020, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library; PubMed (1996 to April 2020), Embase (1980 to April 2020); and CINAHL (1982 to April 2020). We applied no language restrictions. We searched the abstracts of the major congresses in the field (Perinatal Society of Australia New Zealand and Pediatric Academic Societies) from 2000 to 2020 and clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials and cluster trials comparing salbutamol versus placebo or no treatment or any other drugs administered to infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or more and less than three days of age with transient tachypnea of the newborn.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology for data collection and analysis. The primary outcomes considered in this review were duration of oxygen therapy, need for continuous positive airway pressure and need for mechanical ventilation. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

Seven trials, which included 498 infants, met the inclusion criteria. All trials compared a nebulized dose of salbutamol with normal saline. Four studies used one single dose of salbutamol; in two studies, three to four doses were provided; in one study, additional doses were administered if needed. The certainty of the evidence was low for duration of hospital stay and very low for the other outcomes. Among the primary outcomes of this review, four trials (338 infants) reported the duration of oxygen therapy, (mean difference (MD) -19.24 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) -23.76 to -14.72); one trial (46 infants) reported the need for continuous positive airway pressure (risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.39; risk difference (RD) -0.15, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.16), and three trials (254 infants) reported the need for mechanical ventilation (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.86; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.03). Both duration of hospital stay (4 trials; 338 infants) and duration of respiratory support (2 trials, 228 infants) were shorter in the salbutamol group (MD -1.48, 95% CI -1.8 to -1.16; MD -9.24, 95% CI -14.24 to -4.23, respectively). One trial (80 infants) reported duration of mechanical ventilation and pneumothorax but data could not be extracted due to the reporting of these outcomes (type of units of effect measure and unclear number of events, respectively). Five trials are ongoing.

Authors' Conclusions

There was limited evidence to establish the benefits and harms of salbutamol in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. We are uncertain whether salbutamol administration reduces the duration of oxygen therapy, duration of tachypnea, need for continuous positive airway pressure and for mechanical ventilation. Salbutamol may slightly reduce hospital stay. Five trials are ongoing. Given the limited and low certainty of the evidence available, we could not determine whether salbutamol was safe or effective for the treatment of transient tachypnea of the newborn.

### Asthma and pregnancy: a narrative review [^a58e9725]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Topic Importance

Asthma, the most prevalent respiratory condition in pregnancy, affects up to 12% of pregnant women globally and is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes when poorly controlled. Modern asthma management emphasizes achieving clinical remission through personalized, trait-based approaches targeting modifiable risk factors. Insights into the mechanisms of airway inflammation have led to biomarker-directed therapy and the emergence of biologic agents for severe asthma. An evidence review was conducted to evaluate the applicability of these contemporary principles within the context of pregnancy.

Review Findings

Severe or poorly controlled asthma increases the risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and neonatal morbidity such as transient tachypnea of the newborn, intensive care admission, seizures, and hypoglycemia. Maternal adverse outcomes extend to unplanned hospital admissions, reduced quality of life, and psychological comorbidity. Physiological changes in pregnancy are not expected to worsen asthma severity, and any decline in FEV1/FVC should prompt further investigation. Factors that may predict deterioration in pregnancy include increased severity of asthma, suboptimal control, and non-adherence to maintenance therapy. The principles of asthma management include treatment adherence, managing comorbidities, and monitoring for adverse outcomes. Most standard treatments, including biologics if needed, are safe during pregnancy and lactation. Reassuring patients about medication safety is essential to promote adherence and improve maternal and fetal health.

Summary

This review updates healthcare providers on evidence-based strategies for optimizing asthma care in pregnant women, supporting proactive management, personalized treatment, and ongoing inclusion in research.

### Formoterol fumarate [^a72f5d82]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are limited available data with formoterol fumarate inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Beta-agonists may interfere with uterine contractility (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of formoterol fumarate to pregnant rats and rabbits caused increased fetal malformations (rats and rabbits), decreased fetal weight (rats), and increased neonatal mortality (rats) following administration of doses that produced exposures approximately 730 to 29,000 times the MRHD on a mg/m2or AUC basis. These adverse effects generally occurred at large multiples of the MRHD when formoterol fumarate was administered by the oral route to achieve high systemic exposures. No effects were observed in a study with rats that received formoterol fumarate by the inhalation route at an exposure approximately 300 times the MRHD (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Labor or delivery

There are no adequate and well-controlled human studies that have studied the effects of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution during labor and delivery. Because of the potential for beta-agonists interference with uterine contractility, use of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk.

### Maternal bronchodilator use and the risk of orofacial clefts-… [^17d861e7]. stacks.cdc.gov (2011). Low credibility.

Details Alternative Title: Hum Reprod Personal Author: Description: BACKGROUND Few epidemiological studies have explored the relationship between orofacial clefts and bronchodilators. We assessed whether mothers who used bronchodilators during early pregnancy were at an increased risk of delivering infants with orofacial clefts. METHODS We used National Birth Defects Prevention Study case–control data from mothers of 2711 infants with orofacial clefts and 6482 mothers of live born infants without birth defects, delivered during 1997 through 2005. Information on medication use from 3 months before pregnancy through delivery was collected using a standardized interview. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for maternal bronchodilator use during the periconceptional period while controlling for other covariates.

RESULTS We observed an association between maternal bronchodilator use during the periconceptional period and cleft lip only. The risk of cleft palate only was elevated but was not statistically significant. No association was observed for maternal bronchodilator use and the risk of cleft lip with cleft palate. The most commonly used bronchodilator was albuterol. Maternal albuterol use was associated with CLO and CPO. CONCLUSIONS We observed a statistically significant association between maternal bronchodilator use during the periconceptional period and the risk of CLO after controlling for other risk factors. It is unclear whether the increased odds ratios observed in this study are due to the bronchodilators, the severity of asthma, or both, or to chance alone.

Further studies to disentangle the role of asthma or asthma medications would help clarify these findings.

### Women's experiences of personalised support for asthma care during pregnancy: a systematic review of the literature [^52cbc0e6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We found an embryonic evidence base concerning the benefits of personalised support, with only five papers that meet our inclusion and exclusion criteria and quality assessment scoring. Whilst the standing of this evidence base is low in relation to accepted hierarchies of evidence, and the strength of our recommendations consequently weak, they support the authoritative guidance that pregnant asthmatic women should receive monitoring and advice which helps them to understand their asthma symptoms and the role that their medications play in controlling them, including inhaled B2 agonists, and oral and inhaled corticosteroids. Larger randomised controlled trials investigating personalised care are required to build an evidence base to establish the efficacy of such interventions.

### The management of asthma and rhinitis during pregnancy [^03818c1b]. Journal of Women's Health (2005). Low credibility.

Asthma and rhinitis frequently complicate pregnancy. The course of asthma may be adversely altered by gestation, placing the mother and fetus at risk. Therefore, pregnant patients with persistent asthma require an aggressive asthma management plan that includes environmental control measures and the use of long-term controller medications. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the preferred long-term controller medication for persistent asthma, based on efficacy. However, safety concerns regarding corticosteroids may cause physicians or patients to seek an alternate, less effective treatment during pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration's pregnancy category ratings are based on animal and human safety data. Because ICSs were previously rated pregnancy category C (i.e., with human studies lacking and animal studies either lacking or positive for fetal risk), other asthma controllers, such as cromolyn and nedocromil, that carry a pregnancy category B rating (i.e., showing no evidence of fetal risk in humans or animal studies negative for fetal risk) appeared to be more desirable for use during pregnancy. One ICS, budesonide, was reclassified as pregnancy category B based on human data supporting its use during pregnancy. In moderate and severe persistent asthma, add-on therapy may be considered, including long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and theophylline. Because rhinitis may adversely affect quality of life and the course of asthma, recommendations for aggressive management also apply.

### Asthma outcomes and management during Pregnancy [^fc8a7305]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma during pregnancy poses a common, increasingly prevalent threat to the health of women and their children. The present article reviews recent insights gained from the epidemiology of asthma during pregnancy, demonstrating the many short- and long-term risks to mother and fetus incurred by poorly controlled maternal asthma. We further discuss emerging evidence that active management of asthma during pregnancy can positively influence and perhaps completely mitigate these poor outcomes. Recent high-quality trials examining best methods for asthma treatment are reviewed and synthesized to offer an evidence-based pathway for comprehensive treatment of asthma in the outpatient setting. Safe and effective medications, as well as nonpharmacologic interventions, for asthma during pregnancy are discussed, and treatment options for related conditions of pregnancy, including depression, rhinitis, and gastroesophageal reflux, are presented. Throughout, we emphasize that an effective treatment strategy relies on a detailed patient evaluation, patient education, objective measurement of asthma control, and frequent and supportive follow-up. The cardiovascular and respiratory physiology of pregnancy is reviewed, as well as its implications for the management of patients with asthma, including patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. For the situation when outpatient asthma management has failed, an approach to the critically ill pregnant patient with status asthmaticus is detailed. Multidisciplinary teams that include pulmonary specialists, obstetricians, primary care providers, nurses, pharmacists, and asthma educators improve the care of pregnant women with asthma.

### Treating asthma and comorbid allergic rhinitis in pregnancy [^f34fa340]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Women with severe or uncontrolled asthma are at higher risk for pregnancy complications and adverse fetal outcomes than women with well-controlled asthma. Recent evidence-based guidelines have concluded that it is safer for pregnant women with asthma to be treated pharmacologically than to continue to have asthma symptoms and exacerbations. According to the Asthma and Pregnancy Working Group (APWG) of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, optimal treatment of asthma during pregnancy includes treatment of comorbid allergic rhinitis (AR), which can trigger or aggravate asthma symptoms. In general, treatment of both asthma and AR during pregnancy should follow the same stepwise approach that is used in the general population. This article presents the specific recommendations from the most recent APWG report and from other systematic reviews about which asthma and allergic rhinitis drugs should be preferred during pregnancy. Of the corticosteroids, budesonide has the most data and is listed as Pregnancy Category B (no evidence of risk in humans). Other inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids have less data and are listed as Pregnancy Category C but may be continued during pregnancy if the patient's asthma was well controlled with the medication before pregnancy. Family physicians should help their patients control allergic rhinitis and asthma during pregnancy, encouraging adherence to needed medications.

### Interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy [^d8075850]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most common respiratory disorder complicating pregnancy, and is associated with a range of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. There is strong evidence however, that the adequate control of asthma can improve health outcomes for mothers and their babies. Despite known risks of poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy, a large proportion of women have sub-optimal asthma control, due to concerns surrounding risks of pharmacological agents, and uncertainties regarding the effectiveness and safety of different management strategies.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic) for managing women's asthma in pregnancy on maternal and fetal/infant outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 June 2014) and the Cochrane Airways Group's Trials Register (4 June 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention used to manage asthma in pregnancy, with placebo, no intervention, or an alternative intervention. We included pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (including combined interventions). Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion (but none were identified). Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. We included multi-armed trials along with two-armed trials. We also included studies published as abstracts only.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We included eight trials in this review, involving 1181 women and their babies. Overall we judged two trials to be at low risk of bias, two to be of unclear risk of bias, and four to be at moderate risk of bias. Five trials assessed pharmacological agents, including inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone or budesonide), inhaled magnesium sulphate, intravenous theophylline, and inhaled beclomethasone verus oral theophylline. Three trials assessed non-pharmacological interventions, including a fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)-based algorithm versus a clinical guideline-based algorithm to adjust inhaled corticosteroid therapy, a pharmacist-led multi-disciplinary approach to management versus standard care, and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) versus sham training. The eight included trials were assessed under seven separate comparisons. Pharmacological interventionsPrimary outcomes: one trial suggested that inhaled magnesium sulphate in addition to usual treatment could reduce exacerbation frequency in acute asthma (mean difference (MD) -2.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.21 to -2.39; 60 women). One trial assessing the addition of intravenous theophylline to standard care in acute asthma did not report on exacerbations (65 women). No clear difference was shown in the risk of exacerbations with the use of inhaled beclomethasone in addition to usual treatment for maintenance therapy in one trial (risk ratio (RR) 0.36; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.05; 60 women); a second trial also showed no difference, however data were not clearly reported to allow inclusion in a meta-analysis. No difference was shown when inhaled beclomethasone was compared with oral theophylline for maintenance therapy (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.33; one trial, 385 women). None of these trials reported on neonatal intensive care admissions.

Secondary Outcomes

inhaled magnesium sulphate in acute asthma was shown to improve lung function measures (one trial, 60 women); intravenous theophylline in acute asthma was not associated with benefits (one trial, 65 women). No clear differences were seen with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to routine treatment in three trials (374 women). While inhaled beclomethasone, compared with oral theophylline, significantly reduced treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects in one trial (384 women), no other differences were observed, except for higher treatment adherence with theophylline. Four of the five trials did not report on adverse effects. Non-pharmacological interventionsPrimary outcomes: in one trial, the use of a FENO-based algorithm was shown to significantly reduce asthma exacerbations (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.90; 220 women); and a trend towards fewer neonatal hospitalisations was observed (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.02; 214 infants). No exacerbations occurred in one trial assessing pharmacist-led management; this approach did not reduce neonatal intensive care admissions (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.27 to 8.32; 58 infants). One trial (64 women) assessing PMR did not report on exacerbations or neonatal intensive care admissions.

Secondary Outcomes

the use of a FENO-based algorithm to adjust therapy led to some improvements in quality of life scores, as well as more frequent use of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists, and less frequent use of short-acting β-agonists (one trial, 220 women). The FENO-based algorithm was associated with fewer infants with recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis in their first year of life, and a trend towards fewer episodes of croup for infants. Pharmacist-led management improved asthma control scores at six months (one trial, 60 women); PMR improved lung function and quality of life measures (one trial, 64 women). No other differences between comparisons were observed.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on eight included trials, of moderate quality overall, no firm conclusions about optimal interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy can be made. Five trials assessing pharmacological interventions did not provide clear evidence of benefits or harms to support or refute current practice. While inhaled magnesium sulphate for acute asthma was shown to reduce exacerbations, this was in one small trial of unclear quality, and thus this finding should be interpreted with caution. Three trials assessing non-pharmacological interventions provided some support for the use of such strategies, however were not powered to detect differences in important maternal and infant outcomes. While a FENO-based algorithm reduced exacerbations, the effects on perinatal outcomes were less certain, and thus widespread implementation is not yet appropriate. Similarly, though positive effects on asthma control were shown with PMR and pharmacist-led management, the evidence to date is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In view of the limited evidence base, further randomised trials are required to determine the most effective and safe interventions for asthma in pregnancy. Future trials must be sufficiently powered, and well-designed, to allow differences in important outcomes for mothers and babies to be detected. The impact on health services requires evaluation. Any further trials assessing pharmacological interventions should assess novel agents or those used in current practice. Encouragingly, at least five trials have been identified as planned or underway.

### The effectiveness of non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for asthma management during pregnancy: a systematic review [^f75a41fb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is one of the most serious health problems affecting people of all ages throughout the world. In the United States of America the prevalence of self-reported asthma among pregnant women was between 8.4% and 8.8% during the period 1997 to 2001, and 4.1% of all pregnant women had experienced an asthma attack in the previous year. In Australia, asthma is the most common chronic disease affecting pregnant women, complicating one in eight pregnancies.

A prospective study conducted by Schatz et al. of 366 pregnancies in 330 women with asthma, showed that during pregnancy, asthma improved in slightly more than a quarter of patients (28%), worsened in slightly more than a third of patients (35%) and remained unchanged in a third of patients (33%). More than half of women with asthma do not take their asthma preventer medications on a regular basis before and during pregnancy, leading to asthma exacerbations. Good asthma control during pregnancy is important to reduce risks for both mother (e.g. pre-eclampsia, perinatal mortality, and need for cesarean delivery) and infant (e.g. low birth weight and prematurity). Therefore, pregnant women with asthma warrant additional support comprising education, ongoing monitoring and review of treatment.

### Budesonide inhalation [^7c63cbf2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no adequate well-controlled studies of budesonide inhalation suspension in pregnant women. However, there are published studies on the use of budesonide, the active ingredient in budesonide inhalation suspension, in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, budesonide, administered by the subcutaneous route, caused structural abnormalities, was embryocidal, and reduced fetal weights in rats and rabbits at less than the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID), but these effects were not seen in rats that received inhaled doses approximately 2 times the MRHDID (see Data). Studies of pregnant women have not shown that inhaled budesonide increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during pregnancy. Experience with oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to structural abnormalities from corticosteroid exposure than humans.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

 Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal risk

In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of several perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women with asthma should be closely monitored and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal asthma control.

### The effectiveness of non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for asthma management during pregnancy: a systematic review [^e2dbf120]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Practice and research implications

A clinical algorithm for asthma management based on objective measures and asthma symptoms could potentially reduce asthma exacerbations during pregnancy. The goals of asthma management in pregnant women are the same as in non-pregnant patients, which are to control asthma symptoms, maximize lung function, minimize medication side effects and prevent asthma exacerbations. These goals need to be considered when designing interventions, in addition to pharmacological treatment, to improve health outcomes in pregnant women with asthma. The cost-effectiveness of interventions and satisfaction of patients and health professionals also need to be assessed before implementation of such interventions in clinical practice. Further evidence is needed from well-designed prospective controlled studies in pregnant women with asthma investigating the effectiveness of interventions that incorporate patient education, patient self-management and periodic follow-up with health professionals.

### Patterns of pregnancy exposure to prescription FDA C, D and X drugs in a Canadian population [^7add6230]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine prescription Food and Drug Administration (FDA) C, D and X drugs in general obstetric population.

Study Design

Historical cohort study.

Result

A total of 18 575 women who gave a birth in Saskatchewan between January 1997 and December 2000 were included. Among them, 3604 (19.4%) received FDA C, D or X drugs at least once during pregnancy. The pregnancy exposure rates were 15.8, 5.2 and 3.9%, respectively, for category C, D and X drugs, and were 11.2, 7.3 and 8.2%, respectively, in the first, second and third trimesters. Salbutamol (albuterol), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole), ibuprofen, naproxen and oral contraceptives were the most common C, D, X drugs used during pregnancy.

Conclusion

About one in every five women uses FDA C, D and X drugs at least once during pregnancy, and the most common prescription drugs in pregnancy are antiasthmatic, antibiotics, nonsteroid anti-inflammation drugs, antianxiety or antidepressants and oral contraceptives.

### The effectiveness of non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for asthma management during pregnancy: a systematic review [^0d5dc5fb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Many national and international bodies have developed guidelines for asthma management in pregnancy. They include the British Thoracic Society, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American College of Asthma and Allergy (ACAAI), National Asthma Council of Australia (NAC), and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). All these guidelines have emphasized the need to provide optimal therapy to maintain control of asthma throughout gestation for maternal health and quality of life as well as for normal fetal maturation. The Expert Panel Report of the Working Group on Asthma and Pregnancy – Updates in National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) – has recommended four critical components for managing asthma during pregnancy: (1) assessment and monitoring of asthma including objective measures of pulmonary function, (2) control of factors contributing to asthma severity, (3) patient education, and (4) a stepwise approach to pharmacological therapy. Asthma management during pregnancy requires close collaboration among obstetricians, primary care physicians, and asthma-care specialists. Better asthma control can be achieved if patients are involved in self-management, including self-monitoring of either symptoms or peak expiratory flow rates, maintaining regular contact with medical practitioners and following written asthma action plans.

While there are many published reviews of pharmacological asthma management in pregnant women, none has assessed the effectiveness of non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for optimizing asthma management in pregnant women. Most of the interventions in pregnant women have focused on the safety and efficacy of asthma medications in pregnant women. General practitioners (family physicians) have reported a lack of confidence and/or knowledge in managing deteriorating asthma in pregnancy, although having a good understanding of the safety of asthma medications during pregnancy. Despite being concerned about health outcomes, women are not well supported in managing asthma during pregnancy. Empirical evidence on interventions to optimize asthma management during pregnancy, targeting both pregnant women with asthma and their health professionals, is needed. The aim of this review was to identify non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for optimizing asthma management during pregnancy and examine their effects on maternal asthma symptoms and neonatal outcomes.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical studies with STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in pregnant women to inform of drug-associated risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes. There are clinical considerations with the use of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations). Based on animal studies, olodaterol was not teratogenic when administered to pregnant rats or rabbits during organogenesis at inhalation doses of approximately 2,731 or 1,353 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID) (on an AUC basis) in rats or rabbits, respectively (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Labor and Delivery

There are no adequate and well-controlled human studies that have investigated the effects of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT during labor and delivery. Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

Data

Animal Data

STRIVERDI RESPIMAT was not teratogenic in rats at inhalation doses approximately 2,731 times the MRHDID (on an AUC basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 1,054 mcg/kg/day). No significant effects occurred in rabbits at inhalation doses approximately 1,353 times the MRHDID in adults (on an AUC basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 974 mcg/kg/day). Placental transfer of olodaterol was observed in pregnant rats.

Olodaterol has been shown to be teratogenic in New Zealand rabbits at inhalation doses approximately 7,130 times the MRHDID in adults (on an AUC basis at a maternal inhalation dose of 2,489 mcg/kg/day). STRIVERDI RESPIMAT exhibited the following fetal toxicities: enlarged or small heart atria or ventricles, eye abnormalities, and split or distorted sternum.

### Asthma in pregnancy and its pharmacologic treatment [^4a6b76ff]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is among the most common serious medical problems in pregnancy, and its prevalence may be increasing. Management is problematic because asthma may harm the fetus, yet little is known about fetal risks of asthma medications.

Objective

To examine the prevalence, symptom control, and pharmacologic treatment of asthma in pregnancy.

Methods

Study participants were a random sample of 3,609 mothers of nonmalformed infants born in Massachusetts between 1998 and 2006. Interviewed within 6 months of delivery, participants were asked specific asthma-related questions and classified as having physician-diagnosed, possible, past, or no asthma; those with physician-diagnosed asthma were classified as having well-controlled, not well-controlled, or poorly controlled asthma. Drug treatments were grouped into corticosteroids, beta(2)-agonists, leukotriene modifiers, combination products, and others.

Results

Physician-diagnosed asthma was present in 502 women (13.9%) and possible asthma in an additional 578(16.0%). Higher rates of asthma were observed among women who were younger, white, obese, and less well educated, had lower income, and smoked during pregnancy. Secular changes were unremarkable: leukotriene modifiers were used by only 3.4% of asthmatic women; inhaled steroid use increased only from 19.0% during 1997–1999 to 23.3% in 2003–2005, whereas use of inhaled beta(2)-agonists exceeded 50% in both periods. Less than 40% of women with poorly controlled asthma symptoms reported use of a controller medication.

Conclusions

High rates of asthma and asthma symptoms, together with the low rates of use of controller medications, underscore the need to better understand the risks and safety of asthma medications during pregnancy.

### Estimating the U.S. prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometry: the national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 2007–2010 [^c46762f3]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Of these 5,823 examinees, 1110 were eligible for the bronchodilator study based on pre-bronchodilator spirometry values that indicated possible airflow obstruction per ATS/ERS or GOLD criteria. Possible airflow obstruction, per the ATS/ERS criterion, was defined as a pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio less than the lower limit of normal (LLN) representing the lower 5 th percentile based on person's age, sex, height, and race/ethnicity. LLN values were determined using normative reference equations developed from NHANES III data by Hankinson et al. Possible airflow obstruction, per the GOLD criterion, was a pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio less than 70%. Of the 1110 who qualified for post-bronchodilator testing, 238 did not perform the post-bronchodilator test due to subject refusals or limited time available in the MEC. An additional 305 were excluded due to safety reasons which included active cardiovascular disease (uncontrolled blood pressure, irregular pulse on examination, taking medication for major arrhythmia, having an implanted defibrillator, or history of congenital heart disease) or taking certain prescription medications (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, an anticonvulsant, a tricyclic antidepressant plus current treatment for cardiac disease, or potassium lowering drugs). Examinees were also excluded from bronchodilator administration if they had already recently taken a β2-adrenergic bronchodilator to avoid exceeding FDA recommended doses, or if they had had a previous adverse reaction to albuterol. Also, women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded. In total, 543 adults aged 40–79 did not receive the bronchodilator test while 567, or 51% of those eligible, received the test (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Flow diagram of the study population.

Among those who received the pre-bronchodilator spirometry test (n = 5823) and the post-bronchodilator spirometry test (n = 567), 94% and 100%, respectively, had acceptable quality data for analysis. Acceptable quality was defined as either meeting or exceeding the ATS data quality standard of 3 acceptable and 2 reproducible spirometric curves with 2 observed values for both FEV1 and FVC within 150 mL (87% of all tests), or a lesser standard where there were 2 curves where FEV1 values were within 200 ml, and FVC values were within 200 mL (7% of all tests). The final pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator analytic samples were 5477 and 564, respectively.

### Pregnancy and asthma: recent developments [^acb415c4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma is the most common potentially serious medical problem to complicate pregnancy. Asthmatic women have been shown to be at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy. Managing asthma during pregnancy is unique because the effects of both the illness and the treatment on the developing fetus and the patient must be considered.

Recent Findings

This review summarizes the recent studies addressing the interrelationships between asthma and pregnancy and general aspects of pharmacologic therapy of gestational asthma.

Summary

The prevalence of asthma in pregnant women appears to be increasing. Recent evidence supports that pregnant asthmatic women with moderate to severe asthma may have an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. The goal of asthma management during pregnancy is to optimize maternal and fetal health.

### Risk of congenital malformations for asthmatic pregnant women using a long-acting β ₂-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid combination versus higher-dose inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy [^860479f3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Current recommendations for managing persistent asthma during pregnancy when low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are insufficient include adding a long-acting β₂-agonist (LABA) or increasing the ICS dose. However, there are no data to help clinicians evaluate the safest regimen during pregnancy.

Objective

We sought to compare the risk of major congenital malformations in asthmatic women exposed to a LABA plus ICS combination and those exposed to ICS monotherapy at higher doses during the first trimester.

Methods

A cohort of asthmatic pregnant women exposed to ICSs during the first trimester who delivered between January 1990 and March 2009 was established. The primary outcome was major malformation recorded at birth or during the first year of life. Two subcohorts were established as follows: (1) users of a LABA plus low-dose ICS combination or users of a medium-dose ICS and (2) users of a LABA plus medium-dose ICS combination or users of a high-dose ICS. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare the risk of major malformations between the groups.

Results

In one subcohort there were 643 women who used a LABA plus low-dose ICS and 305 who used a medium-dose ICS; the other subcohort included 198 users of a LABA plus medium-dose ICS and 156 users of a high-dose ICS. The prevalence of major malformations was 6.9% and 7.2%, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for major malformations was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.6–1.9) when a LABA plus low-dose ICS was used compared with a medium-dose ICS and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.5–2.7) when a LABA plus medium-dose ICS was used compared with a high-dose ICS.

Conclusion

The risk of major malformations was similar with a LABA plus ICS combination and ICS monotherapy at higher doses, suggesting that both therapeutic options can be considered during pregnancy.

### Safety of fluticasone propionate prescribed for asthma during pregnancy: a UK population-based cohort study [^c8ce006f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is commonly treated during pregnancy, yet data on the safety of asthma medicines used during pregnancy are sparse.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) fluticasone propionate (FP), alone and in fixed-dose combination with salmeterol (FSC) in terms of the risk of all major congenital malformations (MCMs), compared with all other non-FP ICS.

Methods

Women with asthma who had a pregnancy between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010, were identified in the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Exposure to asthma medicines during the first trimester of pregnancy was based on issued prescriptions. The mothers' and infants' medical records were linked where possible, and pregnancy outcomes with an MCM diagnosed by age 1 year were identified based on medical codes in the mother's and infant's medical records, including those MCMs prenatally diagnosed that ended in an induced pregnancy termination. The absolute and relative risks of an MCM after different ICS exposures, stratified by the asthma treatment intensity level, were calculated.

Results

A total of 14,654 mother-infant pairs were identified, of which 6,174 received an ICS prescription during the first trimester, in addition to 13 first trimester ICS exposed pregnancies that ended in an induced termination after a prenatal MCM diagnosis. In total, 5,362 pregnancies were eligible for the primary analysis at age 1 year. The absolute risk of an MCM after any first trimester FP exposure was 2.4% (CI95 0.8–4.1) and 2.7% (CI95 1.8–3.6) for the "moderate" and "considerable/severe" asthma treatment intensity levels, respectively. The adjusted odds ratios when compared with non-FP ICS were 1.1 (CI95 0.5–2.3) and 1.2 (CI95 0.7–2.0) for the "moderate" and "considerable/severe" intensity levels; risks for any FP and for FSC did not differ substantially.

Conclusion

No increase in the overall risk of MCMs was identified after first trimester FP exposure compared with non-FP ICS.

### Inhaled corticosteroid use during pregnancy among women with asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b5ad28d1]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies demonstrate the prescription rate for inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) decreases in early pregnancy, possibly increasing exacerbation risk. This could be related to non-adherence to prescribed asthma medication or medication cessation by the patient or doctor. ICS use during pregnancy has not previously been summarized in a systematic review.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the use of ICS during pregnancy among asthmatic women, specifically: (1) the prevalence of use, (2) changes of use during pregnancy compared with pre-pregnancy and (3) medication adherence among ICS users.

Methods

We systematically searched literature in Embase, MEDLINE, CINAL and Cochrane, using terms related to asthma, pregnancy and medication use. All English articles reporting ICS among pregnant women with asthma were included. Prevalence, changes in ICS use during pregnancy and ICS adherence were pooled using STATA (version 15.0, StataCorp USA).

Results

A total of 4237 references were retrieved in the initial search. Screening and review led to the inclusion of 52 articles for one or more aims (Aim 1: N = 45; Aim 2, N = 13; and Aim 3, N = 5). The pooled prevalence of ICS use during pregnancy was 41% (95%CI 36%-45%); 49% (95%CI 44%-55%) in Europe, 39% (95%CI 32%-47%) in Australia and 34% (95%CI 27%-41%) in North America. In eight prescription databases, ICS prescription rates lowered in the first trimester of pregnancy, compared with pre-pregnancy, increased in the second trimester and decreased in the third trimester. Five studies reported ICS adherence among pregnant women, using four measures of self-reported non-adherence. In two comparable studies, pooled ICS non-adherence was 40% (95%CI 36%-44%).

Conclusions

The prevalence of ICS use among pregnant women with asthma is 41% and varies widely between countries and continents, and prescription rates for ICS change throughout pregnancy. More studies are needed to investigate ICS adherence during pregnancy in women with asthma.

### The effectiveness of non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for asthma management during pregnancy: a systematic review [^72ae8c08]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our review suggests that non-pharmacological healthcare interventions including education, self-management, progressive muscle relaxation and periodic follow-up may optimize asthma management in pregnancy. Interventions that enable pregnant women to be monitored regularly using objective measures of lung function or asthma symptoms appear to be more effective in improving health outcomes during pregnancy.

### Improving safe and effective use of drugs in pregnancy and lactation: workshop summary [^66cf1234]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

In February 2015, given high rates of use of medications by pregnant women and the relative lack of data on safety and efficacy of many drugs utilized in pregnancy, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a group of experts to review the "current" state of the clinical care and science regarding medication use during the perinatal period. The expert panel chose select medications to demonstrate what existing safety and efficacy data may be available for clinicians and patients when making decisions about use in pregnancy or lactation. Furthermore, these example medications also provided opportunities to highlight where data are lacking, thus forming a list of research gaps. Last, after reviewing the existing vaccine safety surveillance system as well as the legislative history surrounding the use of drugs for pediatric diseases, the expert panel made specific recommendations concerning policy efforts to stimulate more research and regulatory attention on drugs for pregnant and lactating women.

FDA pregnancy risk categories and transition to the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR) are outlined as follows: Prior (1979) categories defined A — Adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy; B — Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, or animal reproduction studies have shown adverse effects, but well-controlled studies in pregnant women have shown no adverse effects to the fetus; C — Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, or there are no animal reproduction studies and no well-controlled studies in humans; D — Positive evidence of fetal risk, but benefits may outweigh risks; and X — Positive evidence of fetal risk, and risks clearly outweigh any possible benefit. The (2015) PLLR eliminated the pregnancy risk categories and provides individualized summaries of risk for each medication.

Treatment of asthma and asthma exacerbations during pregnancy

Pregnancy has a unique effect on decisions around asthma control and management. Despite guidelines recommending the continuing of usual asthma medications during pregnancy, it is not uncommon for women to cease their medications, with or without consultation with their doctors. These decisions may be driven by a perceived lack of need to continue their medications, a lack of support and guidance from health professionals regarding how to manage their asthma medications and/or concerns regarding the safety of asthma medications during pregnancy. These concerns may not be unique to women themselves, as a previous survey demonstrated that in situations where asthma was well controlled, over 25% of family physicians would instruct their pregnant patients to decrease or discontinue asthma medication during pregnancy, despite the potential to negatively impact on subsequent asthma control. Furthermore, a study conducted in the US found that pregnant women with an asthma exacerbation were significantly less likely to be given oral steroids either in the emergency department or on discharge from hospital than non-pregnant asthmatic women (50.8% vs. 72.4%). Subsequently, pregnant asthmatic women were three times more likely to report an on-going asthma exacerbation following discharge when compared with non-pregnant asthmatic women. The lack of treatment of an exacerbation during pregnancy can severely compromise the fetus by reducing the oxygen supply to the utero-placental unit and has a more significant impact on the fetus than the medication itself. Daily ICS use has previously been identified as a safe medical approach to controlling asthma during pregnancy and reducing the risk of exacerbation. The uncertainty, concerns and variability in practice surrounding medication use and asthma control during pregnancy emphasizes the key need for a dedicated Antenatal Asthma Management Service.

### Management of rhinitis and asthma in pregnancy [^c74d8a99]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To objectively critique recent available data on the proper management of allergy and asthma during pregnancy, with an emphasis on understanding the risk and benefit of medications used during pregnancy for these disorders.

Data Sources

Data for this article were obtained from a MEDLINE search of literature from 1975 until the present published in English.

Study Selection

It was the expert opinion of the author to select and synthesize recently published articles and reviews on this broad subject.

Results

Asthma is estimated to affect up to 4% of pregnancies, whereas rhinitis complicates up to 20%. The cornerstones of management are environmental avoidance procedures, pharmacologic treatment, and allergen immunotherapy. Pharmaceutical treatment for allergic rhinitis should start with the first-generation antihistamines, chlorpheniramine and tripelennamine. In pregnant women, who cannot tolerate first-generation antihistamines, use of a second-generation agent, either loratadine or cetirizine, should be considered. Though data are lacking, intranasal corticosteroids appear to be safe during pregnancy. For pregnant women with persistent asthma, the use of inhaled cromolyn should be the first-line therapy, followed by inhaled budesonide if symptoms worsen. Other agents such as salmeterol, leukotriene modifiers, and newer inhaled corticosteroids may be considered in women who exhibited a good response to these agents before pregnancy. Immunotherapy is the only disease-modifying treatment for allergic rhinitis and asthma. It can be continued during pregnancy.

Conclusions

Understanding the important differences in treatment for the pregnant patient is vital for all physicians caring for these patients. Proper medical management needs to take into consideration possible adverse effects of different agents used in asthma and rhinitis.
