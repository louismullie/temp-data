## Question

Side effects of antivenum

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the side effects of antivenom, organized by timing, mechanisms, risk modifiers, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic nature of antivenoms and why they cause reactions. Then, I should categorize adverse effects by timing and mechanism. Next, I will quantify frequencies across products and regions, identify risk modifiers, and outline management strategies. Finally, I will consider special populations, product-specific nuances, and the clinical implications for counseling and follow-up, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic basis for adverse effects. Antivenoms are polyclonal immunoglobulins or fragments (IgG, F(ab')2, Fab) derived from animals immunized against venoms, so they are foreign proteins that can provoke both immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions; most early events are not IgE-mediated, which explains why pre-treatment skin testing is unreliable for predicting immediate reactions, and this heterologous protein load also underlies serum sickness risk and dose-related adverse effects [^1116aMRU] [^111vseKs].

> I will now examine early adverse reactions, typically within minutes to hours of infusion. Wait, let me verify the range of reported incidence before I anchor on a number. Depending on product, dose, speed of administration, and quality, early reactions vary from about 3% to over 80% in some Latin American and South Asian series, with roughly 5–10% of these early events being life-threatening; clinically, they include anaphylaxis, pyrogenic reactions from manufacturing contamination, hypotension, bronchospasm, and angioedema, and importantly, prophylactic subcutaneous adrenaline reduces incidence and severity of these early events [^1116aMRU] [^11248KSw].

> Next, I should review delayed reactions, classically serum sickness 5–20 days after treatment. Hold on, I should verify the incidence range and whether it tracks with dose. Observational studies report serum sickness in about 5% to 56% of recipients, and in a prospective Australian cohort, 29% developed serum sickness with no clear dose-response, suggesting that volume alone does not predict risk; typical features include fever, rash or urticaria, arthralgia or myalgia, headache, malaise, and occasionally lymphadenopathy, and WHO guidance supports a 5-day course of oral antihistamines with escalation to a 5-day course of prednisolone if symptoms persist beyond 48 hours [^1116aMRU] [^115fJmhr].

> Let me consider recurrence phenomena, particularly with Fab antivenoms for crotaline envenomation. Recurrent local and coagulopathic effects can occur after clinical improvement, correlating with shorter half-life of Fab fragments and the potential for late venom effects to re-emerge; prevention and management require extended observation and repeat dosing for at least 18 hours, with close follow-up for late coagulopathy, and randomized data suggest F(ab')2 products reduce late coagulopathy compared with Fab, though vigilance remains necessary in practice [^113fXvGk] [^115mkJyC].

> I should double-check product-specific safety signals to avoid overgeneralization. Modern North American Fab and F(ab')2 crotaline antivenoms generally have lower immediate hypersensitivity rates than historical whole-IgG products, with contemporary series showing acute adverse events around 2–3% and severe reactions near 1% for Fab, and overall low rates for F(ab')2; in contrast, older whole-IgG products carried 23–56% early reaction rates, and Australian polyvalent antivenoms have high serum sickness rates, underscoring that safety profiles are formulation- and product-specific rather than uniform across the class [^111AR19d] [^116ihbB8] [^114F9cnq] [^115fJmhr].

> But wait, what about regional and quality-related modifiers. In South Asia, early reaction rates can be very high, reportedly up to 55–80% in some settings, likely reflecting manufacturing quality, aggregate content, and heterologous protein load; similarly, expired or turbid products increase reaction risk and should not be used, whereas carefully selected, recently expired products with retained potency may be considered only in exceptional shortages with informed consent and legal caution, highlighting that product quality and storage conditions materially affect safety [^11248KSw] [^114tG1EF] [^1139KVb5].

> I need to ensure I address risk modifiers at the patient and treatment level. Higher total protein exposure increases adverse reaction risk, and rapid infusion can precipitate reactions; conversely, prophylactic subcutaneous adrenaline reduces early reactions, and premedication with antihistamines and corticosteroids is commonly used despite limited standalone evidence, particularly in settings with historically high reaction rates; clinicians also frequently start slowly and titrate infusion rates as a practical mitigation strategy [^1116aMRU] [^114iMzkZ].

> Next, I should review management of acute reactions. At the first sign of anaphylaxis, I should confirm that the infusion is stopped immediately and intramuscular adrenaline is given in the anterolateral thigh, followed by IV antihistamines and glucocorticoids, with inhaled bronchodilators for bronchospasm; once stabilized, antivenom can be cautiously resumed if clinically indicated, recognizing that glucocorticoids do not prevent recurrence of anaphylaxis and that pyrogenic reactions warrant cooling, antipyretics, and IV fluids [^1116aMRU].

> For delayed serum sickness, let me verify the WHO-recommended approach. A 5-day course of oral antihistamines is first-line, and if symptoms persist beyond 48 hours, a 5-day course of oral prednisolone is advised; patients should be counseled to report rash, fever, arthralgia, and malaise during the post-discharge window, and clinicians should arrange follow-up to detect late reactions and sequelae, typically around two weeks after antivenom [^1116aMRU] [^112jUZaq].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, management prioritizes maternal stabilization, including prompt treatment of anaphylaxis and indicated antivenom, with obstetric evaluation and fetal monitoring; the limited literature suggests antivenom is generally considered safe when clinically indicated, balancing maternal–fetal risks. In pediatrics, adverse reaction patterns appear broadly similar to adults, and pediatric series report acceptable safety with appropriate monitoring, though vigilance remains essential [^114JJc9v] [^113bw3DR].

> I will now examine product-specific nuances that influence monitoring and recurrence risk. Fab products like CroFab have shorter half-lives and are associated with recurrence phenomena, prompting scheduled maintenance dosing in some protocols, whereas F(ab')2 products like Anavip have longer half-lives and may reduce late coagulopathy; nonetheless, real-world data show variability in total vials and administrations, reinforcing the need for individualized reassessment and follow-up coagulation monitoring after control is achieved [^113fXvGk] [^115mkJyC] [^1117cC2n].

> Let me reconsider the clinical implications for counseling and systems of care. Patients and families should be educated about early signs of hypersensitivity during infusion and about delayed serum sickness symptoms after discharge, with clear return precautions and scheduled follow-up; in resource-limited settings, fear of reactions contributes to underuse of antivenom, so training in reaction recognition and management, coupled with quality-assured products and adrenaline prophylaxis, can mitigate both adverse events and access barriers [^112jUZaq] [^11248KSw] [^1116aMRU].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis remains precise. Antivenoms can cause early hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and pyrogenic responses, and delayed serum sickness, with risks modulated by product quality, dose, infusion practice, and patient factors; modern Fab and F(ab')2 formulations generally have lower immediate reaction rates than historical whole-IgG products, but serum sickness remains common in some series, and recurrence phenomena with Fab require extended observation and repeat dosing; proactive prophylaxis, vigilant monitoring during infusion, and structured follow-up for late effects are essential to optimize safety while preserving life-saving benefit [^1116aMRU] [^111AR19d] [^115fJmhr] [^113fXvGk].

Antivenom side effects include **immediate hypersensitivity reactions** (anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm) [^1116aMRU] [^111AR19d], **delayed serum sickness** (fever, rash, arthralgia, malaise) [^115fJmhr] [^114KR3NZ], and **pyrogenic reactions** (fever, chills, rigors) [^1116aMRU]. Risk varies by product and dose [^1116aMRU]; early reactions occur in 3–80% [^1116aMRU], with life-threatening events in 5–10% [^1116aMRU], and serum sickness in 5–56% [^1116aMRU]. Premedication with adrenaline [^1116aMRU], antihistamines, and corticosteroids reduces early reactions; monitor closely during infusion and treat anaphylaxis with adrenaline, antihistamines, and corticosteroids [^1116aMRU]. Delayed serum sickness is managed with antihistamines and corticosteroids [^1116aMRU]; patients should be advised to report late symptoms [^114KR3NZ].

---

## Immediate hypersensitivity reactions

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur within minutes to hours of administration and are the most clinically significant antivenom side effects [^1116aMRU]. These reactions are typically **immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated** and can be severe or life-threatening [^1116aMRU].

- **Anaphylaxis**: Severe systemic reactions characterized by hypotension, bronchospasm, angioedema, and shock [^1116aMRU]. The incidence of anaphylaxis varies widely, ranging from 3% to over 80% depending on the antivenom product, dose, and patient factors [^notfound].

- **Urticaria and angioedema**: Common mild to moderate allergic reactions presenting with hives, itching, and localized swelling [^notfound].

- **Bronchospasm and respiratory distress**: Occurs in approximately 8% of patients, particularly those with pre-existing respiratory conditions [^116chTKN].

- **Pyrogenic reactions**: Fever, chills, and rigors resulting from contamination during manufacturing or improper storage [^1116aMRU].

---

## Delayed hypersensitivity reactions (serum sickness)

Delayed hypersensitivity reactions, commonly known as serum sickness, typically occur 5–14 days after antivenom administration. These reactions are **immune complex-mediated** and present with:

- **Rash and urticaria**: Commonly observed in approximately 29% of patients receiving antivenom [^115fJmhr].

- **Fever, arthralgia, and malaise**: Systemic symptoms resembling viral infections, occurring in about 5–56% of patients depending on the antivenom product and dose [^1116aMRU] [^115fJmhr].

- **Rare severe reactions**: Including nephritis and neurological complications, although these are uncommon [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing the risk and severity of side effects

Several factors influence the **risk and severity** of antivenom side effects:

| **Factor** | **Influence on side effects** |
|-|-|
| Antivenom type and quality | - Higher incidence of reactions with crude whole IgG preparations <br/> - Lower incidence with purified Fab or F(ab')2 fragments [^113yy2FT] [^114F9cnq] |
| Dose and infusion rate | - Higher doses and rapid infusion increase risk of immediate hypersensitivity reactions [^1116aMRU] [^115pmurr] |
| Patient demographics | - Children and elderly patients may have higher susceptibility to adverse reactions [^notfound] |
| Previous exposure to antivenom | - Sensitization from prior exposure increases risk of severe allergic reactions [^notfound] |
| Storage conditions | - Improper storage increases risk of pyrogenic reactions and reduced efficacy [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical management of antivenom side effects

Effective management of antivenom side effects requires **prompt recognition and appropriate treatment**:

- **Immediate hypersensitivity reactions**: Administer intramuscular adrenaline (epinephrine), intravenous antihistamines, and corticosteroids. Suspend antivenom infusion temporarily and resume cautiously once stabilized [^1116aMRU].

- **Pyrogenic reactions**: Manage with physical cooling, antipyretics, and intravenous fluids [^1116aMRU].

- **Delayed serum sickness**: Treat with oral antihistamines and corticosteroids. Severe cases may require hospitalization and supportive care [^1116aMRU].

---

## Preventive measures and monitoring strategies

Preventive measures and careful monitoring can significantly reduce the **incidence and severity** of antivenom side effects:

- **Premedication**: Administer prophylactic adrenaline, antihistamines, and corticosteroids before antivenom infusion to reduce immediate hypersensitivity reactions [^notfound].

- **Gradual infusion**: Infuse antivenom slowly with close monitoring of vital signs and clinical status during administration [^1116aMRU].

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about potential delayed reactions and advise them to seek medical attention if symptoms occur after discharge [^114KR3NZ].

---

## Long-term consequences and chronic side effects

Long-term consequences of antivenom administration are **generally rare** but may include chronic serum sickness, persistent allergic sensitization, and, in rare cases, infectious complications such as hepatitis B or C if the antivenom is contaminated. Regular follow-up and patient counseling are essential to monitor for these rare events [^1116aMRU].

---

Antivenom is the **cornerstone of envenomation treatment**, but it carries a significant risk of side effects, including immediate hypersensitivity reactions, delayed serum sickness, and pyrogenic reactions. The risk and severity of these side effects vary depending on the antivenom type, dose, patient factors, and storage conditions. Effective management involves prompt recognition, appropriate treatment, and preventive measures such as premedication and careful monitoring.

Introduction

Antivenom is widely accepted as an effective treatment for snake envenomation. This is despite very limited evidence supporting clinical effectiveness for major envenomation syndromes, and is mainly based on pre-clinical studies and observational studies without control groups.

Effectiveness Of Early Antivenom

Although antivenom exhibits efficacy by binding to snake toxins and preventing toxic injury in animals if pre-mixed with venom, this efficacy does not always translate to clinical effectiveness. There are many irreversible venom mediated effects that antivenom cannot neutralise or reverse, such as pre-synaptic neurotoxicity and myotoxicity. Fortunately, early antivenom appears to prevent some of these.

Practicalities Of Administering Antivenom Early

With good evidence that early antivenom prevents some envenomation syndromes, the time between bite and antivenom administration must be reduced. This requires improving the initial assessment of snakebite patients, and improving early decision making based on clinical effects.

Conclusion

Until there are improved, simplified, easy to use, rapid and inexpensive tests, whether available in the laboratory or preferably at the bedside that identify systemic envenomation, the key to early antivenom administration is early assessment and decision making based on systemic symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, headache and abdominal pain.

What to cover on discharge and follow-up?

Patients who are clinically stable or asymptomatic with persistently negative 20WBCT after 24 hours may be discharged. Educate patients and their families on snakebite prevention and first aid, preferably using printed leaflets with clear visually represented information and minimal reliance on text.

Inform patients who have received antivenom to report late adverse reactions. Arrange a follow-up after two weeks to review late reactions and sequelae.

### Snake antivenom product guidelines in India: "the devil is in the details" [^111LJboM]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Venomous snakebite continues to exact a tremendous toll in human suffering and mortality in India. Contributing to this problem is the fact that all of the current Indian snake antivenom manufacturers include a great deal of misinformation in the package inserts and guidelines that accompany their products. Examples include erroneous recommendations regarding first aid, misleading information regarding the signs and symptoms to be anticipated after Indian snakebite, and misleading and ambiguous recommendations as to initial dosing and repeat dosing of antivenom. In addition, the significant problem of acute adverse reactions to Indian antivenoms is compounded by a lack of appropriate recommendations regarding prevention, diagnosis, and management of such reactions. It is the intent of this article to point out problems with the current Indian antivenom product guidelines and to encourage these manufacturers to produce new literature to accompany their products based on the best available evidence.

Risk of adverse reactions with antivenom

Monitor patients for adverse reactions in the first two hours of antivenom administration (box 2). Anaphylaxis or pyrogenic reactions occur early (within minutes or hours). Mechanistic studies suggest that most events are not IgE mediated and thus cannot be accurately predicted by skin tests for immediate hypersensitivity. However, their incidence and severity can be reduced by a prophylactic subcutaneous injection of low dose adrenaline. Pyrogenic reactions result from product contamination during manufacture.

Box 2
Clinical features and frequency of adverse reactions to antivenom

Depending on the dose, speed of administration, and product quality, the risk of any early reaction varies from 3% to more than 80% in studies from Latin America and South Asia. About 5–10% of such events are associated with life threatening consequences. The incidence of fatal reactions is unclear because of confusion with symptoms of envenoming, but some have been reported.

Treat anaphylaxis at the earliest sign. Suspend antivenom administration and inject adrenaline intramuscularly, ideally into the upper lateral thigh. Additional treatment includes intravenous antihistamines and glucocorticoids and inhaled bronchodilators for bronchospasm. Anaphylaxis can recur, and glucocorticoids do not prevent recurrence. On resolution of the episode, cautiously resume antivenom in patients with a definite indication for continued treatment. Treat pyrogenic reactions with physical cooling, antipyretics, and intravenous fluids.

Late reactions may manifest a week after administration. Their incidence varies widely from 5% to 56% in observational studies and trials using differing diagnostic criteria.WHO guidelines recommend a five-day course of oral antihistamines for those with serum-sickness type late reactions, and a five-day course of prednisolone in those who fail antihistamine therapy after the first two days.

Whom to refer?

Patients with persistent bleeding despite repeated antivenom treatment or having respiratory and renal failure may require urgent supportive measures such as blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy respectively. If these are not available, arrange for transfer to a specialised centre. Patients with substantial bleeding, worsening paralysis, dropping urine output, refractory shock, anaphylaxis non-responsive to adrenaline, or compartment syndrome may also require specialist management and intensive care.

Having contact details of emergency transport and the referral centre readily available can avoid delays. Inform the receiving hospital about the patient's condition over the phone and send a referral letter with details of assessment and treatment.

### Situation of snakebite, antivenom market and access to antivenoms in ASEAN countries [^117XAMVn]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Interviewees affirm that most antivenoms are officially granted marketing approval by the national regulatory authority in each country. Some are unofficially available via a direct purchase with manufacturers using research fund or physicians' personal money which are used in selected hospitals in the destination countries without official registration.

In countries with officially available antivenoms, the species coverage for snakes of medical importance is 29%–100% for Category 1 snakes and 0%–86% for Category 2 snakes (table 1 with details in online supplemental table S4). The antivenoms are selected to cover highly venomous snake species frequently occurring with dangerous outcomes as explained in the interview: 'They [Category II snakes of medical importance] are medical important, but [they are] not to the level of requiring to produce [its own] antivenom. They are medically important, but in terms of the potential danger, [are] not potentially dangerous. They are venomous but not dangerous'. (Informant 1, Clinician)

The use of expired antivenoms is described in at least three countries. The expired antivenoms are used to treat patients with severe systemic envenoming who provided their consent after they are informed regarding the benefits and potential risks of using the expired antivenom: 'Sometime it [antivenom] is expired, but in terms of life saving. even its efficacy would remain at 70%–80%, it is better than nothing'. (Informant 16, Policymaker) Stability test demonstrated that the expired antivenoms retain their potency after 2–5 years of their expiry date. Informants shared experience of using the expired antivenoms after 1–11 years of their expiry date in 26 cases. The systemic envenoming was effectively reversed without unexpected side effects in 25 cases, whereas, one died from acute kidney injury.

### Snake antivenom for snake venom induced consumption coagulopathy [^11674zVM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Snake venom induced consumption coagulopathy is a major systemic effect of envenoming. Observational studies suggest that antivenom improves outcomes for venom induced consumption coagulopathy in some snakebites and not others. However, the effectiveness of snake antivenom in all cases of venom induced consumption coagulopathy is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effect of snake antivenom as a treatment for venom induced consumption coagulopathy in people with snake bite.

Search Methods

The search was done on 30 January 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), Embase Classic+Embase (OvidSP), three other sources, clinical trials registers, and we also screened reference lists.

Selection Criteria

All completed, published or unpublished, randomised, controlled trials with a placebo or no treatment arm, where snake antivenom was administered for venom induced consumption coagulopathy in humans with snake bites.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors reviewed the identified trials and independently applied the selection criteria.

Main Results

No studies met the inclusion criteria for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

Randomised placebo-controlled trials are required to investigate the effectiveness of snake antivenom for clinically relevant outcomes in patients with venom induced consumption coagulopathy resulting from snake bite. Although ethically difficult, the routine administration of a treatment that has a significant risk of anaphylaxis cannot continue without strong evidence of benefit.

Antivenom

Guidelines from the WHO recommend antivenom treatment for patients with shock, spontaneous systemic bleeding, uncoagulable blood, neurotoxicity, black urine, acute kidney injury, rapidly progressive local swelling, and bites by species known to cause local necrosis and digital bites.

Antivenoms are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins fractionated from the plasma of domesticated animals hyper-immunised with venom from one or more snake species over variable periods. They are highly specific and will neutralise only the venoms used in their production and those of a few closely related species. Polyspecific antivenoms are raised against a mixture of venoms from more than one species. Antivenoms raised against venom from a single species are monospecific.

Early administration of antivenom prevents or limits haemodynamic alterations, progression of coagulopathy to clinically overt bleeding, postsynaptic neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, acute kidney injury, and local tissue damage. Physiological levels of clotting factors are at least partially restored within a median of six hours with sufficient doses of specific antivenoms.

Robust clinical data on the safe and effective initial dose of antivenom are lacking for most products. Clinicians often rely on manufacturers' recommendations provided as package inserts or labels, but these can be unreliable. We suggest following national protocols or standard regional guidelines for dose. Administration is always intravenous, as bolus or diluted in saline solution over 10–60 minutes, at the same dose for adults and children. Repeat administration of antivenom if bleeding persists, if weakness or cardiovascular signs worsen within two hours, or if a 20WBCT is positive at six hours after antivenom administration.

The effectiveness of antivenoms in treating established neurotoxicity, soft tissue damage, and acute kidney injury is not established. Additional treatments are indicated for these.

### Antivenom for European vipera species envenoming [^112hTbsm]. Clinical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

European viper bite is relatively uncommon but can cause serious envenoming, particularly swelling and hemorrhage spreading from limb to trunk that can cause long term disability. Systemic features are relatively mild compared to many other venomous species. Moderate-to-severe envenoming requires antivenom, which is given many hundreds of times each year across the continent. Several Vipera spp antivenoms are produced in Europe, but there is little comparative information available for the antivenoms and none is licensed with the European Medicines Agency. We aimed to collect descriptive data on European viper antivenoms and assess their relative effectiveness.

Methods

A systematic review of articles relating to antivenom in Europe was performed using the Medline medical database. The following keywords "Europ" or the individual names of each European country and "antiven" or "immun" or "envenom" and "snake" or "viper" or "adder" were used. Articles published between 1 January 1996 and 11 March 2016 pertaining to clinical outcome, including case reports, were selected. Referenced articles in the indexed articles were explored for suitability and included if they met any of the criteria: specific antivenom used, route of antivenom administration, adverse reactions to antivenom therapy and length of hospital admission. All accepted abstracts from EAPCCT conferences since 2000 were searched and abstracts relating to Vipera spp envenoming were assessed for suitability. We extracted data on study type, safety and effectiveness. We sought information on antivenoms from manufacturers and individual patient data from authors of publications. Since individual patient data were only rarely available, we compared median length of stay between case series reporting each antivenom. We identified 40 papers and six published abstracts, and one unpublished paper that reported clinical cases and case series of envenomed patients treated with antivenom. No publication reported randomized controlled trials comparing any European Vipera antivenom with either placebo or another antivenom. 25 reports were of retrospective hospital- (n = 13) or poison center-based (n = 12) case series including five or more patients; a further 12 reports were either case reports or case series with less than five patients and one paper was a limited literature review. An additional nine papers reported prospective data; seven collected data remotely through poison service telephone communication with the attending physicians. Antivenoms available in Europe: Eight antivenoms are available for European Vipera spp envenoming; a material safety data sheet providing information on manufacture was available for seven. Six are raised against V. berus or V. ammodytes venom; the seventh is raised against a mixture of V. ammodytes, V. aspis and V. berus venom and the eighth is raised against V. ammodytes, Macrovipera lebetina and Montivipera xanthina venom. Six manufacturers recommended intramuscular administration while two recommended intravenous administration. No randomized control trials comparing the effectiveness of antivenoms were identified. Pre-clinical data: We found two papers presenting comparative preclinical data. Clinical data: Clinical studies were predominantly retrospective and contained clinical data on antivenom used in 2602 patients; where the antivenom was identified (n = 2174), 2061 (94.8%) received Zagreb, ViperFAV or ViperaTAb antivenoms. There were few published data on the other antivenoms. Repeated use of antivenom: Repeat doses were reported in 230/1491 of cases (15.4%) where this information was recorded. Outcome and length of hospital stay: Intravenous administration of antivenom was associated with shorter length of hospital stay (median length of hospital stay in studies of intravenous ViperFAV or ViperaTAb ranged from 1 to 4.8 days versus 2 to 18 days for intramuscular Bulbio or Zagreb antivenoms). Antivenom versus no antivenom: Some small studies demonstrated no difference in the length of hospital stay in patients with equivalent envenomation grading who either did or did not receive antivenom. Adverse events: Adverse reactions were reported in 37 of 2408 cases (1.5%) including seven cases of anaphylaxis.

Conclusions

There are very limited pre-clinical comparative data and no randomised controlled trials assessing effectiveness of the antivenoms against different Vipera species. Most descriptive data suggest the efficacy of Zagreb, ViperFAV and ViperaTAb antivenoms by the intravenous route but not intramuscular route, although this is level D evidence. Reported adverse reactions were rare, suggesting that the modern intravenous antivenoms are of good quality. Better and more systematic data, including perhaps randomized controlled trials comparing different antivenoms, are required for the many hundreds of antivenom administrations that occur annually across Europe.

### Snakebite envenoming [^111YvdEQ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that kills > 100,000 people and maims > 400,000 people every year. Impoverished populations living in the rural tropics are particularly vulnerable; snakebite envenoming perpetuates the cycle of poverty. Snake venoms are complex mixtures of proteins that exert a wide range of toxic actions. The high variability in snake venom composition is responsible for the various clinical manifestations in envenomings, ranging from local tissue damage to potentially life-threatening systemic effects. Intravenous administration of antivenom is the only specific treatment to counteract envenoming. Analgesics, ventilator support, fluid therapy, haemodialysis and antibiotic therapy are also used. Novel therapeutic alternatives based on recombinant antibody technologies and new toxin inhibitors are being explored. Confronting snakebite envenoming at a global level demands the implementation of an integrated intervention strategy involving the WHO, the research community, antivenom manufacturers, regulatory agencies, national and regional health authorities, professional health organizations, international funding agencies, advocacy groups and civil society institutions.

### Scorpion envenomation and antivenom therapy [^116kgCw4]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Scorpion envenomation is a dangerous and common global event that can result in a variety of toxic clinical effects. These are typically managed with supportive care or antivenom. Antivenom use is controversial because of conflicting evidence of effectiveness for adrenergic toxicity. However, both controlled and uncontrolled studies have shown that antivenom is effective in resolving neuromotor toxicity associated with envenomations by the scorpions of genus Centruroides.

### Haemotoxic snake venoms: their functional activity, impact on snakebite victims and pharmaceutical promise [^115pmurr]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

To try and circumvent these limitations, many manufacturers generate antivenoms by immunising animals with multiple different snake venoms. These products have the benefit of generating antibodies against a wider pool of antigens (i.e. the variety of toxins found in different snake venoms) and they also circumvent clinical challenges surrounding identifying the snake that has bitten a patient required to inform antivenom choice. However, the consequences of this approach are that the antivenom contains fewer specific antibodies to the single snake species that envenomed the patient, effectively making them more dilute. Therefore, larger therapeutic doses are required to effect cure (Abubakar et al, 2010). This in turn brings two challenges, a potential increased risk of adverse reactions as larger doses of foreign protein are delivered to human victims, and an increased treatment cost as more vials are required to effect cure. Considering that the incidence of adverse reactions reported after antivenom therapy can be as high as 55% (Deshpande et al, 2013) and the average cost of a vial of antivenom varies from $100–250 in Africa for example, with upwards of 10–20 vials being required to effect cure (World Health Organization, 2010a), these characteristics are far from ideal. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of new, low‐dose, low‐cost and paraspecifically effective antivenoms for treating snakebite victims in the tropical regions of the world (Harrison et al, 2011).

### North American envenomation syndromes [^1155LEkK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

This review discusses the distinct envenomation syndromes produced by North American species of snakes and arthropods, specifically the Crotalinae subfamily of snakes, which includes cottonmouths, copperheads, and rattlesnakes; coral snakes; Latrodectus and Loxosceles species of arachnid; and Centruroides sculpturatus, the only species of North American scorpion capable of producing an envenomation syndrome. The authors discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and presentation of these syndromes and emphasize the varying degrees to which these syndromes can manifest clinically. Finally, the management of each envenomation syndrome is addressed. Special attention is paid to available antivenoms, their indications for use, and their side effects.

### Efficacy, safety, and use of snake antivenoms in the United States [^117VqPZU]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The mainstay of hospital treatment for venomous snakebite is antivenom. There is currently only one antivenom available in the United States for the treatment of pit viper envenomation, Antivenin (Crotalidae) Polyvalent (ACP). The general indication for the administration of antivenom is presence of progressive venom injury. Progressive injury is defined as worsening local injury (eg, swelling, ecchymosis), a clinically important coagulation abnormality, or systemic effects (eg, hypotension, altered mental status). Unfortunately, there are no prospective data available regarding the efficacy of ACP. The efficacy of a new antivenom (CroFab; FabAV) composed of purified Fab specific to indigenous snake species has been demonstrated in prospective trials. FabAV appears as effective as IgG antivenoms. However, Fab molecules have a shorter half-life than IgG molecules and may allow recurrence of venom effects, if additional doses are not administered. It has also been found that other antivenoms, including ACP, also allow recurrence of venom effects. The Fab preparation has produced fewer acute or delayed (serum sickness) allergic reactions; however, further experience is needed to confirm this observation. Evaluation of this new antivenom has led to advances in our understanding of antivenoms in terms of solubility and durability. Fab fragments enter solution quickly, thereby shortening the time to antivenom administration and are remarkably stable under extreme conditions of heat and handling.

### Symptoms and management of painful progressive swelling in eswatini snakebite patients: a prospective observational study [^117MyJS7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This is the first multicenter prospective clinical observational study on snakebites from Eswatini, including snakebite patients from two consecutive snakebite seasons and nine different health facilities with a single antivenom product in use. No measurable differences in the rate of swelling reduction were observed between patients who received antivenom and those who did not. Necrosis developed in several patients despite earlier antivenom therapy. It must be stressed that the shortcomings of an observational study design, the incomplete follow-up, the unknown proportion of different snake species causing the bites, bites caused by species not covered by the antivenom used, and variations in antivenom dosing mandate caution when interpreting these data. The costs of antivenom, its potential serious side effects, and its questionable efficacy in averting local tissue complications are strong arguments for supporting a clinical trial to investigate its efficacy in preventing local tissue complications, preferably stratified by snake species.

### De novo designed proteins neutralize lethal snake venom toxins [^117BCqQ8]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

Snakebite envenoming represents a public health threat in many developing regions, notably low-resource settings in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Papua New Guinea and Latin America. With over two million annual cases, snakebites result in 100,000 fatalities and 300,000 permanent disabilities. In 2017, the World Health Organization listed snakebite envenoming as a highest-priority neglected tropical disease. Nonetheless, limited resources have been dedicated to improving the current antivenom treatments. These therapies rely on plasma-derived polyclonal antibodies from hyperimmunized animals, complemented by medical and surgical care. Although instrumental in saving lives, antivenom accessibility is hindered by high production costs and inadequate cold-chain infrastructure in remote areas. Serious adverse effects, including anaphylaxis and pyrogenic reactions, represent additional challenges during antivenom administration. Furthermore, these treatments are often ineffective in counteracting neurotoxicity and tissue necrosis owing to suboptimal concentrations of neutralizing antibodies against three-finger toxins (3FTxs) –. This inefficacy stems from the limited immunogenicity of 3FTxs in antivenom-producing animals, resulting in a failure to elicit a strong antibody response. Additional issues arise because of the delayed administration of antivenom treatment. Antibody – and non-antibody-based therapeutics – have been tested in preclinical studies, but the development of these types of molecules requires either immunization of animals or the development of large libraries that require extensive selection, screening and optimization efforts.

### African polyvalent antivenom can maintain pharmacological stability and ability to neutralise murine venom lethality for decades post-expiry: evidence for increasing antivenom shelf life to aid in alleviating chronic shortages [^114tG1EF]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

As described, many studies have demonstrated retained efficacy of expired antivenoms, and it is important to consider whether existing antivenom stocks could be used more efficiently, particularly given the lack of access to these products in low and middle-income settings. Reports suggest that clinicians are already using expired antivenom products due to lack of availability of in-date products, and the South-East Asia regional office WHO guidelines for managing snakebite endorse this in certain circumstances: 'in patients with severe envenoming, recently expired antivenoms may be used if there is no alternative'. However, we must emphasise that while we and others have demonstrated retained preclinical efficacy of expired antivenoms in mouse models, the clinical efficacy and safety of these antivenoms cannot be confirmed from these assays. Expired antivenoms which are cloudy or have precipitates must not be administered due to the likely high risk of adverse reactions resulting from aggregates. The legal implications of prescribing expired antivenom must be emphasised, as the prescribing clinician may subsequently become liable for any adverse events suffered by the patient following administration of an expired antivenom and would need to counsel the patient on the potential risks.

Considering the global crisis in antivenom supply, the loss of antivenom due to expiry has driven investigation into whether expired antivenoms retain clinical efficacy, with the rationale that they could be used in emergency situations when in-date antivenom is unavailable. It is widely recognised in academic settings that antivenoms can retain their efficacy for many years after their expiration, with several recent studies demonstrating retained antivenom preclinical efficacy, similar to that of non-expired antivenom, up to two decades post-expiry. Furthermore, there is clinical precedent for the use of expired antivenom in certain situations. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of expired North American coral snake antivenom after it was discontinued by its manufacturer Wyeth in 2006. In emergency cases, the use of 'recently' expired antivenom is recommended by the WHO if no other option is available. This advice seems to be reflected in practice, with reported cases of expired antivenoms being used in several countries, perhaps routinely, when in-date antivenoms were not available, with reported positive outcomes. The most extensive report detailing the use of expired antivenom was a clinical study of 31 patients suffering from systemic effects of envenoming in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. The patients in this study received antivenom which was beyond expiry by 1–6 years, as a result of the unavailability of in-date antivenom within the country at the time.

### A randomized controlled trial and prospective cohort investigating antivenom for red-bellied black snake envenomation [^115A8DJs]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antivenom is first line treatment for snake envenomation worldwide, despite few placebo controlled clinical trials demonstrating effectiveness. We aimed to investigate whether early antivenom in red-bellied black snake (Pseudechis porphyriacus) bites would prevent systemic myotoxicity.

Methods

We undertook a multicentre randomized placebo-controlled trial of antivenom for red-bellied black snake bites with patients recruited from the Australian Snakebite Project (July 2014 to June 2020). In addition, we report all patients with red-bellied black snake bites during the same period, comparing the same outcomes. Patients over 2years of age with definite red-bellied black snake bites and early systemic effects were randomized to receive 50 per cent glucose (placebo) or tiger snake antivenom within 6hours post-bite, or in the cohort group received antivenom determined by the treating clinician. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with myotoxicity (peak creatine kinase activity > 1,000U/L). Secondary outcomes were: area under the curve of total creatine kinase elevation over 48hours, presence of venom post-antivenom, and adverse reactions. We analyzed both the randomized control trial patients and the combination of randomized control trial and cohort patients.

Results

Fifteen patients were recruited to the randomized controlled trial, and a cohort of 68 patients who were not randomized were included in the analysis. After treatment, two of seven patients given placebo had a peak creatine kinase activity > 1,000U/L versus none of the eight given antivenom (difference in favour of antivenom; 29 per cent; 95 per cent confidence interval:-18 per cent to +70 per cent; P = 0.2). The median area under the curve of total creatine kinase elevation over 48hours in patients given placebo was 0U/L*h (interquartile range: 0–124U/L*h), which was not significantly different to those given antivenom: 197U/L*h (interquartile range: 0–66,353U/L*h; P = 0.26). Venom was not detected post-antivenom in six patients with measured venom concentrations given antivenom. Two patients given antivenom had immediate hypersensitivity reactions, one severe anaphylaxis, and another had serum sickness. Combining randomized and not randomized patients, three of 36 (8 per cent) administered antivenom less than 6hours post-bite had a peak creatine kinase activity > 1,000U/L versus 17/47 (36 per cent) patients not receiving antivenom less than 6hours post-bite (difference in favour of antivenom 29 per cent; 95 per cent confidence interval: 8 per cent to 44 per cent; P < 0.004). Overall, 13/36 (36 per cent) patients administered antivenom within 6hours had hypersensitivity reactions, six severe anaphylaxis (17 per cent).

Discussion

We found that early antivenom was effective in red-bellied black snake bites, and only three patients need to be given antivenom within 6hours to prevent myotoxicity in one (number needed to treat = 3). However, one in three patients administered antivenom developed a hypersensitivity reaction, and one in six had severe anaphylaxis. The major limitation of this study was the small number of patients recruited to the randomized controlled trial.

Conclusion

Administration of antivenom in red-bellied black snake envenomation within 6hours post-bite appeared to decrease the proportion of patients with myotoxicity, but a third of patients had adverse reactions.

### Research into the causes of venom-induced mortality and morbidity identifies new therapeutic opportunities [^114MPTzA]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

Snakebite primarily affects rural subsistent farming populations in underdeveloped and developing nations. The annual number of deaths (100,000) and physical disabilities (400,000) of snakebite victims is a societal tragedy that poses a significant added socioeconomic burden to the society. Antivenom therapy is the treatment of choice for snakebite but, as testified by the continuing high rates of mortality and morbidity, too many rural tropical snakebite victims fail to access effective treatment. Here, we advocate for more basic research to better understand the pathogenesis of systemic and local envenoming and describe how research outcomes can identify novel snakebite therapeutic strategies with the potential to be more accessible and affordable to victims than current treatment.

### Randomized controlled trial of intravenous antivenom versus placebo for latrodectism: the second redback antivenom evaluation (RAVE-II) study [^114xo48g]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Latrodectism is the most important spider envenomation syndrome worldwide. There remains considerable controversy over antivenom treatment. We aimed to investigate whether antivenom resulted in resolution of pain and systemic effects in patients with latrodectism who received standardized analgesia.

Methods

In a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of redback spider antivenom for latrodectism, 224 patients (> 7 years) with a redback spider bite and severe pain, with or without systemic effects, were randomized to receive normal saline solution (placebo) or antivenom after receiving standardized analgesia. The primary outcome was a clinically significant reduction in pain 2 hours after trial medication compared with baseline. A second primary outcome for the subgroup with systemic features of envenomation was resolution of systemic features at 2 hours. Secondary outcomes were improved pain at 4 and 24 hours, resolution of systemic features at 4 hours, administration of opioid analgesics or unblinded antivenom after 2 hours, and adverse reactions.

Results

Two hours after treatment, 26 of 112 patients (23%) from the placebo arm had a clinically significant improvement in pain versus 38 of 112 (34%) from the antivenom arm (difference in favor of antivenom 10.7%; 95% confidence interval -1.1% to 22.6%; p = 0.10). Systemic effects resolved after 2 hours in 9 of 41 patients (22%) in the placebo arm and 9 of 35 (26%) in the antivenom arm (difference 3.8%; 95% confidence interval -15% to 23%; p = 0.79). There was no significant difference in any secondary outcome between antivenom and placebo. Acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 4 of 112 patients (3.6%) receiving antivenom.

Conclusion

The addition of antivenom to standardized analgesia in patients with latrodectism did not significantly improve pain or systemic effects.

### Clinical challenges, controversies, and regional strategies in snakebite care in India [^1118T12g]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Antivenom efficacy and development of region-specific protocols for effective snakebite management

The effectiveness of antivenoms, particularly polyvalent formulations like the Indian polyvalent antivenom (IPAV), has been a focal point of debate in snakebite management due to its variable efficacy across different snake species and geographic regions. Standardised treatment protocols for snakebites often fail to account for the regional differences in snake species, venom composition, and healthcare infrastructure. There is a need for region-specific antivenoms, and updated treatment guidelines tailored to the local snake fauna.

Rajasthan, with its desert-adapted snakes, and the North East, where haemotoxic Big Four species are rare, require different management approaches compared to other parts of India. Physicians' experience and clinical observations both suggest that, the Indian polyvalent antivenom (IPAV) is ineffective against H. hypnale venom. However, in a recent survey, 43% of respondents indicated they would administer the currently available polyvalent antivenom for snakebites positively identified as H. hypnale. They based their decision on "relying on a syndromic approach rather than species identification", "lacking confidence in accurately identifying the snake", and "concern about medicolegal implications of withholding antivenom from patients showing signs of envenomation". The panel emphasised that administering Indian polyvalent antivenom (IPAV) for H. hypnale envenomation could cause more harm than benefit, particularly when the risks of adverse reactions outweigh any potential, albeit unsupported, benefits of IPAV in non-Big Four species (Table 1). Standardised treatment protocols for snakebites often fail to account for the regional differences in snake species, venom composition, and healthcare infrastructure. There is a need for region-specific antivenoms, and updated treatment guidelines tailored to the local snake fauna.

### A controlled clinical trial of a novel antivenom in patients envenomed by bungarus multicinctus [^1151FH94]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

In northern Vietnam, a majority of severely envenomed patients are bitten by Bungarus multicinctus. Hitherto, these victims have received supportive care only. The aims of this study were to assess the possible efficacy and side effects of a new antivenom. This trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00811239) was performed during 2004–2006 at an ICU in Hanoi. For ethical reasons, the study was not randomized. All patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria during 2004–2005 were prospectively enrolled, carefully recorded, and treated with optimal supportive therapy (control group). The patients who entered the study 2006 were treated with antivenom in addition to supportive care (antivenom group). The inclusion criteria were: envenomation by B. multicinctus, presence of systemic envenomation, and (during 2006) provision of written informed consent. Predefined endpoints were number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, duration of muscle paralysis, and number of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Eighty-one patients were included, 54 during 2004–2005 and 27 during 2006. Baseline characteristics were similar in the groups. The antivenom-group patients had a shorter duration of muscle paralysis of the limbs (p < 0.001), of the diaphragm (p < 0.001), and of ptosis (p < 0.001). The duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay were shorter in the antivenom group (p < 0.001). The rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia was lower in the antivenom group (p < 0.02). However, the relative number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation was not reduced in the antivenom group. The rate of adverse reactions to the antivenom was 7.4%. A favorable efficacy and acceptable safety of this antivenom were demonstrated.

### Recurrence phenomena after immunoglobulin therapy for snake envenomations: part 2. guidelines for clinical management with crotaline fab antivenom [^113fXvGk]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Recurrent local and coagulopathic effects (worsening after clinical improvement) have been described after treatment with Fab antivenom for envenomation by North American crotaline snakes. Although similar phenomena have been described previously in snakebite, few studies have examined recurrence or its management. Recurrence is consistent with known venom and antivenom kinetics and dynamics. The clinical significance of late coagulopathy after snakebite is uncertain, but clinically significant bleeding is a possibility. Prevention and treatment of recurrence with Fab antivenom require repeated dosing for at least 18 hours, with close monitoring of at-risk patients in the follow-up period. Duration of therapy depends on individual risk factors and coagulation response.

### A therapeutic combination of two small molecule toxin inhibitors provides broad preclinical efficacy against viper snakebite [^113752pb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Snake venoms are complex mixtures of numerous proteins and peptides and extensive interspecific variation in venom composition poses major challenges for the development of generic (i.e. pancontinental) snakebite treatments. Current therapies, known as antivenoms, consist of polyclonal immunoglobulins purified from the plasma/serum of large animals (e.g. equines, ovines) hyperimmunized with snake venoms. Because of the specificity of the resulting immunoglobulins towards the toxins present in the venoms used in manufacture, antivenoms typically have limited efficacy against envenoming by different snake species. Consequently, distinct antivenom products are produced (> 45 manufacturers worldwide) to treat envenoming by numerous snake species found in different parts of the world, resulting in a highly fragmented drug market, issues with affordability, and a lack of sustainability. Other limitations with current antivenom include the following: (i) poor dose efficacy, as the majority (~80–90%) of their immunoglobulins do not bind venom toxins, (ii) high incidences of adverse reactions due to the administration of large doses of foreign immunoglobulins, (iii) the requirement for intravenous delivery in a healthcare facility, and (iv) reliance on cold chain transport and storage. In addition, many rural snakebite victims suffer major delays in accessing healthcare facilities following a bite, if they choose to attend at all, as evidenced by estimates suggesting that 75% of snakebite deaths occur outside of a hospital setting. Cumulatively, these limitations identify an urgent and compelling need to develop cross-generically efficacious, stable and affordable, prehospital treatments as an effective means to considerably decrease snakebite mortality and morbidity.

### The timing is right to end snakebite deaths in south Asia [^11248KSw]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Suboptimal care

Rural health facilities in many parts of South Asia lack the infrastructure and manpower to provide timely and effective treatment. Supportive care such as mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and blood transfusion is critical in the management of patients with complications such as respiratory paralysis, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy induced haemorrhage. Antivenom therapy alone is insufficient in their care. Most rural health centres and hospitals lack critical care facilities and thereby refer patients elsewhere, resulting in treatment delays.

Insufficient knowledge and experience among healthcare providers is also responsible for inadequate treatment. Studies among doctors in primary care and health workers in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan show gaps in ability to recognise systemic envenoming and administer antivenom. This may be because snakebite management is not given enough focus in the medical curriculum. Health workers in remote settings are also reluctant to treat snakebite because of apprehension about managing antivenom associated adverse reactions. This apprehension is not entirely misplaced since up to 80% of those treated develop one or more antivenom associated adverse effects such as anaphylaxis, pyrogenic reactions, or serum sickness.

Most South Asian countries have well formulated snakebite treatment protocols for low resource settings with a tiered referral approach. Yet these are poorly implemented with limited penetration in primary health centres. These protocols are not standardised and numerous conflicting versions exist with differing indications for antivenom administration and dosing.

### Management of envenomations during pregnancy [^114JJc9v]. Clinical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Envenomations during pregnancy pose all the problems of envenomation in the nonpregnant state with additional complexity related to maternal physiologic changes, medication use during pregnancy, and the well-being of the fetus.

Objective

We review the obstetric literature and management options available to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality while limiting adverse obstetric outcomes after envenomation in pregnancy.

Methods

In January 2012, we searched the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medline/PubMed, Toxline, Reprotox, Google Scholar and Micromedex databases, core surgery and internal medicine textbooks, and references of retrieved articles for the years 1966 through 2011. Search terms included "envenomation in pregnancy", "stings in pregnancy", "antivenom use in pregnancy", "anaphylaxis in pregnancy", and variants of these with known venomous animals. Reference lists generated further case reports and articles. We included English language articles and abstracts. Levels of Evidence (LOE) for the reports cited and Grades of Recommendations (GOR) based on LOE for our recommendations use the National Guidelines Clearinghouse metric of the US DHHS.

Results

Recommendations for the management of envenomation in pregnancy are guided primarily by studies on nonpregnant persons and case reports of pregnancy. Clinically significant envenomations in pregnancy are reported for snakes, spiders, scorpions, jellyfish, and hymenoptera (bees, wasps, hornets, and ants). Adverse obstetric outcomes including miscarriage, preterm birth, placental abruption, and stillbirth are associated with envenomation in pregnancy. The limited available literature suggests that adverse outcomes are primarily related to venom effects on the mother. Optimization of maternal health such as management of anaphylaxis and antivenom administration is likely the best approach to improve fetal outcomes despite potential risks to the fetus of medication administration during pregnancy. Obstetric evaluation and fetal monitoring are imperative in cases of severe envenomation.

Conclusion

The medical literature regarding envenomation in pregnancy includes primarily retrospective reviews and case series. The limited available evidence suggests that optimal management includes a venom-specific approach, including supportive care, antivenom administration in appropriate cases, treatment of anaphylaxis if present, and fetal assessment. The current available evidence suggests that antivenom use is safe in pregnancy and that what is good for the mother is good for the fetus. Further research is needed to clarify the optimal management schema for envenomation in pregnancy.

### Antivenom for critically ill children with neurotoxicity from scorpion stings [^113pRXf8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Clinically significant scorpion envenomation by Centruroides sculpturatus produces a dramatic neuromotor syndrome and respiratory insufficiency that often necessitate intensive supportive care. We hypothesized that a scorpion-specific F(ab')(2) antivenom would promptly resolve clinical symptoms in children with this syndrome.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind study, the efficacy of scorpion-specific F(ab')(2) antivenom, as compared with placebo, was assessed in 15 children 6 months to 18 years of age who were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit with clinically significant signs of scorpion envenomation. The primary end point was the resolution of the clinical syndrome within 4 hours after administration of the study drug. Secondary end points included the total dose of concomitant midazolam for sedation and quantitative plasma venom levels, before and after treatment.

Results

The clinical syndrome resolved more rapidly among recipients of the antivenom than among recipients of placebo, with a resolution of symptoms in all eight antivenom recipients versus one of seven placebo recipients within 4 hours after treatment (P = 0.001). More midazolam was administered in the placebo recipients than in the antivenom recipients (mean cumulative dose, 4.61 vs. 0.07 mg per kilogram of body weight; P = 0.01). Plasma venom concentrations were undetectable in all eight antivenom recipients but in only one placebo recipient 1 hour after treatment (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Among critically ill children with neurotoxic effects of scorpion envenomation, intravenous administration of scorpion-specific F(ab')(2) antivenom resolved the clinical syndrome within 4 hours, reduced the need for concomitant sedation with midazolam, and reduced the levels of circulating unbound venom. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00685230.)

### Total croFab and anavip antivenom vial administration in US rattlesnake envenomations: 2019–2021 [^115nbHw7]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The severity of envenomation was not assessed in this analysis due to the lack of a standardized tool in the NASBR. The NASBR has inherent limitations due to the voluntary reporting of data to the ToxIC registry. Medical toxicologists submitting data to the NASBR are primarily located at academic tertiary care centers, which may not reflect how snakebites are managed in the community setting. Furthermore, some NASBR sites receive a disproportionally higher number of envenomations, which may skew the data from those sites' nuanced practice patterns.

Most NASBR patients are seen at the time of presentation, and follow-up is often done outside of medical toxicology clinics. Lack of follow-up data limits the endpoints that can be analyzed using this data and adverse events, recurrence and other patient outcomes could not be assessed. While unlikely, it is possible that venom effect recurrence was not captured, and this may have resulted in additional antivenom administration in either group.

Additional investigation is warranted for patients who received both antivenoms as NASBR does not contain information on why the change in antivenom occurred and observations may be confounded by severity, occurrence of adverse reactions, delays in treatment, and transfers.

### Meta-analysis of controlled studies on immunotherapy in severe scorpion envenomation [^1174HUCk]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite conflicting evidence, specific serotherapy is recommended for scorpion envenomation.

Methods

A meta-analysis of prospective or observational controlled studies, comparing intravenous scorpion antivenin (SAV) with control, was performed. Binary outcomes are reported as risk difference for clinical improvement and mortality rates. Analysis was performed both for the whole number of included studies and for two subgroups (set up according to the geographic origin of scorpions).

Results

Nine studies (four randomised controlled trials (RCTs), five observational) enrolling 687 patients were identified. Six dealt with Old World scorpions and three originated from Arizona. Overall, the rate of clinical improvement was similar in SAV treated and untreated patients (risk difference = 0.22, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.79; p = 0.45 for effect). Subgroup analysis showed favourable effects of SAV in the Arizona scorpion envenomation (risk difference = 0.53; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.91; p < 0.001), and non-significant unfavourable effects in Old World scorpion envenomation (risk difference = -0.05; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.18; p = 0.65; p = 0.003 for z-value, indicating a true heterogeneity of treatment effects). In Old World scorpion envenomation, there was no statistical difference in the risk of death in SAV treated and untreated scorpion envenomated patients (risk difference = 0.007, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; p = 0.6 for effect). Overall, administration of scorpion antivenin was associated with a reduction by 13 h in the mean time of symptom resolution (95% CI -17 to -9; p < 0.0001). Serious adverse events were reported at a rate of 1–2% while minor adverse events occurred in up to 40% of patients.

Conclusions

SAV should not be administered in Old World scorpion envenomation until its efficacy is established by an appropriately designed RCT. In the Arizona scorpion sting, SAV hastens the recovery process.

### Moderate-to-severeenvenoming requiring viperaTAb antivenom therapy in the UK [^1172Bb8M]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bites by the European adder (Vipera berus) in the UK are uncommon but potentially life threatening, and can be associated with marked limb swelling and disability. Following an interruption in Zagreb Imunološki zavod antivenom supply around 2012, the UK changed its national choice of antivenom for Vipera berus to ViperaTAb, an ovine Fab monospecific antivenom. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we established an audit to review its use in clinical practice.

Methods

A prospective audit of ViperaTAb use was conducted from March 2016 until November 2020 by the UK National Poison Information Service (NPIS). Users of the NPIS online toxicology database, TOXBASE, considering the use of antivenom for V. berus envenoming were invited to discuss the case with the on-call clinical toxicology consultant. Information was collected prospectively on indications, administration, adverse reactions and outcome of patients administered ViperaTAb antivenom.

Results

One hundred and seventy patients were administered ViperaTAb antivenom over five years. One hundred and thirty-two were adults and 38 children (median age and range: 38, 2–87years). Bites occurred across the UK, but most commonly in coastal regions of Wales and of South-West and East England. Median time to presentation was 2.1 (IQR 1.5–4.0) h and to antivenom administration from presentation was 2.0 (IQR 0.9–3.6) h. A minority of patients presented to hospital more than 12h after being bitten (n = 19, 11.2%) or received antivenom more than 12h after presenting to hospital (n = 17, 10.0%). Features of systemic envenoming were present in 64/170 (37.6%) patients, including 23 (13.5%) with anaphylaxis and 26 (15.3%) with hypotension (nine with both). Clinician assessment considered the initial antivenom to have been effective in 122/169 (72.2%) patients. Repeated dosing was common, occurring in 55/169 (32.5%), predominantly due to persisting or worsening local effects (46/51, 90.2%). There were three cases of probable early adverse reaction. No deaths occurred during the study. Complications of envenoming were rare but included four patients that underwent surgery, three patients each with acute kidney injury, mild coagulopathy, or thrombocytopenia (one severe). The median duration of hospital stay was 43.7 (IQR 22.5–66.5) h, longer for children than adults (52.5 vs 41.3h).

Conclusion

ViperaTAb antivenom appears to be effective and safe and should be administered as soon as possible for patients meeting clinical criteria. Patients require close observation following antivenom to detect adverse reactions and progression or recurrence of envenoming. Close collaboration with expert NPIS consultant advice can help optimise antivenom timing, ensure repeated dosing is given appropriately, and avoid unnecessary surgical intervention. All hospitals, particularly those located in areas of relatively high incidence, should stock sufficient antivenom available at short notice, 24h a day.

### Acute adverse events associated with the administration of crotalidae polyvalent immune fAb antivenom within the north American snakebite registry [^111AR19d]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Background: Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (Fab Antivenom) is the primary Viperid antivenom used in the United States since 2000. Adverse event data associated with its use are limited. The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of acute adverse events associated with the use of Fab antivenom. Methods: The American College of Medical Toxicology's Toxicology Investigators Consortium maintains a prospective case registry of poisoned and envenomated patients managed by medical toxicologists at the bedside. This registry includes the North American Snakebite sub-registry. We performed a review of 438 cases entered into the Snakebite sub-registry. Results: A total of 373 (85.2%) received at least one vial of Fab Antivenom. Forty percent were children. Adverse events occurred in 10 patients (2.7%) of whom six were adults. Rash was the most common adverse event. More severe adverse events (hypotension, bronchospasm, and/or angioedema) occurred in four (1.1%) patients. Prophylaxis was administered prior to Fab antivenom in 4.0%. Eight patients received various treatments for their adverse events. Neither the initial number of Fab antivenom vials, atopic history, nor prior envenomation correlated with the prevalence of adverse events. Discussion: This prevalence of adverse events was lower than in previous studies and in a meta-analysis of 11 studies. The types of adverse events and treatments used are consistent with those in previous reports. There were no prior reports of prophylaxis use with which to compare. Conclusion: The prevalence of Fab antivenom adverse events in the North American Snakebite Registry was 2.7%.

### Clinical presentations, treatments, and outcomes of non-native snake envenomations in the United States reported in the north American snakebite registry [^116yJtR2]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-native snake envenomations in the United States are uncommon with much unknown about a patient's presenting signs and symptoms. Antivenoms for non-native snake envenomations are not typically available in hospital pharmacies which may limit their administration. What are the clinical presentations, treatments, and outcomes of non-native snake envenomation cases reported to the North American Snakebite Registry (NASBR) of the Toxicology Investigators Consortium (ToxIC)?

Methods

This is a descriptive review of all non-native envenomations reported to the NASBR from 2013 to March 2022. Data abstracted included snake species, patient history, clinical signs, diagnostics, treatment (including antivenom usage), follow-up, and final outcome.

Results

We identified 19 non-native snake envenomations resulting from encounters with eleven different species, eight of which belonged to the Viperidae family. The most common presenting symptoms were edema (18 patients), ecchymosis (seven patients), and necrosis (six patients). Systemic effects and hematologic abnormalities were less common. The most common treatments were extremity elevation and analgesia, with two patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Ten patients received antivenom. No patients died. Three patients had loss of mobility in a digit at the last follow-up visit. One patient had permanent tissue loss of a small area on a finger.

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that non-native snake envenomations in the United States frequently cause local soft tissue effects and less frequently cause systemic or hematologic effects. Most patients received antivenom, although several patients envenomated by snakes for which a specific antivenom exists did not receive any. Sequelae at the last follow-up of such encounters consisted of local mobility deficits.

### Comparing clinical outcomes between two scorpion antivenom dosing strategies in children [^116GURAv]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives: The clinical course from scorpion envenomation can range from mild to life threatening, particularly in younger children. The F(ab') 2 antivenom currently available in the United States is extremely effective for countering the neurotoxic effects but extremely expensive. This dose comparison study assesses clinical outcomes between two antivenom dosing strategies. Methods: This was a retrospective review of medical records of pediatric patients treated in the pediatric emergency department (PED) with grade 3 or 4 envenomation requiring antivenom. Treatments rendered at two time-periods were assessed: 3-vial first dose (May 2007-August 2011) and single-vial-serial dose (September 2011-June 2016). Primary outcome was the proportion of patients who achieved complete symptom resolution within 4h post antivenom dose. Results: One hundred and forty-one children met entry criteria, 76 in 3-vial first dose and 65 in single-vial-serial dose. Median age was 4 years (Q1:2-Q3:7), 56.2% males. There were no demographic and differences in clinical severity at presentation between the two dosing groups. All children, irrespective of group assignment, achieved the primary end-point of symptom resolution within 4h. Median time to complete resolution of symptoms was longer for the single-vial-serial-dosing group vs. the 3-vial-first dose group [90min (Q1:63-Q3:124) vs. 62min (Q1:40-Q3:90), p = 0.002]. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding clinical outcomes including PED discharge, intubation, hospitalization, or death. Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis, children in both single-vial-serial dosing group, and 3-vial-full dosing group, achieved symptom resolution within 4h of initiating therapy with no additional complications or adverse clinical outcomes.

### Evaluation of antivenom therapy for vipera palaestinae bites in children: experience of two large, tertiary care pediatric hospitals [^113ckpSU]. Clinical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antivenom has been successfully used to treat systemic and progressive, local manifestations of envenomation inflicted by Vipera (V.) palaestinae, the most common venomous snake in Israel. The objective of this study was to evaluate the fixed dose V. palaestinae monovalent (equine) immunoglobulin G antivenom used in two pediatric emergency departments. In particular, we wanted to assess the need for repeated antivenom administration and the rate of adverse antivenom effects in children.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed for all children admitted with definite or probable signs of V. palaestinae envenomation to Chaim Sheba Medical Center and Kaplan Medical Center between 1 March 2008 and 1 March 2014. Extracted data included: age, location of bite, time to hospital arrival, time to antivenom administration if indicated, outcomes, and complications of the envenomation and adverse effects to the antivenom.

Results

57 patients met inclusion criteria; they ranged from 1 to 17 years in age and median age was 9.5 years. Clinical manifestations were evident in 55 (96.4%) of victims: 18 presented with minimal local signs and 37 showed marked progressive, local features (rapidly progressing edema) and signs of systemic envenomation: tachycardia (20), vomiting (17), abdominal pain (11) and hypotension (6). Two patients developed compartment syndrome and underwent surgical decompression (both received only a loading dose of antivenom with no subsequent maintenance dose). One patient developed thrombocytopenia and three patients presented with mild coagulopathy. Antivenom was administered to 25 (42%) children. Indications for antivenom administration included moderate to severe local signs (19 patients) and systemic signs (6 patients). None of these patients developed adverse reactions, serum sickness, or other side effects to the antivenom. One patient received a single additional 30mL dose of antivenom, due to hypotension and syncope, with good response.

Conclusions

In children, 50ml dosing of V. palaestinae antivenom is efficacious and safe for the treatment of systemic and progressive local manifestations of envenomation by V. palaestinae.

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (mesobuthus tamulus) sting: randomised open label clinical trial [^1135jnyv]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Strength and limitations

We are not aware of any previous randomised controlled trials comparing the usefulness of mono-specific F(Ab)2 scorpion antivenom plus prazosin against prazosin alone in severe scorpion sting by Mesobuthus tamulus. The number of cases of envenoming peaks in the hot months of the year, May and October (table 1) because of increased agricultural activities. Men are more prone to these accidents owing to greater environmental exposure (table 2). Twenty eight per cent of the study population were younger than 18 years. Our findings in relation to a substantial number of patients with grade 2 envenomation included in this study support a firm conclusion about the efficacy of antivenom plus prazosin in victims reporting within six hours of sting with systemic involvement. Cases of grade 3 and grade 4 envenomation were not included in the present study, as required by the ethics committee. Large randomised trials including victims with grade 3 and 4 envenomation will be needed to demonstrate the effect of antivenom and prazosin on end points such as survival.

This study was not blinded and the primary outcome was evaluated by study investigators, albeit investigators with extensive clinical experience with scorpion sting. The determination of the point at which symptoms disappeared was thus subjective, but we think that this was a clinically relevant and pragmatic way of judging the effects of treatment in a trial carried out in challenging circumstances with restricted resources in a rural setting in India.

Scorpion venom evokes transient parasympathetic and prolonged sympathetic stimulation. The presence of clinical signs and symptoms of excess acetylcholine indicate the presence of active free circulating venom in the blood, which can be neutralised by antivenom. The sympathetic signs suggest after effects of venom on the sympathetic system, which are unresponsive to antivenom but reversible with prazosin. Moreover morbidity and mortality due to envenoming are caused by sympathetic overstimulation and not parasympathetic stimulation. Thus, early administration of antivenom in a stage of acetylcholine excess and prazosin to counteract the sympathetic and metabolic effects may be synergistic in enhancing recovery. On arrival, absence of sweating and salivation that was present before reporting to the hospital suggests that venom has already reached the target site of action and is not accessible to the administration of antivenom, as in our patient who deteriorated to grade 4.

### Total croFab and anavip antivenom vial administration in US rattlesnake envenomations: 2019–2021 [^1117cC2n]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

While the mean number of total vials of antivenom was significantly different between the CroFab (10.19) and Anavip (19.98) groups (p < 0.0001), it is essential to note that the dosing regimens are different. The mean doses for each group are similar to other literature. A 2011 study of CroFab used a median of 9 vials to achieve control, a study in 2011 found similar mean doses for CroFab, and the 2015 Phase 3 trial of Anavip used a mean of 16.1 vials. Our data demonstrate that Crofab had fewer median administrations than Anavip (1 vs 2), similar to a prior single-center study. Twice as many patients in the CroFab group received only a single administration course (61% versus 31%) compared to the Anavip group (Fig. 2). The reasons for additional administrations in the Anavip group are unclear and unexpected given the longer half-life of the F(ab')2 product. Possible explanations include the administration of an insufficient neutralizing antivenom dose, lack of venom component match to North American snake venom in the Anavip product, or other treatment considerations not adequately captured by NASBR. One case series demonstrated that more patients were treated effectively for neurotoxicity with CroFab compared to Anavip, although only 7 patients were included in that series. Clinical response frequently drives redosing decisions and some venom effects may respond better to one product over the other. Scheduled maintenance doses were used in 47% of patients that received CroFab alone in our dataset. It is unclear if those patients would have needed additional doses if no maintenance dosing was given. A prior study illustrated that scheduled maintenance dosing versus re-dosing as needed resulted in the same median total number of vials needed to treat the patient. The benefit of scheduled maintenance dosing for limiting delayed thrombocytopenia remains unclear. Furthermore, the rate of hematologic recurrence varies greatly among rattlesnake species around the United States.

### Preclinical evaluation of small molecule inhibitors as early intervention therapeutics against russell's viper envenoming in India [^112dZB76]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Snakebites are problematic in many developing regions, including India, where over half of global snakebite deaths occur. Antivenoms are currently the only licensed treatment for snakebites. However, their use causes several challenges, most notably geographical limitations in efficacy and adverse side effects. Therefore, therapeutic alternatives are urgently needed. Recently, several studies have evaluated small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) and highlighted their promise as safe and effective alternatives to antivenoms. We investigate their potential use against Indian snakes, particularly Russell's viper (Daboia russelii), responsible for over half of India's snakebite cases.

Methods

Here, we explored the effectiveness of two phase-2-approved SMIs in countering the diverse and variable toxicities of D. russelii from across India.

Results

The phospholipase inhibitor varespladib and the metalloproteinase inhibitor marimastat, individually or in combination, effectively counter the toxicities of D. russelii venoms in vitro. Specific drug efficacy varies across geographic regions. These SMIs and their combination prevent lethality caused by the pan-Indian D. russelii, even in rescue experiments where treatment is delayed, in mice.

Conclusions

Our findings support the potential use of SMIs as effective, affordable, and accessible future therapies for treating bites from the world's most medically important snake species.

### Symptoms and management of painful progressive swelling in eswatini snakebite patients: a prospective observational study [^111DCUbP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, clinicians adhered to the starting dose recommended by the Eswatini National Snakebite Management Guidelines for bites by N. mossambica, H. hemachatus, and B. arietans in 56% of cases. However, in > 40% of cases, fewer than five vials were administered during the first round. This may be related to a combination of factors. Firstly, treating physicians may have given less antivenom for milder cases, particularly given that SAIMR Polyvalent is a costly product with a limited supply. This is consistent with the finding that only 10 of the initial 70 patients receiving antivenom were given additional doses. Secondly, SAIMR Polyvalent has frequently been associated with adverse reactions of varying severity, – which our results corroborate. Clinicians may assume a dose-dependent relationship regarding such reactions, prompting them to administer smaller quantities initially and escalate therapy as needed and once deemed safe or potentially halt antivenom infusion after the occurrence of adverse reactions. The high rate of observed adverse reactions to SAIMR Polyvalent and other antivenoms in general, emphasizes 1) the need to define clear indications for when antivenom is beneficial, 2) the necessity of investigating the etiology and pathophysiological nature of these reactions, and 3) the urgent need to develop safer antivenoms or novel therapies that are safe to use, particularly in an out-of-hospital setting.

Strengths and limitations.

The data gathered from 125 patients yield important insights concerning the demographics and clinical features of patients with painful progressive swelling after a snakebite. Several limitations of this study should be mentioned. It was impossible to reliably identify the vast majority of biting snakes — a challenge most studies in the field face. –, Unfortunately, we could not correlate the frequency and quantity of antivenom administration with up-to-date data on antivenom stocks at the facility level because this information was not gathered. Importantly, in the absence of a randomized approach, it is difficult to determine if antivenom slowed, halted, or prevented the occurrence of necrosis or swelling in some patients. Differences in the severity of envenoming between the antivenom and no-antivenom groups could imply indication bias because clinicians may have selected more severely envenomed patients for treatment with antivenom. Finally, the observational study design precludes us from drawing conclusions regarding causality.

### Clinical effects and antivenom use for snake bite victims treated at three US hospitals in Afghanistan [^112iHsT7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Annually, more than 100,000 US and international military and civilian personnel work in Afghanistan within terrain harboring venomous snakes. Current literature insufficiently supports Afghan antivenom treatment and stocking guidelines. We report the clinical course and treatments for snakebite victims presenting to US military hospitals in Afghanistan.

Methods

All snakebite victims presenting to 3 US military emergency departments between July 2010 and August 2011 in northern and southern Afghanistan were examined via chart review. Case information included patient demographics, snake description, bite details and complications, laboratory results, antivenom use and adverse effects, procedures performed, and hospital course.

Results

Of 17 cases, median patient age was 20 years (interquartile range [IQR], 12–30), 16 were male, and 82% were Afghans. All bites were to an extremity, and median time to care was 2.8 hours (IQR, 2–5.8). On arrival, 8 had tachycardia and none had hypotension or hypoxia. A viper was implicated in 5 cases. Ten cases received at least 1 dose of polyvalent antivenom, most commonly for coagulopathy, without adverse effects. Six received additional antivenom, 6 had an international normalized ratio (INR) > 10, and none developed delayed coagulopathy. Three received blood transfusions. Hospital stay ranged from 1 to 4 days. None required vasopressors, fasciotomy, or other surgery, and none died. All had resolution of marked coagulopathies and improved swelling and pain on discharge.

Conclusions

We report the largest series of snake envenomations treated by US physicians in Afghanistan. Antivenom was tolerated well with improvement of coagulopathy and symptoms. All patients survived with minimal advanced interventions other than blood transfusion.

### Short-term outcomes after fab antivenom therapy for severe crotaline snakebite [^111TaHbz]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

We seek to determine the short-term outcomes associated with the use of Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab (ovine) (CroFab; FabAV) therapy for severe crotaline snake envenomation and to better define the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions associated with FabAV use.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter observational case series study of patients who received FabAV at 17 US hospitals in 2002 to 2004. A 7-point score incorporating local, systemic, and hematologic venom effects was used to grade envenomation severity before and after FabAV therapy. The primary outcome for response to therapy was the change in overall envenomation severity after FabAV administration. The primary safety outcomes were the rates of immediate hypersensitivity reactions and serum sickness.

Results

The outcome-evaluable population included 209 patients, of whom 28 had severe envenomation. All severely envenomated patients improved after receiving FabAV. The median severity scores of severely envenomated patients were 5 (interquartile range [IQR] 5 to 5) before FabAV, 1 (IQR 1 to 2) at the last FabAV loading dose, and 1 (IQR 0 to 1) at the last clinical observation. The proportion of patients with progressive pain, progressive swelling, cardiovascular effects, respiratory effects, neurologic effects, gastrointestinal effects, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia all improved after FabAV therapy. The safety population included 247 patients. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 6.1% (95% confidence interval 3.4% to 9.8%) of patients. Serum sickness was reported in 5% (95% confidence interval 0.6% to 17%) of patients with a minimum of 6 days of follow-up after the last dose of FabAV.

Conclusion

FabAV therapy is associated with clinical improvement in severe crotaline snake envenomation. Immediate hypersensitivity and serum sickness rates may be less than described in the FabAV prescribing information.

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (mesobuthus tamulus) sting: randomised open label clinical trial [^113Pd8vs]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Scorpion sting can pose a life threatening acute medical emergency and is a neglected public health problem in tropical and sub-tropical countries, especially in North Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and India. Mesobuthus tamulus, an Indian red scorpion, is the most lethal species of the Buthidae family in India. Its venom delays the closing of neuronal sodium channels, resulting in "autonomic storm" owing to sudden pouring of endogenous catecholamine into the circulation. Autonomic storm is characterised by transient parasympathetic and prolonged sympathetic stimulation. Similar cardiovascular manifestations are reported in different species of scorpions. Morbidity and mortality due to scorpion sting result from acute refractory pulmonary oedema, cardiogenic shock, and multiorgan failure. Opinions differ about the correct treatment for scorpion sting. In the past various regimens, including a lytic cocktail, insulin, atropine, β blocker, nifedipine, and captoprilhave failed to reduce morbidity and mortality, but since the advent of the α 1 blocker prazosin the fatality rate has been reduced to 1%.

Scorpion antivenom is a specific antidote capable of neutralising circulating venom toxins if administered soon after sting; it is widely used and believed to be effective by experienced doctors in Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Tunisia, and Iran. Serotherapy has been a matter of debate and controversy during the past decade. Whether the antivenom can reverse the cardiac pathophysiological effects of scorpion venom is uncertain. Several studies have shown that antivenom does not alleviate haemodynamic changes or cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, or prevent deathand the outcome was the same for victims treated with antivenom and those treated without antivenom. De Rezende and colleagues found that although venom antigen in plasma from people who had been stung by a scorpion was not detected one hour after antivenom therapy, and pain and agitation disappeared within a few hours, patients with pulmonary oedema recovered only 48 hours after serotherapy.

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (mesobuthus tamulus) sting: randomised open label clinical trial [^112YATpr]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective Envenomation by Mesobuthus tamulus scorpion sting can result in serious cardiovascular effects. Scorpion antivenom is a specific treatment for scorpion sting. Evidence for the benefit of scorpion antivenom and its efficacy compared with that of commonly used vasodilators, such as prazosin, is scarce. We assessed the efficacy of prazosin combined with scorpion antivenom, compared with prazosin alone, in individuals with autonomic storm caused by scorpion sting.

Design Prospective, open label randomised controlled trial.

Setting General hospital inpatients (Bawaskar Hospital and Research Centre Mahad Dist-Raigad Maharashtra, India).

Participants Seventy patients with grade 2 scorpion envenomation, older than six months, with no cardiorespiratory or central nervous system abnormalities.

Intervention Scorpion antivenom plus prazosin (n = 35) or prazosin alone (n = 35) assigned by block randomisation. Treatment was not masked. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Main outcome measures The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving resolution of the clinical syndrome (sweating, salivation, cool extremities, priapism, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia) 10 hours after administration of study drugs. Secondary end points were time required for complete resolution of clinical syndrome, prevention of deterioration to higher grade, doses of prazosin required overall and within 10 hours, and adverse events. The study protocol was approved by the independent ethics committee of Mumbai.

Results Mean (SD) recovery times in hours for the prazosin plus scorpion antivenom group compared with the prazosin alone groups were: sweating 3 (1.1) v 6.6 (2.6); salivation 1.9 (0.9) v 3 (1.9); priapism 4.7 (1.5) v 9.4 (1.5). Mean (SD) doses of prazosin in the groups were 2 (2.3) and 4 (3.5), respectively. 32 patients (91.4%, 95% confidence interval 76.9% to 97.8%) in the prazosin plus antivenom group showed complete resolution of the clinical syndrome within 10 hours of administration of treatment compared with eight patients in the prazosin group (22.9%, 11.8% to 39.3%). Patients from the antivenom plus prazosin group recovered earlier (mean 8 hours, 95% CI 6.5 to 9.5) than those in the control group (17.7 hours, 15.4 to 19.9; mean difference −9.7 hours, −6.9 to −12.4). The number of patients whose condition deteriorated to a higher grade was similar in both groups (antivenom plus prazosin four of 35, prazosin alone five of 35). Hypotension was reported in fewer patients in the antivenom plus prazosin group (12 of 35, 34.3%) than in the prazosin group (19 of 35, 54.3%), but the difference was not statistically significant. No difference was noted in change in blood pressure and pulse rate over time between two groups.

Conclusion Recovery from scorpion sting is hastened by simultaneous administration of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone.

### Managing snakebite [^1168sV3K]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

What are the clinical effects of snakebite?

Not all people with a snakebite have clinical symptoms. Often bites are by non-venomous snakes. Sometimes venomous snakes do not inject venom during a bite.

Clinical manifestations vary between species of snakes (see box 1). Some toxins in venom exert local effects such as swelling, blistering, bruising, and necrosis at the bite site. Other toxins can be distributed systemically through lymphatics and blood vessels and act at distant sites. See supplementary text for an overview of important sites and pathophysiology of venom-toxin action. Common systemic effects include bleeding, paralysis, generalised rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury. Venom injection deep into a limb can cause tissue swelling in the tightly constrained space and compromise neurovascular function. This manifests as "acute compartment syndrome".

### Total croFab and anavip antivenom vial administration in US rattlesnake envenomations: 2019–2021 [^114Q7VEn]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical effects are consistent with prior studies of rattlesnake envenomations from the NASBR. Every patient except one had local tissue damage recorded. Unsurprisingly, there were no deaths in the dataset, given the rarity of deaths from pit vipers in the United States. Snakebite envenomations have better outcomes when appropriate treatments are given earlier. Total treatment time between the Fab and F(ab')2 groups were similar, with those receiving both treatments having a much longer total treatment time. This is logical given that patients receiving both antivenoms likely had one of two scenarios occur. The first scenario is the initiation of treatment with one type of antivenom at an outside facility, followed by transfer to a larger facility where medical toxicology consultation was available, and treatment with the other antivenom. The second scenario was that patients were considered a "treatment failure" due to a lack or limited response to one antivenom, so the other antivenom was used to see if a better response would occur. The median number of total days in the hospital was similar with a median of 2 days, though the range was larger in the Anavip and both antivenom groups. However, this may not be clinically significant. Clearly, many factors affect treatment time, including time of presentation, patient age, and patient comfort/desire for discharge. Future studies should examine total hours in the hospital instead of days to assess this difference with additional attention to confounding factors.

### Oral varespladib for the treatment of snakebite envenoming in India and the United States (BRAVO): a phase II randomised clinical trial [^111X9pLv]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, snakebite envenoming (SBE) annually results in approximately 150 000 deaths and 400 000 cases of permanent disability. India has the highest country-level burden of SBE, with an estimated 58 000 annual deaths. Death and disability following SBE are also common in Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central and South America. In the United States, an estimated 11 000 people are bitten by venomous snakes each year, resulting in both short-term and long-term disability.

Antivenoms are antibody-based therapies that remain the only pharmacologic treatment for SBE. Antivenom efficacy is time-dependent, and their major limitation is that administration is often delayed. Early administration of antivenoms is often not possible because their use is generally limited to hospital settings, a result of antivenoms being intravenously administered and having the potential for serious allergic reactions. The absence of an effective and widely available field or prehospital therapy has profound consequences for victims of snakebite. In India, over 75% of deaths occur prior to hospital arrival. In sub-Saharan Africa, each hour delay in treatment is estimated to increase mortality by 1%. Additionally, the cost of antivenoms limit their supply and distribution creating further challenges to timely access to treatment in some regions. Reflecting these and other concerns, in 2017 the WHO identified snakebite as a Neglected Tropical Disease, and in 2019 the WHO Snakebite Envenoming Working Group encouraged development of oral direct toxin inhibitors, including varespladib, that can be administered in the field to address the limitation of antivenom and reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Acute adverse effects of F (ab') ₂ AV and fabAV use for rattlesnake envenomations: a four-year poison center study [^116ihbB8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rattlesnake envenomations account for many of the Crotalid envenomations in the United States annually. Two antivenoms are currently available to treat Crotalid envenomation in this country: Crotalidae-polyvalent ovine immune Fab antivenom (CroFab®; FabAV) and Crotalidae equine immune F(ab')₂ antivenom (ANAVIP®; F(ab')₂AV). Few studies have compared the adverse effect rates for each. We performed a retrospective chart review of rattlesnake envenomations called to the California Poison Control System from October 2018 to August 2022. Those treated at healthcare facilities with either antivenom were included. Those treated with both antivenoms were excluded. Records were obtained from the poison center electronic medical records system. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted. "Severe" adverse events were defined as multi-organ system involvement, swelling of the patient's airway, and/or hemodynamic instability. All others were categorized as "non-severe". A total of 481 cases were included with 360 treated with FabAV and 121 with F(ab')₂AV. The median age was 47 and 46 years, and 72% and 73% were male, respectively. Clinical signs and symptoms of envenomation were similar in each group. The FabAV group received a median of six vials. The F(ab')₂AV group received a median of 10 vials, based on the recommended loading doses of FabAV and F(ab') 2 AV. Following antivenom administration, 18 individual acute non-severe AEs were reported in 12 FabAV-treated patients. Two acute non-severe AEs were reported in two F(ab')₂AV-treated patients. Rash or urticaria was the most commonly reported adverse effect in both groups after antivenom administration. Five patients (1.5%) had severe adverse events reported in the poison center records following FabAV administration, and none were reported following F(ab')₂AV administration (p = 0.025). Overall, our poison center data suggests the rate of adverse events is low following the use of either antivenom. Our findings are limited by the lack of consistent timing data, a smaller F(ab')₂AV cohort, retrospective format, and use of poison center data.

What you need to know

Bites from venomous snakes can result in bleeding, paralysis, long term disability, and death
Immobilise the bitten limb when transporting the patient to a medical facility; the universal use of pressure immobilisation is controversial, and tourniquets are not recommended
The 20-minute whole blood clotting test is a simple bedside test to screen for and monitor coagulopathy in resource-limited settings
Assess vital parameters and initiate resuscitation measures if the patient is clinically unstable with signs of bleeding, shock, paralysis, or respiratory distress
Intravenous antivenom is recommended in patients with systemic symptoms; the dose and type depend on likely snake species, local guidelines, and availability

Snakebite affects between 1.8 to 2.7 million people worldwide each year, and it is estimated to cause between 80 000 and 138 000 deaths. A mixture of toxins (venom) is injected into the body following bite by a venomous snake. Envenoming can be a highly dynamic clinical event. Symptoms can progressively worsen to a life-threatening emergency. Snakebites can have long term physical sequelae such as amputation, paralysis and disability, and psychological health consequences.

Snakebite envenoming is more common in South and South-East Asia (2 million annually), sub-Saharan Africa (420 000) and Latin America (150 000). These regions also report a high burden of deaths from snakebite (100 000, 32 000, and 5000 deaths respectively) possibly due to poor access to medical aid. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can worsen prognosis. The World Health Organization recognised snakebite as a neglected tropical disease in 2017 and called for concerted global action to reduce deaths and disability.

In this clinical update, we present an approach to evaluation and management of snakebites for primary care providers in resource-limited settings in endemic regions. The principles of management are broadly similar, but it is beyond the scope of this article to cover clinical syndromes and management for the varied snake species globally.

### Total croFab and anavip antivenom vial administration in US rattlesnake envenomations: 2019–2021 [^114F9cnq]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2000, Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (CroFab, BTG International Inc.) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating pit viper envenomations. The CroFab product uses venoms from snakes native to the United States (C. adamanteus, C. atrox, Mojave green or C. scutulatus, and Cottonmouth or A. piscivorus), and the included immunoglobulins are derived from sheep. The Fc portion of the IgG is cleaved with the enzyme papain, which yields isolated Fab fragments. Removing the Fc region, along with other purification techniques, results in the development of an effective antivenom with very few adverse reactions compared to the previous Wyeth product (0.6–6% vs. 23–56%). Wyeth ceased production in 2000, supply waned over the ensuing years, and the safer and effective CroFab antivenom quickly replaced the Wyeth in clinical practice. CroFab is administered as an initial loading bolus of 4–6 vials for initial control (to be re-dosed if venom effect control is not achieved), followed by three two-vial maintenance doses.

In 2018, Crotalidae immune F(ab')2 (Anavip, Instituto Bioclon) was made commercially available initially for rattlesnake envenomation, followed by approval in 2021 for use for Agkistrodon envenomation. This antivenom uses Terciopelo (B. asper) and C. durissis venom and is derived from horses; the harvested immunoglobulins are digested with pepsin, creating a F(ab')2 fragment. The initial loading dose is 10 vials, with repeat dosing to achieve control of venom effects. There is no scheduled maintenance dosing recommended. The rates of reported adverse reactions are similar to CroFab. Phase III clinical trial data suggest that late-onset and post-treatment recurrent coagulopathies are reduced with the use of Anavip. It is postulated this effect is likely due to the significantly longer half-life of F(ab')2 compared to Fab fragments, though these findings and this hypothesis have not been confirmed in the post-approval setting. Furthermore, it is unclear if repeat dosing may occur, contrary to recommendations, due to the progression of patient symptoms and failure of this antivenom to adequately match some venom components of US snakes.

### Haemotoxic snake venoms: their functional activity, impact on snakebite victims and pharmaceutical promise [^1137Wmhu]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Estimates of annual deaths caused by snakebite in different global burden of disease regions. Conservative estimates are displayed by different colour shadings on the map and upper estimates are annotated for each major region where the number of snakebite deaths is greater than 1000. The world map image is reproduced from Kasturiratne et al, (2008)under the Creative Commons Attribution License and the overlaid upper estimates of snakebite death are taken from the same publication.

The only specific therapy available for treating snakebite is antivenom. Antivenom consists of polyclonal antibodies that are generated by immunising animals (horses or sheep) with small amounts of snake venom. The resulting antibodies are purified from serum or plasma and formulated into intact IgG or F(ab') 2 ‐ or Fab‐fragment therapies, which are administered intravenously following snakebite. While antivenoms are effective therapies for neutralising the toxicity of snake venoms if delivered promptly, there are a number of deficiencies with these products. First is the issue of venom variation, described earlier. The antibodies present in any antivenom are specific to those venoms that were used for immunisation. Whilst these antibodies might cross‐react with and neutralise similar venom toxins present in different species than those used for immunisation, there will be a limit to their cross‐efficacy, and this is often restricted to the same genus of snakes (Williams et al, 2011; Tan et al, 2016a, b). Despite a number of recent reports suggesting that certain antivenoms might have greater paraspecificity than previously anticipated (e.g. Pla et al, 2014; Tan et al, 2015), there are also a number of reports describing the poor performance or failure of antivenoms at neutralising venom from snakes related to those used for immunisation (Casewell et al, 2010; Segura et al, 2010; Tan et al, 2016b). Limitations with the paraspecificity of antivenoms are best exemplified by reports from sub‐Saharan Africa where geographically inappropriate products were used to treat snakebite in the Central African Republic and Ghana, resulting in increases in case fatality rates from 0.4% and 1.0% to 10.0% and 12.1% respectively (Visser et al, 2008; Alirol et al, 2015).

### Envenomations: an overview of clinical toxinology for the primary care physician [^113oxgXj]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

About 4,000 to 6,000 venomous snakebites occur each year in the United States. Although these envenomations (also known as envenomings) are rarely fatal, about 70 percent require antivenom therapy. Few evidence-based guidelines are available for the management of envenomation. Antivenom therapy is the cornerstone of management for hemorrhagic or coagulopathic envenomation from pit vipers (with or without paralytic features), and for paralytic envenomation from coral snakes. Early intubation and ventilation may be required after bites from pit vipers whose venoms contain presynaptic neurotoxins. Although relatively controversial, antivenom therapy seems to be effective for the management of severe envenomation from widow spiders. Conversely, little evidence supports any specific management strategy for necrotic envenomation from recluse spiders. Cytotoxic fish stings, cnidarian stings, and traumatic penetrative envenomation by stingrays are typically managed symptomatically. Private collection of nonnative venomous animals in the United States is another source of medical risk.

### Pediatric scorpion envenomation in the United States: morbidity, mortality, and therapeutic innovations [^115Wj8ec]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

In the Southwestern United States, the venom of the scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus (common name bark scorpion) can cause serious and potentially fatal neurotoxicity, with young children most vulnerable to its effects. Historically, advances in the quality of supportive care have made significant improvements in morbidity and mortality. In recent years, the development of effective antivenom therapies has changed the landscape of caring for these patients. This article reviews the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment options for C. sculpturatus envenomation. Recent advances in immunotherapy and subsequent implications for pediatric emergency care providers are discussed.

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (mesobuthus tamulus) sting: randomised open label clinical trial [^1118pcAw]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Evaluation of clinical grade

Cases are graded according to severity of clinical manifestations on arrival at hospital (box). Severity of clinical manifestations, morbidity, and mortality depend on the time lapsed between sting and hospital admission, as well as the grade of a case on arrival.

Patients with grade 2 signs and symptoms were included in the present study. After giving written consent, all eligible patients were examined by one of the two authors and baseline data were recorded on a standard form. Data included age, sex, time between sting and hospital admission, and history of any medication before admission, vomiting soon after sting, or paraesthesia (tingling and numbness in the perioral region, or sometimes reported by the patient to be felt all over the body).

One of the authors sat by the side of the patients and closely clinically examined them for signs and symptoms of systemic manifestations: presence of profuse sweating all over the body, ropey salivation, priapism in men, heart murmur, coolness of the extremities. Blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored on a multipara monitor. These findings were noted on admission at 00.00, at 30 minutes, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 24 hours. Subsequent improvement or deteriorations to grade 3 or 4 were closely followed by the author who examined the patient on arrival. Blood was collected from all participants on admission for measurement of haemoglobin, white cell count, and creatine kinase-MB. A 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was done on arrival, after six hours, and before discharge.

### Examination of adverse events following black widow antivenom use in California [^113KvRny]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Following widow spider (Latrodectus sp.) envenomation, local pain, erythema, abdominal pain, rigidity, hypertension, and diaphoresis can be seen. While an effective specific antivenom (AV) is available, its use is limited due to concern of possible severe allergic reaction. We performed the current study to determine rate of adverse effects and the efficacy of AV in patients treated for widow spider envenomation.

Methods

Observational case series of the California Poison Control System electronic database from January 1999 to December 2009. All cases of widow spider envenomation treated with AV were included. Age, gender, signs, and symptoms, adjunctive therapy, number of vials of AV given, and adverse reaction to AV were recorded. Descriptive statistical methods were used.

Results

Ninety-six patients received AV, mean age 26 years (0.12–74 years), 76% male. Following widow spider envenomation generalized pain was reported in 91%, erythema at site in 57%, hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) in 43%, muscle rigidity/cramping in 43%, abdominal pain in 41%, tachycardia (≥ 100 bpm) in 23% and diaphoresis in 21%. No patient required more than one vial of AV. One patient developed urticaria to AV halfway through infusion which was immediately discontinued. Another patient developed generalized flushing following completion of infusion but had no other effects. Two other patients reported myalgia and paresthesia. There were no deaths in any patients receiving AV. There was no shortness of breath or respiratory distress, no hypotension or chest pain following AV administration. All patients reported pain relief with AV and did not require additional AV doses.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that Black Widow Spider Antivenin® (Merck) administration is relatively safe with mild to moderate adverse effects seen in only a small percentage of patients. There were no deaths, or severe allergic reactions identified. The retrospective use of poison control system data is a limitation of our study. Further prospective studies are needed to validate our findings and elucidate the full safety profile on this antivenom.

### Incidence of serum sickness after the administration of Australian snake antivenom (ASP-22) [^115fJmhr]. Clinical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Serum sickness is a delayed immune reaction resulting from the injection of foreign protein or serum. Antivenom is known to cause serum sickness but the incidence and characteristics are poorly defined.

Objective

To investigate the incidence and clinical features of serum sickness following the administration of Australian snake antivenoms.

Materials and Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of patients recruited to the Australian Snakebite Project who received snake antivenom from November 2012 to March 2014. Demographics, clinical information, laboratory tests and antivenom treatment were recorded prospectively. Patients administered antivenom were followed up at 7–10 days and 6 weeks' post-antivenom. The primary outcome was the proportion with serum sickness, pre-defined as three or more of: fever, erythematous rash/urticaria, myalgia/arthralgia, headache, malaise, nausea/vomiting 5–20 days post-antivenom.

Results

During the 16-month period, 138 patients received antivenom. 23 were not followed up (unable to contact, tourist, child, bee sting) and 6 died in hospital. Of 109 patients followed up, the commonest reason for antivenom was venom induced consumption coagulopathy in 77 patients. An acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction occurred post-antivenom in 25 (23%) and 8 (7%) were severe with hypotension. Serum sickness occurred in 32/109 (29%) patients, including 15/37 (41%) given tiger snake, 6/15 (40%) given polyvalent and 4/23 (17%) given brown snake antivenom. There was no association between the volume of antivenom and serum sickness, p = 0.18. The commonest effects were lethargy, headache, muscle/joint aches and fever.

Discussion

The incidence of serum sickness after snake antivenom in Australia was higher than earlier investigations which failed to define symptoms or follow-up patients, but similar to more recent studies of antivenoms in the United States.

Conclusion

Serum sickness is common with Australian snake antivenom but does not appear to be predictable based on the volume of antivenom administered.

### The cost of antivenom: a cost minimization study using the north American snakebite registry [^114yfyFM]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Snake envenomation represents a significant burden of disease globally, with approximately 125,000 deaths caused by snakebites annually. Emergency departments within the United States see over 9,000 non-fatal snakebite patients each year, and these bites may result in significant morbidity.

Antivenom remains the only widely-used treatment for snakebite globally since its development in 1894. Antivenom is a high-cost medication, partially because its production has not dramatically changed since its inception, but also due to bureaucracy, patents, and litigation. Despite its high cost, antivenom is a highly effective treatment, with measures of cost-effectiveness comparable to treatments targeting other neglected tropical diseases. At the turn of the 21st century, Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab (ovine) [CroFab®], hereafter referred to as Fab, became available, which represented a significant decrease in the risk for immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions when compared to traditional whole antibody preparations. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved Crotalidae immune F(ab') 2 (equine) [ANAVIP®], hereafter referred to as F(ab') 2, which demonstrated a significantly decreased risk for late coagulopathy. In the United States, a dose of either modern crotaline antivenom costs thousands of dollars and may drive healthcare costs. Snakebite therapy can be extraordinarily expensive and can be a precipitant of medical debt. In 2022, medical debt affected more than 100 million Americans. Differences in direct or indirect costs required by the two antivenoms might result in significant differences in total costs.

Given uncertainty regarding the differences in clinical outcomes between the two antivenoms, we focused our analysis on the total cost of treatment for an episode of crotaline envenomation in the United States.

### Situation of snakebite, antivenom market and access to antivenoms in ASEAN countries [^115i53ZQ]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Second, antivenoms should be rigorously regulated by the national regulatory authority to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of the antivenoms. Evidence of non-clinical cross-neutralisation should be mandatory for registration of antivenom products in countries who import antivenoms from other countries to ensure that the purchased antivenoms could effectively reverse snakebite envenoming in the destination countries. The quality of antivenom production should also be further improved such as lyophilisation to prolong shelf-life, and purification to reduce immunogenicity. The technology transfer of antivenom production among ASEAN countries may provide the suitable antivenom for neutralising particular snake venom of each countries to address the venom variability from different geographical areas.

Third, strengthening the supply chain of antivenoms to ensure that antivenoms are readily accessible at the point of service. Centralised pooled procurement is encouraged to increase negotiation power with the manufacturers to ensure constant and reliable antivenom supplies at the affordable prices. Inventory and logistics of antivenom should be managed with support from online system to ensure availability of antivenom at healthcare facilities and provide real-world data of antivenom utilisation which allows reallocation of antivenoms and better estimation of antivenom demand and supply within country.

Fourth, raising public awareness about the importance of treating snakebite envenoming by healthcare professional is crucial. Healthcare authorities should engage with communities to educate people regarding appropriate first aid measures, and when to seek care at healthcare facilities. In areas where there is a strong cultural belief on traditional healing methods, the collaboration with traditional healers is vital to engage the traditional healers on performing safe treatments and to encourage victims to receive proper treatment at healthcare facilities. The more victims seek care at healthcare facilities, the closer we are getting to increase timely access to antivenom in the region.

Fifth, health system should be further strengthened to ensure appropriate snakebite management especially efficient use of antivenom with support from the local clinical practice guidelines, training for healthcare professionals, clinical consultation services and snakebite identification services with the goal of better outcomes of snakebite victims. Healthcare professionals should also be trained periodically to remind the current practices since some might not be familiar with snakebite or snakebite rarely occurs in their hospitals.

### Toxic myocarditis following scorpion sting in a child: a case report and pediatric management approach [^1148iyyG]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Antivenom use in scorpion envenomation is often debated; however, for H. lepturus in Iran, the calculus differs. This species is associated with cytotoxic and hemolytic effects (with risks of hemolysis, coagulopathy, Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), and cardiovascular toxicity), particularly in children. Current local practice favors early intravenous antivenom in moderate–to–severe envenomation, as its benefit is time-dependent and limited to neutralizing circulating venom; once tissue injury (e.g. hemolysis or myocardial damage) is established, antivenom cannot reverse it, and supportive care becomes decisive. In our patient, antivenom was administered promptly alongside aggressive supportive measures (hemodynamic stabilization and seizure control). While causality cannot be inferred from a single case, the combined approach is consistent with species-specific management in Iran and likely contributed to stabilization. High-quality comparative studies are still needed to precisely quantify antivenom efficacy for H. lepturus, but early administration in severe pediatric cases remains prudent given the toxic profile of this species. Furthermore, the multivalent scorpion antivenom used in Iran is supplied in 5-mL ampoules as a pepsin-digested, refined, and concentrated preparation obtained from equine hyperimmune serum and stored at 2–8 °C. This product is manufactured by the Razi Institute of Vaccine and Serum Production (Karaj, Iran). Its efficacy against the major medically important species, including H. lepturus, has been documented in national studies, and it remains the standard of care in moderate-to-severe cases of envenomation.

### Safety profile of antivenom in a cohort of patients envenomed byin hangzhou, zhejiang province, southeast China [^114iMzkZ]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antivenom treatment is the specific treatment for Deinagkistrodon acutus envenomation. However, safety concerns regarding the use of antivenom in this population have been reported only infrequently in the literature. We aimed to determine the incidence of anaphylactic reactions and serum sickness following antivenom administration in a cohort of patients envenomed by Deinagkistrodon acutus.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients admitted to the Hangzhou TCM Hospital between January 2018 and December 2022 with bites from Deinagkistrodon acutus. The information collected included patient demographics, clinical information, laboratory findings, details of antivenom use, use of premedications, and details of anaphylactic reactions and serum sickness.

Results

A total of 157 patients with bites from Deinagkistrodon acutus were treated with antivenom (median dose four vials) and were included in the study. All treated patients received premedications (dexamethasone and antihistamines). Adverse reactions were noted in 18 patients (11.5%). Ten of these individuals (6.4%) suffered anaphylactic reactions within the first 24h following antivenom administration, categorized as mild (n = 5), moderate (n = 4), or severe (n = 1). Symptoms included rash, urticaria, diaphoresis, nausea, dyspnoea, wheezing, anaphylactic shock, loss of consciousness, and angioedema. Serum sickness occurred in eight patients (5.1%), manifesting primarily as urticaria or erythematous rash, fever, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Discussion

This study provided data on adverse reactions associated with antivenom administration in patients admitted with bites from Deinagkistrodon acutus admitted to a regional referral centre specializing in the management of patients with severe or complex health conditions in Zhejiang Province, China. Our results indicate a relatively low incidence of severe adverse reactions. Nevertheless, clinicians must administer appropriate snake antivenom and maintain vigilance during antivenom administration and post-treatment follow-up.

Conclusions

Antivenom therapy was efficacious in treating Deinagkistrodon acutus envenomation. Approximately one in every eight patients developed anaphylactic reactions or serum sickness, although anaphylactic shock was uncommon (0.6%).

### Symptoms and management of painful progressive swelling in eswatini snakebite patients: a prospective observational study [^112QbJsR]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

In Eswatini, bites from snakes with cytotoxic venoms inflict substantial morbidity on humans through blistering, swelling, and tissue necrosis. Despite its widespread use, there is little evidence regarding the efficacy of antivenom in preventing snakebite-induced tissue damage. We conducted a prospective observational study in nine hospitals in Eswatini to describe and quantify symptoms of local tissue toxicity. Our secondary aim was to examine the use of antivenom. Data from 125 snakebite patients with extensive or rapidly progressive swelling were analyzed. The median increase in circumference of envenomed limbs was 12%. Necrosis developed in 31 (25%) patients, primarily in distal extremities. Seventy patients (56%) received South African Institute for Medical Research (SAIMR) Polyvalent antivenom (South African Vaccine producers, Johannesburg South Africa), which was administered for indications related to local tissue damage. Upon hospital presentation, patients treated with antivenom exhibited slightly more severe swelling. Ten out of 11 patients with necrosis upon admission received antivenom. At least seven patients developed necrosis after admission despite previous antivenom therapy. In this nonrandomized observational study, no relationship was observed between the rate at which swelling receded and antivenom treatment. Adverse reactions to antivenom occurred in 49% of patients. Although our analysis has its limitations, it emphasizes the compelling need for research into the indications for and outcomes of antivenom treatment for local tissue damage.

### Total croFab and anavip antivenom vial administration in US rattlesnake envenomations: 2019–2021 [^113yy2FT]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There are approximately 10,000 venomous snakebites in the United States each year. Ninety-nine percent of envenomations occur due to Crotalus or Sistrurus species (rattlesnakes) and Agkistrodon species (i.e. copperheads and cottonmouths), collectively known as pit vipers. Envenomations from these species can result in local symptoms such as pain, swelling, necrosis, or systemic effects such as coagulation abnormalities, bleeding, paralysis, shock or rarely, death.

Antivenoms are the mainstay of treatment for snake envenomations. Before the year 2000, Wyeth Polyvalent antivenom was the only available antivenom to treat pit viper envenomations in the United States. The Wyeth product is a whole IgG derived from horse serum using the venom from Central and North American snakes, Fer-de-lance (Bothrops atrox), South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissis terrificus), Eastern Diamondback (Crotalus adamanteus), and Western Diamondback (Crotalus atrox). It was effective for most pit viper bites in the United States but also carried a significant risk of adverse reactions (23–56%), including a significant rate of anaphylaxis.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

The majority of antivenoms have shelf lives of 2–5 years post-manufacture, and once expired are typically discarded, despite antivenoms possibly retaining efficacy for many years post-expiry. Before this study, there was highly limited information on the retained efficacy of antivenoms for sub-Saharan Africa, the region which experiences the most acute shortages.

### Total croFab and anavip antivenom vial administration in US rattlesnake envenomations: 2019–2021 [^111fawSj]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Due to these factors, there is no one size fits all approach to the dynamic process of treating snake envenomations. Medical toxicologists' practice patterns vary on whether they give maintenance doses or re-administer antivenom boluses depending on the local envenomation syndromes, region-specific data, and anecdotal experience treating envenomation. Increased administration clearly has cost implications for envenomated patients and hospitals stocking antivenoms. These practices may be different in Agkistrodon envenomated patients. Additional work is needed to determine the reasons why more Anavip vials and administrations are administered compared to CroFab.

### A randomized controlled trial of fresh frozen plasma for treating venom-induced consumption coagulopathy in cases of Australian snakebite (ASP-18) [^111FqTcR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Venom-induced consumption coagulopathy (VICC) is a major effect of snake envenoming.

Objectives

To investigate whether fresh frozen plasma (FFP) given after antivenom resulted in more rapid correction of coagulation.

Patients/Methods

This was a multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial in patients with VICC of FFP vs. no FFP within 4 h of antivenom administration. Patients (> 2 years) recruited to the Australian snakebite project with VICC (International Normalized Ratio [INR] > 3) were eligible. Patients were randomized 2: 1 to receive FFP or no FFP. The primary outcome was the proportion with an INR of < 2 at 6 h after antivenom administration. Secondary outcomes included time from antivenom administration to discharge, adverse effects, major hemorrhage, and death.

Results

Of 70 eligible patients, 65 consented to be randomized: 41 to FFP, and 24 to no FFP. Six hours after antivenom administration, more patients randomized to FFP had an INR of < 2 (30/41 [73%] vs. 6/24 [25%]; absolute difference, 48%; 95% confidence interval 23–73%; P = 0.0002). The median time from antivenom administration to discharge was similar (34 h, range 14–230 h vs. 39 h, range 14–321 h; P = 0.44). Seven patients developed systemic hypersensitivity reactions after antivenom administration - two mild and one severe (FFP arm), and three mild and one severe (no FFP). One serious adverse event (intracranial hemorrhage and death) occurred in an FFP patient with pre-existing hypertension, who was hypertensive on admission, and developed a headache 6 h after FFP administration. Post hoc analysis showed that the median time from bite to FFP administration was significantly shorter for non-responders to FFP than for responders (4.7 h, interquartile range [IQR] 4.2–6.7 h vs. 7.3 h, IQR 6.1–8 h; P = 0.002).

Conclusions

FFP administration after antivenom administration results in more rapid restoration of clotting function in most patients, but no decrease in discharge time. Early FFP administration (< 6–8 h) post-bite is less likely to be effective.

### Comparison of F (ab') 2 versus fab antivenom for pit viper envenomation: a prospective, blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trial [^115mkJyC]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (Ovine) has been the only antivenom commercially available in the US since 2007 for treatment of Crotalinae envenomation. Late coagulopathy can occur or recur after clearance of Fab antivenom, often after hospital discharge, lasting in some cases more than 2 weeks. There have been serious, even fatal, bleeding complications associated with recurrence phenomena. Frequent follow-up is required, and additional intervention or hospitalization is often necessary. F(ab')2 immunoglobulin derivatives have longer plasma half life than do Fab. We hypothesized that F(ab')2 antivenom would be superior to Fab in the prevention of late coagulopathy following treatment of patients with Crotalinae envenomation.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, comparing late coagulopathy in snakebitten patients treated with F(ab')2 with maintenance doses [F(ab')2/F(ab')2], or F(ab')2 with placebo maintenance doses [F(ab')2/placebo], versus Fab with maintenance doses [Fab/Fab]. The primary efficacy endpoint was coagulopathy (platelet count < 150 K/mm(3), fibrinogen level < 150 mg/dL) between end of maintenance dosing and day 8.

Results

121 patients were randomized at 18 clinical sites and received at least one dose of study drug. 114 completed the study. Of these, 11/37 (29.7%) in the Fab/Fab cohort experienced late coagulopathy versus 4/39 (10.3%, p < 0.05) in the F(ab')2/F(ab')2 cohort and 2/38 (5.3%, p < 0.05) in the F(ab')2/placebo cohort. The lowest heterologous protein exposure was with F(ab')2/placebo. No serious adverse events were related to study drug. In each study arm, one patient experienced an acute serum reaction and one experienced serum sickness.

Conclusions

In this study, management of coagulopathic Crotalinae envenomation with longer-half-life F(ab')2 antivenom, with or without maintenance dosing, reduced the risk of subacute coagulopathy and bleeding following treatment of envenomation.

### Situation of snakebite, antivenom market and access to antivenoms in ASEAN countries [^116rWL8i]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Our study summarised the situation of snakebite, antivenom market and access to antivenom in seven ASEAN countries which should be highly relevant to clinicians, researchers, antivenom producers and policymakers to further improve the outcomes of snakebite victims. This study provides lesson learnt for countries or regions where snakebites are prevalent that improving the situation of snakebite and antivenom is not only about the availability of antivenom, but the whole landscape of surrounding management and supporting system. The assessment of the situation of snakebite and antivenom is essential to recognise their current standpoint which will inform the development of strategies to achieve the WHO's goal of halving the global burden of snakebite by 2030.

Antivenoms manufacturers in ASEAN are highly subsidised by the local government in each country. Thus, antivenoms could be priced lower with the costs of complete treatment of US$37–800, compared with US$40–24 000 in sub-Saharan Africa. These manufacturers produce up to 288 375 vials of antivenoms annually which could treat 42 213 victims. However, the produced antivenoms are insufficient in most countries. The shortage is expected be more severe because the excess supply of produced antivenoms might not be geographically specific for snakes in other countries. Moreover, the exact effective dose of antivenoms is hard to determine due to several challenges, including variability in the amount of venom injected when snakes bite humans, and lack of clinical evidence of effective dose and safety of antivenoms. Thereby, the recommended doses of antivenom are mostly based on preclinical studies of neutralisation and are considered as initial or starting doses where subsequent doses might be needed based on clinical responses of victims.

### Scorpion stings and antivenom use in Arizona [^115EPQco]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Arizona's rugged desert landscape harbors many venomous animals, including a small nocturnal scorpion, Centruroides sculpturatus, whose venom can cause severe neuromotor disturbance. An effective antivenom is available at selected health care facilities in the state.

Methods

We analyzed 4398 calls of scorpion stings to the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center (APDIC) in Tucson over a period of 3 years, from January 2017 to December 2019.

Results

We followed 1952 (44.4%) of the victims to resolution. We excluded 2253 callers with minimal effects of the sting and 193 victims with possible toxic effects who were lost to follow-up. The most common complaints among callers were pain at the sting site in 88.9% and local numbness in 62.2%. Detailed clinical information was obtained from 593 calls from a health care facility. Neuromotor signs consistent with C. sculpuratus envenomation included nystagmus in 163 (27.5%), hypersalivation in 91 (15.3%), and fasciculations in 88 (14.8%). Antivenom (Anascorp; Rare Disease Therapeutics, Inc, Franklin, Tenn) was administered to 145 patients. Most were children < 5 years old (n = 76, or 54.4%); 27 (18.6%) were 5–9 years old and 42 (30.0%) were ≥ 10 years of age. About half, 79 of 145 (54.5%) victims who received antivenom, met the APDIC recommended use criteria.

Conclusions

Patients treated with antivenom exhibited a rapid resolution of symptoms without immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. We recommend broadened availability of antivenom at sites where it is most needed.

### A randomized controlled trial of fresh frozen plasma for coagulopathy in russell's viper (daboia russelii) envenoming [^11447Ae4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

In addition, the recovery of coagulopathy in the two groups was compared by the use of survival analysis, with the following events being used to measure recovery: time to fibrinogen of > 1 g L −1, INR of < 2, FV > 50%, and FX > 50%. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of D‐dimer were compared to determine whether FFP caused further consumption.

The sample size was based on a previous Australian study 24, in which ~ 25% of patients not given FFP recovered to an INR of < 2 after 6 h. This was confirmed in the recent controlled trial in Australia 5. We assumed that the process of recovery after antivenom administration and toxin neutralization was similar for different snakes. An absolute increase of 25% of patients recovering 6 h after antivenom administration was regarded as clinically significant and sufficient to warrant the use of FFP. In order to detect whether low‐dose antivenom and FFP increase the proportion of patients recovering at 6 h from 25% to 50%, with a significance level (alpha) of 5% and a power of 90%, a minimum of 85 patients were to be recruited to each arm (i.e. a total of 170 patients). We aimed to recruit 200 patients, to allow for missing outcome data.

There was no planned interim analysis, but a Data Monitoring Committee was established to review adverse effects. If > 10% of patients developed severe adverse effects attributed to FFP (anaphylaxis or TRALI), the study was to be stopped. Unfortunately, the rates of enrollment to the study decreased dramatically in the last year, owing to the sudden decrease in cases of Russell's viper envenoming in both hospitals. In this region of Sri Lanka, mechanical harvesting was introduced during the study, resulting in fewer Russell's viper bites. In addition, there was increased antivenom use at referral hospitals, reducing patient recruitment. The study was stopped after randomization of 141 patients of the 200, because grant funding had finished.

One author (K.M.), who remained blinded to treatment allocation, extracted and de‐identified the data from the trial database before classifying the primary and secondary outcomes. The chief investigator (G. I.), also blinded to treatment allocation, checked for missing or inconsistent data, and then unblinded treatment allocations supplied by the research team (F.M.).

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (mesobuthus tamulus) sting: randomised open label clinical trial [^111oNmDB]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We found that in patients treated for scorpion sting with scorpion antivenom and prazosin incidences of improvement and deterioration were similar to those in patients treated with prazosin alone, and the addition of antivenom hastened recovery.

Previous studies

Stimulation of α receptors has an important role in the pathogenesis of venomous scorpion sting. In experimental studies, the major physiological abnormality is stimulation of peripheral α 1 adrenergic receptors by venom leading to blood pressure response. For this reason prazosin, an α receptor blocker, has been successfully used to reverse toxicity and improve survival. By blocking α 1 receptors, prazosin reduces preload and left ventricular impendence without raising heart rate. Prazosin is a simple pharmacological and physiological antidote to venom actions that is easily available in rural settingsmaking it the standard first line management. Of 619 patients with severe envenomation by Mesobuthus tamulus admitted at Mahad, hypertension was noted in 55%, pulmonary oedema in 27%, tachycardia with hypotension in 18%; all recovered with oral prazosin. Similar beneficial effects of prazosin have been reported from other states of India, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Impressive reductions in mortality from Mesobuthus tamulus sting have also been observed with the use of prazosin; from 26% in 1961 to 6% in 1980, and less than 1% at present. In regions where venomous scorpion sting is endemic, prazosin is a "darling" among the drugs kept ready in the outpatient department emergency tray; consultants in these areas even carry two tablets in their bags. Several specific scorpion antivenoms are available but their efficacy is uncertain. Ancillary treatment with vasodilators is crucial in severely envenomed patients.

### Scorpion envenomation: state of the art [^115T8zCD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Scorpion envenomation is common in the tropical and subtropical regions. It poses a major public health problem with some patients having serious clinical manifestations and severe complications including death. Old World and New World scorpions are usually contrasted because of differences in venom composition, clinical presentation and severity, and, accordingly, different therapeutic approaches. The majority of scorpion stings are either dry or result in low amounts of injected venom, thus explaining why up to 95% of scorpion stings ensue only in local signs. For a clinical envenomation to occur, it has been suggested that the interaction between the quantity of venom introduced in the body of the prey and the distribution volume should ensue in a critical threshold of scorpion toxin plasma concentration. In this case, there is a massive release of neurohormonal mediators (mainly catecholamine), with systemic vasoconstrictor effects eliciting a sharp increase in systemic arterial pressure and LV-filling pressure and decreased cardiac output. This early phase of cardiac dysfunction, also called "vascular phase", is followed by a severe cardiomyopathy, a form of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, involving both ventricles and reversible in days to weeks. The more comprehensive understanding of the disease pathophysiology has allowed for a well-codified symptomatic treatment, thus contributing to a substantial reduction in the death toll of scorpion envenomation over the past few decades. The standard intensive-care treatment (when available) overcomes envenomation's consequences such as acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. Even though it continues to inspire many evaluative studies, immunotherapy seems less attractive because of the major role held by mediators in the pathogenesis of envenomation, and unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties to existing sera compared to venom. Meta-analyses of controlled trials of immunotherapy in severe scorpion envenomation reached similar conclusions: there is an acceptable level of evidence in favor of the use of scorpion antivenom (Fab' 2) against Centruroides sp. in USA/Mexico, while there is still a need for a higher level of evidence for immunotherapy in the Old World envenomation.

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (mesobuthus tamulus) sting: randomised open label clinical trial [^111MmdLx]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Total doses of prazosin required were significantly lower in the antivenom plus prazosin group than in the prazosin alone group, suggesting that timely administration of scorpion antivenom leads to rapid neutralisation of circulating venom, resulting in minimum venom available for neuronal sodium channel activation. Amelioration of parasympathetic stimulation (sweating, salivation, arrhythmias) by antivenom may have accounted for the lower incidence of hypotension in the antivenom plus prazosin group. Leucocytosis and raised cardiac enzymes were suggestive of the release of cytokines such as interleukin-6.

No participant had a mild or severe reaction to antivenom. High circulating catecholamines induced by venom prevent a reaction to antivenom and act as a prophylaxis against anaphylaxis. Administration of the minimum first dose of prazosin prevented the development of the first dose phenomenon.

Owing to unavailability of an ELISA test for detection of venom antigen and antivenom in blood we could not perform a correlation with clinical manifestations. Facilities for analysis of serum catecholamine levels are not available at Mahad. We could not enrol patients with grade 3 and 4 severe scorpion stings owing to restriction by the ethics committee. Withholding the lifesaving drug prazosin would be unethical in a life threatening situation; hence it was included in both the arms of the trial and no placebo group was included.

### Coral snake — micrurus fulvius) immune globulin antivenin — equine) — north American coral snake Antivenin — equine [^116chTKN]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

There have been no well-controlled clinical studies of the use of North American Coral Snake Antivenin (Equine) in patients experiencing envenomation by the Eastern Coral Snake, however a retrospective analysis3has been published of 387 coral snake exposures treated in a healthcare facility in Florida between 1998 and 2010, including 252 patients who were treated with North American Coral Snake Antivenin (Equine). Patients were managed according to different treatment strategies: (a) asymptomatic at ED arrival and treated empirically (n = 134); (b) asymptomatic at ED arrival, but treatment withheld until symptoms appeared (n = 106; 6 of the 106 received North American Coral Snake Antivenin (Equine) at some point; the remainder were never treated); (c) symptomatic at ED arrival and treated with North American Coral Snake Antivenin (Equine) (n = 112); and (d) symptomatic at ED arrival but not treated with North American Coral Snake Antivenin (Equine) (n = 35). The average number of vials administered to treated patients was 3.75 (range 1–20 vials); the 17 patients who received repeat treatment were administered 8.3 vials, on average. There was no reported usage of foreign antivenom or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in this case series. The 387 patients were assessed for clinical outcomes, as shown in Table 1. Outcomes codes range from full recovery with no residual effects ("No Effect") to less than full recovery with significant residual effects ("Major"). Empiric treatment of asymptomatic patients resulted in more 'moderate' and 'major' outcomes compared to withholding treatment until symptoms appeared (p < .001), however, the patients were not randomized and selection biases could have affected this result.

Adverse reactions associated with North American Coral Snake Antivenin (Equine) administration were documented in 46 (18.25%) cases. The most common adverse reactions were hives, rash and/or welts (12%); itching (9%); shortness of breath (8%); hypotension (2%) and angioedema (1%). Antihistamines were administered to 46 patients, corticosteroids to 40, and epinephrine to 10 cases to treat these adverse reactions.

Antivenom administration.

Haffkine polyvalent antivenom (raised against the venoms of Naja naja, Bungarus caeruleus, Daboia russelii, and Echis carinatus sourced mainly from Mamallapuram, Tamil Nadu, India) was administered to all patients exhibiting signs of advanced systemic neurotoxicity (e.g. bilateral complete ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, dysphonia, weak grip strength, weak neck muscles, "broken neck" sign, or respiratory difficulty). Antivenom was not given to patients with minimal signs of neurotoxicity (e.g. partial ptosis with no other signs of systemic neurotoxicity) or to those with local signs of envenoming (e.g. blistering and local necrosis) in the absence of systemic neurotoxicity. Antivenom use conformed to Bangladeshi national guidelines: 100 mg of immunoglobulin in 100 mL vehicle was made up to 200 mL in 0.9% w/v NaCl as directed by the manufacturer and administered via intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour. In the absence of any reversal of paralysis after 2 hours, the same dose was repeated. Infusion was suspended if a patient developed adverse responses (e.g. urticaria, anaphylaxis, severe pyrogenic side effects) before the infusion was completed. In that event, adrenaline (0.25 mg i.m.), (0.2 mg/kg i.v.), and hydrocortisone (2 mg/kg i.v.) were administered and the infusion of antivenom was resumed.

Ventilatory support.

Ventilatory support was provided to those patients exhibiting cyanosis, sighing respiration, or other signs of ineffective ventilation. Support was withdrawn as soon as adequate spontaneous respiration was reestablished and the patient resisted enforced ventilation.

### Echis coloratus envenomation in children: a retrospective case series [^113apnQ1]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Antivenom has been used successfully to treat systemic and progressive, local manifestations of envenomations inflicted by Echis coloratus, the second most common cause of snake envenomation in Israel. There is a paucity of published data regarding the use of monovalent (equine) immunoglobulin G antivenom in children. This study describes outcomes from the regimen used in two large, tertiary care pediatric centers.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of children admitted with definite or probable signs of Echis coloratus envenomation to Sourasky (Tel Aviv) and Soroka (Be'er Sheva) Medical Centers from January 1st 2008-to June 1st 2019. Extracted data included age, location of bite, time to hospital arrival, laboratory test results, complications, time to antivenom administration if indicated, adverse effects of the antivenom, and outcomes. Indications for antivenom were: diagnosis of Echis coloratus as the etiology of envenomation, local and systemic signs e.g. skin puncture wounds, swelling of the involved limb, local hematoma, and abnormal coagulation blood test results.

Results

During the study period, 11 children were treated with intravenous Echis coloratus antivenom. Median age was 9years and 10 of 11 patients were male. Two patients underwent fasciotomy; in one, compartment syndrome was diagnosed by pressure measurement, and in the second, clinically. One patient developed mild urticaria 30min after initiation of the antivenom; the treatment was stopped and then restarted at a slower rate after he was treated with hydrocortisone and diphenhydramine. No further adverse reactions were observed.

Conclusions

In children, Echis coloratus antivenom appeared to be effective and safe for the treatment of systemic and progressive local manifestations of envenomation by Echis coloratus.

### Total croFab and anavip antivenom vial administration in US rattlesnake envenomations: 2019–2021 [^112NvuKd]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Database, Case Identification, and Data Definitions

This was a secondary analysis of the American College of Medical Toxicology's (ACMT) Toxicology Investigators Consortium (ToxIC) North American Snakebite Registry (NASBR). The registry is approved by the Western IRB; this analysis included no identifying patient information and thus was deemed exempt from IRB review. This study adheres to the ethical principles for medical research outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

NASBR prospectively collects data about patients treated for snake envenomation from a national network of medical toxicologists who evaluate and treat patients at the bedside. It includes data on demographic and snakebite characteristics, clinical effects of envenomation, and treatment details. We included all rattlesnake cases in the NASBR from 2019–2021. Analyzed cases required complete data on antivenom type and total antivenom vials administered (Fig. 1). Western states were defined as those that do not have native populations of Agkistrodon species. Eastern states were those with native populations of Agkistrodon species (see Supplemental Appendix). Tissue damage was defined as swelling, necrosis, ecchymosis, erythema, concern for compartment syndrome, or functional deficit present during any of the evaluation or treatment times in the dataset. Upper extremity bites included all bites above the waist, and lower extremity bites included bites below the waist. Coagulopathy included patients that had prothrombin time (PT) > 23 seconds, fibrinogen < 150 mg/dL, or platelet count < 150 K/mm 3 at any time during their evaluation and treatment. Neurologic toxicity included cases with documented neurotoxicity at initial presentation, as reason for additional antivenom doses or reason for re-administration. Systemic symptoms included any patient with emesis, diarrhea, hypotension, angioedema, or anaphylaxis recorded in the database. Maintenance doses were considered part of the initial antivenom administration for patients receiving CroFab, since this is the approved treatment course. All additional bolus doses and antivenom administered beyond the three scheduled maintenance doses were considered additional administrations. We defined time to antivenom as the time from the envenomation to the time of initial antivenom administration. Total treatment time was defined as the time between the initial antivenom administration and the end of the final administration.

### The cost of antivenom: a cost minimization study using the north American snakebite registry [^1157fqQH]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This analysis demonstrated that the total cost of treatment for snakebite is overwhelmingly driven by the cost of antivenom. This mirrors an analysis of bark scorpion antivenom performed by Armstrong et. al in 2013. Antivenom in the United States is effective and safe for the treatment of native pit-viper envenomation, but it remains extraordinarily expensive.

F(ab') 2 may decrease the risk of bleeding adverse events by decreasing the probability of late coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. The NASBR dataset demonstrates that these events are rare at baseline. Given the rarity of such events, the analysis was limited to a strict analysis of estimates of cost; however, these events may be of greater significance for a subpopulation with higher risk for bleeding. The initial hypothesis that a pharmaceutical that decreased the risk for delayed coagulopathy (i.e. F(ab') 2) would decrease the subsequent need for other resource utilization was not demonstrated except in blood product administration. While blood product administration is expensive, it remains an overall small proportion of resource utilization.

Other manufacturers might enter the antivenom landscape and lower cost; however, the market size is relatively limited and legal challenges and idiosyncrasies may paradoxically increase cost. Boyer's analysis indicates that the large majority of hospital charges results from "the portion of hospital charges later discounted for contracted payers, a negotiated amount that varied widely among hospitals but that does not represent actual collections for the majority of patients". Furthermore, the largest true cost was due to "legal, regulatory, and hospital activities involved in selling the drug". Thus, incentives for new entrants to the United States antivenom market are limited, while barriers for entry to the United States antivenom market are high. In addition, the cost of manufacture represents only a fraction of the market cost. Finally, drug pricing in the United States remains opaque. Wholesale pricing is not accessible to the public, instead only accessible via proprietary pharmaceutical databases.

### Total croFab and anavip antivenom vial administration in US rattlesnake envenomations: 2019–2021 [^112K75PJ]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

There were 291 rattlesnake envenomations included in this study (Fig. 1). The median age of patients was 32 years old (IQR: 14, 57). Men represented the majority of patients (n = 201, 69%), and most were treated in the Western USA (n = 279, 96%). The large majority of patients were identified as Caucasian (78%), followed by Hispanic/Latino (18%), Unknown (12%), and Native American (6%). Bites were observed in the lower extremity (n = 156, 54%) or upper extremity (n = 135, 46%) at similar rates. Tissue damage was the most common clinical effect (n = 290, 100%), followed by coagulopathy (n = 136, 48%), systemic symptoms (n = 52, 18%), and neurologic symptoms (n = 34, 12%) (Table 1). There were no deaths recorded.

### Efficacy and safety of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin compared with prazosin alone for venomous scorpion (mesobuthus tamulus) sting: randomised open label clinical trial [^116ptkjE]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Scorpion antivenom has been available for clinical use in India since 2002, but it is always in short supply and not easily available in pharmacies, whereas prazosin is freely available. Our experience of severe scorpion sting cases since 1977 shows that mortality can be dramatically reduced even in the absence of antivenom. Although the regimen including scorpion antivenom hastens recovery it is not mandatory. Species specific antivenom is needed to neutralise the circulating venom; however, prazosin, by antagonising sympathetic overactivity and correcting deranged metabolism, is effective against envenomation by different scorpion species. In severe scorpion envenomation the dose of antivenom required is much higher than that noted in an experimental animal study. The scorpion stinger by which venom is injected is short and sharp, 3–4 mm long, enabling it to deposit the venom skin deep (the full thickness of human skin is 1.5–4 mm). Skin circulation is sluggish and normally remains quiescent. Soon after stinging the rapidly absorbed venom evokes autonomic storm owing to sudden pouring of endogenous catecholamine into the circulation. α 1 receptors are stimulated by the circulating catecholamine, causing cold skin as a result of vasoconstriction, which further arrests the absorption of venom from the sting site. Toxicokinetic studies in rabbits showed that scorpion venom was rapidly taken up by organs and tissues, with an estimated half life of two to six minutes after venom injection.

Moreover small doses of scorpion antivenom (such as the 10 mL dose used in a previous report of 25 cases from Mahad) have not been effective in preventing morbidity and mortality caused by Mesobuthus tamulus sting. This led us to conclude that the role of antivenom in severe scorpion sting needed to be re-examined and that prazosin is the standard of care to overcome the autonomic storm.

### African polyvalent antivenom can maintain pharmacological stability and ability to neutralise murine venom lethality for decades post-expiry: evidence for increasing antivenom shelf life to aid in alleviating chronic shortages [^1139KVb5]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Antivenom is a lifesaving medicine for treating snakebite envenoming, yet there has been a crisis in antivenom supply for many decades. Despite this, substantial quantities of antivenom stocks expire before use. This study has investigated whether expired antivenoms retain preclinical quality and efficacy, with the rationale that they could be used in emergency situations when in-date antivenom is unavailable.

Methods

Using WHO guidelines and industry test requirements, we examined the in vitro stability and murine in vivo efficacy of eight batches of the sub-Saharan African antivenom, South African Institute for Medical Research polyvalent, that had expired at various times over a period of 30 years.

Results

We demonstrate modest declines in immunochemical stability, with antivenoms older than 25 years having high levels of turbidity. In vitro preclinical analysis demonstrated all expired antivenoms retained immunological recognition of venom antigens and the ability to inhibit key toxin families. All expired antivenoms retained comparable in vivo preclinical efficacy in preventing the lethal effects of envenoming in mice versus three regionally and medically important venoms.

Conclusions

This study provides strong rationale for stakeholders, including manufacturers, regulators and health authorities, to explore the use of expired antivenom more broadly, to aid in alleviating critical shortages in antivenom supply in the short term and the extension of antivenom shelf life in the longer term.

### Tracheal intubation prevented with administration of fab antivenom after severe crotaline envenomation [^116yujF8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Crotaline snake envenomations are common, but severe crotaline envenomations are infrequent. Death from severe envenomation is usually from upper airway edema and respiratory failure. Published reports of severe respiratory compromise and anaphylactoid reactions are rare. Currently, FabAV (Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab [Ovine] [CroFab]) is the mainstay of crotaline envenomation treatment; however, FabAV has been approved for only mild and moderate envenomations.

Case Report

We describe a case of a male with severe systemic effects and airway compromise after crotaline envenomation. The patient's systemic effects and upper airway edema substantially improved after antivenom infusion and before epinephrine administration. Endotracheal intubation was averted, clinical deterioration was avoided, and improvement occurred after prompt FabAV use.

Conclusion

Fab antivenom likely prevented endotracheal intubation in our case of severe crotaline envenomation.

### Severe systemic envenomation following vipera berus bite managed with viperaTAb antivenom [^116kgPho]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Bites by the European adder (Vipera berus) are a rare medical emergency in the UK with 20 to 50% of an estimated 50 to 200 cases per year necessitating treatment with antivenom. We present a case demonstrating both severe systemic and local effects necessitating out of hospital resuscitation, vasopressor support, and prolonged rehabilitation. Hemodynamic stability was restored promptly after administration of ViperaTAb antivenom, the first published case of its use in the UK.

### In vivo neutralization of dendrotoxin-mediated neurotoxicity of black mamba venom by oligoclonal human IgG antibodies [^11315N3R]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Snakebite envenoming exacts a death toll of 80–150,000 victims each year, leaves approximately four times as many maimed for life, and has recently been recognized as a Neglected Tropical Disease by the World Health Organization (WHO). Antivenoms derived from the plasma of hyper-immunized animals remain the mainstay of snakebite envenoming therapy. However, these present a range of drawbacks due to their relatively high cost and their heterologous nature that causes, in some patients, a number of side effects, such as serum sickness and early adverse reactions, which may include severe anaphylaxis –. Furthermore, it is estimated that only a fraction of the antibodies in most current antivenoms have a therapeutic value, as the majority of antibodies isolated from animal plasma are directed against antigens that are either unrelated to snake venom or related to venom components with negligible contribution to venom toxicity. The implication follows that high amounts of antivenom protein may be needed to treat a snakebite, with heterologous protein loads reaching as much as 15 g/treatment for some antivenoms in severe envenoming cases. Particularly, elapid antivenoms often have an unbalanced antibody content with relatively low amounts of antibodies against small neurotoxic venom components that have low immunogenicity, which often leads to low immune responses in production animals –. Despite the maturity of immunotherapy, there remains a need for cost-effective antivenoms with improved safety and efficacy.

The notorious black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) from sub-Saharan Africa is a particularly dangerous species due to its size, defensive nature, and fast-acting neurotoxic venom. Life threatening clinical manifestations of D. polylepis envenoming include flaccid paralysis due to blockade of neuromuscular transmission resulting from inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the peripheral nervous system caused by α-neurotoxins (both short-chain and long-chain types) of the three-finger toxin superfamily. In terms of abundance, however, the venom of D. polylepis is dominated by dendrotoxins, which are a unique type of neurotoxins that inhibit voltage-dependent potassium channels causing excitatory effects that result in involuntary muscle contractions. In the venom, short neurotoxins, long neurotoxins, and dendrotoxins combine synergistically to provide D. polylepis with a potent neurotoxic bite.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^115hWaqN]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Snake bite — recommendation-specific supportive text emphasizes access to definitive care and minimizing exertion. The definitive treatment for snakebite is antivenom, which is not available for use in the first aid setting, and it is not practical to treat shock, internal bleeding, or severe neurotoxicity in the first aid setting; therefore, a person bitten by a snake that is venomous or might be venomous should seek prompt medical attention and transport by EMS allows delivery of supportive and stabilizing care before arrival at the hospital. A pit viper bite typically deposits venom intradermally or into the subcutaneous space, and in a human experimental study, flow of an intradermally or subcutaneously injected radiotracer increased when the subject walked for ≥ 10 minutes, which could lead to increased systemic absorption of venom.

### Successful use of anti-venom cross-neutralization effects in the clinical management of shore pit viper envenomation [^117PrZMr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

As the landscape becomes more urbanized, snakebites have increasingly become uncommon presentations to the emergency departments in Singapore, while snakebites causing significant envenomation are even rarer. In this case report, we discuss a 55-year-old man who had significant envenomation from a Shore Pit Viper (Trimeresurus Purpureomaculatus) and who was successfully treated with haemato-toxic polyvalent antivenom (HPAV). He initially presented with pain, swelling and bleeding over his wound. Due to a deterioration in his coagulation profile, he was given two doses of HPAV which is typically reserved for viperid snakes instead. Following administration of the anti-venom, the patient's coagulation profile improved, and the local soft tissue effects of the venom resolved. He did not manifest any adverse effects and was discharged uneventfully about 72 h after the snakebite. The cross-neutralization potential of HPAV for Shore Pit Viper (Trimeresurus Purpureomaculatus) venom in this case study suggests that there may be a possible common underlying chemical structure and pathophysiology among the venom proteins of various snake species. Given that Trimeresurus-specific antivenom is unavailable in most countries, this cross-neutralization strategy deserves further consideration and evaluation in similar circumstances.

Bites and envenomation — patient care goals and presentation emphasize that bites, stings, and envenomations can come from a variety of insects, marine, and terrestrial animals, and to assure adequate ventilation, oxygenation, and correction of hypoperfusion while providing pain control which also may include external interventions to reduce pain; patients may present with toxin specific reactions which may include site pain, swelling, muscle pain (hallmark of black widow spider bites), erythema, discoloration, bleeding, nausea, abdominal pain, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, muscle incoordination, confusion, and anaphylaxis/allergic reactions; the critical intervention is to get the patient to a hospital that has access to the antivenin if applicable; exclusion criteria: none noted.

### Evaluation of antivenom therapy for middle east scorpion envenomations [^111B8mnq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Scorpion envenomation is a leading cause of envenomation in our region. Antivenom has been used successfully to treat the systemic manifestations of envenomations inflicted by toxic scorpions. Toxic scorpions common in our area include Leiurus quinquestriatus, Androctonus australis, and Buthus occitanus. This study describes the outcomes of children envenomated by these scorpions, and treated with SCORPIFAV, a polyvalent scorpion antivenom F(ab') 2 (equine), used since 2016 at our institution.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of all children admitted with symptoms and signs of scorpion envenomation to Soroka University Medical Center, between September 1, 2019, and December 1, 2020, who received antivenom SCORPIFAV. Our center has a protocol mandating antivenom therapy for all patients manifesting autonomic excitation, agitation, and anxiety, or more pronounced symptoms, following suspected scorpion envenomation.

Results

Three hundred patients were seen in the pediatric emergency department for scorpion envenomation during the study period, and 49 required antivenom (SCORPIFAV) as per departmental policy. Four of 49 developed allergic reactions during antivenom treatment: 2 manifested minor skin rashes treated with antihistamines only, and a further 2 required intramuscular adrenaline. There were no deaths in the study cohort and all patients recovered fully, with complete resolution of symptoms, signs, and laboratory features.

Conclusions

Patients treated with antivenom exhibited rapid resolution of symptoms without severe hypersensitivity. We recommend broadened availability of antivenom at sites where it is needed.

Patients were monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions, including acute hypersensitivity reactions and. serum sickness.

Follow-up interviews were conducted at 5, 8, 15 and 22 days after treatment to assess symptoms of ongoing venom effect, serum sickness, and any other adverse reactions. Table 2 shows the adverse reactions occurring in patients across all clinical trials for ANAVIP. Seventy-six percent of patients. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ANAVIP. Because these reactions are reported as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs and voluntarily from a global population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
- Chest Pain/Discomfort
- Flushing
- Hypersensitivity
- Late Thrombocytopenia
- Necrosis
- Prolonged Prothrombin Time. experienced a recurrent coagulopathic effect. All adverse reactions in the pediatric patients were non-serious. The most frequent adverse reactions among pediatric patients were nausea and vomiting, itching, and fever.

Thus, the safety and efficacy in the pediatric population was not different from the adults.

### FDA warns about serious problems with high doses of the allergy… [^115moFAN]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug Safety Communication 09–24–2020 FDA Drug Safety Communication The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is warning that taking higher than recommended doses of the common over-the-counter allergy medicine diphenhydramine can lead to serious heart problems, seizures, coma, or even death. We are aware of news reports of teenagers ending up in emergency rooms or dying after participating in the "Benadryl Challenge" encouraged in videos posted on the social media application TikTok. We are investigating these reports and conducting a review to determine if additional cases have been reported. We will update the public once we have completed our review or have more information to share. We also contacted TikTok and strongly urged them to remove the videos from their platform and to be vigilant to remove additional videos that may be posted.

Always read the Drug Facts label included on all OTC medicines to find out if they contain diphenhydramine, how much and how often you should take them, and important safety information. Do not take more than the dose listed on the label, as doing so can cause serious problems. If someone takes too much diphenhydramine and is hallucinating, can't be awakened, has a seizure, has trouble breathing, or has collapsed, immediately get medical attention or contact poison control at 1–800–222–1222 or online. Health care professionals should be aware that the "Benadryl Challenge" is occurring among teens and alert their caregivers about it. Encourage teens and caregivers to read and follow the Drug Facts label. In the event of an overdose, health care professionals should attempt to determine whether a patient with a suspected overdose took diphenhydramine.

We urge health care professionals and consumers to report side effects involving diphenhydramine and other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the "Contact FDA" box at the bottom of the page. Health care professionals, patients, and consumers can sign up for email alerts about Drug Safety Communications on medicines or medical specialties of interest to you. Related Information

### Information on the use of antivenoms… [^114a7qmC]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Antivenoms produced by a foreign manufacturer not licensed by the U. S. are considered experimental drugs, and the Department of Health and Human Service requires an Investigational New Drug filing to permit their importation.
- An Investigational New Drug Application must be submitted.
- A statement naming a local physician, selected by your institution, under whose supervision the antivenom will be maintained and administered. A Statement of Investigator must accompany this statement for your new BB-IND or when there is a change.
- The name of each product, the name and address of the manufacturer, the species against whose venom the antivenom is claimed to be effective, and when available, the lot number of the product, together with a statement by the manufacturer that the antivenom has passed the applicable safety and sterility tests. The lot number and safety and sterility test results can be submitted to CBER upon receipt of the antivenom.
- A copy of the package insert for each of the product to be imported.
- A statement that the antivenom is being imported solely for emergency use and that the product will not be resold.
- A statement to the effect that, in the event the product is administered, a complete case report will be submitted to the Director, CBER. You need apply for the BB-IND number only once. The BB-IND number is permanent provided that your annual reports are appropriately submitted to CBER, stating either that no antivenom was used, or that the antivenom was used. If the antivenom was used during the year, a summary report about the incident must be included in the annual report.

Summary Steps To Be Taken When Importing Antivenom It is important to remember that three Federal agencies are involved in importation: The Department of Health and Human Services, The Department of Agriculture, and the U. S. Customs Service. All submissions to CBER related to a BB-IND will be in triplicate and accompanied by a completed and signed FDA Form 1571, citing the correct BB-IND number. Finally, it is important to remember that, in the event any foreign antivenom is used clinically, a complete case report must be submitted to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.
