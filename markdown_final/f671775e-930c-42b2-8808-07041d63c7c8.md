## Question

Globular heart

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the meaning, differential diagnosis, and management implications of a "globular heart" on chest radiograph. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the radiographic sign and its synonyms. Then, I should verify the key pathophysiologic mechanisms that produce this appearance. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis with supporting imaging clues. After that, I need to check the limitations of chest radiography and the cardiothoracic ratio, and outline the definitive next diagnostic steps. Finally, I will integrate guideline-based management considerations and summarize a practical clinical algorithm, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition and terminology so I don't mislabel the finding. A "globular heart" on chest radiograph refers to a rounded, flask-shaped or water bottle–shaped cardiac silhouette that loses the normal tapering at the apex and base, classically associated with pericardial effusion but also seen with marked right-sided chamber enlargement; synonyms include "water bottle sign" and "flask-shaped heart", and the descriptor signals a diffusely enlarged, rounded cardiac contour rather than focal chamber prominence [^1149iG5c] [^113hJ7Ar] [^111mNB2M].

> I will now examine the primary pathophysiologic mechanisms. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the two dominant causes are pericardial effusion, where fluid in the pericardial sac smooths the cardiac borders and rounds the silhouette, and right-sided chamber enlargement, particularly right atrial and right ventricular dilation, which alters the mediastinal contour and can mimic effusion on plain film; both patterns can coexist, and distinguishing them on CXR alone is unreliable, so I need to ensure I correlate with clinical context and advanced imaging [^1149iG5c] [^111mNB2M] [^1142yEvy].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis and prioritize it by prevalence and clinical significance. Let me think about pericardial effusion first: malignant effusions, idiopathic or viral pericarditis, autoimmune pericarditis, and tuberculous pericarditis are common etiologies, with TB pericarditis particularly prevalent in endemic settings and often presenting with a globular silhouette and pleural effusions; trauma and iatrogenic causes also belong on the list, and I should double-check for HIV-associated TB in the right epidemiology [^1149iG5c] [^113Jy9TX] [^116gG5iB]. For right-sided enlargement, I need to consider pulmonary hypertension with right heart strain, right heart failure from left-sided disease, and congenital lesions such as Ebstein anomaly or repaired tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary regurgitation; wait, I initially thought "pulmonary hypertension is the most common cause of right heart enlargement", but I should correct that to "a common cause", as chronic left heart disease and valvular lesions also contribute substantially [^1142yEvy] [^111mNB2M] [^113wmBmP]. Less common mimics include large left-sided chambers in advanced systolic failure, pericardial fat deposition causing pseudocardiomegaly, and mediastinal masses abutting the heart; I should keep these in mind when the silhouette is atypical or the clinical picture doesn't fit effusion or right-sided disease [^115ngxcZ] [^115HcXHx].

> Now, I need to check the diagnostic performance and limitations of chest radiography so I don't overstate what CXR can do. The sensitivity of a globular silhouette for pericardial effusion is limited, and a substantial volume of fluid (often around 200–250 mL) is typically required before the silhouette enlarges; critically, acute tamponade can occur with smaller volumes, so a normal cardiac silhouette does not exclude hemodynamic compromise, and I should verify hemodynamics at the bedside rather than relying on CXR alone [^117U9G6q]. Moreover, the cardiothoracic ratio correlates only weakly with true cardiac size by MRI, with poor discrimination in the 45–55% range; thus, I should avoid binary "cardiomegaly" calls based solely on CTR and instead correlate with echocardiography or CT/MRI when the diagnosis matters clinically [^1166z65x] [^113HeQTn] [^113b6BmF].

> Let me consider the definitive next diagnostic steps, and I should confirm the sequence to minimize delay. Transthoracic echocardiography is the first-line test to distinguish pericardial effusion from chamber enlargement, quantify effusion size, assess right heart size and function, and evaluate for tamponade physiology; if effusion is confirmed, I need to check for signs of tamponade and proceed to pericardiocentesis when indicated [^112UwMDa] [^116tgjPz]. If echocardiography is inconclusive or anatomy is complex, cardiac CT or MRI can precisely characterize pericardium, chambers, and masses; in suspected pulmonary hypertension, I should look for main pulmonary artery enlargement and pruning on CXR and confirm with echocardiography and, when needed, right heart catheterization per contemporary guidelines [^1142yEvy] [^111A6Wyw].

> I should double-check the ancillary radiographic clues that refine the differential while I await definitive imaging. Loss of the retrosternal airspace on lateral CXR suggests right ventricular enlargement, a prominent pulmonary artery segment with peripheral pruning suggests pulmonary hypertension, and a rightward shift of the cardiac silhouette beyond the spine suggests right atrial enlargement; pleural effusions may accompany right heart failure or pericardial disease, and I need to correlate these with the clinical exam and labs before concluding [^111mNB2M] [^1142yEvy].

> Next, I should review guideline-based management implications so my recommendations align with standards. In suspected or new-onset heart failure, obtain a CXR to assess heart size and pulmonary congestion, but do not use CXR alone to confirm or exclude HF; echocardiography is required to define ventricular function and valve status, and natriuretic peptides add diagnostic and prognostic value in acute dyspnea presentations [^113sYqT2] [^111TS1VV] [^114WXyAF]. For chest pain, CXR is reasonable to screen for alternative cardiopulmonary causes, but it should not delay urgent management when ACS or other time-sensitive conditions are suspected; similarly, in suspected pulmonary hypertension, CXR abnormalities are common but a normal film does not exclude disease, so I should escalate to echocardiography and guideline-directed testing as indicated [^116158qg] [^1142yEvy].

> But wait, what if the patient is unstable or the CXR is technically limited. I need to ensure I account for technique: supine AP films magnify cardiac size and degrade interpretability, so I should repeat a PA erect film when feasible; if tamponade is suspected clinically, I should not wait for repeat imaging — bedside echocardiography and hemodynamic assessment should proceed urgently, and pericardiocentesis should not be delayed for advanced imaging when life-threatening compression is present [^114BTxoH] [^116tgjPz].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical algorithm and sanity-check each step. If a globular cardiac silhouette is identified, I should immediately correlate with vitals, JVP, pulses, and lung exam; obtain transthoracic echocardiography to distinguish effusion from chamber enlargement and assess for tamponade; if effusion is present, evaluate etiology (including TB where relevant) and manage per tamponade physiology; if right-sided enlargement is found, assess for pulmonary hypertension, left heart disease, or congenital lesions and follow guideline-directed pathways; if the diagnosis remains uncertain or masses are suspected, proceed to cardiac CT or MRI; throughout, I should communicate that CTR alone is an imperfect surrogate and avoid overcalling "cardiomegaly" without chamber-specific confirmation [^112UwMDa] [^1142yEvy] [^1166z65x].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: a globular heart on CXR is a morphologic clue that prompts, but does not establish, a diagnosis; it most often reflects pericardial effusion or right-sided chamber enlargement, yet CXR has limited sensitivity and specificity, so echocardiography is mandatory to define anatomy and physiology, with CT/MRI and catheterization reserved for unresolved questions or complex disease; management should follow contemporary HF, pericardial disease, and pulmonary hypertension guidelines, anchored in clinical context rather than radiographic appearance alone [^113sYqT2] [^1142yEvy] [^112UwMDa].

---

A globular heart on chest radiograph most often reflects **pericardial effusion** (water bottle sign) [^1149iG5c] or **right-sided chamber enlargement** from pulmonary hypertension or right heart failure [^111mNB2M] [^1142yEvy]. Other causes include cardiomyopathy, large left atrium, mediastinal masses, and technical factors such as poor inspiratory effort or AP projection [^111M9H6i] [^115HcXHx] [^114BTxoH]. Confirm with **echocardiography** to distinguish effusion from chamber enlargement and guide management; if effusion is present, assess for tamponade and treat the underlying cause [^116tgjPz] [^112JF7ot].

## Radiographic features of a globular heart

A globular heart appears as a **rounded, flask-like cardiac silhouette** on chest radiography, often losing the normal cardiac contour. Key radiographic features include:

- **Pericardial effusion (water bottle sign)**: Smooth, uniform enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, often with a "water bottle" appearance [^1149iG5c] [^113hJ7Ar].
- **Right-sided chamber enlargement**: Loss of retrosternal airspace on lateral view, rightward displacement of the cardiac silhouette, and prominence of the pulmonary arteries [^111mNB2M] [^1142yEvy].
- **Left atrial enlargement**: Double density sign, splaying of the carina, and elevation of the left main bronchus [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and underlying conditions

A globular heart silhouette is **clinically significant** and may indicate several underlying conditions:

| **Category** | **Underlying conditions** |
|-|-|
| Pericardial effusion | - Pericarditis (infectious, autoimmune, idiopathic) [^1149iG5c] <br/> - Malignancy (metastatic disease, lymphoma) <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Uremia <br/> - Hypothyroidism [^notfound] |
| Right-sided chamber enlargement | - Pulmonary hypertension [^1142yEvy] <br/> - Right heart failure [^111mNB2M] <br/> - Tricuspid regurgitation <br/> - Atrial septal defect <br/> - Ebstein's anomaly [^notfound] |
| Left atrial enlargement | - Mitral stenosis <br/> - Mitral regurgitation <br/> - Left heart failure [^notfound] |
| Cardiomyopathy | - Dilated cardiomyopathy <br/> - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <br/> - Restrictive cardiomyopathy [^111M9H6i] |
| Mediastinal masses | - Pericardial cysts <br/> - Teratomas <br/> - Lymphoma [^115HcXHx] |
| Technical factors | - Poor inspiratory effort <br/> - AP projection <br/> - Obesity [^115ngxcZ] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

When a globular heart is identified on chest radiography, a **systematic diagnostic approach** is recommended:

- **Confirm with echocardiography**: Echocardiography is the gold standard to differentiate pericardial effusion from chamber enlargement and to assess cardiac function [^1149iG5c].
- **Evaluate for pericardial effusion**: If effusion is present, assess for signs of cardiac tamponade (elevated jugular venous pressure, hypotension, muffled heart sounds) and perform pericardiocentesis if indicated [^116tgjPz].
- **Assess cardiac chambers and function**: Evaluate for right or left atrial enlargement, ventricular dysfunction, and valvular abnormalities [^111A6Wyw].
- **Identify underlying causes**: Based on clinical history, laboratory tests, and imaging findings, determine the underlying etiology (e.g. infection, malignancy, autoimmune disease, pulmonary hypertension) [^1142yEvy].

---

## Clinical implications and management

The clinical implications and management of a globular heart depend on the **underlying cause**:

- **Pericardial effusion**: Management includes treating the underlying cause, monitoring for tamponade, and performing pericardiocentesis or pericardial window if tamponade is present [^notfound].
- **Right-sided chamber enlargement**: Management focuses on treating the underlying condition (e.g. pulmonary hypertension, valvular disease, congenital heart disease) and managing heart failure symptoms [^notfound].
- **Left atrial enlargement**: Management involves treating mitral valve disease, managing heart failure, and monitoring for complications such as atrial fibrillation and thromboembolism [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of chest radiography

Chest radiography has several limitations in evaluating a globular heart:

- **Limited sensitivity and specificity**: Radiography cannot reliably distinguish between pericardial effusion and chamber enlargement [^notfound].
- **Technical factors**: Poor inspiratory effort, obesity, and AP projection can mimic or obscure cardiomegaly [^114BTxoH].
- **False positives and negatives**: Radiography may miss or overestimate cardiac enlargement, necessitating confirmatory imaging [^115hGtGN].

---

A globular heart on chest radiograph is a **nonspecific finding** that may reflect pericardial effusion, chamber enlargement, cardiomyopathy, mediastinal masses, or technical factors. Confirm with **echocardiography** and tailor management to the underlying cause.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111mNB2M]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Chest radiograph — imaging signs of right-sided disease include a globular cardiac silhouette in cases of significant right ventricular (RV) enlargement, loss of the retrosternal airspace on a lateral projection indicating RV enlargement, and rightward displacement of the cardiac silhouette, well beyond the spine, which almost always represents right atrial (RA) enlargement. With coexisting pulmonary hypertension (PH), the main pulmonary artery (PA) will be enlarged and the distal PA branches may have a "pruned" appearance, and elevated central venous pressure (CVP) may be recognized by an enlarged azygous vein. Pulmonary vascular redistribution, increased interstitial markings, and Kerley lines are signs of pulmonary venous hypertension, and pleural effusions are frequent in severe right heart failure (RHF), particularly when pulmonary and systemic venous pressures are both elevated.

Direct visualization of pathologic changes in the heart has significantly influenced the diagnostic accuracy and management of patients with cardiovascular disease. This article presents an approach to plain film examination of the heart based on basic principles of radiologic evaluation. It emphasizes the relationship between the radiologic appearance of a structure and the technique used to obtain that image, and the relationship between the observation of a structural abnormality and the anatomic relationships that allow that observation to be made. This approach is simple, organized in a logical manner, and when applied rigorously results in not only accurate and insightful differential diagnosis, but also a deep understanding of cardiovascular disease processes.

### Cardiac and pericardial calcifications on chest radiographs [^114ye1oA]. Clinical Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Many types of cardiac and pericardial calcifications identified on chest radiographs can be recognized and distinguished based on characteristic locations and appearances. The purpose of this review is to emphasize the importance of detecting cardiac and pericardial calcifications on chest radiographs, and to illustrate and describe the various types of calcifications that may be encountered and how they may be differentiated from one another. Each type of cardiac and pericardial calcification is discussed, its location and appearance described, and its significance explained. Recognizing and understanding these calcifications is important as they are often encountered in daily practice and play an important role in patient care.

### A pictorial review of traumatic pericardial injuries [^117U9G6q]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

The chest radiograph has an established role in the initial trauma series, however it is limited in its ability to identify pericardial and cardiac injuries, and the main role of the chest radiograph is to identify other associated injuries (e.g. pneumothoraces, haemothoraces and pulmonary contusions). Plain radiograph findings that may portend a potential pericardial injury include an enlarged and/or globular cardiac outline (secondary to a pericardial effusion), pneumopericardium and alteration of the cardiac axis (Fig. 1a–c). With regards to a traumatic pericardial effusion, the presence of a normal cardiac silhouette occurs in up to 80% of trauma patients with acute tamponade as the pericardium has not had time to stretch. The accumulation of approximately 250 mL of fluid is required to enlarge the cardiac silhouette on a chest radiograph, but the accumulation of only 100–200 mL of fluid/blood within the pericardial space can result in physiological compromise and cardiac tamponade. The finding of pneumopericardium should alert the radiologist to consider loss of pericardial integrity. In severe cases, a tension pneumopericardium can develop with a resultant 'small heart' sign. Furthermore, the combination of pneumopericardium with displacement of the heart should alert the reporting radiologist to the possibility of cardiac herniation secondary to a pericardial tear (Fig. 2a–b). In the absence of pneumopericardium, displacement of the heart to the right or left without an obvious cause (e.g. compressive pneumothorax, haemothorax, air trapping in the lung or atelectasis) should also act as a warning sign for potential cardiac herniation. It is also important to bear in mind that there are reports of delayed presentation of cardiac herniation as herniation has also been described following the institution or discontinuation of positive pressure ventilation. Other findings that may suggest cardiac herniation include an unusual cardiac silhouette contour and a change in cardiac position after intercostal drain insertion.

### The cardiothoracic ratio – an inaccurate and outdated measurement: new data from CT [^113U3uQh]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiomegaly (and left ventricular size in particular) is well recognized to have cardiovascular prognostic significance. Cardiac assessment should be routinely performed when evaluating imaging studies encompassing the thorax, whether cross sectional or projectional. However, such measurements should be robust, readily available and practical. In this issue of European Radiology, Schlett et al. describe such a technique based on single level area and transverse diameter measurements on transverse CT and projection digitally acquired radiographs. This paper is significant as it makes a simple tool for left ventricular assessment readily available to all cross-sectional imagers and highlights the established limitation of cardiothoracic ratio on the chest radiograph.

### Limitations of cardiothoracic ratio derived from chest radiographs to predict real heart size: comparison with magnetic resonance imaging [^115hGtGN]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although CTR has an excellent interobserver agreement, is reproducible and easily measurable, it has little accuracy to distinguish a normal from an increased heart size when used as a single threshold method (i.e. CTR > 50%). Due to the lack of sensitivity and specificity of intermediate CTR values (45–55%), it would be more accurate to report a possibility of cardiac chamber enlargement rather than stating true cardiomegaly.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for heart failure, more specifically with respect to chest radiography, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain a CXR to assess heart size and pulmonary congestion and to detect alternative cardiac, pulmonary and other diseases likely to cause or contribute to the symptoms in patients with suspected or new-onset HF or presenting with acute decompensated HF.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest radiographs in acute chest pain — use and limits: "Chest radiographs are rapid, noninvasive tests that can be used to screen for several disorders that may present with chest pain", but "The yield of chest radiography depends on the pretest probability and will thus be higher when history or physical examination point to a greater likelihood of a given diagnosis", and "their use should be guided by clinical suspicion". Guideline-aligned supportive text notes, "The AHA/ACC guidelines for NSTE-ACS and heart failure all recommend chest radiographs on presentation, although this should not delay urgent revascularization if it is indicated", and specific utilities include that "In patients with acute chest pain and heart failure, chest radiographs are useful to assess heart size and pulmonary congestion", and "Chest radiographs may demonstrate a widened mediastinum in patients with aortic dissection, although they are not sensitive enough in this setting to rule out the diagnosis".

### The accuracy of chest radiographs in the detection of congenital heart disease and in the diagnosis of specific congenital cardiac lesions [^116J3iHp]. Pediatric Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Traditional teaching holds that specific types of CHD can be diagnosed on the chest radiograph (CXR) through pattern recognition.

Objective

To determine the accuracy of radiologists in detecting CHD on the CXR.

Materials and Methods

This study was a blinded retrospective review of chest radiographs from 281 patients (< 12 years) by five pediatric radiologists from three institutions. Thirteen groups were evaluated that included 12 categories of CHD and a control group of patients without heart disease. Radiographs were assessed for heart size, heart and mediastinal shape and vascularity. Clinical information, angiography, echocardiograms and surgery were used as the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.

Results

The average accuracy of the five readers in distinguishing normal from CHD patients was 78% (range of 72% to 82%). The overall measure of accuracy in distinguishing specific congenital cardiac lesions among 13 groups of patients was 71% (range of 63% to 79%).

Conclusion

CXR alone is not diagnostic of specific cardiac lesions, with a low accuracy of only 71%. We believe that less emphasis should be placed on the use of radiographs alone in diagnosing specific congenital cardiac lesions.

### Limitations of cardiothoracic ratio derived from chest radiographs to predict real heart size: comparison with magnetic resonance imaging [^113HeQTn]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points

CXR-derived CTR correlates weakly with cardiac chamber enlargement detected on cardiac MRI.
No single CTR cut-off value has good accuracy in diagnosing cardiomegaly.
The cut-off value of CTR > 50% has limited sensitivity and specificity.
Intermediate CTR values (45–55%) do not reliably indicate heart size.

2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline — chest x-ray in suspected heart failure: The chest x-ray is a useful initial diagnostic test for the evaluation of patients presenting with signs and symptoms of HF, but cardiomegaly may be absent in acute HF and findings such as cephalization, interstitial edema, and alveolar edema are relatively insensitive; considering the limited sensitivity and specificity, the chest x-ray should not be used as the only determinant of the specific cause or presence of HF.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111Cxddq]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest radiographs in acute chest pain — chest radiographs are rapid, noninvasive tests that can be used to screen for several disorders that may present with chest pain, and the yield of chest radiography depends on the pretest probability and will thus be higher when history or physical examination point to a greater likelihood of a given diagnosis. However, chest radiographs often do not lead to a diagnosis that requires intervention, and their use should be guided by clinical suspicion. The AHA/ACC guidelines for NSTE-ACS and heart failure all recommend chest radiographs on presentation, although this should not delay urgent revascularization if it is indicated. In patients with acute chest pain and heart failure, chest radiographs are useful to assess heart size and pulmonary congestion, as well as identifying potential pulmonary causes that may have contributed to symptoms, and may demonstrate a widened mediastinum in patients with aortic dissection, although they are not sensitive enough in this setting to rule out the diagnosis. Chest radiographs may be most useful to detect alternative cardiac, pulmonary, or other conditions that may cause symptoms, including pneumonia, pneumothorax, or rib fractures; pleural effusions, pulmonary artery enlargement, and infiltrates may suggest PE, which would need to be confirmed by further testing.

### Limitations of cardiothoracic ratio derived from chest radiographs to predict real heart size: comparison with magnetic resonance imaging [^112dFbej]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

One of the possible limitations of our study is the heterogeneous study population. However, this allowed to assess CTR in a spectrum of pathologies in different categories, likely translatable to broader practice. Secondly, the study was performed in a specialised cardiothoracic centre, meaning there was a low proportion of healthy individuals in the study (8%). Thirdly, our selected maximum interval between chest radiographs and cardiac MRI was one month, although the calculated average time difference was nine days. It is reasonable to assume that a time gap between studies in some cases might have been associated with clinical changes. However, in daily practice, chest radiograph and cardiac MRI are rarely performed on the same day (only 7% in our study sample). Therefore further studies assessing this may give some insight on whether the timeframe could have an influence. Thirdly, it would be interesting to evaluate separate cardiac chamber variations in the heart silhouette and whether this complements CTR to make it a more accurate measure. In this regard, artificial intelligence may play a role in automating and defining cardiac morphology on chest radiograph suggestive of underlying cardiac chamber abnormality. Furthermore, even though cardiac MRI is considered as the gold standard for cardiac volumetry and function, regrettably, the technique, while being increasingly used, is not yet available in every setting and is time-consuming. Hence, CXR cannot be replaced by MRI, but CTR, as an estimate of true cardiac size, should be interpreted with caution and correlated with other available imaging modalities. Finally, CTR itself has limitations due to various cardiac and non-cardiac factors. To address this, we have constrained the impact of this limitation by excluding AP radiographs or patients with pleural or pericardial effusions obscuring the cardiac borders on chest radiographs.

### Water bottle-shaped heart in a five-year-old boy [^1149iG5c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

A 5-year-old previously healthy Somali boy presented to our mission hospital in rural Kenya with a 2 week history of a gradual onset of fever, chest discomfort, and difficulty in breathing, accompanied by nonproductive cough, easy fatiguability, and loss of appetite.

Vital signs were as follows: temperature 39.6°C, heart rate 105, respiratory rate 40, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and weight 13 kg with a mid-upper arm circumference of 11.5 (indicating severe malnutrition). Physical examination was notable for a thin, ill-appearing boy sitting upright in bed. Heart sounds were muffled; peripheral pulses were full. Breath sounds were clear despite being tachypneic. The rest of his physical examination was normal for age.

Laboratory investigations were significant for a white blood cell count of 32,300 mm 3 (75% granulocytes, 14% lymphocytes, and 11% monocytes), hemoglobin 8.2 g/dL, and platelets 393,000/mm 3. Testing for HIV by rapid antigen test and for tuberculosis (TB) via GeneXpert of a gastric aspirate was negative. Chest radiograph showed an enlarged, globular cardiac silhouette (Figure 1) with unremarkable lung fields. Bedside echocardiography showed good contractility, normal appearing valves, and a moderate pericardial effusion with extensive fibrinous exudate (arrow) extending from the pericardium to the epicardium (Figure 2). A clinical diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB with tuberculous pericarditis was made.

Figure 1.
Chest radiograph showing water bottle shaped heart.

Figure 2.
Parasternal long axis view showing moderate pericardial effusion and fibrinous exudate (arrow).

Pericarditis is a well-known extrapulmonary manifestation of TB and the most common cause of pericardial effusion in the resource-limited setting. Despite this boy having the classic water bottle appearance to the cardiac silhouette, radiography has low sensitivity for detecting pericardial effusion. Echocardiogram is the definitive test to confirm the presence of pericardial effusion, especially when fibrinous material is observed.

He was started on four drug anti-TB regimen and prednisone 2 mg/kg for the pericardial effusion. A Cochrane review from 2017 suggested that HIV-negative individuals with TB pericarditis may have reduced incidence of death if treated with corticosteroids.

Repeat echocardiogram after 14 days of therapy showed near complete resolution of the effusion (Figure 3). He was discharged on day 22 of hospitalization.

Chest radiography — abnormal findings are present in most patients with pulmonary hypertension, yet a normal chest X-ray does not exclude the diagnosis; characteristic signs include a configuration of the cardiac silhouette due to right heart (right atrium [RA]/RV) and pulmonary artery enlargement with pruning of peripheral vessels, and additional signs may indicate the underlying cause such as left heart disease or lung disease.

### Clinical significance of cardiomegaly caused by cardiac adiposity [^115ngxcZ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray (CXR) in the absence of cardiopulmonary disease is often dismissed as "pseudocardiomegaly". We aimed to assess the impact of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) on radiographic heart size and to determine the clinical significance of cardiomegaly caused by EAT. In total 112 patients (52 ± 13 years old, 53% women, body mass index 32 ± 8 kg/m(2)) with structurally normal hearts by transthoracic echocardiography underwent cardiac computed tomography (CCT). EAT volume was measured by CCT and cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) and cardiac transverse and lateral horizontal transverse diameters were measured on posteroanterior and lateral view CXR. EAT volume (mean 122 ± 49 ml) correlated directly with age, body mass index, hypertension, hyperlipidemia (p < 0.05 for all comparisons), transverse diameter (r = 0.50, p < 0.001), CTR (r = 0.45, p < 0.001), and lateral horizontal transverse diameter (r = 0.38, p < 0.001). EAT volume was larger in those with increased (n = 22) compared to those with normal (n = 90) CTR (154 ± 54 vs 115 ± 54 ml, p = 0.0005). Patients with cardiomegaly were also older (58 ± 13 vs 50 ± 12 years old, p = 0.009) and more often had diabetes (32% vs 9%, p = 0.03), hypertension (86% vs 46%, p = 0.001), hyperlipidemia (68% vs 44%, p = 0.04), or obstructive coronary artery disease by CCT (32% vs 11%, p = 0.04). Coronary artery calcium score was also higher in those with cardiomegaly (median 56 [first tertile 0, third tertile 298] vs 0 [0, 55], p = 0.006). In conclusion, cardiomegaly on CXR can be caused by excessive EAT. This is associated with several coronary risk factors and with coronary calcification and stenosis. Cardiomegaly in this setting may be regarded as another noninvasive marker of coronary atherosclerosis.

### Limitations of cardiothoracic ratio derived from chest radiographs to predict real heart size: comparison with magnetic resonance imaging [^1166z65x]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) in chest radiographs is still widely used to estimate cardiac size despite the advent of newer imaging techniques. We hypothesise that a universal CTR cut-off value of 50% is a poor indicator of cardiac enlargement. Our aim was to compare CTR with volumetric and functional parameters derived from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Methods

309 patients with a chest radiograph and cardiac MRI acquired within a month were reviewed to assess how CTR correlates with multiple cardiac MRI variables: bi-ventricular EDV (absolute and indexed to body surface area), EF, indexed total heart volume and bi-atrial areas. In addition, we have also determined CTR accuracy by creating multiple ROC curves with the described variables.

Results

All cardiac MRI variables correlate weakly but statistically significantly with CTR. This weak correlation is explained by a substantial overlap of cardiac MRI parameters in patients with normal and increased CTR. For all variables, CTR was only mildly to moderately better than a chance to discriminate cardiac enlargement (AUC 0.6–0.7). Large CTR values (> 55%) are specific but not sensitive, while low CTR values (< 45%) are sensitive but not specific. Values in between are not sensitive nor specific.

Conclusions

CTR correlates weakly with true chamber size assessed by gold standard cardiac MRI and has a weak discriminatory power. Thus, clinical decisions based on intermediate CTRs (45–55%) should be avoided. Large CTRs (> 55%) are likely indicative of true heart chamber enlargement. Low CTRs (< 45%) are likely indicative of normal heart size.

The silhouette sign refers to the absence of depiction of an anatomical soft-tissue border. The silhouette sign results from the juxtaposition of structures of similar radiographic attenuation and this sign actually refers to the absence of a silhouette. It is caused by consolidation and/or atelectasis of the adjacent lung, a large mass or by contiguous pleural fluid. However, it is not always indicative of disease; for example, the absence of a right heart border on chest radiograph can result from pectus excavatum.

A footnote to the original World Health Organization definitions refers to the silhouette sign as follows: "In the presence of any visible adjacent opacity, a silhouette sign, where the length of loss of an anatomical border is greater or equal to the length of a posterior rib and one adjacent rib space at the same level, is considered to indicate of endpoint consolidation. A silhouette sign of this size without a visible adjacent opacity is considered to fulfill the definition of other infiltrate". This is illustrated in Fig. 3.

### Cardiac silhouette findings and mediastinal lines and stripes: radiograph and CT scan correlation [^111Y2JKk]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Despite the increased use of CT imaging, chest radiography remains a very important diagnostic modality in the evaluation of lung parenchymal and mediastinal diseases, providing a vast amount of useful information. This information is generally derived from the relationships among the normal anatomic structures of the mediastinum, pleura, and lungs, which represent the basis of the "cardiac silhouette" and "mediastinal lines-and-stripes" concepts that potentially play an important role in the establishment of a diagnosis or a spectrum of diagnoses before proceeding to CT imaging. The capability of recognizing an abnormal chest radiograph on the basis of the displacement, deformation, or obscuration of one of these structures when compared with those in normal findings is often mandatory prior to requesting a potentially useful CT scan examination. Therefore, radiologists, trainees, and physicians must be familiar with the anatomic basis of those findings to be able to recognize the normal and abnormal appearance of structures when developing an appropriate differential diagnosis. In this review, we briefly describe the cardiac silhouette concepts and the mediastinal lines-and-stripes configurations as they relate to the radiographic and CT scan appearance of structures for a spectrum of pathologic diseases and list the possible underlying causes of the displacement, deformation, or obscuration of the structures.

### Limitations of cardiothoracic ratio derived from chest radiographs to predict real heart size: comparison with magnetic resonance imaging [^1151ynCi]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Notably, patients with several cardiac pathologies have been included in the present study, thus covering a broad spectrum of cardiac morphologies. Nevertheless, reliance on CTR is based on the fact that even isolated chamber enlargement impacts the whole cardiac silhouette. Typically, LV dilatation causes leftward, downward and backward rotation of the heart in a clockwise direction. However, it can also result in anticlockwise rotation, which is not expressed as increased CTR on chest radiographs. Furthermore, RV does not contribute to the left heart contour unless severely dilated as the sternum limits its expansion. Only if dilated enough, RV may rotate leftwards, push the left ventricle and increase the left heart border. This may help to explain the particularly low correlation found between CTR and RV volumes. As CTR effectively represents the transverse diameter between the RA and LV (which form the right and left heart borders, respectively), it might be expected to reflect more accurately the enlargement of these chambers. However, neither RA area nor LV volume showed stronger correlations with CTR than other parameters.

A large number of cases with normal CTR revealed another interesting aspect of our study. A normal CTR was determined in 62.8% of patients, even though only 8.1% of individuals had normal cardiac MRI scans. Therefore, a CTR < 50% on chest radiographs does not seem to be a reliable indicator to exclude cardiac pathology. Dimopoulos et al. also found that only 56.4% of adult congenital heart disease patients had an increased CTR on chest radiographs. In addition, some authors state that even a normal CTR could be related to poor clinical outcomes. Jun et al. determined that a CTR greater than 42% was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention. Of note, in our population, such values were rare, as only 22 individuals out of 309 (7%) had a CTR of ≤ 42%.

Pericardial disease

Tuberculous pericarditis is a relatively uncommon complication of primary tuberculosis. It has been reported in 1% of cases. It is commonly caused by direct extension of lymph nodes into the posterior pericardial sac, although miliary spread has been reported. CT shows lymphadenopathy and pericardial thickening with or without effusion. Constrictive pericarditis with fibrous or calcified pericardial thickening of usually > 3 mm occur in about 10% of patients. Pericardial effusion (Figs. 15, 16 and 17), commonly serous type, can result in globular enlargement of the heart shadow (water bottle sign).

### Limitations of cardiothoracic ratio derived from chest radiographs to predict real heart size: comparison with magnetic resonance imaging [^114BTxoH]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chest radiographs (CXR) are routinely used to assess the lungs and mediastinum. Cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) is a simple method to evaluate the heart size on chest radiographs. Despite having been introduced more than 100 years ago, it is still commonly reported nowadays, even though new imaging techniques have been developed. This is probably because CTR can be easily measured and simply interpreted on a widely available and inexpensive imaging study. Nevertheless, CTR depends on multiple technical and anatomic factors that can contribute to an inaccurate assessment of the real heart size. CTR is only considered reliable if calculated from a frontal upright postero-anterior (PA) chest radiograph. The supine position and any other antero-posterior (AP) projection overestimate cardiac size due to a magnification effect caused by the heart being closer to the imaging cassette. In addition, there are other cardiac and non-cardiac aspects such as sub-optimal inspiratory effort, patient's or thoracic cage abnormalities that could influence the value of CTR.

### Heart size on chest X-ray as a predictor of cardiac enlargement by echocardiography in children [^112JF7ot]. Pediatric Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the usefulness of heart size on chest radiograph (CXR) in predicting cardiac enlargement (CE) in children, we prospectively evaluated 95 consecutive outpatients, who had both a CXR and echocardiography performed. Their median age was 5.0 years (2 days to 19.9 years). All patients underwent CXR assessment by a pediatric radiologist, with classification of cardiac silhouette as normal, borderline, or enlarged. Echocardiographic assessment of CE was performed by a pediatric echocardiographer. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the pediatric radiologist's interpretation of heart size on CXR were estimated. The presence of CE by echocardiography was used as the gold standard. Seventy-nine patients (83.2%) had no CE on CXR, and 16 patients (16.8%) had CE. Sensitivity of the CXR to identify CE was 58.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [32.9, 81.6], with a positive predictive value of 62.5% [35.4, 84.8]. Specificity was 92.3% [84.0, 97.1], with a negative predictive value of 91.1% [82.6, 96.4]. These data suggest that the assessment of CE on CXR to predict CE by echocardiography has a relatively high specificity and negative predictive value, but a low sensitivity and positive predictive value. The limitations of CXR as a diagnostic test should be understood by clinicians using the test when screening children for cardiac disease.

### Limitations of cardiothoracic ratio derived from chest radiographs to predict real heart size: comparison with magnetic resonance imaging [^115WoaeY]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding CT, CTR can be derived from the CT itself, using the scout images or axial slices. While this allows overcoming the limitation of a time gap that previous studies encountered when comparing two different imaging modalities, it is important to note that CT images are acquired in the supine position. Schlett et al. used anteroposterior scout images to calculate the CTR and found that CTR did not correlate with CT derived end-diastolic LV volume, mass or size (all p ≥ 0.27). On the other hand, all these mentioned LV parameters showed significant correlation with a simple axial LV area-based measurement, suggesting that on CT, other straightforward measurements may be applied instead of traditional CTR. Regarding CTR as a single parameter, CTRs obtained by CXR and CT correlated (r = 0.802) in a study of cancer patients by Gollub et al. The authors also showed a limited ability of CT-derived CTR to recognise LV hypertrophy determined by echocardiography (AUC was 0.71).

Generally, the complexity of the heart and extracardiac factors, as described in our study, undermines the value of a single cut-off of CTR. Thus, our results support the evidence that the reliability of CTR to predict cardiac size and functional status is limited.

### Limitations of cardiothoracic ratio derived from chest radiographs to predict real heart size: comparison with magnetic resonance imaging [^112H1Xet]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

CTR is defined as the ratio between the maximal horizontal cardiac diameter and the maximal horizontal inner thoracic cage diameter. A CTR > 0.5 (or > 50%) is considered abnormal. In radiology reports, terms like "cardiomegaly" or "increased heart size" are commonly used to describe an increased CTR. Despite its broad use, some researchers have questioned the real value of this arbitrary cut-off point. For example, in a study with patients undergoing coronary angiography due to angina, a CTR between 42 and 49% was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality or major coronary event (death, non-fatal myocardial infarction) compared to patients with CTR < 42%.

In modern diagnostic imaging, newer modalities allow to thoroughly examine the three-dimensional structure of the heart, assessing chamber size and function. Some studies have questioned the correlation between CTR and cardiac parameters derived from other imaging techniques with controversial results. In comparisons done within specific cardiac pathologies, there is usually an absence of correlation with CTR or CTR correlates with the size of only one or two cardiac chambers. A systematic review by Loomba et al. showed that CTR is sensitive for identifying an increased left ventricular volume on echocardiography (sensitivity 83.3%) but lacks specificity (45.4%). Larger CTRs were related to increased mortality risk in adults with congenital heart disease. Apart from chest radiographs, CTR can also be measured using other imaging modalities like CT and MRI. However, Schlett et al. found that CTR derived from CT scout images did not correlate to LV parameters measured from the same CT scan.

Cardiac MRI is a modern, high-resolution, ionising radiation-free technique that is now considered the gold standard for cardiac volumetry and function assessment. We hypothesise that the cut off value of CTR = 50% is a poor indicator of cardiac enlargement and should be interpreted with caution. The primary aim of this study was to compare the CTR to indexed cardiac volumetry values. Secondary objectives were: (1) to evaluate the isolated correlation between CTR and individual cardiac chamber measurements, (2) to stratify the results by age and gender using the dedicated normal cardiac MRI values for comparison.

A chest CT is warranted in all adult patients with high-energy torso trauma, a positive chest radiograph, or positive findings on physical examination, and chest CT has low sensitivity for detection of blunt cardiac injury. In pediatrics, for the pediatric patient with minor abnormalities on chest radiograph, chest CT is reported to have no impact on subsequent management, whereas a chest CT is recommended for children with an abnormal contour of the mediastinum to an age-appropriate shaped chest.

ROC curve analysis corroborated the poor discriminatory value of CTR with AUCs only mildly above "chance" when using cardiac MRI values as the gold standard. No single CTR cut-off point was able to classify increased and normal chamber sizes accurately. Low CTR thresholds were associated with many false positives (patients with higher CTR on CXR but normal heart size on cardiac MRI). Larger CTR thresholds failed to identify most patients with abnormal cardiac MRI parameters, thus giving very few true positive results. Yet, CTR showed value when extreme measurements were found. That is to say, the likelihood of having an increased heart size is high when a CTR > 55% is found, as is the likelihood of having a normal heart size with a CTR < 45%.

Although cardiac MRI is considered the gold standard to assess cardiac volumes and function, it is not always accessible or even indicated. Other imaging modalities such as echocardiography and CT are also available for cardiac evaluation. Meta-analysis performed by Loomba et al. showed that CTR was sensitive but not specific to detect left ventricular dilatation determined by echocardiography: after assessing six studies with a total of 466 patients, the authors concluded that CTR had 83.3% sensitivity, 45.4% specificity, 43.5% positive predictive value and 82.7% negative predictive value. However, after one study with a paediatric population was excluded, specificity significantly decreased to 25.2%. On the contrary, CTR in patients with NSTEMI showed lower sensitivity (40%) but higher specificity (91%) in detecting cardiomegaly compared to echocardiography, however in this study, cardiomegaly was described as an enlargement of the right or left ventricle. Furthermore, Chana et al. found CTR to have a limited value in detecting left and/or right ventricular dysfunction (0.7 AUC, 73.9% sensitivity and 47.4% specificity).

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is common in HIV-infected patients, especially at lower CD4 cell counts, yet is often difficult to diagnose with certainty. A 35-year-old man presented with dyspnoea and constitutional symptoms of tuberculosis (TB). Laboratory investigations included a positive HIV test and a CD4 cell count of 138 cells/μL. Chest radiography revealed a globular-shaped heart and bilateral pleural effusions, while echocardiography confirmed a massive pericardial effusion. The new Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay detected rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis in pericardial as well as sputum samples. Smear of the pericardial sample was negative. The patient was started on anti-TB treatment and is presently well. He will initiate antiretroviral therapy after 4–6 weeks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of EPTB diagnosed on pericardial fluid using the Xpert assay in Africa. This report also summarises the use of this assay in the diagnosis of EPTB in HIV-associated TB.

Comparison of patients with normal and increased CTR

The CTR on CXR was normal in 194 cases (62.8%) and > 50% in 115 cases (37.2%). When grouped, patients with an increased CTR showed more abnormal cardiac MRI parameters than those with normal CTR (expressed as higher average/median ventricular volumes and atrial areas or lower ventricular ejection fraction) (Table 3). These differences were statistically significant. Nevertheless, there was a substantial overlap of individual cardiac MRI values between groups, which explains the low correlation coefficients (Figs. 3, 4).

Fig. 4
Density plots representing distributions of cardiac MRI parameters in patients with normal and increased CTR. Density plots are a variation of histograms that allow to observe the distribution of a variable in a dataset in a continuous fashion. They are instrumental in demonstrating the extensive overlap of cardiac MRI derived values between patients with normal and increased CTR. Dashed lines represent the means for each distribution. Note that mean values are larger in patients with CTR > 50%. This explains the described positive but weak correlations.

Biventricular cardiac MRI parameters were grouped into normal and abnormal according to their age and sex reference values. There was a weak but significant association (r φ < 0.4, p < 0.05) between an increased CTR, increased indexed biventricular volumes, increased LV mass and decreased biventricular ejection fraction. ROC curves were used to represent the sensitivity and specificity of multiple CTR values graphically. A truly increased heart size was defined as increased LVEDV, LVEDVi, RVEDVi, LA area, and RA area. True-positive results (Se) and false-positive results (1-Sp) were plotted together for each variable. The diagnostic accuracy of CTR was then inferred from the area under the curve (AUC). For all variables, CTR was only mildly to moderately better than the chance to discriminate cardiac enlargement (AUC 0.6–0.7) with a large number of false positives (low Sp) and false negatives (low Se), see Table 4. However, low CTR cut-off points produced very few false-negative results, and large CTR values have few false-positive results (Fig. 5, Additional file 1: Fig. S1).

### When, why, and how to examine the heart during thoracic CT: part 1, basic principles [^1153w1JK]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

MDCT systems with fast scanning capabilities can acquire images of the thorax with reduced cardiac motion artifacts, enabling improved evaluation of the heart and surrounding structures in the course of routine thoracic CT. This article describes the principles of including an evaluation of the heart in the course of a chest CT examination in terms of both examination technique and image interpretation. In addition, both the normal appearances and some of the most common abnormal appearances of the cardiac structures will be described.

Conclusion

Details concerning the cardiac structures can inform interpretation of thoracic CT studies and can influence the patient's clinical management. Both unenhanced and contrast-enhanced scans can detect significant cardiac disorders that may otherwise go undetected. In certain situations, a CT examination of the entire chest, complemented by cardiac gating, can provide a more dedicated analysis of the heart and coronary arteries, providing both morphologic and functional information.

### Cardiac findings on non-gated chest computed tomography: a clinical and pictorial review [^114Y7KeX]. European Journal of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The use of chest computed tomography (CT) as an imaging test for the evaluation of thoracic pathology has significantly increased during the last four decades. Although cardiopulmonary diseases often overlap in their clinical manifestation, radiologists tend to overlook the heart while interpreting routine chest CT. Recent advances in CT technology have led to significant reduction of heart motion artefacts and now allow for the identification of several cardiac findings on chest CT even without electrocardiogram (ECG) gating. These observations range from simple curiosity to both benign and malignant discoveries, to life-threatening discoveries. We here present a clinical and radiologic review of common and less common cardiac findings discovered on non-gated chest CT in order to draw the attention of radiologists and referring physicians to these possibilities.

### Who should be reading chest radiographs in the pediatric emergency department? [^116FmHtL]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pediatric emergency department chest radiographs are frequently interpreted by the pediatrician, and patient management is based on this interpretation.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the chest radiograph interpretation discordance rate between pediatricians and pediatric radiologists and determine its clinical significance.

Methods

This study included 1196 patients admitted off-hours to the pediatric emergency department who had chest radiographs as part of the clinical evaluation. The pediatricians' interpretations of the chest radiographs as appeared in the discharge reports were reviewed and compared with the specialist radiologist's ultimate report.

Results

Discordant chest radiograph interpretations were found in 332 (28%) of 1196 patients. Of these, 76 (6.3%) were clinically significant. These included 59 initial diagnoses of normal or viral patterns subsequently interpreted as bacterial pattern by the radiologist and 17 radiographs with findings such as chronic lung disease or abnormal heart shadow overlooked or misinterpreted by the pediatrician.

Conclusions

Although the clinically significant discordant rate was relatively low, daily chest radiograph reassessment by pediatric radiologists in a joint meeting with pediatricians has an added value for patient safety, quality assurance, and mutual training.

### Sudden cardiac death in adults with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries [^112zuiVb]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Case 2

A man aged 29 years with ccTGA and an associated infracristal VSD and systemic AV valve incompetence (mild–moderate) was diagnosed on angiography at 11 months of age. He underwent VSD repair and systemic AV valve replacement (Carbomedics 25 mm prosthesis) at 7 years of age. A year later, the prosthetic valve had thrombosed despite warfarin anticoagulation and was subsequently replaced with a 23 mm St Jude prosthesis. Other medications included digoxin and diuretics. He was a lifelong non-smoker and did not consume excessive amounts of alcohol.

In the months prior to his death, the patient had recurrent episodes of severe left-sided chest discomfort and nausea for 2–3 months, appearing to coincide with periods of subtherapeutic anticoagulation (international normalised ratio (INR) 1.2–1.4). He was reviewed by a cardiologist 4 months prior to his death. Examination was unremarkable and there were no signs of heart failure. His ECG revealed sinus bradycardia with occasional premature ventricular complexes, PR duration 202 ms and QRS duration 106 ms. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring revealed an average rate of 58 bpm, occasional atrial and ventricular ectopy with rare ventricular couplets. There were no sinus pauses. Chest radiograph demonstrated a globular heart that was unchanged from previous chest radiographs. TTE showed mild obstruction of the valve prosthesis (with good movement of both disc leaflets) and mild impairment of the systemic ventricle.

Owing to the risk of prosthetic valve thrombosis due to subtherapeutic INR, he was bridged with subcutaneous enoxaparin when INR was subtherapeutic and a target INR of 2.5–4 was established. At clinical evaluation 2 months before his death, the chest pain had settled, and he was otherwise well.

The National Death Index registry identified the cause of death as a motor vehicle accident due to the patient's car colliding with a stationary object, resulting in multiple injuries and death. Arrhythmia may have been a significant contributory factor; however, this cannot definitively be determined.

### Diaphragm position on chest radiograph to estimate lung volume in neonates [^113ivooq]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Our findings do not invalidate the use of chest radiographs in the NICU for other purposes, such as diagnosing pathologies. Chest radiographs provide additional information on abnormal aeration states such as radiolucency/opacity, bulging ribs, flattened diaphragm, or abnormal heart shape. Although we documented these features, due to the poor association with lung volume, we did not assess a potential composite score involving diaphragm position and other subjective measures of abnormal aeration status. Previous attempts have not significantly improved accuracy, likely due to the subjectivity of each. We contend that it is more appropriate to use a combination of clinical and diagnostic radiographic features to assess lung volume rather than diaphragm position alone. Oxygenation, carbon dioxide, and tidal volume all directly relate to lung volume in neonates, particularly significant hyperinflation or hypoinflation. Unlike chest radiographs, these measures allow for dynamic assessment after changes in mechanical support. In contrast, chest radiography is a static single snapshot of the lung and radiation exposure limits repeated use.

The ideal diaphragm position for infants is usually stated to be between the 7th and 9th posterior rib. In our study, despite a robust sample size, we found that 95% of diaphragm positions were distributed between the 8th and 10th posterior rib. Potentially many infants in our study had well-aerated lungs with optimized respiratory support as all infants were being closely monitored during the CT scan. Alternatively, most infants have a diaphragm position within normal limits regardless of the extent of respiratory pathology. Interestingly, the only other studyto assess diaphragm position in neonates, and specifically those preterm, reported a range of 8 to 11 posterior ribs. In our study, 35% of the infants were intubated, and 61% had a degree of parenchymal opacification or consolidation. Thus, our study population was not standardized but had a diverse range of aeration states reflective of the NICU population. Furthermore, parenchymal opacification or consolidation was reported less on CREs than CT indicating that chest radiographs may lack the precision to detect more subtle parenchymal changes.

A round lucency in the right lower zone was reported as aerated lung and not a cavity

Compounding the interpretation and descriptive differences of radiologists are the limitations of chest radiography itself. Interpretation of chest radiographs is subjective and is challenging for both clinicians and expert radiologists. This is because chest radiographs are two-dimensional and are therefore compromised by superimposition of normal and abnormal structures, with resultant summation artefacts and hidden pathology. The single-projection chest radiograph, as recommended by the British Thoracic Society guideline, masks up to 40% of lung by the overlying normal soft-tissue structures such as the heart and diaphragms. Despite this, the current British Thoracic Society guidelines hold the position that a lateral view is unhelpful, while other groups such as the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the WHO require anteroposterior and lateral views for diagnosis, as stated in their guidelines.

### Amyloidosis: modern cross-sectional imaging [^113bnxDv]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Amyloidosis is a rare diverse condition caused by the pathologic extracellular deposition of abnormal insoluble proteins throughout the body. It may exist as a primary disease or, more commonly, may be secondary to a wide variety of pathologic processes ranging from chronic infection or inflammation to malignancy. Hereditary forms also exist. On the basis of the structure of the protein deposits, more than two dozen subtypes of amyloidosis have been described. A single organ or multiple organ systems may be affected. The radiologic manifestations of amyloidosis are varied and often nonspecific, making amyloidosis a diagnostic challenge for the radiologist. In the chest, the lungs, mediastinum, pleura, and heart may be involved. Lung involvement may manifest as diffuse reticulonodular interstitial thickening, consolidations, or solitary or multiple parenchymal nodules that may calcify, cavitate, and slowly enlarge. Pleural involvement most commonly manifests as pleural effusions. Tracheobronchial involvement may exhibit concentric airway thickening, mural and intraluminal nodules, submucosal calcification, and airway obstruction. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes may enlarge and frequently calcify. At cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, the left ventricular wall is typically thickened, with associated diastolic dysfunction. Delayed contrast material-enhanced cardiac MR imaging typically shows global transmural or subendocardial enhancement. The pathophysiology, classification, treatment, and prognosis of amyloidosis are reviewed, followed by case examples of the appearance of thoracic and cardiac amyloidosis on chest radiographs, computed tomographic (CT) images, and cardiac MR images.

### Limitations of cardiothoracic ratio derived from chest radiographs to predict real heart size: comparison with magnetic resonance imaging [^115D5vsF]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study aims to determine the reliability of CTR to predict cardiac enlargement by comparing the CTR values to cardiac parameters. Our results have shown a weak but statistically significant correlation between CTR and cardiac MRI defined parameters related to cardiac size. This weak correlation is explained by the substantial overlap of all measured cardiac MRI values in patients with normal and increased CTR. Although patients with CTR > 50% tend to have larger ventricular volumes and atrial areas, many patients with a normal CTR have abnormal cardiac MRI values. Interestingly, CTR correlated significantly with all ventricular and atrial measurements, despite having a broad spectrum of pathologies. In a heterogeneous adult population of our study, the cardiac chamber responsible for an increased CTR is variable, as is the number of enlarged chambers.

Compared to a paediatric population study performed by Grotenhuis et al. (including congenital heart diseases, aortic regurgitation and HCM), our results show that the THVi correlated better with CTR in adults than in children (r = 0.41 vs. r = 0.27). However, correlation with isolated chambers' enlargement was substantially better in children. In paediatric patients with Tetralogy of Fallot, the RVEDVi and CTR correlated weakly (r = 0.4), and in those with aortic regurgitation, the LVEDVi and CTR showed moderate correlation (r = 0.5). In this regard, a more homogenous sample is a plausible explanation for the stronger correlation between ventricular volumes and CTR, as seen in paediatric patients (i.e. enlargement of the RV is the expected cause of increased CTR in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot, as is dilated LV in patients with aortic regurgitation). On the other hand, Spiewak et al. did not find a correlation between CTR and ventricular volumes in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot but reported a weak but statistically significant correlation with atrial volumes. This weak correlation is maintained in our adult population. Anyhow, the commented heterogeneity of results among studies is in keeping with the poor discriminatory value of CTR regarding true cardiac size, which is likely translatable in routine settings.

### Did I miss that: subtle and commonly missed findings on chest radiographs [^117FoAVJ]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

This article reviews examples of easily missed, subtle, or ambiguous lesions on chest radiography. Anecdotally, reliance on cross-sectional imaging has diminished radiologists׳ comfort level with chest radiograph interpretation. However, plain film chest radiography remains a valuable tool in diagnostic imaging. It is noninvasive, inexpensive, easily obtained, and diagnostic for many common conditions with the benefit of a very low radiation dose. It is one of the most commonly ordered radiographic examinations; therefore, proficiency in chest radiograph interpretation remains an essential tool in our diagnostic armamentarium. Certain anatomical regions on chest radiographs are particularly prone to perceptual errors. These are often referred to as "blind spots" and have been emphasized as we demonstrate methods that can be applied to search patterns to improve detection of abnormalities.

### Every second counts: signs of a failing heart on thoracic CT in the ED [^111HAzZ9]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Impending cardiac failure is often difficult to recognize and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Upon arrival in the emergency department, patients are promptly screened for potentially life-threatening conditions through a history and physical examination. In many cases, the diagnosis is not clear until confirmatory laboratory or imaging tests are performed. Unfortunately, patients can rapidly decompensate as this diagnostic information is being obtained. Emergent CT plays a key role in identifying conditions that may result in cardiovascular collapse, including severe congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, and impending cardiac failure. Characteristic imaging findings can prompt the physician to take immediate action and prepare for resuscitation.

Cardiac imaging and electrocardiography — modalities for evaluating suspected heart failure (HF) are described as follows: Radionuclide ventriculography provides accurate measurements of left ventricular (LV) function and right ventricular ejection fraction but cannot directly assess valvular abnormalities or hypertrophy; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography may be useful for chamber size, ventricular mass, right ventricular dysplasia, pericardial disease, and assessing function/wall motion, and MRI may identify myocardial viability and scar tissue; chest radiography can estimate cardiac enlargement and pulmonary congestion or detect pulmonary disease; a 12-lead electrocardiogram may demonstrate prior MI, LVH, conduction abnormalities, or arrhythmia; however, because of low sensitivity/specificity, "neither the chest x-ray nor the electrocardiogram should form the primary basis for determining the specific cardiac abnormality responsible for the development of HF".

### Cardiothoracic ratio on chest radiograph in pediatric heart disease: how does it correlate with heart volumes at magnetic resonance imaging? [^116TFi3u]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The cardiothoracic ratio by chest radiograph is widely used as a marker of cardiac size.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to correlate cardiothoracic ratio and cardiac volumes as measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (MR) in common structural and myopathic heart disease with increased cardiac size due to volume overload or hypertrophy.

Material and Methods

A retrospective single center study was performed in all patients between 2007 and 2013 with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), aortic regurgitation, isolated left-to-right shunt and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) who underwent cardiovascular MR and chest radiograph within 6 months of each other. Cardiothoracic ratios by chest radiograph (frontal and lateral) were compared to cardiac volumes (indexed for body surface area) by cardiovascular MR.

Results

One hundred twenty-seven patients (mean age: 11.2 ± 5.5 years) were included in this study (76 with TOF, 23 with isolated left-to-right shunt, 16 with aortic regurgitation and 12 with HCM). Frontal cardiothoracic ratio of all groups correlated with indexed right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (EDVI) (r = 0.40, P < 0.01) and indexed total heart volume (THVI) (r = 0.27, P < 0.01). In TOF patients, frontal cardiothoracic ratio correlated with RVEDVI (r = 0.34, P < 0.01; coefficient of variation = 27.6%), indexed RV end-systolic volume (ESVI) (r = 0.44, P < 0.01; coefficient of variation = 33.3%) and THVI (r = 0.35, P < 0.01; coefficient of variation = 19.6%), although RV volumes and THVI showed widespread variation given the high coefficients of variation. In patients with aortic regurgitation, frontal cardiothoracic ratio correlated with left ventricular (LV) EDVI (r = 0.50, P = 0.047), but not with THVI and aortic regurgitant fraction, and widespread variation for LV EDVI (coefficient of variation = 19.2%), LV ESVI (coefficient of variation = 32.5%) and THVI (coefficient of variation = 13.6%) was also observed. Frontal cardiothoracic ratio was not correlated with cardiac volumes or mass in patients with a left-to-right shunt or HCM. Lateral cardiothoracic ratio showed no correlation with any cardiac volume in all four groups.

Conclusion

Although increased cardiothoracic ratio on frontal chest radiograph is associated with increased biventricular volumes in patients with pulmonary and aortic regurgitation, significant variation in ventricular volumes and total heart volume for any given frontal cardiothoracic ratio limits the use of cardiothoracic ratio in monitoring the individual patient's heart size. Frontal cardiothoracic ratio did not correlate with cardiac chamber volumes in patients with a left-to-right shunt or HCM and lateral cardiothoracic ratio offered no additional value for cardiac size assessment.

### Tuberculosis revisted: classic imaging findings in childhood [^116gG5iB]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

When pulmonary TB affects the pleura, pleural thickening, effusions (Fig. 7) and TB empyema can result as complications with or without pleural calcification. Pericardial effusion and pericarditis may also develop as complications of TB (Fig. 8). These complications can be further evaluated with US or cross-sectional imaging studies such as CT or MRI.

Fig. 7
Posteroanterior chest radiograph in a 9-year-old girl with confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis shows a large right-sided pleural effusion with minimum mediastinal shift due to underlying atelectasis

Fig. 8
Posteroanterior chest radiograph in a 6-year-old boy demonstrates a tuberculous pericardial effusion causing globular cardiomegaly

On MRI, TB infection typically presents as consolidation with or without cavitation (low signal intensity on T2 and short tau inversion recovery sequences), ground-glass signal abnormality, pulmonary nodules, lymphadenopathy (low signal intensity on T2 and peripheral enhancement on T1 post-contrast sequences) and pleural effusion. A previously published study consisting of 40 consecutive paediatric patients with pulmonary TB showed that MRI with fast imaging sequences is comparable to CXR for evaluating underlying pulmonary consolidation, bronchiectasis, necrosis/abscess and pleural effusion often associated with TB infection in children. It has been reported that MRI may be superior to CT for evaluating lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions, whereas ground-glass and small nodular, particularly tree-in-bud signal abnormalities, are better visualised on CT.

Besides lung and mediastinal involvement of TB infection in children, TB can also affect the airways via extrinsic tracheobronchial compression by infectious mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy or intrinsic airway involvement, which can be seen in up to 43% of children with active TB. On imaging studies, various degrees of lung aeration (from hyperinflation to atelectasis) may be observed, depending on the degree of extrinsic airway compression from adjacent lymphadenopathy — better assessed with cross-sectional imaging studies such as CT or MRI than CXR. The distal trachea and proximal main bronchi are most affected from TB lymphadenopathy. Intrinsic airway involvement is characterised by tracheobronchial thickening and narrowing from mucosal inflammation and oedema. Tracheobronchial fibrostenosis may occur in the later stages and fistula formation may develop with advanced airway disease.

### Diagnostic value of the chest radiograph in asymptomatic neonates with a cardiac murmur [^1161csdu]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Aim

To establish the diagnostic accuracy and diagnostic usefulness of the chest radiograph in asymptomatic neonates with cardiac murmurs.

Patients and Methods

The chest radiographs of 68 asymptomatic neonates with cardiac murmurs were analysed retrospectively. The radiographs were anonymized and then evaluated for the presence or absence of cardiac disease by six radiologists, three who regularly interpret neonatal chest radiographs and three who do so infrequently. The eventual diagnosis for each neonate and the impact of the chest radiograph and original report on patient management were established by review of the clinical case notes.

Results

The results for each observer were expressed in 2 x 2 contingency tables and statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test. The radiologists who were experienced in reporting neonatal chest radiographs achieved statistically significant results (P = 0.003, P = 0.002 and P = 0.007) compared with those who were less experienced (P = 0.13, P = 0.16 and P = 0.09). Review of the case notes established that the chest radiograph and original report did not influence clinical management in any of the 68 cases studied.

Conclusions

Radiologists who frequently report neonatal chest radiographs achieve high accuracy in differentiating cardiac from non-cardiac disease. However, inaccuracies are unavoidable as radiological evidence of cardiac disease is often not present. A false-positive result could cause undue anxiety while a false-negative report could result in the omission of further investigations. Furthermore, a chest radiograph is unlikely to provide the definitive diagnosis. Chest radiographs did not appear to influence patient management in this study and cannot be recommended in the initial evaluation of the asymptomatic neonate with a heart murmur.

### Cardiothoracic ratio values and trajectories are associated with risk of requiring dialysis and mortality in chronic kidney disease [^112LCGKi]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) was first defined in 1919 and has since been accepted as a means of quantifying heart size and volume on posterior-anterior chest X-rays (PA-CXRs). A CTR of < 0.5 is considered normal, whereas a CTR > 0.5 indicates cardiomegaly. The CTR is a key prognostic indicator in many conditions, such as coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and conditions related to aging. A higher CTR value is generally associated with poor prognosis, and 2 longitudinal studies of healthy populations have reported significant associations between high CTR values and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Several studies have challenged the current CTR threshold; their results have revealed CTRs below 0.5 to be associated with increased CV mortality in the general population. Zaman et al. observed that a preangiographic CTR above 0.42 to be associated with increased all-cause mortality.

### 'If not TB, what could it be?' chest X-ray findings from the 2016 Kenya tuberculosis prevalence survey [^112VzwTQ]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

Calculation of the cardio-thoracic ratio (CTR) on CXR read by humans is a well-described affordable and reproducible screening method for cardiomegaly. However, current studies, including our own, use CTR cut-off values developed in Caucasian populations and there will be a need for robust validation of baseline CTR values for healthy populations in sub-Saharan Africa.CAD for detection of CTR is under development.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the most common causes of cardiomegaly are conditions of significant public health importance associated with premature mortality, including hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathies, cor pulmonale, chronic rheumatic heart diseases and ischaemic heart diseases. Cardiomegaly has been associated with both higher body mass index and higher median systolic blood pressure. The high prevalence of cardiomegaly in our study supports exploration of the benefits of CVD screening during TB CXR screening as a potentially affordable public health intervention. Health messaging on prevention of NCDs through recommendations on diet, such as reduction of commercial sugar and high salt diet, could be considered for integration in such programmes.

Non-TB-related respiratory pathology, including chronic respiratory diseases (CRD), was another significant finding in our cohort. In a Vancouver study in 1960s, three cases of significant previously unknown non-TB lung disease were identified for every new TB case; in our study, this figure was approximately 2:1. It should be noted that CXR alone has limited specificity for many of these conditions, especially in this cohort where very limited clinical information was available. The diagnoses of 'non-specific airspace opacification' and 'interstitial pattern' cover a range of possible pathologies, varying from incidental acute or chronic infective changes, not typical of TB, to non-infective pathology. COPD and emphysema cannot be diagnosed reliably on CXR alone, requiring spirometry and referral for further confirmation. However, CRD morbidity and mortality is on the rise, with the prevalence of COPD shown to range between 4% and 25% in one systematic review in sub-Saharan Africa comparable to 3.6% (2.3%–4.4%) in our study. As expected, our study confirmed that screening for TB will detect alternative lung abnormalities in a significant number of non-TB cases and spirometry as well as expert clinical review, for example, pulmonologists will be required for a subset of these patients.

### Multidetector computed tomography of chest trauma: indications, technique and interpretation [^115GjZXF]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Injuries of the pleura

Pneumothorax

Pneumothorax frequently accompanies blunt and penetrating chest injuries. In cases of blunt trauma, it is the second most common finding after rib fractures. It is caused not only by direct injury to the pleura, but also by a rupture of the alveoli or bronchi accompanied by increased pressure in the airways. It can also be a complication of medical procedures. On CT it is manifested as a collection of gas in the pleural cavity accumulating behind the ventral thoracic wall. In chest X-ray examinations performed in the supine position, it is often manifested very discretely, and in 30–55% of cases it cannot be seen at all (Fig. 11). The clinical significance of pneumothorax depends not only on its size at the time of initial examination, but also on its development over time and on the overall condition of the patient. In a ventilated patient, a small overlooked pneumothorax can grow rapidly and cause a hemodynamic and ventilation instability. Tension pneumothorax is a serious, life-threatening condition requiring immediate drainage. It results in an increase of intrathoracic pressure on the affected side with a subsequent compression of the mediastinal structures and reduction of cardiac diastolic filling. It is often clinically diagnosed before MDCT. Its basic symptoms include an increase of the volume of the affected hemithorax, shift of the mediastinum to the healthy side, and compression of the mediastinal vessels (mainly veins), heart and depression of the diaphragmatic arch (Fig. 12).

### Applications of artificial intelligence in computed tomography imaging for phenotyping pulmonary hypertension [^113hUd5G]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Morphology of the cardiac chambers and myocardial hypertrophy provide evidence of left-sided and right-sided disease manifestations in pulmonary hypertension. Right ventricular hypertrophy, deviation of the interventricular septum, and pulmonary artery dilatation are the three features that indicate increased pulmonary arterial pressures (Fig. 1 d). Right ventricular hypertrophy is commonly assessed at the right ventricular outflow tract (given the compacted nature at this anatomical location), with thickness ≥ 6 mm suggesting pulmonary hypertension (Fig. 1 e). CHD and anomalous arterial venous drainage can be visualized. Other nonspecific features of heart failure may be present such as pericardial or pleural effusions (Fig. 1 f).

Lung parenchymal assessment provides information as to the type and severity of lung disease. Increases in lung density (or attenuation) are seen in ground glass opacification or consolidation. Density reductions are seen in emphysema-related lung destruction and mild reductions are seen in mosaic perfusion abnormalities or air trapping. The distribution should be assessed with specific diseases, such as ILD, presenting with characteristic patterns like honeycombing and reticulation (Fig. 1 g). In pulmonary hypertension, overlapping imaging patterns emerge, highlighting the need for robust modes of parenchymal assessment to phenotype those with pulmonary hypertension.

### Deep learning to detect left ventricular structural abnormalities in chest X-rays [^116Rg3nr]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

To date, studies building machine learning models to evaluate cardiac pathology on CXRs have focused on predicting cardiomegaly, a diagnosis that is poorly predictive of cardiac disease. Our study is the first to demonstrate that CXRs can be used for detecting structural abnormalities associated with Stage Bor worse heart failure, potentially expediting diagnosis and improving clinical outcomes. To our knowledge, it is also the first study showing an AI model can outperform radiologists in the detection of cardiac pathology. These results show early promise that machine learning may enable effective screening using cheap, prevalent imaging to identify patients with undiagnosed heart failure, potentially even in pre-symptomatic Stage B, through earlier detection of structural abnormalities.

Thalassemia major (TM) basic tests — chest radiograph and natriuretic peptides: The chest radiograph may show cardiomegaly from the hyperdynamic circulation, signs of congestive HF, and, on occasion, extramedullary hematopoiesis. Natriuretic peptides NT-proBNP and BNP are significantly increased in documented LV diastolic dysfunction, and NT-proBNP appears to have better predictive value in detecting latent LV diastolic dysfunction; however, one study showed poor correlation of BNP against low myocardial T2✱, and one possible explanation is reduced BNP secretion caused by iron toxicity. More recent data suggest that NT-proBNP levels may be useful, and further studies are needed.

### Chest radiography and the evaluation of the neonate for congenital heart disease [^1171TiLe]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

We assessed the utility of the chest film as a screening tool for term and preterm neonates with suspected structural heart disease. Three independent observers, blinded to patient diagnosis, retrospectively evaluated the initial chest film for each of 128 consecutive neonates with suspected heart disease (gestational age, 23–42 weeks; birth weight, 500–4,621 g) who had undergone both chest radiography and echocardiography. These evaluations were subsequently compared with the results of the respective echocardiograms, read by board-certified pediatric cardiologists blinded to the chest film and chest film interpretation. Kappa statistics demonstrated moderate correlation (0.42–0.48) among different observers in their interpretation of the chest films but poor correlation (0.15–0.34) between chest radiography and echocardiography. The chest film had a low sensitivity for structural heart disease (26–59%), with a negative predictive value of 46–52%. Among neonates less than 2 kg or younger than 35 weeks of gestation, the chest film had still lower sensitivity for detecting heart disease. Despite agreement among observers in chest film interpretation, the chest film does not function as a screening test for neonates with suspected heart disease, particularly in small or premature neonates. In neonates with suspected heart disease, echocardiography should be considered, even in patients with chest films that do not suggest congenital heart disease.

### Cardiomegaly on chest radiographs as a predictor of heart disease in the pediatric population [^114gSwme]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiomegaly on chest radiographs (CXR) in pediatric patients leads to multiple tests. We aimed to determine the positive predictive value (PPV) of cardiomegaly on CXR in predicting subsequent heart disease and to assess the utility of obtaining a B-type Natriuretic Peptide level (BNP) and/or electrocardiogram (EKG) in such patients. We hypothesized that an echocardiogram may not be appropriate in all cases of cardiomegaly on CXR, particularly in a patient with a normal EKG and BNP level.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients with cardiomegaly on their initial CXR between January 2015-December 2017. Patients without a subsequent echocardiogram or known congenital heart disease were excluded. A patient was deemed to have heart disease if they had structural abnormalities, functional abnormalities or a pericardial effusion on echocardiogram. The PPV of CXR and the PPV/NPV of the other tests (EKG, BNP) were calculated using contingency tables.

Results

Four hundred and eighty nine patients met inclusion criteria. The PPV of cardiomegaly on CXR alone without any other diagnostic testing in predicting subsequent heart disease was 15%. The PPV increased if there was either an abnormal EKG or a BNP > 100 pg/ml and further increased if both of these were present. The PPV values were higher in patients < 1 year of age.

Conclusions

Cardiomegaly on CXR can often predict the presence of heart disease, particularly in infants. Further testing with EKG and BNP can better predict who may have heart disease, but it may not eliminate the need for echocardiography.

Right heart chamber enlargement can be caused by a diverse and heterogeneous group of conditions with highly varied clinical symptoms and signs. An appreciation of the pathophysiology, causes, and imaging features of right heart enlargement is paramount in recognizing and potentially ameliorating the development of right heart dysfunction or adverse cardiac events. Chest x-ray and transthoracic echocardiography have traditionally been, and still are, the mainstay in initial evaluation of right heart dilatation; however, recent advances in both multidetector computed tomography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging now permit a comprehensive assessment of the causes and consequences of right heart dilatation.

### Diagnostic value of B-type natriuretic peptide and chest radiographic findings in patients with acute dyspnea [^114WXyAF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare chest radiographic findings and circulating B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels as an adjunct to clinical findings in the diagnosis of heart failure in patients presenting with acute dyspnea.

Methods

The diagnostic performance of radiographic evidence of cardiomegaly/redistribution and BNP levels ≥ 100 pg/mL as indicators of heart failure were assessed in 880 patients presenting with acute dyspnea to the emergency departments of five U.S. and two European teaching hospitals. BNP levels were determined by a rapid, point-of-care device. Two blinded cardiologists reviewed all clinical data and categorized patients as to whether they had acute heart failure (n = 447) or not (n = 433).

Results

Three-factor analyses showed that BNP levels ≥ 100 pg/mL contributed significantly to the prediction of heart failure over each of the radiographic indicators. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, both BNP levels ≥ 100 pg/mL (odds ratio [OR] = 12.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.4 to 20.4) and radiographic findings of cardiomegaly (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4 to 3.7), cephalization (OR = 6.4; 95% CI: 3.3 to 12.5), and interstitial edema (OR = 7.0; 95% CI: 2.9 to 17.0) added significant, predictive information above historical and clinical predictors of heart failure.

Conclusion

In patients presenting to the emergency department with acute dyspnea, BNP levels and chest radiographs provide complementary diagnostic information that may be useful in the early evaluation of heart failure.

### Radiographic measurements of cardiac size as predictors of outcome in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [^111M9H6i]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac dilatation is a predictor of poor outcome in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Whereas cardiac chamber dimensions or volumes can be assessed by various noninvasive and invasive techniques, simple chest radiography also may provide a valuable assessment of cardiac size.

Methods and Results

To determine the relative power of radiographic heart measurements for predicting outcome in dilated cardiomyopathy, we retrospectively studied 88 adult patients with chest radiographs obtained within 35 days of echocardiography. Standard radiographic variables were measured for each patient, and the cardiothoracic (CT) ratio, frontal cardiac area, and volume were calculated. During a mean 4.1-year follow-up, 62 of the 88 (71%) patients died. CT ratio was the best predictor of mortality among the radiographic cardiac measurements. By multivariate analysis, a model including echocardiographic ejection fraction, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and history of heart failure was highly predictive of survival. When added to this model, CT ratio also was independently associated with mortality, but not radiographic cardiac area or volume. When radiographic variables were each added to CT ratio, they did not add incremental predictive value to the model that included CT ratio alone. Echocardiographic measurement of left ventricular (LV) size, especially when indexed for body size, was independently predictive of outcome, but it did not supersede the predictive power of CT ratio.

Conclusion

The simply derived radiographic CT ratio is a useful predictor of outcome in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and compares favorably with other clinical and selected echocardiographic variables.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: lessons from computed tomography of the whole lung [^114opqEQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This review aims to show how computed tomography of the whole lung has modified our view of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and why it impacts on the optimization of the ventilatory strategy.

Data Sources

Computed tomography allows an accurate assessment of the volumes of gas and lung tissue, respectively, and lung aeration. If computed tomographic sections are contiguous from the apex to the lung base, quantitative analysis can be performed either on the whole lung or, regionally, at the lobar level. Analysis requires a manual delineation of lung parenchyma and is facilitated by software, including a color-coding system that allows direct visualization of overinflated, normally aerated, poorly aerated, and nonaerated lung regions. In addition, lung recruitment can be measured as the amount of gas that penetrates poorly aerated and nonaerated lung regions after the application of positive intrathoracic pressure.

Data Summary

The lung in acute respiratory distress syndrome is characterized by a marked increase in lung tissue and a massive loss of aeration. The former is homogeneously distributed, although with a slight predominance in the upper lobes, whereas the latter is heterogeneously distributed. The lower lobes are essentially nonaerated, whereas the upper lobes may remain normally aerated, despite a substantial increase in regional lung tissue. The overall lung volume and the cephalocaudal lung dimensions are reduced primarily at the expense of the lower lobes, which are externally compressed by the heart and abdominal content when the patient is in the supine position. Two opposite radiologic presentations, corresponding to different lung morphologies, can be observed. In patients with focal computed tomographic attenuations, frontal chest radiography generally shows bilateral opacities in the lower quadrants and may remain normal, particularly when the lower lobes are entirely atelectatic. In patients with diffuse computed tomographic attenuations, the typical radiologic presentation of "white lungs" is observed. If these patients lie supine, lung volume is preserved in the upper lobes and reduced in the lower lobes, although the loss of aeration is equally distributed between the upper and lower lobes. This observation does not support the "opening and collapse concept" described as the "sponge model". In fact, interstitial edema, alveolar flooding, or both, not collapse, are histologically present in all regions of the lung in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Compression atelectasis is observed only in caudal parts of the lung, where external forces (such as cardiac weight, abdominal pressure, and pleural effusion) tend to squeeze the lower lobes. When a positive intrathoracic pressure is applied to patients with focal acute respiratory distress syndrome, poorly aerated and nonaerated lung regions are recruited, whereas lung regions that are normally aerated at zero end-expiratory pressure tend to be rapidly overinflated, increasing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury.

Conclusion

Selection of the optimal positive end-expiratory pressure level should not only consider optimizing alveolar recruitment, it should also focus on limiting lung overinflation and counterbalancing compression of the lower lobes by maneuvers such as appropriate body positioning. Prone and semirecumbent positions facilitate the reaeration of dependent and caudal lung regions by partially relieving cardiac and abdominal compression and may improve gas exchange.

### Accuracy of chest radiographs in the emergency diagnosis of heart failure [^115CCrC1]. European Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of chest radiographic findings of heart failure (HF) in current patients presenting with dyspnea in the emergency department. In a secondary analysis of the BASEL study, initial chest radiographs of 277 patients with acute dyspnea were evaluated by two radiologists blinded to the adjudicated diagnosis (56% had the final diagnosis of HF). Predefined radiographic criteria of HF were used. Statistical analysis included receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calculation of a logistic regression model including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The reader's overall impression showed the highest area under the ROC curve for the diagnosis of HF in both supine and erect patient positions (0.855 and 0.857). Among individual radiographic findings, peribronchial cuffing in the supine position (0.829) showed the highest accuracies. The lowest accuracy was found for the vascular pedicle width in the supine position (0.461). Logistic regression analysis showed no significant differences between the reader's overall impression, the radiographic model, and BNP testing. In our study, the combination of radiographic features provided valuable information and was of comparable accuracy as BNP-testing for the diagnosis of HF.

### Prevalence of negative chest radiography results in the emergency department patient with decompensated heart failure [^114pmmco]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Although chest radiography is quick and inexpensive, previous research suggests that it is often misleading in emergency department (ED) patients with decompensated heart failure, resulting in misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. This study determines the rate of negative chest radiography results in patients found to have disease and the potential contribution of negative findings to a diagnosis discordant with heart failure by an emergency physician.

Methods

We used data from the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE), a registry of patients with a primary hospital discharge diagnosis of heart failure. We compared initial ED admitting diagnosis to the criterion standard of a hospital discharge diagnosis of heart failure and related these to radiographic findings of heart failure (interstitial edema, pulmonary edema, or vascular congestion, as determined by a staff radiologist) for patients first treated in the ED. The proportion of patients with a non-heart failure ED diagnosis and the diagnostic sensitivity of radiographic findings of heart failure are calculated.

Results

There were 85,376 patients with chest radiograph results and an ED admitting diagnosis. Overall, there were 15,937 patients with no signs of congestion on ED chest radiography, giving a negative rate of 18.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18.4% to 18.9%). The proportion of patients with an ED non-heart failure admitting diagnosis was higher in patients with a negative chest radiograph result (23.3%; 95% CI 22.6% to 23.9%) than in patients with a positive chest radiograph result (13.0%; 95% CI 12.7% to 13.2%).

Conclusion

Approximately 1 of every 5 patients admitted from the ED with acute decompensated heart failure had no signs of congestion on chest radiography. Patients lacking signs of congestion on ED chest radiography were more likely to have an ED non-heart failure diagnosis than patients with signs of congestion. Clinicians should not rule out heart failure in patients with no radiographic signs of congestion.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to illustrate the common congenital cardiac lesions that are characterized by right-sided heart enlargement that may be seen on routine thoracic or cardiac imaging.

Conclusion

A systematic approach to the evaluation of the right heart and an understanding of the congenital abnormalities causing right chamber enlargement will allow the radiologist to diagnose unsuspected cardiac abnormalities on routine clinical thoracic and cardiac imaging as well as accurately identify these defects on dedicated cardiac CT or MRI examinations.

### Asbestos: when the dust settles an imaging review of asbestos-related disease [^113Kxirb]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Asbestos-related neoplastic and nonneoplastic diseases of the lungs and pleura range from pleural effusion and pleural plaques to lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Pleural effusions are typically hemorrhagic exudates of mixed cellularity but do not typically contain asbestos bodies. The classic distribution of pleural plaques seen on chest radiographs is the posterolateral chest wall between the seventh and tenth ribs, lateral chest wall between the sixth and ninth ribs, the dome of the diaphragm, and the mediastinal pleura. Computed tomographic (CT) findings support this distribution but also show anterior and paravertebral plaques not well shown at chest radiography. Imaging features of diffuse pleural thickening include a continuous sheet, often involving the costophrenic angles and apices, that rarely calcifies. The typical CT features of round atelectasis are of a round or oval mass that abuts the pleura, a "comet tail" of bronchovascular structures going into the mass, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. Features of asbestosis on chest radiographs include ground-glass opacification, small nodular opacities, "shaggy" cardiac silhouette, and ill-defined diaphragmatic contours. CT, however, is more sensitive in their detection. Chest radiography in patients with malignant mesothelioma may show an effusion, pleural thickening, and as the tumor progresses, a more lobulated outline. CT can help identify the disease in its early stages. Asbestos-related cancers can occur anywhere in the lungs. Recognition of the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features of these diseases will be important for some years to come.

Prognostic value

In the cohort of 32,900 CAD patients, there were 390 (1.18%) instances of all-cause death or myocardial infarctions. CT ratio z -scores indicated an increasing risk with higher scores (Figure 6). Patients with a CT ratio z -score of 2 or higher were at a significantly elevated risk (adjusted HR: 3.73; 95% CI: 2.09–6.64), showing a higher percentage of cumulative events (4.6% vs 0.6%, P < 0.001) over 5 years compared to the reference group with a z -score less than −1 (HR: 1.00). Elevated risks were also observed with higher z -scores (≥ 2) for SVC/AO, RA, DAO, and carinal angle, while the Arch, PT, LAA, and LV z -scores not reaching statistical significance (Supplemental Table 18, Supplemental Figures 11 to 18).

Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Strong recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (1C): Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burden, or vice versa; Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized, controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence; Recommendation can apply to most patients in many circumstances. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate.

Pulmonary hypertension — chest radiograph: In idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), the chest radiograph is abnormal at diagnosis in 90% of patients, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) findings include central pulmonary arterial dilatation with peripheral vessel 'pruning'; in advanced cases, right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) enlargement may be seen. A chest radiograph may assist in differential diagnosis by suggesting lung disease or pulmonary venous congestion due to left heart disease and may help distinguish arterial vs venous pulmonary hypertension by artery/vein ratios, but the degree of PH does not correlate with radiographic abnormalities and a normal chest radiograph does not exclude PH.

### A diagnostic approach to the mediastinal masses [^115HcXHx]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Imaging modalities

Many mediastinal reflections can be appreciated at conventional radiography (CR), and their presence or distortion is the key to the interpretation of mediastinal abnormalities. However, computed tomography (CT) is the most important tool in the evaluation of a mediastinal mass. Characterisation on CT is based on specific attenuation of air, fat, water and calcium (Fig. 1). High-resolution multiplanar reformation images display the detailed anatomical relationship of the tumour with the adjacent structures. An excellent soft tissue contrast also designates magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an ideal tool to evaluate tumours of the mediastinum. Assessment of preoperative relationships with the pericardium, heart cavities, spinal cord and vascular involvement is a common indication. Chemical-shift MRI has been shown to be useful in distinguishing normal thymus and thymic hyperplasia from thymic neoplasms and lymphoma. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is another special application that unveils minute metabolic and biophysical differences between tissues. According to Gumustas et al. the mean apparent diffusion coefficient for the malignant mediastinal entities could be significantly lower than that for the benign diseases.

### Does this patient with a pericardial effusion have cardiac tamponade? [^116tgjPz]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Cardiac tamponade is a state of hemodynamic compromise resulting from cardiac compression by fluid trapped in the pericardial space. The clinical examination may assist in the decision to perform pericardiocentesis in patients with cardiac tamponade diagnosed by echocardiography.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of the history, physical examination, and basic diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search of English-language articles published between 1966 and 2006, reference lists of these articles, and reference lists of relevant textbooks.

Study Selection

We included articles that compared aspects of the clinical examination to a reference standard for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. We excluded studies with fewer than 15 patients. Of 787 studies identified by our search strategy, 8 were included in our final analysis.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed articles for study results and quality. A third reviewer resolved disagreements.

Data Synthesis

All studies evaluated patients with known tamponade or those referred for pericardiocentesis with known effusion. Five features occur in the majority of patients with tamponade: dyspnea (sensitivity range, 87%-89%), tachycardia (pooled sensitivity, 77%; 95% confidence interval, 69%-85%), pulsus paradoxus (pooled sensitivity, 82%; 95% CI, 72%-92%), elevated jugular venous pressure (pooled sensitivity, 76%; 95% CI, 62%-90%), and cardiomegaly on chest radiograph (pooled sensitivity, 89%; 95% CI, 73%-100%). Based on 1 study, the presence of pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg in a patient with a pericardial effusion increases the likelihood of tamponade (likelihood ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.8–6.3), while a pulsus paradoxus of 10 mm Hg or less greatly lowers the likelihood (likelihood ratio, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01–0.24).

Conclusions

Among patients with cardiac tamponade, a minority will not have dyspnea, tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, or cardiomegaly on chest radiograph. A pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg among patients with a pericardial effusion helps distinguish those with cardiac tamponade from those without. Diagnostic certainty of the presence of tamponade requires additional testing.

### Significant incidental cardiac disease on thoracic CT: what the general radiologist needs to know [^115vBnnC]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemopericardium

Pericardial effusion results when more than 60 mL of fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac. Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion is better characterized on unenhanced CT and measures between 40 and 60 HU (Hounsfield units), compared to less than 10 HU for simple fluid/transudates and between 10 to 20 HU for exudates (Fig. 16). Hemopericardium can occur following left ventricular free wall rupture in myocardial infarction, with ventricular or coronary aneurysmal rupture, in postsurgical patients, in the setting of trauma, and with malignancy.

Fig. 16

Pericardial calcification

Pericardial calcification commonly results from trauma, infection, hemorrhage, or therapeutic radiation. Traumatic etiologies include surgical exploration during pericardiotomy for cardiac shunt surgery. Tuberculosis and histoplasmosis as infectious etiologies are now less commonly seen in the developed world. Calcification resulting from radiation will confirm to the radiation port used. The calcification may be a focal plaque or a thin curvilinear focus following the cardiac contour. Lesions are usually 1 to 2 mm thick but can increase to 1 to 2 cm in thickness in chronic cases. Pericardial calcification is most commonly found in the atrioventricular (AV) groove and in the lower and diaphragmatic portions of the pericardium (Fig. 17). It is most commonly a global process, involving both sides of the heart. Myocardial calcification tends to localize to the left heart (where the myocardium is thickest) and is thinner than pericardial calcification. Up to 28% of patients with constrictive pericarditis have pericardial calcification, but the converse is not true. Pericardial calcifications may be present without any physiological compromise to the heart. If pericardial calcification is seen on a chest CT, evaluation of the images for signs of constriction is recommended, with consideration for ECHO and or cardiac MRI to further evaluate.

### Contribution of right-sided heart enlargement to cardiomegaly on chest roentgenogram in diastolic and systolic heart failure [^116ec8D8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

We investigated the contribution of a dilated right-sided heart to roentgenographic cardiomegaly in patients with heart failure (HF) and a normal ejection fraction (EF; diastolic HF) and those with HF and a decreased EF (systolic HF). We compared the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) on upright chest roentgenograms and major- and minor-axis dimensions of the 4 cardiac chambers on echocardiograms in patients with HF and a normal EF (≥ 0.50, n = 35) and those with a decreased EF (< 0.50, n = 37) and examined the correlation between the CTR and cardiac chamber dimensions. The CTR did not differ between patients with normal and decreased EF values (0.58 ± 0.07 vs 0.60 ± 0.06, p = 0.26). Left-side cardiac chamber dimensions were substantially smaller in patients with a normal EF than in those with a decreased EF (left ventricular minor-axis dimension, 4.4 ± 0.7 vs 5.8 ± 0.8 cm, p < 0.001). In contrast, right-side cardiac chamber dimensions were generally similar between groups. The CTR correlated with major-axis dimensions of the right ventricle and right atrium (p < 0.01 for the 2 comparisons), but not with the left-side cardiac chamber dimensions (all p values > 0.05). In conclusion, the CTR predominantly reflects right- rather than left-sided heart size in patients with HF. Right-sided heart size is similar between patients with normal and decreased EF values. Thus, despite the substantial difference in left ventricular size and EF, there is substantial overlap in the CTR between patients with diastolic and systolic HFs and the CTR is unable to discriminate between groups.

Problems and pitfalls after prior tetralogy of Fallot repair include that cardiomegaly on chest x-ray should prompt the search for a residual hemodynamic lesion, arrhythmias should prompt the search for an underlying hemodynamic abnormality, diagnostic confusion may occur with double-outlet right ventricle where the aorta overrides the RV by more than 50% and postoperative subaortic obstruction should be carefully excluded, hypoxemia should prompt a search for a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD) with a right-to-left shunt, the presence of RV enlargement or dysfunction with important tricuspid regurgitation (TR) should prompt the search for a residual lesion, and some postoperative patients may have LV dysfunction with potential etiologies listed.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of heart failure [^115Y881R]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a common clinical syndrome characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of volume overload, which may include peripheral edema and pulmonary rales. Heart failure has high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in older persons. Many conditions, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, can cause or lead to decompensation of chronic heart failure. Up to 40 to 50 percent of patients with heart failure have diastolic heart failure with preserved left ventricular function, and the overall mortality is similar to that of systolic heart failure. The initial evaluation includes a history and physical examination, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and laboratory assessment to identify causes or precipitating factors. A displaced cardiac apex, a third heart sound, and chest radiography findings of venous congestion or interstitial edema are useful in identifying heart failure. Systolic heart failure is unlikely when the Framingham criteria are not met or when B-type natriuretic peptide level is normal. Echocardiography is the diagnostic standard to confirm systolic or diastolic heart failure through assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction. Evaluation for ischemic heart disease is warranted in patients with heart failure, especially if angina is present, given that coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Pericardial defect imaging appearance and indirect signs — on good-quality electrocardiographically synchronized CT and CMR, the pericardium is identified by differentiation from myocardium via adjacent epicardial and pericardial fat layers, but with minimal fat the pericardium lies almost immediately on the myocardium and differentiation becomes difficult, particularly in younger, lean, athletic patients where visualization at the lateral, posterior, and inferior left ventricular walls can be impossible; in such scenarios, overdiagnosis of pericardial absence should be avoided. Indirect morphologic signs include leftward cardiac displacement, excessive levorotation visible on chest x-ray, and the relatively specific sign of interposed lung tissue in areas typically covered by pericardium, including the space between the aorta and pulmonary artery or between the diaphragm and the base of the heart; patients with pericardial defects may have associated congenital abnormalities.

### A deep-learning-based framework for identifying and localizing multiple abnormalities and assessing cardiomegaly in chest X-ray [^112tx25U]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In addition, the size of the heart shadow should also be observed by radiologists in a CXR. The cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) is often used to assess the degree of cardiomegaly in clinical practice; however, its manual calculation is relatively time-consuming.

In this work, we constructed a large CXR dataset named CXR-AL14 with bounding boxes for 14 abnormalities. Based on the CXR-AL14 dataset, a deep learning-based framework was developed for the identification and localization of 14 abnormalities and the simultaneous calculation of the CTR (Fig. 1). Finally, an intelligent diagnosis system was developed according to this framework to assist radiologists in more efficiently interpreting CXRs.

### Nontraumatic thoracic emergencies [^115mJgyB]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Acute chest pain is one of the most common complaints of patients who present to an emergency department, and accounts for up to 5% of all visits. It also is one of the most complex issues in an emergency setting because, although clinical signs and symptoms often are nonspecific, rapid diagnosis and therapy are of great importance. The chest radiograph remains an important component of the evaluation of chest pain, and usually is the first examination to be obtained. Nevertheless, cross-sectional imaging has added greatly to the ability to characterize the wide constellation of clinical findings into a distinct etiology. This article reviews how the various entities that can present as nontraumatic chest pain can manifest radiographically.

Initial examination should include assessment of the patient's volume status, orthostatic blood pressure changes, measurement of weight and height, and calculation of body mass index (Level of Evidence: C). Initial laboratory evaluation should include complete blood count, urinalysis, serum electrolytes (including calcium and magnesium), blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, fasting blood glucose (glycohemoglobin), lipid profile, liver function tests, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (Level of Evidence: C). Twelve-lead electrocardiogram and chest radiograph (PA and lateral) should be performed initially in patients presenting with HF (Level of Evidence: C). Two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler should be performed during initial evaluation of patients presenting with HF to assess LVEF, LV size, wall thickness, and valve function, and radionuclide ventriculography can be performed to assess LVEF and volumes (Level of Evidence: C). Coronary arteriography should be performed in patients presenting with HF who have angina or significant ischemia unless the patient is not eligible for revascularization of any kind (Level of Evidence: B).

### ACC / AHA 2008 guidelines for the management of adults with congenital heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines on the management of adults with congenital heart disease) [^112ApjzA]. Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid atresia/single ventricle — imaging evaluation notes that cardiac enlargement on chest x-ray correlates with significant RV or LV enlargement in the absence of pericardial effusion, with dextrocardia or mesocardia common, variable pulmonary vascularity, and frequent scoliosis and ipsilateral rib abnormalities after thoracotomy. Echocardiography is the major imaging modality, and the data to be obtained with a complete echocardiographic assessment include abdominal/atrial situs; cardiac apex position, AV and ventriculoarterial connections, ventricular and arterial looping; systemic venous and pulmonary venous anatomy and flow patterns; right-to-left and left-to-right shunt pathways; valvular abnormalities/outflow obstruction; ASD/VSD size, numbers, and location; ventricular function/hypertrophy; and aortic/pulmonary artery abnormalities, including coarctation, pulmonary artery size, and the presence or absence of stenosis. Transesophageal echocardiography may be needed if all information is not available from transthoracic echocardiography, historical data, or other imaging modalities. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography can be extremely useful for systemic and pulmonary arterial and venous anatomy and complex intracardiac anatomy, determining ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, regurgitant fraction, and hypertrophy, and MRI or CT data can obviate catheterization imaging in many situations and help prepare for optimal catheterization.

### Age-and site-specific variation in the dermoscopic patterns of congenital melanocytic nevi… [^113sD2oT]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Dermoscopic image of a congenital melanocytic nevus with haloed globules. Dermoscopic images of congenital melanocytic nevi. A, Target network with a target globule. B, Target globule. Dermoscopic images of congenital melanocytic nevi. A, Target network with globules and dots. B, Target network with blood vessels. The predominant dermoscopic pattern also varied by lesional site: a globular pattern was present in 11 head, neck, and axial lesions compared with only 3 extremity lesions. Conversely, a reticular pattern was present in 16 extremity lesions, compared with only 2 head, neck, and axial lesions. We believe that the haloed globule, which was observed in 13 lesions, is structurally distinct from the target globule.

The target globule, which has been described as a globule containing a central dot, 8, 9, 15 essentially appears as a dot encircled by a halo that is hyperpigmented relative to surrounding background pigment. In contrast, the haloed globule appears as a globule surrounded by a hypopigmented halo. The most common predominant dermoscopic patterns in our study population were reticular, globular, and reticuloglobular. In addition, we observed an association between predominant dermoscopic pattern and age. A globular pattern was seen commonly in individuals younger than 12 years but far less frequently in individuals 12 years or older. Analogous findings have also recently been reported in acquired melanocytic nevi.

22 Some researchers may speculate that the age-related differences in dermoscopic patterns observed in our study may reflect dynamic changes in lesions over time; that is, CMN may initially show a globular pattern, which may with age eventually evolve into a reticular or homogeneous pattern. In conclusion, our study describes the normal dermoscopic features of CMN, including the haloed globule, a new structure that to our knowledge has not yet been described. Our findings suggest that the predominant dermoscopic patterns of CMN vary according to age and lesional site but not sex. Globular CMN were more commonly observed in individuals younger than 12 years and on the head, neck, and trunk.

### Growth-curve modeling of nevi with a peripheral globular pattern… [^114B6bE2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The median time to growth cessation in the 26 PGN that stabilized or decreased in size was 58. 6 months. All lesions changed in a symmetric manner and 91 displayed a decrease in the density of peripheral globules over time. Conclusions and Relevance Nevi displaying a peripheral globular pattern enlarged symmetrically with apparent growth cessation occurring during a span of 4 to 5 years. Our results reiterate the important concept that not all growth is associated with malignancy. Nevi are dynamic yet benign neoplasms with a life cycle that includes inception, growth, senescence, and involution. 1 Although growth is a normal part of the nevus life cycle, limited data are available to help physicians distinguish normal from abnormal growth. Peripheral globular nevi are a distinct subset of enlarging nevi that display a single peripheral rim of brown globules when examined with dermoscopy and have a homogeneous, globular, reticular, or mixed central pattern.

The histologic characteristics of peripheral globules correspond to junctional melanocytic nests, and nevi with this pattern are most commonly seen in younger individuals. 6, 7 The presence of peripheral globules is thought to suggest that the nevus is in an active growth phase. The MSKCC PGN grew at a mean rate of 0. 52 mm2/mo, whereas the Barcelona and SONIC PGN grew at slower rates of
0. 12 and 0. 14 mm2/mo, respectively. Studies have identified growing melanocytic nevi as significantly more likely to have a BRAF V600E mutation or to exhibit a peripheral globular pattern than nevi that exhibit no change in size. 17, 18 In addition, Zalaudek et al18 found that 10. A more complete understanding of the life cycle of nevi may shed important insights into the biological features of melanocytes.

Although nevi proliferate before undergoing senescence, malignant melanocytes are thought to overcome the molecular mediators that induce growth arrest. 21 We were careful to use the term growth cessation as opposed to senescence.

### Key points… [^111N4MsV]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- An aortic aneurysm is a dangerous balloon-like bulge in the aorta, the large artery that carries blood from the heart through the chest and torso. What it is Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture:

- The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a dissection.
- The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a rupture.
- Dissections and ruptures are the cause of most deaths from aortic aneurysms. Types Thoracic aortic aneurysm A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age. 4 Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and older. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common among White people than among Black people. 5 Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis, but infection or injury can also cause them. 6 Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following:

- Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side.
- Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs. Other types Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause a stroke. Peripheral aneurysms — those found in arteries other than the aorta — can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees.

These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow through the artery.
