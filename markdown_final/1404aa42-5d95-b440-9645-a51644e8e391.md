## Question

Does farxiga increase potassium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Farxiga (dapagliflozin) increases potassium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanism of action to see if there is a plausible mechanism for hyperkalemia. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence from randomized trials and pooled analyses. Next, I will review meta-analyses and guideline statements. After that, I need to check for any exceptions or high-risk subgroups. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable conclusion with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Dapagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the proximal tubule, increasing urinary glucose and sodium delivery to the distal nephron, which can enhance kaliuresis and would be expected to lower or leave potassium unchanged rather than raise it, especially early after initiation when osmotic diuresis is most pronounced [^c47e86de] [^196c8e13]. Wait, let me verify the counterbalancing effects: SGLT2 inhibition also activates renin and aldosterone, which could promote potassium secretion, and increases distal sodium delivery, both of which would not favor hyperkalemia, while adaptive changes in the distal nephron can limit excessive potassium loss, explaining why dyskalemias are uncommon overall [^b1f3524b] [^f6326d1c].

> Next, I should review the pivotal clinical data. A pooled analysis of 14 randomized, placebo-controlled trials in type 2 diabetes (including patients with moderate renal impairment and those on ACE inhibitors/ARBs or potassium-sparing diuretics) showed no clinically relevant mean increase in serum potassium with dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo, and the incidence of potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L was similar between groups, with very few marked hyperkalemia events and no signal for increased risk even in high-risk subgroups [^74576d45] [^3e6694a5]. Hold on, I should double-check the numeric details: mean potassium change was about −0.05 mmol/L with dapagliflozin vs −0.02 mmol/L with placebo, and hyperkalemia ≥ 5.5 mmol/L occurred in roughly 9% in both arms, with moderate/severe hyperkalemia around 3% in both, confirming neutrality [^74576d45] [^3e6694a5].

> I will now examine broader syntheses. Multiple meta-analyses and contemporary reviews conclude that SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin, do not increase serum potassium and may reduce hyperkalemia risk in high-risk populations such as CKD and heart failure, without increasing hypokalemia, which aligns with the mechanistic expectation of enhanced distal sodium delivery and kaliuresis offset by adaptive renal responses [^bc123af1] [^f6326d1c] [^613ade0d]. Let me reconsider whether this applies across eGFR strata; yes, the risk reduction for serious hyperkalemia has been demonstrated in pooled analyses that include patients with reduced eGFR, reinforcing class-wide neutrality or modest protection rather than harm [^bc123af1] [^613ade0d].

> But wait, what about exceptions or edge cases. I should confirm whether any subgroup shows increased potassium. Observational and trial data indicate that a pronounced early eGFR decline (> 30%) after SGLT2 initiation is associated with greater variability in potassium and more hyper- or hypokalemia events, likely reflecting underlying kidney disease progression rather than a direct drug effect, so in those patients I would monitor more closely rather than attributing causality to dapagliflozin itself [^0cc69564] [^d66e18d4]. Hold on, I should verify drug–drug interactions: when combined with loop diuretics, dapagliflozin can augment natriuresis and kaliuresis, so additive hypokalemia risk is plausible and warrants monitoring, even though dapagliflozin alone does not meaningfully lower potassium in most patients [^25fee4f2] [^9f6091a2].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure consistency. KDIGO 2024 explicitly notes that SGLT2 inhibitors do not appear to increase serum potassium and can facilitate continued use of RAAS blockade, which is crucial in CKD and heart failure where hyperkalemia often limits therapy, and the ADA Standards recommend routine potassium monitoring when initiating or changing RAAS inhibitors or diuretics, reflecting standard-of-care rather than a unique SGLT2 risk signal [^b26aeb1d] [^d8ebfb25] [^2a4976a0]. I need to ensure I am not overstating; these guidelines emphasize monitoring in high-risk contexts rather than asserting a potassium-raising effect of SGLT2 inhibitors, which supports the conclusion of neutrality or benefit on potassium balance [^b26aeb1d] [^d8ebfb25].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. No, Farxiga (dapagliflozin) does not increase potassium; clinically it is potassium-neutral overall and may reduce hyperkalemia risk in CKD and heart failure populations, with no meaningful increase in hypokalemia in large pooled datasets, though a small increase in mild hypokalemia has been observed in some analyses and concomitant loop diuretics can potentiate kaliuresis, so prudent monitoring is reasonable in high-risk patients or when combining with other diuretics [^74576d45] [^bc123af1] [^613ade0d] [^25fee4f2]. I should double-check that this aligns with FDA labeling; the U.S. label highlights volume depletion and ketoacidosis risks but does not identify hyperkalemia as a safety signal, which is consistent with the clinical data showing no potassium increase signal [^d59b5827].

> Practically, I need to ensure safe use. In patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², those on ACE inhibitors/ARBs/MRAs, or those using loop/thiazide diuretics, I would check potassium within 1–2 weeks after initiation and again after dose changes, recognizing that any abnormalities are more likely due to the underlying disease and co-therapies than to dapagliflozin itself, and I would not withhold dapagliflozin solely for fear of hyperkalemia in the absence of an alternative explanation [^2a4976a0] [^b26aeb1d]. Hold on, I should verify that this monitoring cadence matches guidance; yes, KDIGO and ADA endorse early lab checks after RAAS changes, which fits the clinical scenario even when SGLT2 is added, and supports proactive but not overly restrictive monitoring [^24497906] [^2a4976a0].

Farxiga (dapagliflozin) **does not increase potassium** and is not associated with hyperkalemia. In fact, it may slightly **lower potassium** or be neutral, with a small increase in mild hypokalemia in some patients. Large pooled analyses and meta-analyses show no clinically meaningful change in serum potassium versus placebo, even in patients with CKD or on ACE inhibitors/ARBs. Routine potassium monitoring is not required solely due to Farxiga, but standard monitoring is advised in patients with CKD, heart failure, or those on RAAS inhibitors or diuretics.

---

## Clinical evidence on potassium levels

Multiple large clinical trials and pooled analyses have evaluated the **effect of dapagliflozin on serum potassium**, consistently showing no increase in potassium and a low risk of hyperkalemia:

- **Pooled analysis of 14 randomized trials**: No clinically relevant mean change in serum potassium with dapagliflozin 10 mg vs placebo over 24 weeks; hyperkalemia (≥ 5.5 mmol/L) occurred in 8.6% with dapagliflozin vs 9.5% with placebo (IRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.10) [^74576d45] [^3e6694a5].

- **Moderate renal impairment study**: No difference in potassium with dapagliflozin vs placebo over 52 weeks; hyperkalemia incidence was 20.2% vs 26.5% with placebo (IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.34–1.35) [^74576d45] [^14e0887d].

- **Meta-analyses**: SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin, do not increase potassium and may reduce hyperkalemia risk, especially in CKD or HF patients on RAAS inhibitors [^bc123af1] [^613ade0d].

---

## Mechanisms influencing potassium balance

Dapagliflozin affects potassium via **competing physiological effects**:

| **Mechanism promoting hyperkalemia** | **Mechanism promoting hypokalemia** |
|-|-|
| Reduced insulin levels (via glycosuria) may shift potassium extracellularly | Increased distal sodium delivery enhances kaliuresis |
| RAAS activation from volume depletion could reduce potassium excretion | Osmotic diuresis increases urinary potassium loss |
| None of these produce sustained hyperkalemia in clinical studies | Mild hypokalemia can occur, especially with diuretics |

---

Overall, these effects **offset each other**, resulting in neutral or slightly lower potassium with dapagliflozin [^f6326d1c] [^b1f3524b].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do not require routine potassium monitoring solely for dapagliflozin; standard monitoring is advised for patients with CKD, heart failure, or those on RAAS inhibitors or diuretics. KDIGO 2024 notes that **SGLT2 inhibitors do not appear to increase serum potassium** and may facilitate continued RAAS blockade, which is beneficial in CKD and HF [^b26aeb1d] [^d8ebfb25].

---

## Patient populations at risk of potassium disturbances

Certain patients may have a **higher risk of potassium changes** with dapagliflozin, though absolute risk remains low:

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² have a higher baseline hyperkalemia risk, but dapagliflozin does not increase this risk and may reduce hyperkalemia events [^bc123af1] [^613ade0d].

- **Heart failure**: Patients on MRAs or ACE inhibitors/ARBs may benefit from dapagliflozin's potassium-neutral or mildly lowering effect, enabling continued RAAS therapy [^bc123af1] [^613ade0d].

- **Concomitant medications**: Loop or thiazide diuretics may increase hypokalemia risk; monitor potassium if used with dapagliflozin [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management of potassium disturbances

If potassium abnormalities occur in patients taking dapagliflozin:

- **Hyperkalemia**: Evaluate other causes (e.g. ACE inhibitors/ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, renal impairment) and manage per standard protocols; dapagliflozin is rarely the cause [^bc123af1] [^613ade0d].

- **Hypokalemia**: Consider dietary potassium intake, adjust diuretics, or add potassium-sparing agents if indicated; dapagliflozin alone rarely causes significant hypokalemia [^bc123af1] [^613ade0d].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Study or analysis** | **Findings regarding potassium** |
|-|-|
| Pooled analysis of 14 RCTs | No clinically meaningful change in potassium; hyperkalemia risk similar to placebo [^74576d45] [^3e6694a5] |
| Moderate renal impairment study | No difference in potassium; hyperkalemia incidence lower vs placebo [^74576d45] [^14e0887d] |
| Meta-analyses | SGLT2 inhibitors do not increase potassium; may reduce hyperkalemia risk [^bc123af1] [^613ade0d] |
| Clinical guidelines | No routine potassium monitoring required solely for dapagliflozin [^notfound] |

---

Farxiga (dapagliflozin) **does not increase potassium** and is not associated with hyperkalemia; it is potassium-neutral or may slightly lower potassium, with a low risk of mild hypokalemia. Routine potassium monitoring is not required solely for Farxiga, but standard monitoring is advised in patients with CKD, heart failure, or those on RAAS inhibitors or diuretics.

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin does not appear to increase serum potassium levels in patients with T2DM, including patients at a higher risk of hyperkalemia, such as those with moderate renal impairment or treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs or potassium-sparing diuretics. Furthermore, although there were more episodes of hypokalemia overall in the dapagliflozin group, dapagliflozin was not associated with an increased risk of hypokalemia in any of the patient categories associated with increased hypokalemia risk.

Discussion

The effect of dapagliflozin on serum potassium levels in over 4000 patients with T2DM across the dapagliflozin clinical trials program, and for a duration of up to 24 weeks was explored. No clinically relevant mean changes from baseline in serum potassium were noted in patients receiving dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo, and few marked abnormalities of serum potassium were reported in either group; all cases resolved without treatment and did not lead to discontinuation. Furthermore, no clinically relevant changes from baseline in serum potassium and no differences in marked abnormalities in serum potassium were reported with dapagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo in patients at higher risk of hyperkalemia, such as those with moderate renal impairment or those receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors, ARBs or potassium-sparing diuretics. While this analysis indicated that dapagliflozin did not increase hyperkalemia risk in patients with moderate renal impairment, dapagliflozin is not indicated for use in patients with moderate or low renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2). The frequency of any hyperkalemia episode (i.e. serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) in the overall pooled population was approximately 9% for both the dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo groups, whereas moderate or severe episodes of hyperkalemia (i.e. patients with a serum potassium level ≥ 6.0 mmol/L) occurred in 3% of patients in both groups. The majority of these episodes were asymptomatic and few AEs of potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L were reported (0.3% vs. 0.0% with dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively).

5.1 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, FARXIGA significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. FARXIGA is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing FARXIGA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) [^d7c3d907]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of dapagliflozin PO (also known as Farxiga) in patients with eGFR 45–60 mL/min/1.73 m²:
- Use acceptable.
- No dose adjustment required.
- Monitor renal function. Monitor for hypotension.

---

### Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) [^d59b5827]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and consider ketone monitoring in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue FARXIGA, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting FARXIGA.

Withhold FARXIGA, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume FARXIGA when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue FARXIGA and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Volume Depletion

FARXIGA can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating FARXIGA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.3 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis [^74576d45]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalemia risk is increased in diabetes, particularly in patients with renal impairment or those receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or potassium-sparing diuretics. Conversely, other diuretics can increase hypokalemia risk. We assessed the effects of the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin on serum potassium levels in a pooled analysis of clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

Fourteen randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind T2DM studies were analyzed: pooled data from 13 studies of ≤ 24 weeks' duration (dapagliflozin 10 mg, N = 2360; placebo, N = 2295); and one 52-week moderate renal impairment study in patients with baseline eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (dapagliflozin 10 mg, N = 85; placebo, N = 84). Central laboratory serum potassium levels were determined at each study visit.

Results

No clinically relevant mean changes from baseline in serum potassium ≤ 24 weeks were reported for dapagliflozin 10 mg [−0.05 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.07, −0.03] versus placebo (−0.02 mmol/L; 95% CI −0.04, 0.00) in the pooled population or in the renal impairment study (−0.03 mmol/L; 95% CI −0.14, 0.08 vs. −0.02 mmol/L; 95% CI −0.13, 0.09, respectively). The incidence rate ratio for serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L over 24 weeks for dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo was 0.90 (95% CI 0.74, 1.10) in the pooled population; with no increased risk in patients receiving ARBs/ACE inhibitors, or potassium-sparing diuretics, or in those with moderate renal impairment. Slightly more patients receiving dapagliflozin 10 mg had serum potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/L versus placebo (5.2% vs. 3.6%); however, no instances of serum potassium ≤ 2.5 mmol/L were reported.

Conclusion

Dapagliflozin is not associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia or severe hypokalemia in patients with T2DM.

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis [^48ea90f2]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of glucose-lowering drugs that improve glycemic control, produce favorable effects on body weight and blood pressure, and have a low associated risk of hypoglycemia. Given the renal site of action of SGLT2 inhibitors and the mild diuresis associated with their mode of action, there is potential concern about their effects on electrolyte balance, including potassium. Indeed, the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin is associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia.

Dapagliflozin is a highly selective orally available SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Phase IIb and III clinical studies have demonstrated that dapagliflozin has a favorable safety profile and is well tolerated as monotherapy or in combination with other glucose-lowering agents. Here we describe the results of a pooled analysis of dapagliflozin clinical trials in patients with T2DM that aimed to determine whether or not dapagliflozin 10 mg affected the risk of potassium imbalance.

Mean Change in Potassium from Baseline up to Week 24

No clinically relevant mean change from baseline in serum potassium was noted up to 24 weeks in the pooled population: −0.05 mmol/L (95% CI −0.07, −0.03) in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group compared with −0.02 mmol/L (95% CI −0.04, 0.00) in the placebo group (Fig. 1). Similarly, no clinically relevant mean changes from baseline in serum potassium over 24 weeks were noted with dapagliflozin versus placebo in the pooled population of patients treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs [−0.04 mmol/L (95% CI −0.07, −0.02) vs. −0.01 mmol/L (95% CI −0.03, 0.01), respectively, at week 24; Fig. 2 a] or potassium-sparing diuretics [−0.06 mmol/L (95% CI −0.15, 0.02), vs. 0.00 mmol/L (95% CI: −0.09, 0.09), respectively, at week 24; Fig. 2 b]. There were no clinically relevant mean changes from baseline in serum potassium in patients with moderate renal impairment at 24 weeks [−0.03 mmol/L (95% CI −0.14, 0.08) vs. −0.02 mmol/L (95% CI −0.13, 0.09) for dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo groups, respectively] or week 52 [−0.09 mmol/L (95% CI −0.19, 0.01) vs. 0.00 mmol/L (95% CI −0.11, 0.11), respectively; Fig. 2 c].

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, inform them that using FARXIGA can increase their risk of life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis. For all other patients, inform them that FARXIGA can cause potentially fatal ketoacidosis and that type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are risk factors.

Educate all patients on precipitating factors (such as insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, infection, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, dehydration, and alcohol abuse) and symptoms of ketoacidosis (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing). Inform patients that blood glucose may be normal even in the presence of ketoacidosis.

Advise patients that they may be asked to monitor ketones. If symptoms of ketoacidosis occur, instruct patients to discontinue FARXIGA and seek medical attention immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Volume Depletion

Inform patients that symptomatic hypotension may occur with FARXIGA and advise them to contact their healthcare provider if they experience such symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Inform patients that dehydration may increase the risk for hypotension, and to have adequate fluid intake.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. However, the benefit-risk for the use of dapagliflozin in patients with severe hepatic impairment should be individually assessed since the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin have not been specifically studied in this population [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis [^27c325c1]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Episodes of mild hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/L) in the pooled population were slightly more frequent with dapagliflozin than with placebo. As expected, these episodes were more common in patients receiving loop diuretics or thiazide diuretics both in patients taking dapagliflozin and placebo, with no relevant difference between the groups. Few AEs of hypokalemia were reported in either group (0.4% with dapagliflozin vs. 0.2% with placebo), and did not lead to discontinuation. There were no reports of severe hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 2.5 mmol/L) in the pooled population.

A trend towards increased hypokalemia risk could be consistent with dapagliflozin's mild diuretic effect; however, a lack of any difference between the groups when used with typical diuretics is both reassuring and somewhat unexpected. Renal potassium excretion is a complex process that is primarily determined by the serum aldosterone concentration and driven by the sodium concentration in the distal nephron. Due to the co-transportation of sodium and glucose, transient increases in urinary sodium excretion are seen for a few days upon initiation of dapagliflozin, after which levels tend to normalize. Thus, unlike typical diuretics, long-term treatment with dapagliflozin should not affect sodium delivery to the distal nephron. However, it should be acknowledged that in a previous small exploratory study, dapagliflozin treatment increased median plasma renin activity relative to placebo, to approximately a quarter of the hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg effect, and increased median serum aldosterone activity to a similar extent as hydrochlorothiazide. A potential trend for hypokalemia does not seem to be explained by dapagliflozin's mechanism of action, which is not reported to promote kaliuresis, neither is it consistent across the SGLT2 inhibitor class, as the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin has been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia risk with canagliflozin was greater in patients with moderate renal impairment or receiving ACE inhibitors, ARBs or potassium-sparing diuretics, and was more pronounced with the canagliflozin 300 mg dose than the 100 mg dose.

10 OVERDOSAGE

There were no reports of overdose during the clinical development program for FARXIGA.

In the event of an overdose, consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations. It is also reasonable to employ supportive measures as dictated by the patient's clinical status. The removal of dapagliflozin by hemodialysis has not been studied.

The analyzed population comprised short-term pooled data from 13 placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase IIb and III studies of up to 24 weeks' duration, in which patients with T2DM were treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg (N = 2360) or placebo (N = 2295; Table S1 in the supplementary material). The analysis consisted of three Phase IIb studies with durations of 12 weeks, and 10 Phase III studies with durations of 24 weeks. All patients had a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, with the exception of 1 patient in each treatment group.

Data from a Phase II/III 52-week dedicated renal impairment study, in which all patients had an eGFR at baseline of ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, were analyzed separately [dapagliflozin 10 mg (N = 85); placebo (N = 84)].

This article is based on previously conducted studies, and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors.

Outcomes Measures

Serum potassium levels were determined for each patient by central laboratory measurements at every study visit (at baseline, week 1 and week 4, then every 4 weeks up to week 24). Mean change in serum potassium levels from baseline were determined for dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo. This outcome was assessed in the pooled population (overall and in patients treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs) up to week 24, and in the moderate renal impairment study over 52 weeks.

The incidence of marked abnormalities of serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L and ≥ 6.0 mmol/L were determined for dapagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo. These cut-off points were selected as hyperkalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level at or above the upper limit of normal (≥ 5.5 mmol/L), whereas moderate hyperkalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level of ≥ 6.0–6.9 mmol/L.

Marked abnormalities of serum potassium reported as adverse events (AEs) or serious AEs (SAE; defined as those events meeting the International Conference on Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice criteria for an SAE) were assessed for dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo for the overall pooled population. The incidence of mild and severe hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 3.5 and ≤ 2.5 mmol/L, respectively) was also determined for dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo for the overall pooled population.

Results

Patients

Mean baseline demographic characteristics were well balanced between the dapagliflozin and placebo groups in the pooled population (Table 1). A high proportion of patients received an ACE inhibitor or ARB (65.9% in the dapagliflozin group and 68.2% in the placebo group) whereas only a small proportion of patients were treated with a potassium-sparing diuretic (5.0% with dapagliflozin vs. 5.6% with placebo). The majority of patients treated with a potassium-sparing diuretic also received an ACE inhibitor or ARB (82.4% with dapagliflozin and 80.5% with placebo).

Marked Abnormalities of Serum Potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L Reported as Adverse Events

Very few marked abnormalities of increased potassium were reported by the individual study investigators as clinical AEs: 7 (0.3%) in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group versus 0 in the placebo group. One SAE of hyperkalemia (serum potassium of 6.4 mmol/L on day 169 of treatment) was reported in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group. This patient had a history of hyperkalemia and hypertension and was treated with perindopril, which was stopped on day 175. His re-test potassium measurement was 6.1 mmol/L on day 176 and on day 178 this had decreased further to 4.5 mmol/L, at which point the SAE was considered resolved. Dapagliflozin dosing was not interrupted during this time.

All other AEs of hyperkalemia reported for patients in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group were reported as mild or moderate and had resolved by the next laboratory measurement (7 to 25 days later). No other patients had an AE that required treatment and no patients discontinued due to an AE of hyperkalemia.

Increase in Hematocrit

In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled trials of glycemic control, increases from baseline in mean hematocrit values were observed in FARXIGA-treated adult patients starting at Week 1 and continuing up to Week 16, when the maximum mean difference from baseline was observed. At Week 24, the mean changes from baseline in hematocrit were -0.33% in the placebo group and 2.30% in the FARXIGA 10 mg group. By Week 24, hematocrit values > 55% were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients and 1.3% of FARXIGA 10 mg-treated patients.

Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol

In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled trials of glycemic control, changes from baseline in mean lipid values were reported in FARXIGA-treated adult patients compared to placebo-treated patients. Mean percent changes from baseline at Week 24 were 0.0% versus 2.5% for total cholesterol, and -1.0% versus 2.9% for LDL cholesterol in the placebo and FARXIGA 10 mg groups, respectively. In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], mean changes from baseline after 4 years were 0.4 mg/dL versus -4.1 mg/dL for total cholesterol, and -2.5 mg/dL versus -4.4 mg/dL for LDL cholesterol, in FARXIGA-treated and the placebo groups, respectively.

Decrease in Serum Bicarbonate

In a trial of concomitant therapy of FARXIGA 10 mg with exenatide extended-release (on a background of metformin) in adults, four patients (1.7%) on concomitant therapy had a serum bicarbonate value of less than or equal to 13 mEq/L compared to one each (0.4%) in the FARXIGA and exenatide-extended release treatment groups [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Clinical Trial in Pediatric Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

The FARXIGA safety profile observed in a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial with a 26-week extension in 157 pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus was similar to that observed in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Marked Abnormalities of Serum Potassium ≤ 2.5 and ≤ 3.5 mmol/L

The proportion of patients with a serum potassium level of ≤ 3.5 mmol/L was slightly higher with dapagliflozin 10 mg than placebo in the overall pooled population [5.2% vs. 3.6%, respectively; IRR 1.40 (95% CI 1.05, 1.87); Fig. 5], and for subgroups of patients in the pooled population receiving thiazide diuretics [7.9% vs. 6.7%; IRR 1.24 (95% CI 0.73, 2.11)] or loop diuretics [7.4% vs. 5.3%; IRR 1.56 (95% CI 0.65, 3.93)].

Few marked abnormalities of potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/L were reported as AEs [9 (0.4%) vs. 4 (0.2%) with dapagliflozin 10 mg vs. placebo, respectively]. None of these AEs resulted in discontinuation and the majority were mild in intensity [8 (0.3%) with dapagliflozin 10 mg vs. 2 (0.1%) with placebo], with no severe events reported. In total, 6 (0.3%) patients in the dapagliflozin group and 1 (< 0.1%) patient in the placebo group had an AE of hypokalemia that required intervention.

There were no reports of a serum potassium level of ≤ 2.5 mmol/L in the pooled population.

Introduction

Hyperkalemia, defined as a serum potassium level of greater than 5.5 mmol/L, is a potentially life-threatening condition that causes increased cardiac depolarization and can lead to rapid electrocardiographic changes and an increased risk of arrhythmias. Conversely, hypokalemia is defined as a serum potassium level of less than 3.5 mmol/L (mild) or less than 2.5 mmol/L (severe) and can lead to an increase in the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition to the risk associated with serum potassium outside the normal range (i.e. below or above normal levels), maintaining stable serum potassium values within physiological levels is important, as high serum potassium fluctuations are associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of hyperkalemia and diabetes is an independent risk factor for hyperkalemia. In an outpatient population of patients with diabetes, the prevalence of hyperkalemia has been estimated at 4%, whereas in a separate investigation in the general population, it has been estimated to be lower (0.3%). Additionally, diabetes is associated with a high incidence of renal impairment, which in turn is an independent risk factor for hyperkalemia.

Antihypertensive medications, which are frequently prescribed to these patients, can also increase serum potassium. For example, medications that reduce renal potassium excretion by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)], and drugs that inhibit the epithelial sodium channel (known as potassium-sparing diuretics) are associated with a greater hyperkalemia risk. The combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB and a potassium-sparing diuretic is likely to further increase potassium levels and has been shown to precipitate life-threatening hyperkalemia in patients with diabetes. Conversely, other diuretics such as thiazides or loop diuretics are generally associated with an increased risk of hypokalemia.

Older patients with diabetes have an increased susceptibility to hyperkalemia due to a number of factors, including an age-related decline in renal function and pharmaceutical side effects, such as those associated with ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment.

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis [^2d6a2bed]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia risk is greater in patients with diabetes, which may be partly attributed to hyperosmolarity caused by hyperglycemia, resulting in a shift in potassium out of cells. Impaired elimination of potassium can also increase the risk of hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with reduced renal function or those treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Monitoring potassium levels is an important consideration in patients with diabetes, particularly as these patients often have hypertension and may be treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs and/or potassium-sparing diuretics, making them more susceptible to hyperkalemia. Likewise, potassium monitoring may be important in patients with renal impairment, who are also considered to be at high risk of hyperkalemia. Clinicians should balance the opposing risks of avoiding hyperkalemia and causing hypokalemia, or vice versa. For example, potassium-sparing diuretics have been shown to prevent diuretic-induced hypokalemia but are associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Furthermore, combinations of drugs with an associated risk of hyperkalemia (e.g. ACE inhibitor, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics) or hypokalemia (e.g. thiazides or loop diuretics) may rapidly precipitate serious serum electrolyte abnormalities. Therefore, knowledge of the presence or absence of an effect on potassium homeostasis with antidiabetic drugs is important. Previous studies indicate that dapagliflozin does not affect potassium levels when taken in combination with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazides or loop diuretics.

A limitation of this analysis was the low number of patients in some of the subgroups (i.e. patients on potassium-sparing diuretics or with low eGFR), restricting the reliability of the assessment of risk for the AEs or marked abnormalities in these patients.

Incidence of Marked Abnormalities of Serum Potassium ≥ 5.5 and ≥ 6.0 mmol/L

The incidence of serum potassium reported at or above the upper limit of normal (5.5 mmol/L) up to 24 weeks was similar for dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo overall in the pooled population of patients [8.6% vs. 9.5%, respectively; IRR 0.90 (95% CI 0.74, 1.10)], and for subgroups of patients in the pooled population on ACE inhibitors or ARBs, or with low eGFR (Fig. 3). The IRR upper 95% CI for serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L up to 24 weeks was below 1 for dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo for patients on potassium-sparing diuretics and for patients with an eGFR of ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 on ACE inhibitors or ARBs (Fig. 3). In the 52 week moderate renal impairment study, the incidence of serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L was 20.2% with dapagliflozin 10 mg and 26.5% with placebo [IRR 0.69 (95% CI 0.34, 1.35); Fig. 3], with fewer patients treated with dapagliflozin discontinuing due to hyperkalemia (4.7% vs. 9.5%, respectively).

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal renal tubules, is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and thereby promotes urinary glucose excretion.

Dapagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and downregulation of sympathetic activity, and decreased intraglomerular pressure which is believed to be mediated by increased tubuloglomerular feedback.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

General

Increases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin (see Figure 1). Dapagliflozin doses of 5 or 10 mg per day in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks resulted in excretion of approximately 70 grams of glucose in the urine per day at Week 12. A near maximum glucose excretion was observed at the dapagliflozin daily dosage of 20 mg. This urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. After discontinuation of dapagliflozin, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg dosage.

Figure 1: Scatter Plot and Fitted Line of Change from Baseline in 24-Hour Urinary Glucose Amount versus Dapagliflozin Dose in Healthy Subjects and Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) (Semi-Log Plot)

Cardiac Electrophysiology

Dapagliflozin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of QTc interval at daily doses up to 150 mg (15-times the recommended maximum dose) in a study of healthy subjects. In addition, no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval was observed following single doses of up to 500 mg (50-times the recommended maximum dose) of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects.

8.5 Geriatric Use

No FARXIGA dosage change is recommended based on age.

A total of 1424 (24%) of the 5936 FARXIGA-treated patients were 65 years and older and 207 (3.5%) patients were 75 years and older in a pool of 21 double-blind, controlled, clinical trials assessing the efficacy of FARXIGA in improving glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. After controlling for level of renal function (eGFR), efficacy was similar for patients under age 65 years and those 65 years and older. In patients ≥ 65 years of age, a higher proportion of patients treated with FARXIGA for glycemic control had adverse reactions of hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the DAPA-CKD, DAPA-HF and DELIVER trials, safety and efficacy were similar for patients aged 65 years and younger and those older than 65. In the DAPA-HF study, 2714 (57%) out of 4744 patients with HFrEF were older than 65 years. In the DELIVER study, 4759 (76%) out of 6263 patients with heart failure (LVEF > 40%) were older than 65 years. In the DAPA-CKD study, 1818 (42%) out of 4304 patients with CKD were older than 65 years.

Add-On Combination Therapy with a Sulfonylurea

A total of 597 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7% and ≤ 10%) were randomized in this 24-week, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate FARXIGA in combination with glimepiride (a sulfonylurea) (NCT00680745).

Patients on at least half the maximum recommended dose of glimepiride as monotherapy (4 mg) for at least 8 weeks lead-in were randomized to FARXIGA 5 mg, FARXIGA 10 mg, or placebo in addition to glimepiride 4 mg per day. Down-titration of glimepiride to 2 mg or 0 mg was allowed for hypoglycemia during the treatment period; no up-titration of glimepiride was allowed.

In combination with glimepiride, FARXIGA 10 mg provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c, FPG, and 2-hour PPG, and statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo plus glimepiride at Week 24 (see Table 12). Statistically significant (p < 0.05 for both doses) mean changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure relative to placebo plus glimepiride were −2.8 mmHg and −3.8 mmHg with FARXIGA 5 mg and 10 mg plus glimepiride, respectively.

Likewise, when the higher serum potassium cut-off point of ≥ 6.0 mmol/L was used, the incidence of marked abnormalities with dapagliflozin 10 mg was similar to placebo for patients overall (3.0% vs. 2.7%, respectively), with an IRR of 1.08 (95% CI 0.76, 1.55). For all subgroups, IRR analysis of marked abnormalities of serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L had 95% CIs that included the null value of 1, suggesting that there were no differences between the dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo groups [IRR (95% CI) by patient subgroup: ACE inhibitor/ARB, 1.16 (0.78, 1.74); ACE inhibitor/ARB or potassium-sparing diuretic, 1.16 (0.78, 1.75); eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 0.60 (0.23, 1.51); eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 on ACE inhibitor/ARB, 0.54 (0.19, 1.40)]. Furthermore, there was no meaningful difference between dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo in the incidence of marked abnormalities of serum potassium of ≥ 6.0 mmol/L in the moderate renal impairment study (IRR 0.34 [95% CI 0.06, 1.41]).

Distribution of Marked Abnormalities of Serum Potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L

Marked abnormalities of serum potassium for patients in the dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo groups were most commonly limited to the 5.50–5.75 mmol/L range [91 (45.3%) vs. 113 (52.6%), respectively; Fig. 4].

Analysis Methods

Presented mean changes from baseline and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI), which were calculated using the t-distribution method, were conducted with SAS/STAT ® (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA). For the analysis of the incidence of marked abnormalities of serum potassium, incidence rate ratios (IRR) and associated 95% CIs, which were stratified by study, were calculated post hoc using exact methods with StatXact ® (Cytel, Cambridge, MA, USA). The IRR was defined as the rate of the event in the dapagliflozin group divided by the rate in the placebo group. Thus, an IRR upper 95% CI of < 1 (1 being the null value) would indicate that dapagliflozin was associated with a lower incidence of marked abnormalities of serum potassium than placebo. Conversely, an IRR lower 95% CI of > 1 would indicate that dapagliflozin was associated with a higher incidence of marked abnormalities of serum potassium than placebo. No statistical hypothesis testing was conducted and no p values were calculated. All analyses were performed using all available data regardless of the use of rescue therapy. Mean eGFR was determined using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, urticaria, hypersensitivity) were reported with FARXIGA treatment. In glycemic control trials in adults, serious anaphylactic reactions and severe cutaneous adverse reactions and angioedema were reported in 0.2% of comparator-treated patients and 0.3% of FARXIGA-treated patients. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of FARXIGA; treat per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.

Ketoacidosis in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus

In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], events of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were reported in 27 out of 8574 adult patients in the FARXIGA-treated group and 12 out of 8569 adult patients in the placebo group. The events were evenly distributed over the trial period.

Laboratory Tests in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Increases in Serum Creatinine and Decreases in eGFR

Initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA causes a small increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR. These changes in serum creatinine and eGFR generally occur within two weeks of starting therapy and then stabilize regardless of baseline kidney function. Changes that do not fit this pattern should prompt further evaluation to exclude the possibility of acute kidney injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In two trials that included adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with moderate renal impairment, the acute effect on eGFR reversed after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the renal function changes observed with FARXIGA.

In the subgroup of 136 patients with UACR ≥ 30 mg/g, the difference between dapagliflozin compared with placebo in UACR was −49.7% (95% CI −66.9 to −23.6) and −30.2% (95% CI −52.3–2.2) in the 5- and 10-mg groups, respectively, after 4 weeks. This effect was sustained throughout the remaining follow-up period. The least square mean differences between placebo and dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg during the overall period were −47.1% (95% CI −64.8 to −20.6) and −38.4% (95% CI −57.6 to −10.3), respectively. The effects of dapagliflozin on UACR 24 weeks post-therapy were consistent in albuminuria subgroups stratified by baseline median albuminuria level (P of interaction = 0.57) and also in subgroups defined by baseline micro- and macroalbuminuria (P of interaction = 0.26).

Compared with placebo, treatment with dapagliflozin resulted in an elevation of the least square mean serum phosphate level by 0.2 mg/dL (95% CI 0.1–0.4) for the 5-mg group and 0.3 mg/dL (95% CI 0.1–0.4) for the 10-mg group (Figure 1 C). No clinically relevant change in potassium was observed for either of the dapagliflozin groups (Figure 1 D).

5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) are known to cause hypoglycemia. FARXIGA may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with FARXIGA [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)

Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's Gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

Patients treated with FARXIGA presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue FARXIGA, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

### Long-term study of patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment shows that dapagliflozin reduces weight and blood pressure but does not improve glycemic control [^b91078ac]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

No change from baseline was noted in mean serum sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, or calcium with dapagliflozin or placebo. No evidence of hyponatremia or hypokalemia was observed. Marked abnormalities of elevated potassium (⩾6 mEq/l) were more common in the placebo group (12.0%) than in dapagliflozin 5-mg (4.8%) or 10-mg groups (4.8%) during the study. More patients experienced marked abnormalities of hyperphosphatemia (⩾5.6 mg/dl for patients 17 to 65 years of age or ⩾5.1 mg/dl for patients ⩾66 years of age) on treatment with dapagliflozin 5 mg (15.7%) or 10 mg (14.3%) than placebo (8.4%). Patients receiving dapagliflozin had a larger mean decrease in serum uric acid than those receiving placebo (Table 6). The mean concentration of serum parathyroid hormone exceeded the upper limit of normal at baseline in all treatment groups, and there were larger mean increases in parathyroid hormone in dapagliflozin compared with placebo during the cumulative 104-week period (Table 6).

Conclusions

In patients with T2D, SGLT2i treatment decreased eGFR by a small amount on average. There was a higher incidence of hyperkalemic and hypokalemic events in a small number of patients, especially those whose eGFR dropped significantly at the start of treatment. Conversely, a modest early drop in eGFR (eg < 30%) following SGLT2i treatment was not associated with an increase in the risk of hypokalemia or hyperkalemia. Nevertheless, physicians should be aware that the eGFR trough occurs shortly, and consequent serum potassium changes following SGLT2i initiation.

### Effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition with empagliflozin on potassium handling in patients with acute heart failure [^b92bac25]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Disturbances of potassium homeostasis are common in patients hospitalised for heart failure (HF). This increased risk of hypo‐ and hyperkalaemia is caused by haemodynamic changes, treatment with diuretics and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, and the high prevalence of comorbidities (e.g. diabetes and renal dysfunction) in these patients. Therefore, current HF guidelines recommend close monitoring of serum potassium concentrations in patients hospitalised with HF.

Treatment with sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduces the risk of worsening HF and cardiovascular death in ambulant patients with HF. In acute HF, SGLT2 inhibitors increase diuresis despite a temporary decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Due to the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function, an impact on potassium homeostasis might be expected. Although the largest proportion of potassium is reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and water in the proximal tubule causes an electrical and chemical potassium gradient which leads to (passive) potassium reabsorption. Therefore, blocking the SGLT2 receptor might affect potassium homeostasis.

Data on the risk of potassium disturbances after initiating treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors remain inconsistent. In patients with diabetes, dapagliflozin did not affect serum potassium concentrations. However, patients on mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy included in the DAPA‐HF trial had a 50% lower chance of developing moderate/severe hyperkalaemia when treated with dapagliflozin compared with placebo. The frequency of hyperkalaemia in the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial was lower for patients treated with empagliflozin compared with placebo, whereas the EMPEROR‐Reduced trial showed no difference. Canagliflozin increased serum potassium concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes, with a more pronounced effect at higher dosages, concomitant treatment with RAAS inhibitors, or impaired renal function. Contrastingly, no differences in the frequency of hyperkalaemia were seen in the large canagliflozin trials (CREDENCE and CANVAS). None of these studies reported on renal potassium handling as reflected by urinary potassium concentrations. Therefore, we studied the effects of the addition of empagliflozin, on top of loop diuretic therapy, on renal potassium handling in patients hospitalised with acute HF.

Increases in Serum Potassium

In a pooled population of adult patients (N = 723) in glycemic control trials with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), increases in serum potassium to greater than 5.4 mEq/L and 15% above occurred in 5.3%, 5.0%, and 8.8% of patients treated with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Severe elevations (greater than or equal to 6.5 mEq/L) occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with placebo, no patients treated with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 1.3% of patients treated with canagliflozin 300 mg.

In these patients, increases in potassium were more commonly seen in those with elevated potassium at baseline. Among patients with moderate renal impairment, approximately 84% were taking medications that interfere with potassium excretion, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor blockers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

In CREDENCE, no difference in serum potassium, no increase in adverse events of hyperkalemia, and no increase in absolute (> 6.5 mEq/L) or relative (> upper limit of normal and > 15% increase from baseline) increases in serum potassium were observed in adult patients treated with canagliflozin 100 mg relative to placebo.

Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (non-HDL-C)

In the pool of four glycemic control placebo-controlled trials in adults, dose-related increases in LDL-C with canagliflozin were observed. Mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in LDL-C relative to placebo were 4.4 mg/dL (4.5%) and 8.2 mg/dL (8.0%) with canagliflozin 100 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. The mean baseline LDL-C levels were 104 to 110 mg/dL across treatment groups.

Dose-related increases in non-HDL-C with canagliflozin were observed in adults. Mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in non-HDL-C relative to placebo were 2.1 mg/dL (1.5%) and 5.1 mg/dL (3.6%) with canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively. The mean baseline non-HDL-C levels were 140 to 147 mg/dL across treatment groups.

### Dapagliflozin acutely improves endothelial dysfunction, reduces aortic stiffness and renal resistive index in type 2 diabetic patients: a pilot study [^78d69690]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Effect of dapagliflozin on electrolytes balance

A novel observation coming from our data is to characterize for the first time as dapagliflozin acutely acts as a purely "glucoretic" compound; in other words, beside glycosuria, it increases free water excretion without modifying the urinary electrolyte profile.

A common, and likely incorrect concept, is that SGLT2 inhibitors exert a beneficial natriuretic effect, even though few studies have so far measured natriuresis during SGLT2 inhibition in type 2 diabetes. Recently, a transient increase in urinary sodium and chloride excretion has been reported with empagliflozin; we could not confirm this observation with dapagliflozin. The lack of variation in natriuresis, even after a 2-day treatment, supports the hypothesis of an increased expression and/or functional activity of other sodium transporters that might account for an immediately increased distal Na reabsorption. It is unlikely that the lack of change in natriuresis is attributable to the baseline small difference in serum osmolarity, more likely influenced by baseline difference in haematocrit.

Furthermore, acute variations in serum potassium levels were not observed in the present study. In a similar experimental setting, empagliflozin induces a modest, albeit significant increase in serum potassium levels. We cannot exclude that this different behaviour might be due to the different SGLT2 selectivity of the two drugs; however, this selective action on the free water pool can be regarded as a clinically advantageous effect respect to diuresis induced by classic thiazide compounds.

Another small mechanistic contribution of the present study is to show here that an increased serum magnesium level following SGLT2 inhibition, recently reported by an ample meta-analysis, is an immediate effect. Interestingly, magnesium in the high-normality range, is associated with a lower cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, magnesium supplementation exerts favorable effects on endothelial function in individuals at risk for diabetes, suggesting another possible mechanism through which SGLT2 inhibitors achieve vascular protection.

Some limitations of the present study should be acknowledged. First, this is a pilot study; though performed in a carefully selected population, the promising beneficial effects of dapagliflozin on endothelial function should be confirmed in larger cohorts and by randomized clinical trials. This is particularly relevant, since adjustment for known determinants of vascular function (i.e. brachial artery diameter for FMD), crucial for the interpretation of our findings, was not possible in the present study due to the small sample size. Second, before the described acute vascular effects can translate to an effective reduction of the cardiovascular risk, a demonstration of a long-lasting improvement in vascular function is necessary.

Urinary output

The probability of interaction between dapagliflozin and urinary output over time was 0.86. Overall, dapagliflozin increased urinary output by 94 mL/day (95% CrI −52 to 229) with 91% probability. This effect remained consistent, with probabilities around 0.90 from day 2 to day 5 (Table 2, Fig. 1). By day 5, urinary output was 157 mL/day higher in the dapagliflozin group (95% CrI −90 to 386). Raw values are shown in eFigure 1 and subgroup analysis is shown in eFigure 2, with numerical values in eTable 2 and 3. Heterogeneity analyses revealed no major signs of heterogeneity for treatment effects on urinary output (heterogeneity probability 16–34%). In analyses adjusting only for baseline characteristics (without furosemide or creatinine adjustment), the net effect was 82 mL/day overall (95% CrI −52 to 223, probability 88%), demonstrating that dapagliflozin improves urinary output even when accounting for reduced diuretic use.

### Effects of dapagliflozin on urinary output, fluid balance, and biochemistry in critically ill patients: a post-hoc secondary analysis of the DEFENDER trial [^0aaaabde]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium-glucose cotransport-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are increasingly used in medical patients with several clinical conditions. SGLT2i have been shown to improve relevant patient-centered outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). SGLT2i may also have acute effects such as reducing occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in some specific populations. Trials of SGLT2i in acutely ill patients, however, have been limited in size and have yielded inconclusive results so far. On the other hand, the recent DEFENDER trial found a 90% probability that dapagliflozin reduced the need for renal replacement therapy. Such observations suggest the need to better understand how dapagliflozin might have affected kidney relevant physiological variables.

SGLT2i have important physiologic effects relevant to critical illness. Specifically, besides the expected effects on glycemic control due glycosuria, SGLT2i may increase urinary output and, due to free water losses, also increase sodium levels. Such diuresis and hypernatremia may affect fluid balance, pH and vasopressor requirements. Knowledge of such effects may help clinicians interpret clinical and laboratory findings and respond as clinically indicated.

In this secondary analysis of the Dapagliflozin for Critically Ill Patients With Acute Organ Dysfunction (DEFENDER) trial, we explored whether dapagliflozin, a SGLT2i, would affect urinary output, fluid balance, furosemide use, norepinephrine requirements, sodium and potassium levels, and glucose levels in the first five days after the initiation of therapy. We aimed to test the primary hypothesis that, compared with controls, dapagliflozin would increase urinary output and, thereby, lead to a more negative fluid balance.

Severe elevations (greater than or equal to 6.5 mEq/L) occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with placebo, no patients treated with INVOKANA 100 mg, and 1.3% of patients treated with INVOKANA 300 mg.

### Empagliflozin and serum potassium in heart failure: an analysis from EMPEROR-pooled [^cef8950c]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In more than 9500 HF patients across a wide range of ejection fractions, our study shows that empagliflozin (vs. placebo) reduced the rate of new-onset hyperkalaemia or new initiation of potassium binders without increasing the incidence of hypokalaemia in a significant manner (Structured Graphical Abstract). These findings are clinically important and expand the potential benefits of empagliflozin in HF.

Patients with high potassium at baseline were more frequently diagnosed with diabetes and ischaemic HF aetiology, had reduced LVEF and impaired renal function, but were more frequently treated with RAASi, particularly sacubitril/valsartan or MRAs. Patients with these characteristics are at high risk of developing hyperkalaemia, and in the presence of even mild hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 5.0–5.5 mmol/L) many clinicians reduce the dose, withhold, or stop RAASi which may lead to HF worsening and a poor prognosis. Therefore, by reducing the incidence of hyperkalaemia, empagliflozin treatment may enable the concomitant use or up-titration of RAASi to target doses. In this regard, we have previously documented that patients randomized to empagliflozin were less likely to stop MRA therapy throughout the follow-up.

The effect to reduce hyperkalaemia incidence likely represents a SGLT2i class effect reported across different populations. An analysis from CREDENCE trial showed that canagliflozin (vs. placebo) reduced the rate of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64–0.95) and laboratory-determined hyperkalaemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L, HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61–0.98), without increasing the risk of hypokalaemia in patients with T2D and CKD. In the DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced trials, where 70% of participants were using MRAs at baseline, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin reduced the incidence of moderate-to-severe hyperkalaemia, defined as serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L, particularly among patients receiving MRAs. Patients with CKD and those who had a recent HHF also have a high risk of hyperkalaemia; such risk can be reduced with SGLT2i in a pronounced fashion.

There were no clinically significant changes in serum sodium, osmolality, or creatinine concentrations (Table 2). Serum glucose was reduced modestly by dapagliflozin or combined administration (Table 2), reflecting a sharp increase in urinary glucose excretion (Figure S1). Serum potassium was unchanged by dapagliflozin alone but was reduced 7% by bumetanide alone and 12% by the combination (Table 2), reflecting increases in renal K + excretion (Figure S2). Serum urate was reduced 36% by dapagliflozin alone, was increased 3% by bumetanide alone, and was reduced 22% by the combination (Table 2). Urate excretion peaked quickly after dapagliflozin and combined administration, followed by a decline, but there was a sustained increase in renal urate clearance (Figure S3).

### Treatment strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in persons with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^7de319bb]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The main adverse effect of RAS inhibitor therapy is hyperkalemia, particularly in the advanced stages of disease. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of 20 studies covering 47,122 participants reported that hyperkalemia is twice as common (risk ratio 2.03; 95% CI 1.67–2.48) in participants on drugs that act on the RAS compared with the control group. In most individuals, the clinical benefit of RAS inhibition outweighs the risk of hyperkalemia. Moreover, the risk can be managed without the need to discontinue therapy with RAS inhibitors by using strategies such as reducing potassium intake or prescribing loop diuretics and potassium binders, and the risk of hyperkalemia is lower in people on SGLT2 inhibitors.

SGLT2 inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glucose and sodium reabsorption by kidney proximal tubular cells, by their action on SGLT2, a sodium‐coupled glucose transporter, which is upregulated in diabetes.

Data from randomized controlled trials (CREDENCE, SCORED, DAPA‐CKD, and EMPA‐KIDNEY) demonstrate improvements in cardiorenal outcomes following SGLT2‐inhibitor treatment in diabetic kidney disease (and non‐diabetic CKD).

CREDENCE (NCT02065791) was a double‐blind, randomized trial evaluating the effects of canagliflozin on kidney and CV outcomes in participants with T2D and albuminuric CKD who were randomized to receive canagliflozin or placebo in addition to maximally tolerated/clinically appropriate RAS blockade. The primary endpoint was a composite kidney outcome, including end‐stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplantation, or a sustained eGFR of < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2), a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from kidney or CV causes. In participants receiving canagliflozin, the relative risk of the composite kidney outcome was 30% lower compared with the placebo group, with event rates of 43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient‐years, respectively (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.59–0.82). The risk of CV death, MI, or stroke was also lowered (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.67–0.95). In participants with a history of CVD, the relative risk of the composite kidney outcome was 30% lower compared with the placebo group (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.56–0.88). The event rates per 1000 patient‐years were 46.8 and 65.1 in the canagliflozin and placebo arm, respectively.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors as an early, first-line therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^404e429f]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

ACEi or ARNI and MRA, among the pillars of HFrEF therapy, often cause hyperkalaemia, especially in patients with CKD, leading to under‐prescription of evidence‐based treatment and worse outcome.SGLT2 inhibitors were not associated with significant changes in potassium levels in major trials, also reducing the need for close laboratory monitoring. A sub‐analysis of DAPA‐HF showed lower rates of hyperkalaemia with dapagliflozin in the subgroup of individuals treated with MRAs. Although this observation has not been confirmed in EMPEROR‐Reduced, results showed fewer discontinuation of MRAs among patients prescribed with empagliflozin. Reduced rates of hyperkalaemia with SGLT2 inhibitors have also been demonstrated in adjacent clinical trials of patients with CKD. Adverse events observed in major clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Genital infections are among the most common complications in patients with diabetes treated with SGLT2 inhibitors as a consequence of glycosuria. Of note, sotagliflozin was associated with more frequent adverse events, including diarrhoea, hypotension and hypoglycaemia, generally not observed in the other SGLT2 inhibitor trials. This adverse event rate can likely be attributed to additional inhibition effects exerted by sotagliflozin on the gastrointestinal and renal SGLT1.

3.4 Effect of dapagliflozin on neurohormonal hormones

Plasma renin and angiotensin II increased after 4 days of dapagliflozin treatment. This effect persisted on Day 14 (Table 2). With respect to urinary RAAS markers in DAPASALT, aldosterone, angiotensinogen and renin increased after 4 days of dapagliflozin treatment. This effect persisted on Day 14 (Table 2). During wash‐out, urinary aldosterone and urinary angiotensinogen remained stable, whereas urinary renin returned towards baseline (Table 2). In the DIAMOND study, dapagliflozin modestly increased both plasma renin and aldosterone compared to placebo, but these effects were not statistically significant (Table 3).

3.5 Effect of dapagliflozin on markers of volume status

In DAPASALT participants, mean plasma copeptin level increased during treatment with dapagliflozin after 4 days, which persisted throughout follow‐up and returned towards baseline values during wash‐out (Table 2). Mean plasma osmolality was stable during dapagliflozin treatment and wash‐out. Mean plasma urea nominally increased after 4 days of treatment but returned to baseline on Day 14 and was stable afterwards during wash‐out (Table 2). Mean urinary urea gradually decreased in DAPASALT during dapagliflozin treatment and increased during wash‐out (Table 2). Mean 24‐hour osmolality showed a modest increase at the start of dapagliflozin treatment and decreased during wash‐out. Mean free water clearance did not change during dapagliflozin treatment but decreased during wash‐out (Table 2). Mean fractional urea excretion gradually decreased on Day 4 and persisted on Day 14, while a nominal initial increase in fractional potassium excretion was observed after 4 days of dapagliflozin treatment (Table 2).

In DIAMOND study participants, dapagliflozin compared to placebo significantly increased plasma copeptin and urea levels, while no between‐group difference was observed in plasma osmolality. Dapagliflozin compared to placebo significantly increased urine osmolality. Similarly, as in DAPASALT, in the dapagliflozin group fractional potassium excretion increased and fractional urea excretion decreased although these differences were not statistically significant when compared with placebo (Table 3).

### Interaction between the sodium-glucose-linked transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and the loop diuretic bumetanide in normal human subjects [^25fee4f2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Daily renal K + excretion was greater during combined therapy than during dapagliflozin alone. Accordingly, serum potassium was reduced more when administered with bumetanide. Hypokalemia with loop diuretics has been attributed variously to flow‐mediated K + secretion in the distal nephron 32 or to effects of K + arginine vasopressin 33 or hyperaldosteronism. 33, 34 The greater K + excretion and hypokalemia with combined therapy may be a consequence of hyperaldosteronism because there were high levels of PRA. Serum potassium should be monitored during combined therapy.

Dapagliflozin enhanced urate excretion and urate clearance and reduced serum urate substantially, 35, 36 whereas bumetanide alone reduced urate clearance. An enhanced proximal urate reabsorption with loop diuretics has been ascribed to volume depletion. 37 Moreover, both uric acid and loop diuretics are substrates for the apical proximal tubule human sodium phosphate transporter 4 (SLC17A3) 38 and the proximal multidrug resistance protein 4. 39 Thus, loop diuretics might compete for the renal secretion of uric acid. Glucose reabsorption enhances urate reabsorption via the sugar‐related human uric acid transporter/channel. 40 Thus, an increase in proximal tubule fluid glucose delivery with dapagliflozin may decrease proximal tubular urate transport and thereby increase urate clearance. 41

There was no apparently significant pharmacokinetic interaction between dapagliflozin and bumetanide. There was a relatively high frequency of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness that may have been related to the administration of the salt tablets.

We acknowledge some limitations. First, we measured Na + excretion in 6‐hour, 24‐hour, and 1‐week periods rather than changes from baseline because the Na + excretion on the predosing day was low because subjects were fasted to undertake pharmacokinetic studies. More important, all 42 subjects consumed identical meals throughout the 16 days. Therefore, between‐group comparisons would not be prejudiced. We elected to undertake this initial study in a homogeneous group of normal subjects. The effects were more modest than would be anticipated in patients with T2DM who have an increased filtered load of glucose and therefore an enhanced excretion of glucose, osmoles, and Na +. 42 Nevertheless, substantial adaptive changes were apparent, despite the relatively small natriuretic effect of dapagliflozin in these euglycemic subjects.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and DPP-4 inhibitors and risk of hyperkalemia among people with type 2 diabetes in clinical practice: population based cohort study [^74446bbb]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Unanswered questions and future research

In our analyses, we focused on hyperkalemia as an outcome. A recent post hoc analysis of the CREDENCE (canagliflozin and renal events in diabetes with established nephropathy clinical evaluation) and DAPA-CKD (dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease) trials found that SGLT-2 inhibitor use was associated with a lower rate of discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors compared with placebo during follow-up in patients with albuminuric chronic kidney disease. Future studies should investigate whether these effects are also observed for GLP-1 receptor agonists, and whether this is mediated by a lower risk of hyperkalemia. Similarly, studies could investigate whether SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists have an effect on the use of loop diuretics.

### Correction of hypomagnesemia by dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes: a post hoc analysis of 10 randomized, placebo-controlled trials [^5f3ab99f]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium [Mg] < 0.74 mmol/L [< 1.8 mg/dL]) is commonly observed in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study investigated the effect of treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg on Mg concentrations in patients with T2D.

Methods

In this post hoc analysis, we used pooled data from 10 placebo-controlled studies of dapagliflozin over 24 weeks of treatment in patients with T2D. We evaluated the change in Mg in patients receiving dapagliflozin vs. placebo overall, and in subgroups with baseline hypomagnesemia and normal/hypermagnesemia (≥ 0.74 mmol/L [≥ 1.8 mg/dL]). We determined the proportion of patients with baseline hypomagnesemia who achieved Mg ≥ 0.74 mmol/L (≥ 1.8 mg/dL).

Results

A total of 4398 patients with T2D were included. The mean change from baseline to week 24 in Mg was significantly larger with dapagliflozin vs. placebo; difference, 0.06 mmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05, 0.06). The proportion of patients with Mg within the population reference range after 24 weeks of treatment was significantly higher with dapagliflozin vs. placebo; difference, 47.8% (95% CI: 41.4, 53.9). The proportion of patients displaying hypermagnesemia did not increase with dapagliflozin treatment.

Conclusions

Treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg resulted in correction of Mg concentrations in patients with T2D and hypomagnesemia.

### Long-term study of patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment shows that dapagliflozin reduces weight and blood pressure but does not improve glycemic control [^586e1938]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

In patients with diabetes, glycemic improvement by sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition depends on the kidney's ability to filter glucose. Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, reduces hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes and normal or mildly impaired renal function. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study we assessed daily treatment with dapagliflozin in 252 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment. The primary endpoint, the mean change in HbA1c, was not statistically different from placebo after 24 weeks (-0.41% and -0.44% for 5- and 10-mg doses, respectively, and -0.32% for placebo). The mean weight change from baseline was -1.54 and -1.89kg for the 5- and 10-mg doses, respectively, and +0.21kg for placebo. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased in the dapagliflozin groups compared to placebo. Through 104 weeks, 13 patients receiving dapagliflozin and no patients receiving placebo experienced bone fracture. At 1 week, the mean serum creatinine increased with dapagliflozin 5mg (+0.13mg/dl) and 10mg (+0.18mg/dl) and did not change further after 104 weeks. Mean serum electrolytes did not change in any group, and there were fewer episodes of hyperkalemia with dapagliflozin than placebo. Thus, in patients with moderate renal impairment, dapagliflozin did not improve glycemic control, but reduced weight and blood pressure.

### SGLT2 inhibition and kidney potassium homeostasis [^bc123af1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subsequent reports have confirmed the neutrality of SGLT2i therapy and development of abnormalities in plasma K + concentration. If anything, these drugs either cause no effect or a slight reduction in plasma K + concentration in patients with normal kidney function but seem to exert a protective effect against hyperkalemia in the setting of reduced kidney function or when given with drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. In a meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials that included more than 21,000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the odds of experiencing a hyperkalemic event was 28% lower with SGLT2i therapy when compared with placebo. The mean difference in plasma K + was 0.04 mmol/L lower with SGLT2i versus placebo in six randomized controlled trials and was not significantly greater even when patients with severe reductions in kidney function were excluded from the analysis. In a meta-analysis of individual patient data from six trials comprising > 49,000 patients, SGLT2is reduced the risk of both serious (≥ 6.0 mmol/L) and mild hyperkalemia (≥ 5.5 mmol/L) without increasing the risk for hypokalemia, including those receiving diuretics. Even when examined in a real-world setting, no association is found between SGLT2i and abnormal K + levels even when stratified by eGFR or coprescription of non–potassium-sparing diuretics. In a pooled analysis of heart failure patients with reduced or preserved ejection fraction, empagliflozin reduced the composite of investigator-reported hyperkalemia or initiation of K + -binding drugs without increasing the incidence of hypokalemia. The ability of SGLT2is to reduce the incidence of moderate to severe hyperkalemia is also present in heart failure patients receiving mineralocorticoid antagonists.

### Balcinrenone plus dapagliflozin in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease: results from the phase 2b MIRACLE trial [^ce4f535b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Many patients with heart failure (HF) have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may not tolerate mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. We investigated the efficacy and safety of the novel mineralocorticoid receptor modulator balcinrenone in combination with dapagliflozin in a phase 2b study.

Methods and Results

From January 2021 to October 2023, we randomized 133 adults with symptomatic HF, ejection fraction < 60%, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 to ≤ 60ml/min/1.73 m 2 and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 to < 3000mg/g, to receive balcinrenone 15, 50 or 150mg/day plus dapagliflozin 10mg/day, or dapagliflozin 10mg/day plus placebo, for 12weeks. Enrolment was stopped early because of slow recruitment. Relative reductions in UACR from baseline to week 12 (primary endpoint) were not significantly different between the balcinrenone plus dapagliflozin groups versus dapagliflozin plus placebo. There was no clear balcinrenone dose-response relationship. There were possible dose-dependent increases in serum potassium levels, reduced eGFR in the highest dose group, and non-significant trends towards reduced N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Hyperkalaemia adverse events led to discontinuation in two participants receiving balcinrenone plus dapagliflozin and none in those receiving dapagliflozin plus placebo.

Conclusion

While the smaller than planned sample size limits interpretation, we did not see significant reduction in UACR in patients treated with balcinrenone plus dapagliflozin compared with dapagliflozin plus placebo.

### Initial eGFR changes with SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes and associations with the risk of abnormal serum potassium level [^d66e18d4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

We previously reported that a total of 3.7% of patients with T2D experienced an eGFR decline of > 30% following SGLT2i initiation, respectively. After 24 weeks, the aggregate eGFR trajectory became stable in all eGFR decline categories, including those with a > 30% eGFR decline. A drop in eGFR of 0% to 10%, 10% to 20%, or 20% to 30% did not lead to a worse clinical outcome compared with no drop at all. However, a drop in eGFR of > 30% did lead to worse kidney outcomes (risk of serum creatinine doubling or end‐stage kidney disease of eGFR 15 mL/min per 1.73 m 2). Therefore, the risk of hyperkalemia and hypokalemia events increased over the course of the study for those with a pronounced eGFR decline of > 30%, which likely reflects a decline in kidney function over time for participants at high risk for the progression of kidney disease. Our observation partially explained why the salutary association of SGLT2i in the maintenance of potassium homeostasis was attenuated in those with a pronounced eGFR decline of > 30%. Taken together, our study showed that an abrupt initial decline of eGFR > 30% following SGLT2i therapy may be a sign of a higher risk for increased serum potassium variability, hyperkalemia, and hypokalemia, and patients should undergo further evaluation and treatment for the underlying risk factors if they experience this. In contrast, an initial eGFR decline of < 30% should be tolerated following SGLT2i treatment, and therapy should not be discontinued prematurely for an acute decline in kidney function within this range.

SAFETY PROFILE OF SGLT2i

The renal safety profile of SGLT2i has been quantified by meta-analysis. Data from 13 studies of 90413 participants showed that beyond the known excess risk of mycotic genital infections (RR, 3.57; 95% CI, 3.14–4.06), there was no overall increased risk of other safety outcomes, including serious urinary tract infections, amputations, and fractures. In patients with diabetes, the risk of ketoacidosis is approximately doubled, but the risk is higher for states of insulin deficiency and T1 diabetes mellitus and patients with T2DM in the trials remained at low absolute risk. In the trial populations studies to date, the absolute harms of SGLT2i in patients with and without diabetes are clearly lower than the substantial absolute benefits. This is particularly the case in patients with CKD, and especially those without diabetes. Furthermore, meta-analysis of the large placebo-controlled SGLT2i trials show they reduce the risk of AKI (HR 0.77, 0.70–0.84) and reduce risk of serious adverse events of hyperkalaemia by 16% (0.84, 95% CI 0.76–0.93). Although there is a risk of ketoacidosis and hypoglycaemia with these agents, there were no differences in the incidence of these events between placebo and control groups.

Reductions in serious hyperkalaemia were consistent across the trials and a range of subgroups, including baseline kidney function, history of HF, and use of RASi, diuretic, and MRA. Of note, SGLT2i did not increase the risk of hypokalaemia [HR, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.94–1.15)]. In the HFrEF setting, beneficial effects of empagliflozin were unmodified in a secondary analysis of EMPEROR Reduced when those prescribed an MRA at baseline or not were compared, and allocation to empagliflozin was associated with less discontinuation of MRAs (perhaps due to less severe hyperkalaemia with empagliflozin). In DAPA-HF moderate/severe hyperkalaemia (potassium > 6.0 mmol/l) was less common among patients assigned to dapagliflozin, compared with placebo in patients taking an MRA at baseline [HR 0.50 (0.29–0.85); P = 0.01, P value for interaction 0.08].

### Empagliflozin and serum potassium in heart failure: an analysis from EMPEROR-pooled [^d85ab1f1]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Effect of empagliflozin on efficacy outcomes across baseline potassium levels

For the treatment effect of empagliflozin on major outcomes, we observed heterogeneity in some outcomes of interest (see Supplementary material online, Table S1). Whereas the effect of empagliflozin on the primary composite of HHF or cardiovascular death, first and total HHF was attenuated in patients with a serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L, empagliflozin consistently reduced the extended composite outcome (cardiovascular death, HHF or equivalent events [urgent care or emergency room visits requiring intravenous therapy for worsening HF] or visit reporting intensification of diuretics) across baseline potassium levels. For the composite of HHF or cardiovascular death the treatment effect in patients with a serum potassium < 4.0 mmol/L was HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.97; for potassium 4.0–5.0 mmol/L HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.65–0.81; for potassium > 5.0 mmol/L HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82–1.27 (interaction trend P = 0.024). A similar pattern was observed for first and total HHF (interaction trend P = 0.011 and 0.067, respectively). For the extended composite, HRs were as follows: serum potassium < 4 mmol/L HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65–1.00; potassium 4.0–5.0 mmol/L HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65–0.78; potassium > 5.0 mmol/L HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.98 (interaction trend P = 0.64). Similarly, the effect of empagliflozin to slow the decline in eGFR was not modified by baseline potassium levels (interaction trend P = 0.31). Also, the effect of empagliflozin on fatal outcomes, including sudden death, was not modified by baseline potassium levels (see Supplementary material online, Table S1).

### SGLT2 inhibition and kidney potassium homeostasis [^f6326d1c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic inhibition of the sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubule brings about physiologic changes predicted to both increase and decrease kidney K + excretion. Despite these effects, disorders of plasma K + concentration are an uncommon occurrence. If anything, these drugs either cause no effect or a slight reduction in plasma K + concentration in patients with normal kidney function but seem to exert a protective effect against hyperkalemia in the setting of reduced kidney function or when given with drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. In this review, we discuss the changes in kidney physiology after the administration of SGLT2 inhibitors predicted to cause both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia. We conclude that these factors offset one another, explaining the uncommon occurrence of dyskalemias with these drugs. Careful human studies focusing on the determinants of kidney K + handling are needed to fully understand how these drugs attenuate the risk of hyperkalemia and yet rarely cause hypokalemia.

### SGLT2 inhibition and kidney potassium homeostasis [^5b3fb138]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inhibitors of sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2is) are a critical component of clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with cardiovascular disease with and without diabetes mellitus. In clinical trials investigating these drugs, disturbances in plasma K + concentration have not been a common occurrence. This finding is notable because physiologic changes resulting from the inhibition of SGLT2 have the potential to alter kidney K + handling in ways predisposing patients to either hypokalemia or hyperkalemia. In this review, we discuss mechanisms by which SGLT2is affect kidney K + homeostasis. We conclude that factors favoring increased K + excretion and K + retention offset one another, explaining the uncommon occurrence of dyskalemias with these drugs.

The occurrence of investigator-reported hypokalaemia or new initiation of potassium supplement, each component, and the occurrence of a serum potassium < 3.0 mmol/L were not significantly increased with empagliflozin treatment (Table 2).

Serum potassium over time was not significantly different between empagliflozin and placebo groups, neither by baseline potassium (Figure 3) nor overall (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1).

### Initial eGFR changes with SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes and associations with the risk of abnormal serum potassium level [^f78d3ef5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia increases the risk of death and cardiac arrhythmias and limits the use of medications like RAS inhibitors or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists that improve clinical outcomes in patients with CKD or systolic HF. The patient‐level meta‐analysis of 6 trials of SGLT2i evaluating 49 875 participants reported that 1754 participants developed severe hyperkalemia, and an additional 1119 hyperkalemia events were reported by investigators.SGLT2is reduced the risk of severe hyperkalemia as well as investigator‐reported hyperkalemia consistent across 6 studies. Reductions in severe hyperkalemia were observed in a variety of subgroups, including impaired kidney function at baseline, history of HF, and use of RAS inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and diuretics. Furthermore, SGLT2i did not increase the risk of hypokalemia. The post hoc analysis of Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and a Reduced Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR‐Reduced) and The Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR‐Preserved) combined also showed that empagliflozin reduced the incidence of hyperkalemia without a significant increase in hypokalemia in patients with HF. In conclusion, SGLT2is reduce the risk of severe hyperkalemia in patients with T2D through a variety of risk factors without increasing the risk of hypokalemia.

### Hyperkalemia and maintenance of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy after initiating SGLT-2 or DPP-4 inhibitors [^991a5baa]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings align with mechanistic evidence on the pleiotropic effects of SGLT-2i on potassium homeostasis. First, SGLT2i increase distal sodium and water delivery to the distal nephron, enhancing electronegativity in the tubular lumen, and thus leading to increase urinary potassium secretion. Second, SGLT2i increase aldosterone secretion, which further directly and indirectly increases urinary potassium excretion, lowering the risk of hyperkalemia. Third, rather than having a direct effect on potassium homeostasis, the reduction in the incidence of hyperkalemia observed with SGLT2 inhibitors might be also due to its intrinsic nephroprotective effect, i.e. maintenance of kidney function itself, or due to yet uncharacterized mechanisms.

An important novel finding in our analysis is that despite a lower hyperkalemia occurrence among SGLT-2i users, there was no apparent effect on RASi persistence in our study. This observation contrasts with a recent secondary analysis from the pooled CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trials. In that study, the authors observed that the relative risk for RASi discontinuation was 15% lower in patients randomized to receiving SGLT-2i (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.99) compared to placebo. A potential explanation is that in our study, follow up was too short for patients to benefit enough from SGLT-2i: while patients on CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD had median 2.2 (IQR 1.6–2.6) years on therapy, patients in our study were median 0.9 (IQR 0.4–1.9) years. This short persistence to SGLT-2i is not an isolated finding, as it echoes multiple reports globally showing that at least 40% of patients discontinue SGLT-2i treatment within 1 year. Drug efficacy and safety may importantly differ in routine care versus trial settings, where patients are carefully selected and drug adherence and accountability are closely monitored. The short duration of SGLT-2i treatments in current clinical practice forms a substantial barrier to the delivery of evidence-based care. Additionally, our design may introduce bias by censoring patients when stopping SGLT-2i, without evaluating if the medication cessation was permanent or temporary (for instance, a temporary cessation during the resolution of an adverse effect). However, the fact that we observe similar associations following an intention-to-treat design (i.e. assuming the medications to be consumed throughout the follow up) would argue against this.

### Empagliflozin and serum potassium in heart failure: an analysis from EMPEROR-pooled [^c8db70da]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms by which empagliflozin reduced hyperkalaemia are uncertain and likely multifactorial. It is possible that, by increasing the sodium and water delivery to the distal nephron, kaliuresis could also be enhanced with empagliflozin treatment. In addition, by slowing the decline in eGFR over time, empagliflozin may contribute to the maintenance of potassium homeostasis compared with placebo. By decreasing the rate of HHF, empagliflozin may also decrease hyperkalaemia resulting from multiple interventions and therapeutic shifts that often occur during hospital stay.

The effect of empagliflozin to reduce the composite of HHF or cardiovascular death, first and total HHF appeared attenuated in patients with baseline potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L. However, such pattern was not observed when urgent visits for worsening HF, intravenous diuretic use or outpatient diuretic intensification were considered or for the reduction in eGFR slope decline. Also, when investigating the kidney effects of canagliflozin in patients with T2D and CKD in the CREDENCE trial, patients with high baseline potassium seemed to have experienced a greater benefit with canagliflozin treatment than those with low baseline potassium. Therefore, interactions between baseline potassium and treatment efficacy may not represent a replicable finding of SGLT2i.

### Initial eGFR changes with SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes and associations with the risk of abnormal serum potassium level [^196c8e13]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

There were several possible mechanisms underlying the effect of SGLT2i on serum potassium homeostasis. Key determinants of potassium excretion by the kidney under physiological conditions are the rate of sodium and water delivery to the distal nephron and aldosterone stimulation. In patients with T2D receiving SGLT2i, glycosuria and the ensuing osmotic diuresis contribute to kaliuresis. By inhibiting SGLT2 in the proximal tubule, SGLT2i augments distal sodium delivery and reabsorption, thereby increasing the electronegative charge in the tubular lumen, which stimulates potassium secretion via the principal cell in the cortical collecting duct. Hypokalemia, which frequently complicates the use of thiazide or loop diuretics, is caused by the inhibition of the Na + ‐Cl − cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule and the Na + ‐K + ‐2Cl − cotransporter in the thick ascending limb subsequent to the administration of thiazide and loop diuretics, respectively. Pharmacologic inhibition of SGLT2 creates a similar situation and increases kidney K + secretion, which may be further exacerbated by the concomitant use of thiazides or loop diuretics in patients with T2D.SGLT2i inhibits the Na + ‐H + antiporter activity, causing increased pH in distal tubule. Alkaline pH allosterically increases K + secretion through the renal outer medullary potassium channel. By shifting energy metabolism from glucose to fat oxidation, SGLT2 administration increases both ketogenesis and endogenous glucose production. This shift is facilitated by increased glucagon levels accompanied by a reduction in insulin secretion in response to the forced excretion of glucose into the urine. Increased plasma glucagon may contribute to the kaliuretic effect of SGLT2i treatment. In addition, the lower incidence of hyperkalemia may be partially attributable to the preservation of kidney function by SGLT2i, as opposed to the direct effects of SGLT2i on the kidney's sodium–potassium management. SGLT2i may aid in the maintenance of potassium homeostasis by slowing the decline in eGFR over time. Furthermore, by reducing the incidence of HF hospitalization, SGLT2i may also reduce hyperkalemia and hypokalemia events caused by multiple interventions and therapeutic adjustments (eg, use of diuretics) related to the patient's underlying CKD or HF.

Effect of empagliflozin on potassium-related outcomes and safety

Compared with placebo, empagliflozin reduced the occurrence of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or new initiation of potassium binders [6.5% vs. 7.7%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.95, P = 0.01] (Figure 1); investigator-reported hyperkalaemia (6.1% vs. 7.2%, HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71–0.97, P = 0.018); potassium > 5.5 mmol/L or new initiation of potassium binders (9.3% vs. 10.8%, HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.94, P = 0.004); potassium > 5.5 mmol/L (8.6% vs. 9.9%, HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74–0.97, P = 0.017); potassium > 6.0 mmol/L or new initiation of potassium binders (3.1% vs. 4.3%, HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55–0.85, P < 0.001); potassium > 6.0 mmol/L (1.9% vs. 2.9%, HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48–0.81, P < 0.001). The use of potassium binders was not significantly reduced with empagliflozin (1.5% vs. 1.8%, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.59–1.10, P = 0.17) (Table 2). The adverse event of serious hyperkalaemia leading to hospitalization was 11 (0.2%) in the empagliflozin group and 24 (0.5%) in the placebo group. Hyperkalaemia leading to trial drug discontinuation occurred in 2 patients on placebo and no patient on empagliflozin.

### Effect of dapagliflozin on urine metabolome in patients with type 2 diabetes [^9145b376]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Trigonelline, N-methyl nicotinic acid or betaine nicotinate, is a product of niacin (vitamin B3) metabolism that is excreted in the urine. Experimental studies have shown that trigonelline ameliorates diabetic hypertensive nephropathy by suppression of oxidative stress in kidney and reduction in renal cell apoptosis and fibrosis. Trigonelline is also reported as a constituent found in tissues that correlates positively with lean mass quantity of which the physiological properties remain unexplored and also as a metabolite that could reflect part of the metabolism of choline through betaine and glycine metabolic pathways. The statistically significant increased levels in our study after dapagliflozin treatment may indicate an improved metabolic status of our patients.

Proximal tubules have a very high content of mitochondria and are highly dependent on oxidative phosphorylation. Previous studies in diabetic and nondiabetic models of chronic kidney disease revealed significant disruption of mitochondrial function that parallels the evolution of the disease and is translated into abnormal renal excretion of citric acid cycle (tricarboxylic acid) intermediates. In our patients, we observed a significant increase in the renal excretion of citrate following dapagliflozin treatment, a finding that may indicate a restoration of mitochondrial function and an improvement in energy metabolism in tubular cells. Other conditions that may increase citrate excretion like potassium depletion, acid-base abnormalities, hyperparathyroidism, or protein-rich diet are unlikely in our population. Hippurate is a metabolite normally found in human urine. It is synthesized in the kidney and liver from glycine and benzoic acid, secreted by the renal tubular cells, and excreted in the urine. Dapagliflozin altered hippurate excretion in the same direction as did for citrate. This covariation that has been also noted in certain renal disorders can be explained by the link between hippurate synthesis and mitochondrial function. The first step in the formation of hippurate from benzoate in the mitochondrial matrix requires adenosine 5′-triphosphate. Thus, it is possible that impaired mitochondrial functioning may have contributed to the lower levels of hippurate excretion before treatment.

In patients at risk for hyperkalemia, measuring serum potassium before and at 1–2 weeks after initiation of RASi is recommended, based on expert opinion, and an increase in serum creatinine level, if it occurs, will typically happen during the first 2 weeks of treatment initiation and should stabilize within 2–4 weeks in the setting of normal sodium and fluid intake.

### Cardiorenal nexus: a review with focus on combined chronic heart and kidney failure, and insights from recent clinical trials [^b249fb36]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors have a multifactorial role in ameliorating the insults of the cardiorenal syndromes. In addition to improving glycemic control, SGLT2 inhibitors can increase red blood cell mass and hematocrit via renal erythropoietin production and potentially have a role in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory pathways, inducing autophagy, and activating nonclassic RAAS pathways.SGLT2 inhibition with canagliflozin reduced the risk of hyperkalemia in patients treated with RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) in CREDENCE, which may contribute to cardiorenal benefits. However, a secondary analysis of DAPA‐CKD showed no statistically significant difference in hyperkalemia between the dapagliflozin and placebo arms (regardless of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use). The risk of hyperkalemia is lower with nonsteroidal than steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. There are different mechanisms that can be hypothesized for how SGLT2 inhibitors might affect RAAS, including hemodynamic modification of glomerular blood flow and level of hyperfiltration in intact nephrons. Hyperfiltration induces activation of profibrotic pathways and thus modulation of hyperfiltration, and tubular activity may have an impact on long‐term nephron function.

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

To investigate potential treatment effect modification, we performed a number of subgroup analyses in the following prespecified strata: age (< 65 years v ≥ 65 years), sex, race (white v black, based on Medicare data only, where the race variable has been validated against self-reported race), heart failure, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, loop diuretics and insulin on the cohort entry date, and by baseline hemoglobin A1c level (< 7.5% v 7.5–9.0% v ≥ 9.0%). We re-estimated propensity scores and reperformed matching for each subgroup stratum.

To examine the robustness of our findings, we performed the following sensitivity analyses: treatment discontinuation was defined as no prescription refill for the index drug within 60 days rather than 30 days; to investigate the potential influence of informative censoring, we followed patients for a maximum of 180 and 365 days, regardless of treatment discontinuation or starting a drug in the comparator class; finally, we excluded patients with a history of hyperkalemia or potassium binder use in the previous 365 days.

Individual agents in SGLT-2 inhibitor and GLP-1 receptor agonist classes

We investigated potential differences in the risk of hyperkalemia for individual agents in the SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist classes by constructing separate cohorts for empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, and semaglutide versus DPP-4 inhibitors, re-estimated the propensity scores and reperformed the matching, and calculated effect estimates for the primary outcome. The SGLT-2 inhibitor cohorts were restricted to the dates when both drugs under comparison were on the market (April 2013 for canagliflozin v DPP-4 inhibitors, January 2014 for dapagliflozin v DPP-4 inhibitors, and August 2014 for empagliflozin v DPP-4 inhibitors).

Patient and public involvement

There were no funds or time allocated for patient and public involvement, so we were unable to involve patients. Nevertheless, this study was inspired by conversations with patients in clinical practice. We also asked a member of the public to provide feedback on the article before resubmission. To be compliant with our data use agreements, we are not allowed to reidentify and contact patients who were included in the study dataset to share the results of this research.

### Sodium-glucose cotransport inhibition with dapagliflozin in type 2 diabetes [^5d437292]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Dapagliflozin, a novel inhibitor of renal sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, allows an insulin-independent approach to improve type 2 diabetes hyperglycemia. In this multiple-dose study we evaluated the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin in type 2 diabetic patients.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned to one of five dapagliflozin doses, metformin XR, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to compare mean change from baseline in A1C. Other objectives included comparison of changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), weight, adverse events, and laboratory measurements.

RESULTS

After 12 weeks, dapagliflozin induced moderate glucosuria (52–85 g urinary glucose/day) and demonstrated significant glycemic improvements versus placebo (ΔA1C −0.55 to −0.90% and ΔFPG −16 to −31 mg/dl). Weight loss change versus placebo was −1.3 to −2.0 kg. There was no change in renal function. Serum uric acid decreased, serum magnesium increased, serum phosphate increased at higher doses, and dose-related 24-h urine volume and hematocrit increased, all of small magnitude. Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across all groups.

CONCLUSIONS

Dapagliflozin improved hyperglycemia and facilitates weight loss in type 2 diabetic patients by inducing controlled glucosuria with urinary loss of ∼200–300 kcal/day. Dapagliflozin treatment demonstrated no persistent, clinically significant osmolarity, volume, or renal status changes.

### SGLT2 inhibition and kidney potassium homeostasis [^70f99766]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

An additional mechanism to retain salt without an increase in K + secretion is the ability of SGLT2is to increase the delivery of α -ketoglutarate (α -KG) to downstream segments (Figure 2). This intermediate of the citric acid cycle participates in an intraluminal signaling pathway that alters transport in the distal nephron after binding to the luminal oxoglutarate receptor 1 (OXGR1). It is unknown whether the increase in the delivery of α -KG is the result of decreased reabsorption of the filtered substrate or increased proximal tubular secretion. Regarding the later source, decreased glucose entry into the cell along with reductions in insulin levels may cause increased gluconeogenesis, providing more availability of α -KG for tubular secretion. Since gluconeogenesis and ammoniagenesis are linked, increased urinary excretion of ammonia provides a mechanism for the maintenance of acid–base balance in the setting of decreased NHE3 activity and decreased HCO 3 − reabsorption caused by SGLT2 inhibition. The activation of OXGR1 stimulates NaCl reabsorption in an electroneutral fashion through the coordinated activity of Cl − -HCO 3 − exchange via pendrin and the Na + -dependent Cl − /HCO 3 − exchanger. In addition, luminal α -KG exerts an inhibitory effect on the epithelial Na + channel independent of OXGR1. These effects, in total, enhance salt reabsorption, thereby limiting the diuretic effect of SGLT2i and, at the same time, limit electrogenic and flow-mediated K + loss.

### SGLT2 inhibition and kidney potassium homeostasis [^b1f3524b]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Here, we provide a unique perspective as to why SGLT2is are an uncommon cause of dyskalemias. Despite the various ways SGLT2is alter kidney K + handling, disorders of plasma K + concentration are not common. Increased distal Na + delivery in combination with a variable degree of activation in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system due to contraction of extracellular fluid volume along with alkalinization of the tubular fluid is likely most important in increasing K + secretion in the initial period after initiation of the drug. A more sustained kaliuretic effect remains from the osmotic diuretic effect secondary to persistent glycosuria and possibly from ongoing kidney K + secretion mediated by increases in plasma glucagon. Beyond concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the formation or actions of aldosterone, SGLT2is oppose kidney K + excretion by inhibiting renin release though tubuloglomerular feedback and decreases in sympathetic tone. SGLT2is sensitize the Ca 2+ -sensing receptor in the distal convoluted tubule through glycosuria, causing increased activity of NCC. This effect allows for increased salt retention without augmenting K + secretion. A similar effect develops in the downstream β -intercalated cell brought about by increased delivery of α -KG, leading to coupled activity of pendrin and Na + -dependent Cl − /HCO 3 − exchanger. The sum effect of changes after the inhibition of SGLT2 provides a mechanism by which these drugs attenuate the risk of hyperkalemia and yet rarely cause hypokalemia.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) for kidney protection in T2D — An SGLT2i with proven kidney protection is recommended for people with T2D who have an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2; in those with HF, empagliflozin can be used with an eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and if eGFR drops below this level on treatment, the SGLT2i does not have to be stopped unless kidney replacement therapy is required. Recognized side effects are not greater at lower eGFR, initial reports of higher rates of lower extremity amputation with canagliflozin have not been substantiated, SGLT2is tend to lower serum potassium, and the risk of AKI is actually reduced by 25% with SGLT2i use in persons with T2D.

### Dapagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Xigduo) [^d18ccb8d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue XIGDUO XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting XIGDUO XR.

Withhold XIGDUO XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume XIGDUO XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue XIGDUO XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.3 Volume Depletion

Dapagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating XIGDUO XR in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### SGLT2 inhibition and kidney potassium homeostasis [^0896ca89]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Effect of SGLT2is on Plasma K + in Clinical Practice

Studies demonstrating the ability of SGLT2is to improve clinical outcomes have primarily been conducted in patients at high risk for hyperkalemia due to underlying disease states, such as diabetes mellitus, CKD, and congestive heart failure. The concomitant use of drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in most of these patients further exacerbate this risk. Early analysis of data from the development program for canagliflozin (the first approved SGLT2i by the Food and Drug Administration) found a numerically higher number of hyperkalemic episodes when compared with placebo in patients with moderate kidney impairment and/or in those receiving drugs known to reduce kidney K + excretion. This finding prompted the inclusion into the original package insert of canagliflozin a warning regarding a higher risk of hyperkalemia when given to patients with kidney impairment receiving drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system. However, this warning was subsequently removed after the analysis of the completed program where no meaningful effects on plasma K + concentration were found when compared with placebo, regardless of dose, use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers, or baseline GFR. This change in labeling was further supported by a post hoc analysis of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation trial where canagliflozin similarly reduced the risk of both investigator-reported and central laboratory–determined hyperkalemia without increasing the risk of hypokalemia.

### Pharmacodynamic differences between canagliflozin and dapagliflozin: results of a randomized, double-blind, crossover study [^f56f0d64]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Canagliflozin and dapagliflozin are the first two sodium glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors to be approved in the USA and Europe for use as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 1, 2. These drugs decrease plasma glucose (PG) levels by lowering the renal threshold for glucose excretion (RT G) and reducing renal glucose reabsorption, thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE) 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. In addition to reducing hyperglycaemia, the increase in UGE observed with SGLT2 inhibition is associated with a mild osmotic diuresis and loss of calories leading to weight loss 1.

It has been estimated that the highest approved therapeutic dose of dapagliflozin (10 mg) increases 24‐h UGE in healthy individuals to ∼70% of the maximum UGE observed at higher dapagliflozin doses of 20–100 mg 8. By contrast, 24‐h UGE values reported in studies of canagliflozin in healthy participants indicate that canagliflozin provides near‐maximal effects on UGE at doses > 200 mg 4; however, the lack of direct comparison limits the ability to make definitive conclusions about the possible pharmacodynamic (PD) differences between canagliflozin and dapagliflozin.

In addition to inhibition of renal SGLT2 leading to increased UGE, the 300‐mg dose of canagliflozin has been shown to lower postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) and insulin concentrations by delaying intestinal glucose absorption 9. This effect is thought to be attributable to transient inhibition of intestinal sodium glucose co‐transporter 1 (SGLT1), which occurs shortly after the drug is administered and when intraluminal gut drug concentrations are predicted to be high. The delayed rise in PPG and insulin seen with canagliflozin doses of 300 mg or higher was not observed with doses ≤ 200 mg 4. Although no data have been published describing the effects of dapagliflozin on intestinal glucose absorption, it has been hypothesized that dapagliflozin 10 mg would have no effect on intestinal SGLT1 because of the greater selectivity of dapagliflozin for SGLT2 compared with SGLT1 (the SGLT2:SGLT1 half‐maximal inhibitory concentration [IC 50] ratio is ∼1400 for dapagliflozin 10 compared with ∼160 for canagliflozin 11), and the lower doses of dapagliflozin used compared with canagliflozin.

### Pharmacodynamic differences between canagliflozin and dapagliflozin: results of a randomized, double-blind, crossover study [^b513214d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

The effects of multiple doses of canagliflozin 300 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg on UGE and RT G are shown in Figure 3 A and 3 B, respectively. For the first 4 h after dosing, canagliflozin 300 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg had similar effects on UGE and RT G; however, for the remainder of the 24‐h interval, treatment with canagliflozin 300 mg was associated with a larger increase in UGE and a greater reduction in RT G than treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg. As shown in Table 2, on day 4, mean (s.d.) 24‐h UGE was ∼25% higher with canagliflozin compared with dapagliflozin [51.4 (13.0) vs. 40.8 (10.4) g]. The LS mean for 24‐h mean RT G on day 4 was 3.79 mmol/l with canagliflozin 300 mg and 4.17 mmol/l with dapagliflozin 10 mg (LS mean difference, −0.39 mmol/l; two‐sided p < 0.0001); therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected (Table 3).

### Sodium-glucose cotransport inhibition with dapagliflozin in type 2 diabetes [^b4c3ada0]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Dapagliflozin, a novel inhibitor of renal sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, allows an insulin-independent approach to improve type 2 diabetes hyperglycemia. In this multiple-dose study we evaluated the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin in type 2 diabetic patients.

Research Design and Methods

Type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned to one of five dapagliflozin doses, metformin XR, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to compare mean change from baseline in A1C. Other objectives included comparison of changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), weight, adverse events, and laboratory measurements.

Results

After 12 weeks, dapagliflozin induced moderate glucosuria (52–85 g urinary glucose/day) and demonstrated significant glycemic improvements versus placebo (DeltaA1C -0.55 to -0.90% and DeltaFPG -16 to -31 mg/dl). Weight loss change versus placebo was -1.3 to -2.0 kg. There was no change in renal function. Serum uric acid decreased, serum magnesium increased, serum phosphate increased at higher doses, and dose-related 24-h urine volume and hematocrit increased, all of small magnitude. Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across all groups.

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin improved hyperglycemia and facilitates weight loss in type 2 diabetic patients by inducing controlled glucosuria with urinary loss of approximately 200–300 kcal/day. Dapagliflozin treatment demonstrated no persistent, clinically significant osmolarity, volume, or renal status changes.

### Hyperkalemia and maintenance of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy after initiating SGLT-2 or DPP-4 inhibitors [^1422d7bb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

To this preceding evidence we add some novel findings. Hyperkalemia is a common complication in T2D, but many of these events are not coded with clinical diagnoses. Therefore, we regard as a study strength the capture of all potassium measurements performed in our region. This allowed for the novel exploration of mild hyperkalemia events (potassium > 5–5.5 mmol/l), which may be less likely to receive a diagnosis code but more likely to prompt clinical decisions such as discontinuation of therapies. The evaluation of recurrent hyperkalemia events is another novel finding that reinforces the plausibility of the observed associations. We also observed larger hyperkalemia reduction rates when our follow up was restricted to periods of drug use (i.e. per-protocol effect), compared to intention-to-treat approach, which supports the possibility of these effects being a direct consequence of SGLT-2i therapy. Another novelty of our analysis is that whereas we observed consistently lower rates of moderate/severe hyperkalemia (potassium > 5.5 mmol/l) in relation to SGLT-2i use across a range of subgroups, the associations were less consistent for mild hyperkalemia (potassium > 5.0–5.5 mmol/l). Specifically, we failed to observe any difference between treatment strategies in subgroups of old age (> 70 years) and eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Previous trials and observational studies evaluating this effect have measured the rate of moderate/severe hyperkalemias, or hyperkalemia severe enough to deserve a diagnosis, and in this setting our results agree. However, we are not aware of other studies that have explored the effect of SGLT-2i on mild hyperkalemias and cannot confirm/refute our observations. We speculate that the lack of association with mild hyperkalemia events in our study suggests that SGLT-2i is less effective in managing the small variations in potassium levels potentially attributable to the multiple risk factors (i.e. diet, renal potassium excretion, acidosis, comorbidities, polypharmacy, etc.) that operate in older adults or in those with established CKD.

Enablement of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists by other drugs

It was suggested that sacubitril/valsartan may lower hyperkalaemia risk and facilitate MRA therapy. Secondary analysis of the PARADIGM‐HF (Efficacy and Safety of LCZ696 Compared to Enalapril on Morbidity and Mortality of Patients With Chronic Heart Failure) trial showed that among patients taking an MRA at baseline, the overall rates of hyperkalaemia were similar between the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups (17.0% vs. 18.7%), but severe hyperkalaemia was less common in patients assigned to sacubitril/valsartan (4.5% vs. 6.1%). In contrast however, the PIONEER‐HF (Comparison of Sacubitril–Valsartan versus Enalapril on Effect on NT‐proBNP in Patients Stabilized from an Acute Heart Failure Episode) trial showed that the risk of hyperkalaemia was more in the sacubitril/valsartan arm compared to enalapril (12.5% vs. 9.2%). Thus whether sacubitril/valsartan truly reduces the risk of hyperkalaemia remains debated. Data from the EMPEROR trial programme showed that empagliflozin was associated with an 18% decrease in investigator‐reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders. Similarly, the DAPA‐HF (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure) trial showed that dapagliflozin reduced the risk of hyperkalaemia by 14% and severe hyperkalaemia by 50% compared with placebo. Indeed, the effect of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT‐2) inhibition in reducing serum potassium levels is consistent, but is derived from secondary analysis.

Discussion

Several aspects of the design of DAPA‐HF merit discussion.

Study drug and dose

Dapagliflozin is a once daily, selective, competitive, reversible inhibitor of SGLT2 with similar in vitro potency to canagliflozin and empagliflozin. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 It causes a dose‐dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion with a near maximum effect at 10 mg daily and has no clinically important drug interactions. In common with other SGLT2 inhibitors, dapagliflozin causes small reductions in blood pressure and weight, a small initial increase in creatinine (although long‐term treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors appears to be reno‐protective in type 2 diabetes – see below), as well as an increase in the risk of genital mycotic infection.

Why an SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction?

As described in the introduction, canagliflozin, empagliflozin and dapagliflozin reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalization among patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease/cardiovascular risk factors, with an apparently similar treatment effect in the small subgroup (∼10–15%) of patients in each trial with baseline heart failure of undetermined phenotype, as illustrated in a meta‐analysis of EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE–TIMI 58. 7, 8, 9, 23 Examination of the event curves in these trials shows a reduction in heart failure hospitalization within weeks to months of randomization. The rapidity of onset of the benefit in the three trials is not consistent with traditional views about the mechanisms and time course of cardiovascular protection accruing with conventional glucose‐lowering therapies. 9, 10, 11, 12, 24, 25, 26, 27 Consequently, numerous additional beneficial mechanisms have been proposed, ranging from diuretic–haemodynamic actions, through effects on cardiac metabolism, adipokines, myocardial fibrosis, uric acid, myocyte ion channels and kidney function. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 A recent mediation analysis suggested that the rise in haematocrit concentration following SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is related to benefit, supporting a diuretic action, and mathematical modelling suggests SGLT2 inhibitors may remove fluid preferentially from the interstitial space and cause less intravascular volume contraction. 27, 28 Other data suggest SGLT2 inhibition can lead to ketogenesis and an increase in β‐hydroxybutyrate, which provides an alternative and more efficient substrate for myocardial energy generation.

### Empagliflozin and serum potassium in heart failure: an analysis from EMPEROR-pooled [^5c15161f]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Hyperkalaemia frequently leads to interruption and discontinuation of neurohormonal antagonists, which may worsen heart failure prognosis. Some studies suggested that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors reduce hyperkalaemia, an effect that may have important clinical implications. This analysis evaluates the effect of empagliflozin on the occurrence of hyper- and hypokalaemia in HF.

Methods and Results

EMPEROR-Pooled (i.e. EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved combined) included 9583 patients with available serum potassium levels at baseline (98.6% of the total EMPEROR-Pooled population, n = 9718). Hyperkalaemia was identified by investigators' reports of adverse events, and by a laboratory serum potassium value above 5.5mmol/L and 6.0mmol/L. The main outcome was a composite of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders. Patients with high potassium at baseline were more frequently diagnosed with diabetes and ischaemic HF aetiology and had lower left ventricular ejection fraction and estimated glomerular filtration rate but were more frequently treated with sacubitril/valsartan or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Empagliflozin (compared with placebo) reduced the composite of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders [6.5% vs. 7.7%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71–0.95, P = 0.01]. Empagliflozin reduced hyperkalaemia rates regardless of the definition used (serum potassium > 5.5mmol/l: 8.6% vs. 9.9%, HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74–0.97, P = 0.017; serum potassium > 6.0mmol/l: 1.9% vs. 2.9%, HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48–0.81, P < 0.001). The incidence of hypokalaemia (investigator-reported or serum potassium < 3.0mmol/l) was not significantly increased with empagliflozin.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin reduced the incidence of hyperkalaemia without significant increase in hypokalaemia.
