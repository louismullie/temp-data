## Question

Teenager right sided low back pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing a teenager with right-sided low back pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and red flag screening. Then, I should verify the focused history elements that change pretest probabilities. Next, I will examine the physical exam priorities and what findings push me toward imaging. After that, I need to check the imaging strategy and when MRI is warranted. Then, I will consider the differential diagnosis in adolescents, including mechanical, posterior-element, and serious pathology. Finally, I will outline management principles, follow-up, and when to escalate care, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: most adolescent low back pain is nonspecific and self-limited, so I should avoid over-imaging and over-medicalization while maintaining vigilance for red flags and persistent symptoms that warrant targeted evaluation [^e7407f24] [^5f325f1b].

> I need to ensure a structured red flag screen up front: constant pain, night pain, radicular pain lasting 4 weeks or more, fever, weight loss, history of cancer, immunosuppression, progressive neurologic deficits, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or failure to improve with conservative care beyond about 4–6 weeks should prompt imaging and specialty referral rather than watchful waiting [^6cccf270] [^4da7743c] [^e99a1ed2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology just because the pain is right-sided; unilateral pain alone is not a red flag, so I should anchor on duration, severity, constitutional features, and neurologic signs to guide urgency and testing [^6cccf270] [^4da7743c].

> Next, I should review the focused history: onset and tempo (acute vs insidious), trauma or repetitive extension/rotation sports, activity modification and response to rest, pain location and radiation, night pain, fever or malaise, weight change, bowel/bladder symptoms, menstrual history in females, backpack load and school ergonomics, and psychosocial stressors, because these shape pretest probabilities and management [^e7407f24] [^5f325f1b] [^55146d68].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology to calibrate expectations: adolescent low back pain is common, with lifetime prevalence approaching 70–80% by age 20, females have higher risk, and most cases remain nonspecific; identifiable pathology is uncommon, so I should resist the urge to over-test in the absence of red flags or persistent symptoms [^55146d68] [^037d0cc4] [^42c9c713].

> I will now examine the patient with attention to gait, posture, and alignment; inspect for scoliosis or kyphosis; palpate spinous processes and paraspinals for focal tenderness; perform active and passive range of motion with pain provocation; and execute a focused neurologic exam including strength, sensation, reflexes, and straight leg raise to screen for radiculopathy, because these findings refine the differential and imaging threshold [^e7407f24] [^5f325f1b].

> But wait, what if the pain is right-sided and reproduced with spinal extension or single-leg hyperextension? That pattern raises suspicion for posterior-element stress injury such as spondylolysis, particularly in athletes with repetitive extension loads, so I should keep that in mind as I decide on imaging timing and modality [^a3aa9ee2] [^7d185aab].

> I should double-check the imaging strategy: in the absence of red flags, routine imaging is not recommended for acute or subacute low back pain; if symptoms persist beyond roughly 4–6 weeks or red flags emerge, start with plain radiographs limited to the area of concern, and escalate to MRI if radiographs are abnormal, symptoms persist, or there are neurologic deficits or concern for infection, malignancy, or significant posterior-element disease [^6cccf270] [^55585497] [^b0a6f625].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of MRI in adolescents: MRI is the preferred modality when serious pathology is suspected or when posterior-element lesions like spondylolysis are suspected but not visualized on radiographs, whereas CT can help define bony detail when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated; bone scan or SPECT can be considered when MRI is unavailable and spondylolysis remains strongly suspected [^6cccf270] [^ed4d3b3d].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis in this age group: most cases are nonspecific mechanical pain, but I must actively exclude posterior-element stress injuries (spondylolysis, with or without spondylolisthesis), Scheuermann disease, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, lumbar disc herniation, and rare but serious entities such as infection, malignancy, and inflammatory spondyloarthropathies; right-sided focal tenderness with extension-provoked pain nudges me toward posterior-element pathology, while night pain, fever, or weight loss push me toward infection or malignancy [^e7407f24] [^a3aa9ee2] [^25ebb5d1] [^691db354].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought disc herniation was common in adolescents, but I should correct that: disc-related disease is relatively uncommon in pediatrics compared with adults, though it does occur and may require MRI for confirmation; conservative care is first-line, with surgical consideration for refractory cases or progressive deficits, so I should not overcall it without supportive findings [^a891108a] [^e7407f24].

> Next, I should review management principles: for nonspecific pain, emphasize activity as tolerated, avoid bed rest, provide ergonomic counseling, and initiate a core-strengthening and flexibility program; NSAIDs can be used short course if needed, and I should set expectations for a positive trajectory while monitoring for red flags or nonresponse [^e7407f24] [^5f325f1b] [^ce3f2ccb].

> I need to ensure sport-specific guidance for athletes: relative rest from aggravating activities, bracing for suspected spondylolysis in some protocols, and a staged rehabilitation emphasizing core stability, hamstring flexibility, and gradual return-to-sport after pain resolution and strength recovery; persistent symptoms despite 3–6 months of conservative care warrant re-evaluation and possible surgical consultation [^b82abef0] [^7d185aab].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up cadence: reassess at 2–4 weeks to confirm improvement, and if there is no meaningful progress by 4–6 weeks or new red flags appear, obtain imaging and consider specialty referral; failure to improve with appropriate conservative therapy beyond about 30 days is itself a red flag that warrants further evaluation [^e99a1ed2] [^4da7743c].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways: right-sided adolescent low back pain is common and usually nonspecific, so I should prioritize red flag screening, focused history and exam, and conservative management while reserving imaging for persistent symptoms or concerning findings; spondylolysis remains a key consideration in active adolescents with extension-provoked pain, and MRI is the modality of choice when serious pathology is suspected or radiographs are unrevealing but suspicion remains high [^e7407f24] [^a3aa9ee2] [^6cccf270].

---

Right-sided low back pain in teenagers is most often due to **mechanical or muscular causes** (strain, poor posture, heavy backpacks, or sports-related overuse) [^e7407f24] [^55146d68]. Less common but important causes include **spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis** (pars interarticularis defects) [^a3aa9ee2], disc herniation [^a891108a], and scoliosis [^691db354]. Red flags (fever, weight loss, night pain, neurologic deficits) [^6cccf270] require **urgent evaluation** for infection, malignancy, or fracture [^9b837377]. Most cases resolve with **conservative care** (activity, physical therapy, NSAIDs) [^e7407f24]; persistent pain (> 4–6 weeks) or red flags warrant imaging (X-ray, MRI) [^6cccf270] and specialist referral [^9b837377].

---

## Common causes of right-sided low back pain in teenagers

### Mechanical and muscular causes

Mechanical and muscular causes are the **most common etiologies** of right-sided low back pain in teenagers [^e7407f24]. These include:

- **Muscle strain**: Often related to sports, poor posture, or heavy lifting [^e7407f24].

- **Poor posture**: Prolonged sitting, slouching, or improper ergonomics [^55146d68].

- **Heavy backpacks**: Carrying excessive weight can cause musculoskeletal strain [^55146d68].

- **Sports-related injuries**: Repetitive motions, overuse, or acute injuries during athletic activities [^7d185aab].

---

### Structural abnormalities

Structural abnormalities of the spine can also cause **right-sided low back pain** in teenagers:

- **Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis**: Defects in the pars interarticularis, often due to repetitive stress or trauma, commonly seen in adolescent athletes [^a3aa9ee2].

- **Scoliosis**: Lateral curvature of the spine, which can cause asymmetric loading and pain [^691db354].

- **Disc herniation**: Less common in teenagers but can occur, particularly in athletes or those with repetitive loading [^a891108a].

---

### Infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic causes

Although rare, serious underlying conditions must be considered, especially when **red flags** are present [^6cccf270]:

- **Infection**: Osteomyelitis, discitis, or epidural abscess [^ed4d3b3d].

- **Inflammatory conditions**: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis [^notfound].

- **Neoplastic conditions**: Leukemia, lymphoma, or primary bone tumors [^92a5085e].

---

## Clinical evaluation

### History

A thorough history should include:

- **Pain characteristics**: Onset, duration, intensity, location, radiation, aggravating and relieving factors [^80041dc9].

- **Activity and trauma**: Recent physical activities, sports participation, trauma, or heavy lifting [^80041dc9].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, weight loss, night pain, fatigue, appetite changes [^6cccf270].

- **Medical history**: Previous episodes of back pain, chronic illnesses, family history of spinal disorders [^80041dc9].

---

### Physical examination

The physical examination should include:

- **Inspection**: Posture, gait, spinal alignment, asymmetry [^691db354].

- **Palpation**: Tenderness, muscle spasm, step-offs [^a3aa9ee2].

- **Range of motion**: Flexion, extension, lateral bending, rotation [^a3aa9ee2].

- **Neurological examination**: Motor strength, sensory testing, reflexes, straight leg raise test [^9b06897d].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Imaging is not routinely indicated for acute low back pain without red flags [^55585497]. Indications for imaging include:

| **Indication** | **Recommended imaging modality** |
|-|-|
| Persistent pain (> 4–6 weeks) | X-ray (AP/lateral) [^6cccf270] |
| Suspected spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis | MRI or CT [^6cccf270] |
| Neurologic deficits | MRI [^6cccf270] |
| Suspected infection or malignancy | MRI with contrast [^6cccf270] |

---

## Management

### Conservative management

Most cases of right-sided low back pain in teenagers resolve with **conservative management**:

- **Activity modification**: Avoid heavy lifting, prolonged sitting, and aggravating activities [^e7407f24].

- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening, flexibility exercises, posture training [^e7407f24].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: NSAIDs for pain and inflammation [^08eceeaa].

- **Patient education**: Ergonomics, backpack safety, posture correction [^bb446459].

---

### Indications for specialist referral

Specialist referral is indicated for:

- **Persistent pain**: Despite conservative management for more than 4–6 weeks [^6cccf270].

- **Neurologic deficits**: Motor weakness, sensory loss, or bowel/bladder dysfunction [^9b837377].

- **Suspected serious pathology**: Infection, malignancy, or fracture [^9b837377].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis for right-sided low back pain in teenagers is **generally favorable**. Most cases resolve with conservative management, though recurrence is common. Persistent or recurrent pain may indicate underlying structural abnormalities or chronic pain syndromes, requiring further evaluation and management [^e7407f24] [^6b97f712].

---

Right-sided low back pain in teenagers is **commonly due to mechanical or muscular causes**, but structural abnormalities and serious underlying conditions must be considered. A thorough clinical evaluation, selective imaging, and conservative management are the cornerstones of care. Persistent pain or red flags necessitate further investigation and specialist referral.

Right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain is a common clinical presentation in children, and accurate clinical diagnosis remains challenging given that this nonspecific presentation is associated with numerous surgical and nonsurgical conditions. The broad differential diagnosis varies by patient age and sex. Important considerations in the selection of a diagnostic imaging strategy include the sequencing, performance, and cost of tests. This article provides a comprehensive narrative review of the diagnostic imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents, including a discussion of the complementary roles of ultrasound, CT, and MRI; description of key imaging findings based on available evidence; and presentation of salient differential diagnoses. Subspecialized pediatric emergency medicine and surgical perspectives are also provided as further clinical insight into this common, but often challenging, scenario. Finally, the current status of imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents is summarized on the basis of expert consensus.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^e91f9f23]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for low back pain (LBP)—imaging and other diagnostic testing: Lumbar spine x-rays are not recommended in patients with LBP without red flags for serious spinal pathology within the first 4 to 6 weeks, and among patients with evidence of radiculopathy, imaging in the acute setting is also not recommended; however, an imaging study may be appropriate when limitations from consistent symptoms have persisted for 1 month or more or when potentially serious pathology or progressive neurologic deficit(s) are concerns. Pretest probability and test characteristics are critical, as lumbosacral spine MRIs are more likely to be “abnormal” by age 40 in normal individuals and herniated discs are not infrequently found in asymptomatic teenagers and young adults; at present, no single imaging modality shows a clear overall advantage, though MRI is superior for soft tissues including intervertebral disc herniations. In the absence of moderate- to high-quality studies, additional diagnostic tests for LBP and spinal conditions are Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), Low Confidence.

Low back pain in children and adolescents—epidemiology and risk factors show substantial lifetime burden by late adolescence and sex-related risk differences. Prevalence rates are as high as 70% to 80% by 20 years of age, and one study found females had almost 3 times the risk of back pain as their male counterparts. Anthropometrics are not strongly associated with adolescent low back pain, findings for physical activity are mixed with certain sports associated, cross-sectional studies describe a U-shaped pattern with increased pain at sedentary and higher-activity ends, and psychological/psychosocial factors are commonly increased and may predict future onset.

Study Design

Resident's case problem.

Background

A 26-year-old male sought physical therapy services via direct access secondary to a flare-up of a chronic low back pain condition. The patient complained of recent onset of lumbosacral joint pain, including (1) constant right-sided deep-bruise sensation, (2) intermittent right-sided sharp stabbing pain, and (3) constant bilateral aching. The patient's past medical history included a hyperextension low back injury while playing football at age 17. Physical examination revealed (1) deep pain with palpation over the right lumbosacral joint region, (2) sharp right lumbosacral joint pain with 1 repetition of active trunk backward bending, and (3) a marked increase in pain and joint hypomobility with right unilateral joint assessment at the L4 and L5 spinal levels.

Diagnosis

The examining therapist referred the patient for radiographic evaluation due to strong suspicions of a pars interarticularis bony defect. Lumbar plain films, oblique views, revealed an L5 bilateral pars defect, leading to a diagnosis of a longstanding bilateral L5 spondylolysis.

Discussion

Patients with low back pain often seek physical therapy services. Identification of pathology requiring examination by other health care providers, leading to patient referral to other health care practitioners, is a potential important outcome of the therapist's examination. This resident's case problem illustrates the importance of a systematic examination scheme, including a thorough medical screening component that led to a patient referral for radiographic evaluation. The resultant diagnosis, although not representing serious pathology, did impact the therapist's patient plan of care.

Introduction

LBP refers to pain, stiffness, or muscle tension located between the lower rib margin and the gluteal fold, which may or may not be accompanied by sciatica (pain radiating from the buttocks down the course of the sciatic nerve.It is induced by diverse factors, including poor posture, physical strain, and lifestyle habits, which contribute to the degeneration of spinal structures and the activation of inflammatory responses.LBP in adults is widely acknowledged for its substantial impact on disability, quality of life, and healthcare consumption.However, the significance of LBP in adolescents has received far less attention in both social and scientific literature. This lack of attention is concerning not only due to the considerable impact LBP has on adolescents but also because adolescent LBP is associated with the future development of disabling LBP.LBP often emerges early in adolescence, with nearly 14% of teenagers reporting LBP in the past month, and approximately 10% reporting persistent LBP.By their teenage years, girls are almost twice as likely to report persistent back pain compared to boys, and by adolescence, one-third of teenagers report experiencing back pain in the past month.Common symptoms of adolescent LBP encompass back discomfort, pain during physical activity, and in severe cases, reduced participation in school and sports activities. The recurrence of these symptoms can severely affect adolescents’ mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and a decline in overall quality of life.

### Back pain in children and adolescents [^cc3eb0df]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Back pain is a common symptom in children and adolescents. Here we review the important causes, of which defects and stress reactions of the pars interarticularis are the most common identifiable problems. More serious pathology, including malignancy and infection, needs to be excluded when there is associated systemic illness. Clinical evaluation and management may be difficult and always requires a thorough history and physical examination. Diagnostic imaging is obtained when symptoms are persistent or severe. Imaging is used to reassure the patient, relatives and carers, and to guide management.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of low back pain in children and adolescents [^884c7660]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Back pain is common in children and adolescents. Most cases of back pain are non-specific and self-limiting. In children and adolescents, pain is usually related to the posterior elements of the spine and disc-related problems are rare. Serious pathology, including malignancy and infection needs to be excluded. Evaluation and management is challenging and requires a thorough history and physical exam, and understanding of the immature skeleton. Diagnostic imaging is useful in the evaluation of a child or adolescent with low back pain and can help guide management. This article will review common causes of back pain in the pediatric population.

### A typical low-back pain caused by an atypical etiology [^e20f8422]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Pain arising in the lumbar spine can have many etiologies, nearly 80% of which cannot be established with certainty. We present a very rare cause of back pain.

Case Report

A 54-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of low-back pain and right-sided sciatica. Conventional analgesics, physiotherapy, and epidural steroid application had failed to provide relief. She had tenderness of the right sacroiliac joint. Diagnostic fluoroscopic-guided sacroiliac-joint injection with lidocaine did not produce symptomatic relief. Pelvic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging showed septated multilocular hydatic cysts along the sciatic nerve. Surgical exploration noted multicystic lesions along the sciatic nerve woven to the nerve. Her low-back pain disappeared completely after the operation. She received oral albendazole for 6 months to prevent any recurrence of the disease and remains asymptomatic.

Conclusion

Hydatid cyst can be included in the differential diagnosis of lumbar back pain, especially in the endemic areas.

Pain amplification syndromes

Many pediatric patients with severe chronic musculoskeletal pain do not have an identified cause. The cause of amplified musculoskeletal pain is unknown, but minor trauma, underlying chronic illnesses and psychological distress have been associated. Typically, an affected child has pain at multiple sites in addition to back pain.

On physical examination, children may have altered posture, manifest allodynia (pain generated by normally non-painful stimuli), and have tenderness at multiple bony and soft tissue sites. Examination maneuvers that may help differentiate organic from non-organic pain include simulation of axial loading and passive rotation, and distracted straight leg raising. General and neurovascular exam are normal. Diagnostic studies are typically not helpful, other than to rule out other pathology. Treatment includes aggressive physiotherapy for desensitization, range of motion and function and multidisciplinary team approach to help with pain coping mechanisms.

### Contralateral spondylolysis and fracture of the lumbar pedicle in a young athlete [^a7f2eaa5]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

Clinical case report of unilateral pedicular stress fracture with a contralateral spondylolysis in a male high-school athlete presenting with low back pain.

Objective

To report this uncommon cause of low back pain in an adolescent athlete, and review the relevant literature.

Summary Of Background Data

The incidence of spondylolysis in the Caucasian population was found to be about 3% to 6%. This number is probably higher in the athletic adolescent age group, with reports ranging from 8% to 15%. Spondylolysis may be associated with pedicle fracture, usually on the contralateral side. This is an uncommon phenomenon that is not well described in the adolescent age group.

Methods

A 16-year-old male athlete presents with low back pain and limitation in sports as well as in daily activities. Clinical evaluation was suspicious for, and radiographic evaluation revealed left-sided L5 spondylolysis as well as contralateral L5 pedicle fracture. Conservative management included Boston Overlapping brace, external electrical stimulation, modification of activities, and a comprehensive physical therapy program.

Results

Radiological evaluation revealed persistent left L5 pars defect and advanced healing of the contralateral pedicle fracture. The patient achieved complete pain relief and returned to varsity level sporting activity.

Conclusion

Complete radiographic and clinical healing of the pedicle defect was observed, with return competitive varsity-level football without symptoms.

### Musculoskeletal low back pain in school-aged children: a review [^e7407f24]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Low back pain (LBP) in children and adolescents is a common problem. The differential diagnosis of LBP in this population is broad and different from that seen in the adult population. Most causes of LBP are musculoskeletal and benign in their clinical course. Clinicians should have an understanding of the relevant anatomy and the most commonly encountered etiologic factors of LBP in children and adolescents to provide effective care.

Observations

Low back pain is rarely seen in youth before they reach school age. Subsequently, rates of LBP rise until age 18 years, at which age the prevalence of LBP is similar to that in adults. The differential diagnosis of LBP in this population is broad, and individual etiologic factors are most often associated with musculoskeletal overuse or trauma. Sinister etiologic factors are rare. The patient's history and physical examination are the foundation of evaluating a child with LBP. The indication for and timing of specific imaging or other studies will vary depending on the etiologic factor of concern. Most treatment of LBP in this population is centered on relative rest, rehabilitation, and identification of predisposing risk factors. Pharmacologic treatment may be used but is typically a brief course. Orthopedic, rheumatologic, and other subspecialty referrals may be considered when indicated, but most of these patients can be managed by a general pediatrician with a good understanding of the principles described in this article.

Conclusions and Relevance

Low back pain in children and adolescents is a common problem. It is most often nonspecific, musculoskeletal, and self-limiting. Pediatricians should recognize the importance of a proper history, physical examination, and general knowledge of the lumbar spine and pelvic anatomy relevant to the child in their evaluation with this presenting symptom.

### Myeloid sarcoma presenting as low back pain in the pediatric emergency department [^92a5085e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain is a common symptom in the pediatric population; approximately half of all children present with at least one episode of low back pain. The majority of cases are due to nonspecific causes such as musculoskeletal trauma with spontaneous regression. On some occasions, however, life-threatening diseases have to be considered.

Case Report

A 15-year-old girl presented to the Pediatric Emergency Department for a history of continuous 2-day duration of low back pain and transient paresthesia of the right gluteal area. Low back pain was diagnosed and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory treatment combined with rest were prescribed. After 7 days, worsening of the clinical conditions was observed with bilateral gluteus paresthesia. A corset was recommended, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and rheumatological evaluation were prescribed on an outpatient basis. After 5 days she was hospitalized due to urinary incontinence and persistence of pain. Blood tests revealed neutrophil leukocytosis associated with mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperuricemia, and increased lactate dehydrogenase. MRI examination of the spine demonstrated a mass involving the sacral canal and the presacral region, extending through the sacral foramina, along the nerve roots. Similar tissue was found at multiple levels in the spine and in the right orbit. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy highlighted the presence of myeloid blasts and myeloid dysplasia, consequently, myeloid sarcoma was diagnosed. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Our case demonstrates the importance of prompt identification of diagnostic "red flags" in childhood low back pain, indicating the need for diagnostic investigations such as MRI and blood tests.

### Low back pain [^e99a1ed2]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain—lack of improvement as a red flag states that failure to improve with conservative care can be a sign of a serious medical condition or misdiagnosis, and as a general guideline, failure of a patient to demonstrate improvement in a period of time no longer than 30 days can be interpreted as a red flag.

### The investigation and management of back pain in children [^1ab39320]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2008). Low credibility.

Back pain in children and adolescents is probably much less common than in adults, but its true incidence is unknown. Although back pain has traditionally been considered a rare and often sinister presentation in the paediatric age group, recent literature now suggests that a relatively high number of children do experience back pain, but only a small proportion seek medical attention. For the majority of children with back pain no underlying cause is identified, but some require investigation to exclude serious underlying pathology. Laboratory and imaging investigations should be targeted towards those with "red flag" symptoms and signs. Imaging studies, particularly MRI, have an important role in diagnosis of underlying pathology such as infection or malignancy.

### Lifetime prevalence of nonspecific low back pain in adolescents: a cross-sectional epidemiologic survey [^0f7b7b5e]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

What Is Known

Nonspecific LBP is relatively common among adolescents, mostly in females, and is associated with age, positive family history, lifestyle, and sleep deprivation. Sport practice lowers the incidence of LBP.

What Is New

LBP is often associated with disabling pain and requires professional intervention. Identifying adolescent LBP and associated factors may reduce the risk of chronic pain.

Nonspecific low back pain (LBP) is defined as pain and discomfort localized between the costal margin and the lower gluteus folds, with or without radiation to the lower limbs, not attributed to specific and/or known diseases.

The diagnosis of this condition in adolescence is of exclusion, for example, in the absence of infections, tumors, spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, juvenile osteochondrosis of the spine (Scheuermann disease), and rheumatic diseases.This aspect must be more emphasized in adult patients (age >20 yrs), owing to the lower frequency of nonspecific LBP in this age group.

Epidemiologic data show that most LBP cases in adolescents are nonspecific. A recent systematic review indicates that the lifetime prevalence of nonspecific LBP in children and adolescents varies between 11.60% and 83.56%.This wide range is likely because of the heterogeneity and the different cultural and social norms of individuals included. –

Indeed, no consensus exists on a sex difference in LBP prevalence,,, whereas data on the association of height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and anthropometric factors are still inconclusive.

Among the factors associated with the onset, progression, and outcome of this condition, lifestyle factors such as smoking, hours of sleep per night, or long hours sitting (computer, school) and psychosocial factors such as depression, stress, poor academic performance, and perceived weight of backpacks are reported.–

Diagnosis & treatment of low back pain—pain diagrams and assessment tools: In patients with low back pain (LBP), the guideline asks whether pain diagram findings differentiate the pain‑causing structure and whether assessment tools or questionnaires identify the cause of acute, subacute or chronic LBP; a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address these questions in this patient population, and the work group feels that in the specifically defined patient population it is unlikely that pain diagrams are going to elucidate the cause of LBP.

Prior to his initial visit, VV had been previously evaluated for back pain by primary care, physiatry, spine surgery, rheumatology, and another pain management clinic. His pain was being managed with acetaminophen, a low dosage of gabapentin, a low dosage of tramadol, and topical lidocaine patches. Oxycodone had previously been prescribed but was discontinued due to side effects. He had previously completed physical therapy with reportedly limited benefit. Initial procedural interventions included right lumbar L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 medial branch blocks, as well as trigger point injections to the gluteal muscles. Initial diagnostic medial branch blocks were positive in that they provided greater than 80% relief of his right-sided low back pain. However, the patient later developed a deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, which required systemic anticoagulation with enoxaparin. It was thought that the risk of bleeding during the medial branch radiofrequency ablation (RFA) if anticoagulation was not held, as well as the risk of a cardioembolic event if anticoagulation were stopped, outweighed the potential benefit of this procedure. During this time, he presented to the emergency department for severe pain on multiple occasions and continued to experience functional decline at home despite additional medication trials, including pregabalin and duloxetine. Several months later when it became medically permissible to hold enoxaparin, he underwent right lumbar L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 medial branch radiofrequency ablations. Unfortunately, these were reportedly not effective in relieving his pain.

### Imaging in pediatric low back pain: expert panel narrative review [^ed4d3b3d]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) in the absence of acute trauma is a common pediatric presentation. Although LBP is frequently due to benign causes, red-flag signs and symptoms may indicate more serious causes, including infections, neoplasms, and inflammatory conditions, that necessitate more urgent management. MRI is the mainstay imaging test for the evaluation of pediatric LBP, and increased radiologist awareness of the imaging findings of key causes of pediatric LBP can expedite diagnosis and treatment and thereby decrease morbidity and mortality. Although imaging plays a key role in the diagnostic work-up of LBP in the pediatric age group, imaging must be used judiciously, as excessive advanced imaging may be associated with unnecessary costs and additional patient risk without substantial positive effect on clinical outcome. In this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review, we provide an overview of the appropriate use of imaging for the work-up of a child presenting with LBP, highlighting the utility of different modalities, optimal imaging techniques, and advanced methods that may aid problem solving. We also review the classic imaging features of common and critical causes of LBP in this age group, focusing on pediatric-specific organic causes while addressing certain uncommon diagnoses that radiologists should not miss.

### Back pain in children and adolescents [^5f325f1b]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Back pain has long been considered an uncommon complaint in the pediatric population. When present, teaching had been that pediatric back pain almost always has a diagnosable cause, many of which are progressive and potentially debilitating. Recent evidence has suggested that pediatric back pain is not only more common than once thought but also, within certain populations, benign and idiopathic. This, in turn, places an increasing amount of pressure on pediatricians to accurately assess and manage their patients presenting with complaints of back pain. The aim of this article is to serve as a review of the current literature on pediatric back pain. The article reviews the epidemiology, basic anatomy, and important elements of a history and examination, which should be considered when a child presents complaining of back pain. Last, a common differential diagnosis with evaluation and management is also given to help guide pediatricians through their medical decision making.

Low back pain is a common problem among young athletes. These individuals are at risk for significant structural injuries or nonmechanical problems that can be associated with their symptoms. Any athlete who has severe, persisting, or activity-limiting symptoms must be evaluated thoroughly. Clinicians must have a working knowledge of the developmental issues, injury patterns, and particular conditions that may affect a given athlete and be able to work with patients in addition to families, coaches, trainers, and others involved in the care and training of the injured athlete.

### Low back pain in adolescent and geriatric populations [^3371313c]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Spinal pain is the most common form of musculoskeletal pain. Chronic low back pain may contain nociceptive, neuropathic, and central components. Children are at risk of developing spinal pain. An increasing proportion of children develop low back pain as they become adolescents. In most adolescents, no specific diagnosis is identified. Psychological factors play a role in adolescents with back pain. Lumbar spinal stenosis causes neurogenic claudication in older patients. Magnetic resonance imaging is the best radiographic technique to detect nerve compression. Surgical decompression with or without fusion may offer greater short-term benefit but may not be significantly better than medical therapy.

Communication style —Findings from a recent qualitative study suggests four key behaviours from clinicians that can help patients feel reassured.

Show that you “know the whole story” by summarising the patient’s medical history and conducting a thorough assessment
Demonstrate empathy and communicate that you are qualified and experienced, helping the patient to feel that they are “seeing the right person”
Reduce the use of generic statements such as “nothing to worry about” and recognise the patient’s distress
Explain the likely cause(s) of LBP and provide a clear self management plan to help the patient understand and manage their LBP.

Monitoring —Regularly monitor image ordering practices and LBP outcomes relative to peers. This will reassure clinicians that the changes to practice that they implement are effective and do not result in patient harm.

Search methods

We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library to identify published systematic reviews on (i) the use of LBP imaging, (ii) the concordance of imaging with guidelines, (iii) physician reported barriers to guideline adherence, (iv) patient expectations around LBP imaging, and (v) interventions that have been used to change LBP imaging practice. Additionally, we consulted experts in LBP and primary care on relevant published evidence and the most up to date LBP guidelines internationally.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: a structured approach to the management of a child or adolescent with back pain [^eb31e26b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Back pain in childhood is relatively unusual, although as a child matures through adolescence it becomes much more common. At any age, potentially serious illnesses need to be excluded. There are some useful red flags to be aware of when taking a history and performing an examination. We outline a systematic approach when faced with this clinical presentation in a general paediatric setting, with suggestions for initial investigations and when to consider referral to a specialist.

Objective

To provide a structured approach for the paediatrician to appropriately manage a child or adolescent who presents with back pain.

Method

Review of the literature and description of the approach commonly adopted in a paediatric setting. Extended matching case questions are used to help the reader test their understanding.

Conclusions

A focused history, specifically asking about red flags, and a careful examination are essential to reach an appropriate differential diagnosis and management plan. Onward referral to a specialist may be required.

### Differences in pain, psychological symptoms, and gender distribution among patients with left-vs right-sided chronic spinal pain [^4941343f]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine pain levels, function, and psychological symptoms in relation to predominant sidedness of pain (right or left) and gender in patients being treated for chronic spinal pain.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Patients

Patients with chronic neck or low back pain undergoing a nerve block procedure in a specialty pain medicine clinic. INTERVENTIONS/OUTCOMES: Patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Brief Pain Inventory just prior to the procedure. Pain history and demographic variables were collected from a chart review. Chi-square, Pearson correlations, and multivariate statistics were used to characterize the relationships between side of pain, gender, pain levels, pain interference, and psychological symptoms.

Results

Among 519 subjects, men with left-sided pain (N = 98) were found to have significantly greater depression and anxiety symptoms and worse pain-related quality of life (P < 0.01), despite having similar pain levels as men with right-sided pain (N = 91) or women with left- or right-sided pain (N = 289). In men, psychological symptoms had a significantly greater correlation with pain levels than in women (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

In this sample, men with left-sided spinal pain report worse quality of life and more psychological symptoms than women. These data provide clinical evidence corroborating basic neuroscience findings indicating that the right cerebral hemisphere is preferentially involved in the processing of pain and negative affect. These data suggest that men appear more right hemisphere dominant in pain and affect processing. These findings have implications for multidisciplinary assessment and treatment planning in men.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of low back pain in children and adolescents [^c952a195]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Back pain is common in young people with one year prevalence rates varying from 7% to 58%. The lifetime prevalence may be as high as 70-80% by age 20. Low back pain (LBP) in childhood/adolescence is a significant risk factor for LBP in adulthood.

Low back pain (LBP) is more common in girls, with increasing age, with high and low levels of activity, and during periods of rapid growth. LBP is particularly common in youth participating in sports requiring flexion/extension/rotation of the spine (gymnastics, wrestling, football, racquet sports, diving, volleyball, cricket). Familial LBP, psychological distress and behavioural factors are also associated with LBP. Greater relative backpack weight is associated with upper- and mid-back pain but not LBP. Research supports the use of a 10% of body weight cutoff for safe use of backpacks.

The etiology of back pain in children and adolescents differs significantly from the adult population. Pediatric dogma suggests that children with back pain may have serious pathology, including malignancy and infection. However, most cases of back pain are non-specific and self-limiting. A recent prospective study of 73 children under age 18 years, with back pain of greater than 3 months duration found only 21% of the patients had positive findings after diagnostic evaluation or a minimum of 2 years follow-up. Spondylolysis with or without spondylolisthesis was the most common diagnosis. Back pain in young athletes is usually related to the posterior elements of the spine and disc-related problems are rare. Evaluation and management is challenging and requires a thorough history and physical exam, understanding of the pediatric skeleton and appropriate diagnostic imaging. This article will review common causes of low back pain in the pediatric population. It is not meant to be an exhaustive review and will not review acute trauma.

### Multifidus muscle contractility deficit was not specific to the painful side in patients with chronic low back pain during remission: a cross-sectional study [^053a2e7d]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Findings demonstrated no difference between right and left sides in healthy individuals and patients with bilateral CLBP, as well as painful and non-painful side in patients with unilateral CLBP. These findings suggest that patients with CLBP have the same LM contractility level between painful and non-painful sides, rather than specifically to the painful side. Although we found differences in LM thickness between males and females, these differences were no longer present after using our approach as standardization. This allowed us to compare data across males and females.

### Low back pain in the adolescent athlete [^b82abef0]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Clinicians must have knowledge of the growth and development of the adolescent spine and the subsequent injury patterns and other spinal conditions common in the adolescent athlete. The management and treatment of spinal injuries in adolescent athletes require a coordinated effort between the clinician, patients, parents/guardians, coaches, therapists, and athletic trainers. Treatment should not only help alleviate the current symptoms but also address flexibility and muscle imbalances to prevent future injuries by recognizing and addressing risk factors. Return to sport should be a gradual process once the pain has resolved and the athlete has regained full strength.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® back pain-child: 2024 update [^1c2851f1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Nontraumatic back pain is a common chief complaint encountered in the pediatric population. Although there are many etiologies for pediatric back pain, most cases are attributable to benign mechanical causes. Serious conditions causing back pain such as inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic etiologies are much less common but these pathologies can lead to long-term morbidity. Recent paradigm shift to judicious use of diagnostic imaging resources has come to the forefront. Although imaging is unlikely to be beneficial in transient back pain without neurologic deficit and normal physical examination, prompt imaging evaluation is required when there are clinical and laboratory findings suggesting an infectious or neoplastic etiology. For this document, various clinical scenarios are discussed by which a child may present with back pain. Imaging studies that might be most appropriate (based on the best available evidence or expert consensus) in these clinical scenarios are detailed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Risk factors for low back pain after iliac vein stenting for non-thrombotic iliac vein lesions [^9c3ebb02]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite a few patients with very high pain scores, overall, the vast majority of pain scores were low. Factors that were associated with lower pain scores were older age, male sex, procedures on the right side, and IV sedation, in particular with the use of propofol. There was no relationship between BMI or presenting symptoms and pain scores. These data may help us better target patients anticipated to have high pain scores and suggest the preferential use of propofol and toradol for sedation.

Results

Descriptive data

Complete datasets were available for 409 adults (66% of the invited study sample) and 439 adolescents (80% of the invited study sample). A detailed description of all variables included in the analyses is shown in Table 1, summarised below.

"LBP ever" and "LBP year" were reported by 85% and 70% of the adults, respectively. In adolescents, "LBP year" was reported by 41% and "LBP month" by 22%.

Fat infiltration of the LMM was far more common in the adults; slight fat infiltration was observed in 71% and severe infiltration in 10%, whereas in adolescents these figures were 14% and 0%, respectively (Table 1). Infiltration was most commonly found at the lowest lumbar level, with no difference between left and right, and this did not change with age (data not shown). Female participants had markedly higher prevalence rates of fat in the LMM [90% in women versus 71% in men (p < 0.0001) and 20% in girls versus 6% in boys (p < 0.0001)]. Other prevalence rates for men and women are shown in Table 1.

In adults, 43% were overweight or obese compared with only 16% of adolescents. A fairly regular spread of data was noticed in the four groups of activity at work and in the groups ofhours spent in sports. This was also the case for the adolescents' participation in sports. Regarding physical activity in the adults, few participated in competitive sports and relatively few reported not being active in leisure time. A large proportion of the children cycled daily (85%).

Pain from the anterior elements of the spine

Scheuermann's Disease

Scheuermann's disease is the most common cause of kyphotic deformity in adolescence with a reported incidence of 1-8%. It affects male and females in equal numbers and the etiology is unknown. The onset usually occurs just prior to puberty and is commonly attributed to poor posture, causing delay in diagnosis and treatment. Most adolescents are asymptomatic and cosmetic appearance is their chief presenting complaint. However, pain may be present, especially with prolonged sitting posture and exercise. On clinical examination, the kyphosis may be thoracic or thoracolumbar. The kyphosis is fixed and remains evident on hyperextension and flexion of the spine, distinguishing Scheuermann's from postural kyphosis which disappears with forward flexion. The thoracic pattern is most common; adolescents have non-structural hyperlordosis of the lumbar and cervical spine and may have moderate scoliosis. The thoracolumbar form is uncommon and is associated with relative lumbar hypolordosis and pain. Tightness of the anterior shoulder muscles, iliopsoas and hamstrings is common. Neurologic deficits are rare and cardiopulmonary insufficiency occurs only with severe curves measuring > 100 degrees. Standing lateral and anterior-posterior radiographic features classically show anterior wedging of at least three adjacent vertebral bodies by 5 or more degrees, end plate irregularities, loss of disc space height, Schmorl nodes and Cobb angle of at least 45 degrees. (Figure 2)

Observation and symptomatic treatment with extension exercises, hamstring and pectoral muscles is sufficient for minor curves. Bracing is indicated for thoracic curves greater than 55 degrees and thoracolumbar curves greater than 40 degrees. Surgical intervention may be considered for adolescents with curvature of 70 degrees or greater, refractory pain or neurologic deficit.

### Global, regional and national burden of low back pain in adolescents aged 10-19 years, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis of the global burden of disease study 2021 [^bb446459]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

From a health policy perspective, addressing the global burden of LBP in adolescents requires multi-sectoral collaboration and targeted interventions tailored to regional and socioeconomic contexts. First, preventive strategies should prioritize population-wide health education to raise awareness about LBP risk factors, such as prolonged sedentary behavior, poor posture, and unsafe lifting practices. School-based programs could integrate age-appropriate modules on spinal health, including daily warm-up exercises and ergonomic guidance, with a focus on gender-specific needs—for example, educating female adolescents about hormonal influences on pain sensitivity and stress management techniques.Second, school environment ergonomics must be systematically improved. Policies should mandate adjustable desks and chairs that accommodate adolescent growth, reduce backpack weights (eg, through digital textbook adoption), and enforce regular break times to encourage movement. In high-SDI regions with intense academic pressure, like Eastern Europe and East Asia, education systems should implement evidence-based limits on daily study hours and promote peer-led “posture champions” to reinforce healthy habits. For low-SDI regions where adolescents engage in heavy labor, occupational health protections are critical, including age-appropriate workload regulations, vocational training on safe lifting techniques, and access to protective equipment for those in agricultural or industrial roles.Third, promoting physical activity requires policy incentives to increase structured and unstructured movement. Governments should expand school-based sports programs, integrate active commuting (eg, walking or cycling to school), and collaborate with urban planners to create safe public spaces for play. In high-SDI areas with sedentary lifestyles, digital health interventions (eg, mobile apps tracking screen time and prompting movement) could complement in-person initiatives. Conversely, in regions with high physical labor burdens, policies should balance injury prevention with access to recreational activities that strengthen core muscles without exacerbating occupational strain. Lastly, health systems need enhanced capacity to diagnose and manage adolescent LBP, particularly in low-resource settings. Training primary care providers in non-pharmacological interventions (eg, physical therapy, yoga) and reducing barriers to low-cost treatments would improve outcomes. Cross-sectoral monitoring frameworks, linking education, labor, and health data, should be established to evaluate policy impacts on LBP prevalence, incidence, and YLDs over time. By embedding these strategies into national health agendas, policymakers can mitigate the lifelong social and economic toll of adolescent LBP while fostering healthier lifestyles for future generations.

3.2. Latent class analysis classes

The LCA classes were visualized by heat maps of the probability of an individual having membership in a specific class, where the darker the color, the higher the probability of indicating pain in that anatomical region, see Figure 1. The classes were labeled according to clinically meaningful pain distribution patterns.

Figure 1. 
This figure shows the aggregated pain drawings in classes derived from LCA for LBP (upper row; 5-class-model solution) and MBPNP (lower row; 4-class-model solution). The frequency of pain marked in each of the 46 anatomical regions is presented with a red scale heat map (0%-100%). The darker the color of red, the more individuals have indicated pain in that anatomical region. Descriptions of the main characteristics of each class are provided under the respective aggregated pain drawing. When inspecting the aggregated pain drawings, the reader should keep in mind that any difference in shading between the left and right side represents a difference in the frequency of unilateral vs bilateral pain indications, respectively, as any unilateral right-sided pain indication has been mirrored to the left side. LBP, low back pain; LCA, latent class analysis; MBPNP, midback pain/neck pain.

3.2.1. Latent class analysis classes for low back pain

Class 1 was labeled as LBP and radiating pain (19.9% [n = 3073]) and was characterized by multiple pain sites limited to the dorsum of the body with high pain intensity and psychological scores. The largest class was class 2, labeled as radiating pain (25.8% [n = 3993]). Class 2 was characterized by pain extending into one leg, reporting the highest mean age, the smallest number of pain sites, moderate activity limitation and pain intensity, and the lowest mean scores on psychological factors. Class 3 was labeled as local LBP (24.8% [n = 3829]) and was characterized by the lowest activity limitation, pain intensity, and psychological scores on average. Class 4 was labeled as LBP and whole leg pain (18.7% [n = 2896]) and was characterized by LBP and primarily unilateral leg pain (both frontal and dorsal), reporting high activity limitation, pain intensity, and psychological scores. The smallest class was class 5, labeled as widespread pain (10.8% [n = 1674]). Class 5 was characterized by high activity limitation and pain intensity while having the highest scores on average in all psychological factors.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaBack pain-child [^6cccf270]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

It is now generally accepted that nontraumatic back pain in the pediatric population is common. The presence of isolated back pain in a child has previously been an indication for imaging; however, recently a more conservative approach has been suggested using clinical criteria. The presence of constant pain, night pain, and radicular pain, alone or in combination, lasting for 4 weeks or more, constitute clinical red flags that should prompt further imaging. Without these clinical red flags, imaging is likely not indicated. Exceptions include an abnormal neurologic examination or clinical and laboratory findings suggesting an infectious or neoplastic etiology, and when present should prompt immediate imaging. Initial imaging should consist of spine radiographs limited to area of interest, with spine MRI without contrast to evaluate further if needed. CT of the spine, limited to area of interest, and Tc-99m bone scan whole body with single-photon emission computed tomography may be useful in some patients. The addition of intravenous contrast is also recommended for evaluation of a potential neoplastic or infectious process. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Multifidus muscle contractility deficit was not specific to the painful side in patients with chronic low back pain during remission: a cross-sectional study [^73fb6514]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain is one of the leading causes of musculoskeletal problems with a great negative impact on society because of its global burden of disability.It affects nearly 60% to 80% of all populations throughout their lifetime.Once individuals suffer from low back pain, the recurrence rate throughout their lifetime will be approximately between 60% and 70% per year.Several studies have suggested lumbar multifidus muscle (LM) impairment might be a key factor contributing to low back pain.Studies also found that LM cannot be automatically recovered even after remission stage; therefore, it should be responsible for persistent/recurrent symptoms in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP).

LM is one of the deep trunk muscles responsible for static and dynamic stability of the lumbar spine.LM controls stability of the lumbar spine by stiffening the spine and takes part in more than two-thirds of the stiffness of the lumbar spine.Morphology studies using magnetic resonance image (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated reduction in LM cross-sectional area (CSA) bilaterally regardless of the side of pain.Functional studies using electromyography (EMG) demonstrated reduction in LM activation in both painful and non-painful sides in patients with CLBP.Recently, rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI) has been commonly used in clinical settings to evaluate LM contractility in patients with CLBP.Several studies demonstrated bilateral changes in LM morphology and activation regardless of side of pain.These changes are also related to muscle contractility. Therefore, questions remain whether any difference in LM contractility exists between left and right sides in healthy individuals, as well as painful and non-painful sides in patients with CLBP when using RUSI.

### Imaging of back pain in children [^1d80a51c]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

While back pain presents less frequently in children than in adults, it still poses a significant clinical challenge with respect to making a firm diagnosis and developing an effective treatment plan. When children have back pain and medical attention is sought, an underlying pathology is usually suspected. Pediatric patients are evaluated, first, with a complete clinical history and examination and, second, by an imaging work-up that is based on initial findings, including the child's age and size, signs and symptoms, and suspected etiology. This article describes 1) the epidemiology of back pain in children, 2) the imaging work-up used, and 3) the correlation of imaging findings with disease entities that may cause back pain in the pediatric patient. The list of diseases giving rise to back pain is not meant to be exhaustive but rather reflective of the most commonly identified pathologies and disorders among young children and adolescents, from athletic injuries to lethal cancers.

Investigations

Laboratory tests are necessary in evaluating patients with back pain and a high suspicion of infection or systemic disease. CBC, ESR or CRP, blood and joint cultures should be done if infection is suspected. Arthritis is a clinical diagnosis; ANA, rheumatoid factor and HLA-B27 are helpful in classification and treatment but not diagnosis. CBC, peripheral smear should be done if hematological malignancy is suspected.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. We will include data from studies reported as full text. We will describe the characteristics of studies published as abstract only, unpublished data, and ongoing studies, but will not include their results in the data syntheses. There will be no language or date restrictions.

Types of participants

We will include children from 6 to 18 years of age suffering from non‐specific LBP. We will include participants with LBP irrespective of the duration, and will perform a subgroup analysis that considers acute, subacute, chronic, and recurrent LBP. We will also include children and adolescents with prior LBP who were treated with exercise to prevent the recurrence of LBP.

In the case of mixed populations involving adults, we will include studies only if data on children are reported separately.

We will exclude participants with pain secondary to specific causes of pain, such as spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis, Scheuermann’s disease, scoliosis, trauma, and other severe pathologies.

### Acute low back pain: diagnosis and management [^08eceeaa]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute low back pain falls into two causal categories: specific and nonspecific. Specific causes can be intrinsic to the spine, from systemic disease, or referred pain from other organs. However, acute low back pain typically is nonspecific. Aside from recent trauma, most patients with acute low back pain do not require imaging unless history reveals red flag findings. Those with red flag findings require immediate evaluation and treatment, including imaging and specialty referral or consultation. For patients with nonspecific low back pain, first-line treatment involves maintaining activity, use of heat therapy, and other nonpharmacologic treatments (eg, dry needling, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, acupuncture). Pharmacotherapy options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, trigger point injections, and possibly systemic corticosteroids for radicular low back pain. Drugs that should not routinely be used include benzodiazepines, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, and acetaminophen. Physicians should address comorbid conditions that increase the risk of acute low back pain becoming chronic. Patients with pain persisting beyond 8 weeks despite appropriate therapy should be considered for imaging and laboratory evaluation to identify specific causes.

Pain from the posterior elements of the spine

Spondylolysis and Spondylolithesis

Spondylolysis is a defect in the pars interarticularis and most commonly affects the fifth and fourth lumbar vertebrae. The majority of pediatric cases represent a fatigue or stress fracture in the pars interarticularis. The incidence of pars defects on plain radiographs is approximately 6% of the general population by age 18 and 8% to 15% of elite adolescent athletes. Spondylolysis is more common in boys and in athletes participating in sports involving repetitive extension, flexion, and rotation. Acute and overuse injuries both occur, with overuse injuries being more common. There is also a genetic predisposition to spondylolysis among certain ethnic groups with the prevalence among the Inuit in Northern Canada as high as 20-50%. An association between spina bifida occulta and spondylolysis has also been reported.

Spondylolithesis occurs with bilateral pars defects and is defined by forward translation of one vertebra on the next caudal segment. Spondylolithesis is graded based on the percentage of slip of one vertebral body on the vertebral body below [grade 1 slip (0-25% slip), grade 2 (25-50%), grade 3 (50-75%) and grade 4 (> 75%)]. Spondylolithesis is more common in females, and typically occurs during the adolescent growth spurt. Progression of slip after skeletal maturity is rare.

Older children and adolescents usually present with the insidious onset of low back pain, worsened by extension, activity or prolonged standing. Radicular symptoms and neurologic deficit affecting the L5 or S1 nerve roots may be present with nerve root irritation and high grade spondylolisthesis. On examination, patients may have an exaggerated lumbar hyperlordosis, ipsilateral paraspinal muscle spasm and tight hamstrings. Spinal extension is typically painful, especially single leg extension on the affected side. There is often limited forward flexion and straight leg raise. There may be focal tenderness to palpation over the site of the pars lesion and a step-off at the lumbosacral junction with spondylolisthesis.

### Low back pain in adolescents: a 1-year analysis of eventual diagnoses [^42c9c713]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Back pain in adolescents is very common and often seen in the office for evaluation of potential spinal pathology. Pediatric back pain has often thought to be from serious identifiable causes such as spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, tumor, or infection. A follow-up analysis of adolescents initially presenting with back pain to their eventual subsequent diagnosis within 1 year has not been reported on a large scale with a national sample.

Methods

A national insurance database (PearlDiver Patient Records Database) was queried for ICD-9 codes to identify patients aged 10 to 19 years with back pain from 2007 to 2010. These patients were tracked for imaging obtained, and eventual development of subsequent associated spinal pathology diagnoses using CPT and ICD-9 codes for up to 1 year after initial presentation.

Results

A total of 215,592 adolescents were identified presenting with low back pain (LBP) from 2007 to 2010. Over 80% of adolescents with LBP had no identifiable diagnosis within 1 year. The most common associated subsequent diagnoses were lumbar strain/spasm (8.9%), followed by scoliosis (4.7%), lumbar degenerative disk disease (1.7%), and lumbar disk herniation (1.3%). The rates of all other diagnoses including spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, infection, tumor, and fracture had <1% association with LBP.

Conclusions

In conclusion, adolescent LBP is a common diagnosis for which underlying serious pathology is rare. The most common diagnosis aside from strain or muscle spasm associated with LBP are scoliosis and degenerative disk disease. Pediatric orthopaedists often are consulted on patients with LBP and should always have high suspicion for potential serious spinal pathology, but should recognize the most common etiologies of back pain in adolescence.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^80041dc9]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) clinical evaluation—history, physical examination, and red flags: No quality studies assess the utility and/or components of a history and physical examination; nevertheless, the Panel’s consensus recommendation is that a careful history and physical examination is naturally important for appropriate evaluation and diagnosis. The initial assessment of LBP has a unique emphasis on ‘ruling out’ serious underlying conditions, and this process primarily relies upon the identification of red flags that in employed populations include trauma, history of cancer, immunosuppression, progressive neurological deficit, renal colic, and history of urinary tract infections. The absence of red flags and conditions generally rules out the need for specialist studies, referral, or inpatient care during the first 4 to 6 weeks. A comprehensive evaluation and documentation include history, prior treatment, vocation and avocational activities, functional level, medical and family history, social history including substance(s) use, review of systems, laboratory testing, and imaging studies. Evaluation using repeated end-range testing while monitoring for patterns of pain response determines the presence or absence of directional preference and pain centralization.

Introduction

In adults, low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) are the first and fourth leading causes for years lived with disability worldwide. Several studies indicate that these conditions have their onset in childhood or adolescence and that prevalence increases with age, accelerating around the age of 12 to 15. Only a minority of adolescents (< 10%) repeatedly report pain and seek care for their condition. Nevertheless, adolescents with back or neck pain have an increased risk for suffering from back or neck pain also in adulthood. Thus, it was postulated that the focus of research, prevention and treatment should be shifted from the adult to the young population.

As with adults, the first step in the assessment of adolescent spinal pain (lower back, mid back, neck) is to rule out red flags. Likewise, in the majority of adolescent spinal pain no serious underlying pathology can be identified and back and neck pain is classified as non-specific: in a study with more than 200,000 adolescents with LBP, more than 80% had no identifiable diagnosis within one year, 9% had muscle spasm, 5% scoliosis and very few degenerative disc disease and disc herniation, respectively (1–2% each). Serious pathologies such as tumor, fracture, or spondylolisthesis were diagnosed in less than 1% of these patients. In non-specific spinal pain it is essential to early differentiate those children and adolescents who are at risk for a long-term (‘consequential’) pain condition from those with a self-limiting (‘trivial’) pain episode, to prevent the former from developing chronic pain and to ensure that the latter are not ‘over-medicalized’ by unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic activities.

Routine ordering of imaging for low back pain should be discouraged, and current recommendations from the American College of Physicians are that (1) imaging is only indicated for severe progressive neurological deficits or when red flags are suspected, and (2) routine imaging does not result in clinical benefit and may lead to harm.

### Final comment (...) [^538d3404]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The pain is vague and is unrelated to meals, activity or stool pattern. Patients are not awakened by the pain. An epigastric location is reported by 10 percent of patients. It is accompanied by autonomic features such as pallor, nausea, dizziness, headache and fatigue. The family history is often positive for functional bowel disease such as irritable bowel syndrome. 7 The physical examination is striking for its normality, and the screening laboratory investigations are by definition normal. True irritable bowel syndrome occurs infrequently before late adolescence. 7 It is best characterized as an intestinal dysmotility with intervals of nuisance diarrhea or constipation. The pain is dull, crampy and located in the left lower quadrant or periumbilical region. As in cases of recurrent abdominal pain syndrome, autonomic features are common.

Stress is implicated in the flare-up of symptoms, and a positive family history is common. Management includes dietary factors such as exclusion of contributory lactose intolerance and the addition of fiber to the diet, instruction in stress management techniques and, rarely, the use of antispasmotic medications. Antral gastritis is a common peptic presentation in children. Children present with chronic epigastric pain, early satiety with nausea, modest weight loss and a low frequency of family history of peptic disease. Gastric emptying is impaired, and reflux symptoms may be prominent. Results of the stool test for occult blood are usually negative. Radiographic studies are either normal or demonstrate pylorospasm. Many children with antral gastritis have an acute onset of gastritis, often in the context of a viral-like illness. 16 This treatment regimen is successful in approximately 90 percent of patients.

Endoscopic confirmation of healing is indicated with recurrent or persistent symptoms. Antibiotic resistance is an increasing concern, so empiric treatment for possible Helicobacter infection is discouraged. 17 Children present with episodic nausea, abdominal pain and usually significant emesis, typically beginning during the night or early morning hours and lasting from six to 48 hours, with intervening intervals of weeks to months with no symptoms or findings at all. The majority of children have a family history of migraine and may have other autonomic features such as pallor, explosive diarrhea, lethargy and tachycardia. Of note, headache is rare in children with cyclic vomiting syndrome, although it may evolve into more classic migraine in adolescence. Treatment is usually early intervention with anti-emetics or migraine medications.

Low back pain—differential diagnosis and red flag screening note that in the vast majority of patients with low back pain, symptoms can be attributed to nonspecific mechanical factors, but in a much smaller percentage the cause may be something more serious such as cancer, cauda equina syndrome, spinal infection, spinal compression fractures, spinal stress fractures, ankylosing spondylitis, or aneurysm. Clinicians must be aware of the key signs and symptoms associated with serious medical conditions and develop a system to continually screen, which may include medical screening questionnaires and a neurological status examination. A neurological status examination should be included for patients with low back pain, and patients with paresthesias, sensory changes, weakness, or signs of central nervous system disorders should receive a thorough neurological examination including assessment of sensation, reflexes, muscle power, motor control, and movement coordination. When a potentially serious medical condition is suspected, clinicians should initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner.

### Republished: parapedicular vertebral augmentation with polymethylmetacrylate for pedicle screw loosening [^bc2e2241]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

A 71-year-old man who had a L1/S1 posterior fusion revision surgery complained of increasing back pain 5 weeks after the open surgical procedure. The pain was initially estimated at 9/10 on the visual analog scale (VAS) and thought to be related to a right-sided L2 screw loosening. A right parapedicular vertebroplasty was performed and polymethylmethacrylate cement was instilled around the right pedicle screw, filling the anterior two-thirds of the vertebral body. On postvertebroplasty day 1, the patient had significant improvement in his low back pain. The pain further decreased at 1 and 3months after the intervention (2/10 on the VAS). Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive, accessible, effective, and long lasting treatment for compression fractures. We believe that this technique could also be indicated to treat pain related to low grade screw loosening in properly selected patients.

### Etiology (...) [^c6747748]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

2, 6 Approximately one in 15 persons develop appendicitis. 7 Lymphoid tissue or a fecalith obstructs the appendiceal lumen, the appendix becomes distended, and ischemia and necrosis may develop. Patients with appendicitis classically present with visceral, vague, poorly localized, periumbilical pain. Within six to 48 hours, the pain becomes parietal as the overlying peritoneum becomes inflamed; the pain then becomes well localized and constant in the right iliac fossa. Clinical Evaluation HISTORY Age of Onset Pain History Children who do not verbalize typically present with late symptoms of disease. Children up to the teenage years have a poor sense of onset or location of pain. The classic sequence of shifting pain usually occurs with appendicitis. In children who cannot verbalize, the initial 24-hour history of vague nausea or periumbilical pain may be unreported or go unnoticed, so these children more often present at the second stage of more visceral pain.

However, any child with pain that localizes to the right lower quadrant should be suspected of having appendicitis. Thus, inquiry into the location, timing of onset, character, severity, duration, and radiation of pain are all important points but must be viewed in the context of the child's age. Recent Trauma A history of recent trauma may indicate the cause of pain. Abdominal Examination The breathing pattern should be observed, and the patient should be asked to distend the abdomen and then flatten it. After the child is asked to indicate, with one finger, the area of maximal tenderness, the abdomen should be gently palpated, moving toward that area. The physician should examine for Rovsing's sign, then gently assess muscle rigidity. Associated Signs Jaundice suggests hemolysis or liver disease.

Pallor and jaundice point to sickle cell crisis. A positive iliopsoas test or obturator test suggests an inflamed retrocecal appendix, a ruptured appendix, or an iliopsoas abscess.

### Low back pain due to middle cluneal nerve entrapment neuropathy [^961568f7]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The etiology of low back pain (LBP) is complicated and the diagnosis can be difficult. Superior cluneal nerve entrapment neuropathy (SCN-EN) is a known cause of LBP, although the middle cluneal nerve (MCN) can be implicated in the elicitation of LBP.

Methods

A 76-year-old woman with a 4-year history of severe LBP was admitted to our department in a wheelchair. She complained of bilateral LBP that was exacerbated by lumbar movement. Her pain was severe on the right side and she also suffered right leg pain and numbness. Based on palpation and nerve blocking findings we diagnosed SCN-EN and MCN entrapment neuropathy (MCN-EN).

Results

Her symptoms improved with repeated SCN and MCN blocking; the MCN block was the more effective and her symptoms improved. As her right-side pain around the MCN -EN with severe trigger pain recurred we performed microscopic right MCN neurolysis under local anesthesia. This led to dramatic improvement of her LBP and leg pain and the numbness improved. At the last follow-up, 7 months after surgery, she did not require pain medication.

Conclusions

The MCN consists of sensory branches from the dorsal rami of S1-S4. It sandwiches the sacral ligament between the posterior superior and inferior iliac spine as it courses over the iliac crest. Its entrapment at this hard orifice can lead to severe LBP with leg symptoms. An MCN block effect is diagnostically useful. Less invasive MCN neurolysis under local anesthesia is effective in patients who fail to respond to observation therapy.

Patient IV3

At 7 years of age this boy developed episodic back pain with nausea, lethargy, pallor and marked photophobia, sometimes with a bilateral frontal or vertex headache. The episodes started with a deep throbbing pain between the shoulder blades, going down the centre of his back, and sometimes followed by a throbbing pain in the top half of his right arm, occasionally in his left arm, but never in both. As he was lying down in a quiet dark room, he would often get a severe, pounding headache on the top of his head and in both eyes, with a feeling that his eyes were swollen. He said ‘the head felt big and weighed down on my body’. The backache would get better while the headache was getting worse, then the arm would get better, then finally the headache. Episodes lasted about 30 minutes in total. On a few occasions the backache was present for several hours.

Patient IV4

This male patient had motion sickness from the age of 4 until 12 years and intermittent headaches from before the age of 10 years. In his teenage years these were unilateral, frontal, aching or throbbing, mild (2/10), lasting for hours and associated with dizziness preceding and during the headache. On a few occasions he had persistent blurred vision with the headache or visual bright spots lasting seconds and severe headaches (9/10) with nausea, vomiting and photophobia. With a few headaches he had a moderate (3/10) ache or throb in the right scapula and right upper arm, ipsilateral or contralateral to the headache, and on one occasion in the left arm. Episodes lasted up to 5 hours with a maximum frequency of every 2 months.

These types of labor often require long - term bending, heavy lifting, or maintaining a fixed posture, exerting greater pressure on the adolescents’ waists and increasing the possibility of LBP caused by occupational risks.For example, in some rural areas of Africa, adolescents may need to assist their families in heavy agricultural activities, and frequent bending actions like sowing and harvesting increase the risk of developing LBP.Conversely, in Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and Southern Latin America, adolescents are more concentrated in schools for education, with a relatively low proportion of participation in labor and lighter labor intensity.They may mainly be engaged in some light physical activities, such as part - time retail work or simple office assistant work, which exert less pressure on the waist and have relatively low occupational risks.In regions with a high level of education popularization, such as Central and Eastern Europe, adolescents spend most of their time receiving systematic education in schools. Vocational training is usually carried out in the later stage of the formal education system or after graduation, and vocational training focuses on skill cultivation and the imparting of labor safety knowledge.This enables adolescents to possess certain knowledge and skills before entering the labor market, allowing them to choose relatively safe and suitable jobs and reducing occupational risks.For example, vocational schools will provide students with labor safety courses related to their majors, cultivating correct working postures and labor habits and reducing the risk of LBP.In some regions with relatively scarce educational resources, such as some parts of Sub - Saharan Africa and East Asia, adolescents may leave school and enter the labor market earlier and lack formal vocational training. They lack the necessary skills and knowledge in work and do not understand how to prevent occupational injuries.Overall, the education systems in regions such as Eastern Europe are more developed compared to those in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, adolescent working hours are subject to clearly defined legal restrictions. These factors collectively result in significant disparities in YLDs attribution rates between these regions.

### Transversus abdominis and multifidus asymmetry in runners measured by MRI: a cross-sectional study [^6984d073]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

In an attempt to explain our unexpected results, we investigated if handedness was associated with muscle thickness, although Springer et al found that hand dominance had no impact on TrA activation in 32 healthy participants aged 18–45 years. When our data were stratified for hand dominance, we found that there was no difference in TrA thickness with contraction in left-hand dominant runners. In fact, the thickness of both TrA with contraction was virtually the same (7.6 mm). Therefore, it seems that the side difference we found was driven by the right-hand dominant participants.

It is not likely that the differences in core muscle morphology are the result of other habitual unilateral movements performed on a daily basis. We asked the participants about their occupation. The answers ranged from sedentary, such as ‘administrator’, ‘customer service representative’, ’medical scientist’, ‘broker’ or ‘manager’ to more dynamic, such as ‘orthopaedic surgeon’, ‘teacher’ and ‘running coach’.

Further possible explanations for the right to left side differences at rest and with contraction include previous unilateral training protocols (eg, resistance training), leg length difference, previous injuries and their rehabilitation protocols. We did not measure any of those variables. Additionally, it is possible that running the same route repeatedly and exclusively, the runner could have obtained muscle imbalance from environmental factors, such as running in circles on a track or on the side of a sloped road.

We have to reject our hypothesis that runners without low back pain exhibit right to left symmetrical core muscles at rest and with contraction. Our study showed that asymmetries in core muscles are found in athletes engaged in endurance running, a seemingly symmetrical activity. An asymmetry in core muscles at rest has been associated with low back pain in several studies,with the usual finding being that the side of pain demonstrated a smaller MF CSA. Since our study recruited subjects who were pain free, it is not surprising that their MF was symmetrical at rest. The muscle asymmetry found with contraction has to be linked to a mechanism other than pain.

### Imaging findings in right-sided diverticulitis in a child [^5c339fa1]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

We report the imaging findings in a case of acute right-sided diverticulitis in a 13-year-old boy. Based on this diagnosis the patient was successfully treated conservatively with intravenous antibiotics. This entity should be considered in patients with right lower quadrant pain and a sonographically normal appendix, particularly in those of Asian or Pacific descent.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^be29c199]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain—imaging recommendations emphasize evidence gaps and research needs: For contrast enhanced imaging indications based on history and clinical presentation, for imaging the lumbar spine in an oblique plane, and for the value of flexion/extension films in evaluating lower back pain, “A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.” The work group recommends that future imaging studies relative to low back pain (LBP) include subgrouping of relevant populations, and recommends a prospective study evaluating patients with and without nonspecific low back pain.

Lumbar Disk Herniation

Lumbar disc herniation in pediatric and adolescent populations is uncommon with an incidence of 3.5% recently reported. Disk protrusion (primarily L4-5 or L5-S1) is more common in adolescents than in young children. In a study of 100 consecutive adolescent athletes presenting with acute low back pain, only 11% had disc pathology. Children and adolescents with disc herniation present with low back, buttock or hip pain worsened by bending forward, coughing, sneezing or straining with bowel movements. On examination, there is often limitation of forward flexion and positive straight-leg raise test. Weakness in a myotomal distribution, numbness in a dermatomal distribution and diminished reflexes are not common in adolescents with disc herniation. Investigations include radiographs and MRI of the lumbar spine. Careful inspection is required to differentiate between spondylolysis with nerve root impingement or disc herniation with nerve root impingement. Symptomatic treatment with rest, analgesics, and physical therapy is successful in the majority of patients but adolescents do not fare as well with conservative therapy as do adults. Early microdiscectomy for patients who do not respond to conservative treatment is advocated by some surgeons while others reserve operative therapy for progressive neurologic deficit.
