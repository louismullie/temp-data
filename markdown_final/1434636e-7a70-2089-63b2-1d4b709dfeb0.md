## Question

How long do viral URI last in infants

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long viral upper respiratory infections (URIs) last in infants. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence base for symptom duration in children. Then, I should verify whether infant-specific data are available or if I need to extrapolate from pediatric cohorts. Next, I will consider virus-specific nuances, especially RSV and rhinovirus, and how age modifies duration. Finally, I will synthesize practical timelines and highlight red flags that warrant reassessment, while noting limitations and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the best evidence base. The most robust data on symptom duration in children come from a 2013 BMJ systematic review of 23 randomized trials and 25 observational studies in primary care and emergency settings, which reported time to resolution for common cold and non-specific respiratory symptoms using 50% and 90% thresholds, which are clinically meaningful for counseling families [^928ff5c8] [^7a850fa8].

> Wait, let me verify whether infant-specific durations are available in that review. The BMJ review pooled data across children 0–18 years and did not provide infant-only subgroup estimates, so I should be cautious about directly applying means to infants; however, the 50% and 90% resolution metrics are the most reliable benchmarks we have for pediatric URIs and are commonly used for anticipatory guidance in primary care [^928ff5c8] [^7a850fa8].

> I will now examine the core estimates for "common cold" and "non-specific respiratory symptoms". For common cold, about 50% of children are better by 10 days and about 90% are better by 15 days; for non-specific respiratory symptoms, about 50% are better by 7–8 days and about 80% by 14 days, with a projected 90% resolution around day 16, which aligns with the general trajectory parents observe in infants as well [^928ff5c8] [^7b4fc58c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all viruses behaving the same. I need to check virus-specific nuances. RSV in infants often causes more severe disease and can persist longer than some other viruses; RSV replication and shedding can extend beyond two weeks in young infants, and higher viral load correlates with longer hospitalization and more severe disease, which helps explain why some infants have prolonged courses even when managed as outpatients [^b94fa33a] [^0ef192f8].

> Let me consider rhinovirus specifically. Prolonged PCR detection of the same rhinovirus strain beyond 30 days is uncommon in infants, suggesting that when symptoms persist, recurrence or a new infection is more likely than ongoing replication of a single strain; this supports counseling that persistent symptoms beyond a month warrant reassessment for complications or new infections rather than assuming a single prolonged URI [^6bc09c29].

> I should double-check how age modifies duration. Younger infants clear some respiratory viruses more slowly and have higher viral loads, which can prolong symptoms and increase transmission risk; this is particularly relevant for RSV, where infants under 6 months have the highest burden and longest shedding, reinforcing the need for conservative return-to-care thresholds in this age group [^0b1119ae] [^b94fa33a].

> Next, I should review what to expect day-by-day. Early in a viral URI, symptoms often escalate over the first 3–5 days, peak around days 3–6, and then gradually improve; fever, when present, typically resolves within 24–48 hours, and respiratory symptoms dominate thereafter, with most infants showing clear improvement by 7–10 days and the majority fully resolved by 2 weeks, though a lingering cough or nasal congestion can persist toward day 14–16 in some cases [^baf06bf8] [^928ff5c8].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist beyond two weeks or worsen after initial improvement. I need to ensure I flag red flags: persistent symptoms beyond about 14–16 days, new high fever after initial defervescence, respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, or signs of dehydration should prompt reassessment for complications such as acute otitis media, bacterial sinusitis, pneumonia, or asthma-like wheeze, especially in infants with higher risk profiles or frequent URIs [^baf06bf8] [^7a9a380e].

> Let me reconsider the practical counseling message. For a typical, well-appearing infant with a viral URI, I would advise that symptoms usually peak by days 3–5, improve noticeably by days 7–10, and resolve in most by 2 weeks; I should also explain that a residual cough or congestion can persist up to about 16 days in some children, and that RSV may last longer and behave more variably in infants, which sets expectations and reduces unnecessary reconsultations [^928ff5c8] [^b94fa33a].

> I should confirm limitations so we do not overgeneralize. The best estimates are from mixed-age pediatric cohorts rather than infant-only studies, and individual variation is substantial due to virus type, age, comorbidities, and environment; nonetheless, the 10–15 day window for most infant URIs is consistent with clinical experience and supported by high-quality systematic review data, with the caveat that RSV and very young infants may extend toward the upper end of that range [^928ff5c8] [^7a850fa8].

---

Viral URIs in infants typically last **7–10 days**, with most resolving within 2 weeks [^928ff5c8]. RSV and influenza may persist longer, often **10–14 days**, and cough can linger up to 3 weeks [^928ff5c8]. Younger infants and those with comorbidities may have **prolonged symptoms** and higher risk of complications [^b94fa33a] [^d8b77d57]. Supportive care is the mainstay, and antibiotics are not indicated unless bacterial complications are suspected [^5fae7d10] [^a278cecb].

---

## Typical duration of viral URI in infants

- **General duration**: Most viral URIs in infants last 7–10 days, with symptoms peaking around days 3–5 and gradually improving thereafter [^baf06bf8].

- **Range of duration**: The duration can vary from 5 to 14 days, depending on the virus involved, the infant's age, and underlying health conditions [^notfound].

- **Common cold**: Specifically, the common cold (often caused by rhinovirus) typically lasts 10–15 days in children, including infants [^928ff5c8].

---

## Factors influencing duration of viral URI in infants

Several factors can influence the **duration and severity** of viral URIs in infants:

| **Factor** | **Impact on duration** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger infants (especially < 6 months) may have longer-lasting symptoms due to immature immune systems [^4d2ddf90] |
| Virus type | RSV, influenza, and parainfluenza viruses tend to cause more severe and longer-lasting symptoms than rhinovirus or coronaviruses [^cac32a39] |
| Comorbidities | Prematurity, chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, and immunocompromised states can prolong illness and increase severity [^db3d5ce9] |
| Environmental factors | Exposure to tobacco smoke, daycare attendance, and crowded living conditions can exacerbate symptoms and prolong illness [^db3d5ce9] |

---

## Clinical course and symptoms

Viral URIs in infants typically follow a predictable **clinical course**:

- **Initial symptoms**: Nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and mild cough usually appear first [^4f41aa83].

- **Peak symptoms**: Symptoms often peak around days 3–5, with increased nasal congestion, cough, and irritability [^baf06bf8].

- **Resolution**: Most infants show significant improvement by day 7–10, with residual cough or nasal congestion lasting up to 2 weeks [^928ff5c8].

- **Complications**: Some infants may develop complications such as acute otitis media, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia, which can prolong illness and require medical intervention [^7a9a380e].

---

## Prolonged viral URI: when to be concerned

While most viral URIs resolve within 2 weeks, some infants may experience **prolonged symptoms**. Clinicians and caregivers should consider further evaluation if:

- **Symptoms persist beyond 14 days**: Persistent cough, nasal congestion, or fever beyond 2 weeks warrants reassessment for complications or alternative diagnoses [^baf06bf8].

- **Worsening symptoms**: Increasing severity of symptoms after initial improvement (e.g. "double sickening") may indicate secondary bacterial infection or complications [^baf06bf8].

- **Signs of complications**: Ear pain, difficulty breathing, chest retractions, lethargy, or poor feeding suggest complications requiring medical evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Management and supportive care

Management of viral URIs in infants is primarily supportive, focusing on symptom relief and monitoring for complications:

- **Hydration**: Ensure adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration [^notfound].

- **Nasal congestion**: Use saline drops and gentle suctioning to relieve nasal congestion, especially in infants under 6 months [^notfound].

- **Fever control**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen (if > 6 months) can be used for fever and discomfort, following pediatric dosing guidelines [^notfound].

- **Avoidance of irritants**: Minimize exposure to tobacco smoke and other environmental irritants [^notfound].

- **Antibiotics**: Not indicated unless bacterial complications are suspected, as they do not shorten the duration of viral URIs [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies can reduce the frequency and severity of viral URIs in infants:

- **Breastfeeding**: Provides passive immunity and reduces the risk and severity of respiratory infections [^5e979312].

- **Hand hygiene**: Regular handwashing reduces transmission of respiratory viruses [^notfound].

- **Vaccination**: Influenza vaccination in eligible infants and maternal RSV vaccination during pregnancy can reduce the burden of these infections [^cc4f305f] [^7cadc2b9].

- **Avoidance of sick contacts**: Limiting exposure to individuals with respiratory infections, especially in the first few months of life, is advisable [^notfound].

---

Viral URIs in infants typically last **7–10 days**, with most resolving within 2 weeks. Duration varies with age, virus type, and comorbidities, and supportive care remains the cornerstone of management. Persistent symptoms beyond 14 days or worsening clinical status should prompt further evaluation for complications.

### Viral genetic determinants of prolonged respiratory syncytial virus infection among infants in a healthy term birth cohort [^60f61bd8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Human Orthopneumovirus, formerly known (and still referred to) as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), results in significant global morbidity and mortality. By the age of 2 to 3 years, nearly all children have been infected with RSV at least once. RSV is a seasonal mucosal pathogen that primarily infects upper and lower respiratory tract epithelium, although it has been recovered from nonairway sources. While RSV is mainly associated with acute respiratory infection, many RNA viruses can establish prolonged or persistent infection in some infected individuals. Prolonged shedding of RSV, especially in young infants and following first infection, has been demonstrated, with longer average duration of viral shedding when polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to detect RSV. While younger age and first infection are associated with protracted infection, it is not known whether specific viral factors contribute to prolonged RSV infection in infants. This is important as prolonged infection may contribute to enhanced transmission and developmental changes to the early life airway epithelium. Furthermore, the reservoir of RSV infection is not understood, and it is possible that some RSV strains sustain a low level of ongoing viral circulation in the community until seasonal or other influences favor epidemic spread.

The objectives of this study were therefore to determine if there exist host or pathogen genetic risk alleles for RSV infection and to identify viral genetic variation associated with prolonged infection. These motivating questions are of fundamental interest in understanding viral and host genetic contributions that may underlie the development of chronic respiratory morbidity due to RSV, including asthma.

### Duration of rhinovirus shedding in the upper respiratory tract in the first year of life [^6bc09c29]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current molecular diagnostic methods have detected rhinovirus RNA in a high proportion of asymptomatic infants and children, raising the question of the clinical significance of these findings. This study investigates the prevalence of prolonged rhinovirus RNA presence in the upper respiratory tract of infants during the first year of life.

Methods

In a longitudinal study, infants were followed from birth up to 12 months. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected monthly (months 1–6 and month 9) and during an upper respiratory infection. Rhinoviruses were detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Presence of repeated rhinovirus RNA was evaluated by nucleotide sequence analysis.

Results

A total of 2153 specimens from 362 infants were studied; 341 distinct rhinovirus infections in 216 infants were identified. Follow-up specimens were available within 30 days for 179 infections, creating the sample set to assess prolonged rhinovirus presence. Of the 179 infections, 46 involved the detection of the same rhinovirus strain in repeated specimens, including 8 events of prolonged presence of the same strain (detected in specimens collected > 30 days apart), representing 4.5% of the evaluable rhinovirus infections. There were 26 events in which a rhinovirus strain was replaced by a different strain within a 30-day interval, representing 14.5% of the 179 infections.

Conclusions

Although rhinovirus infections are common in healthy infants, prolonged presence of rhinovirus RNA in the respiratory tract after an upper respiratory infection was uncommon (< 5%). Detection of rhinovirus RNA in an infant most likely represents an infection within a 30-day period.

Strengths and limitations

We believe this is the first systematic review of the duration of illness for common respiratory tract infections in children. Our strategy of including data from placebo arms of randomised controlled trials and from observational studies not only increases the available data but also provides more generalisable populations of children. This approach inevitably included children who might have been given over-the-counter treatments for symptoms and, in a few cases, antibiotics. We consider that it would be unrealistic to restrict our review to children with respiratory tract infections who were not given any symptomatic treatment. While symptomatic treatments might reduce symptom severity, however, they are unlikely to influence the overall duration of illness. It is possible that excluding studies of experimentally induced infection might have reduced eligible studies, though we do not consider that these types of usually single pathogen infections reflect the reality of clinical practice, where patients typically present with clinical syndromes rather than pathogen specific infections. In synthesising our results, we opted to present the number of days when 50% and 90% of children were reported to be asymptomatic. Although the data were not available for all the respiratory tract infections, we believe that this additional information avoids the ambiguity of terms such as "average duration" for parents and clinicians. Our estimates of duration also apply to children who are given (usually symptomatic) drugs rather than those given nothing at all, thereby providing more valuable information for how most children are managed in the community. As many trials and studies will have excluded children with severe symptoms, our findings might not be generalisable to such children or those in low or middle income countries where risks of complications are higher. While we included data from both randomised controlled trials and prospective observational studies, we excluded retrospective studies, which could be subject to recall or recording bias.

Data synthesis

We report data on duration of symptoms for each symptom category from each study. When possible (that is, at time points included in two or more studies) we calculated the pooled daily mean proportions and 95% confidence intervals for symptom duration and presented summary data visually. Given the heterogeneity in study populations and inconsistent methods of assessment, we have also presented the individual study data in addition to pooled means to display the variation in symptom durations. We identified the mean time point (as number of whole days) at which the symptom was resolved in 50% and in 90% of children with that particular symptom. Though we had planned to carry out subgroup analyses based on age and symptom duration before enrolment, we were unable to do so because of insufficient data.

RSV PATHOGENESIS

Infants and Young Children

As noted above, RSV disease in infants ranges from mild upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) to necrotizing bronchiolitis and pneumonia causing respiratory failure. We know surprisingly little about the timing and events occurring in early RSV infections of infants; most of our knowledge has been developed after studying infants who are already hospitalized with infection. Acute RSV bronchiolitis is characterized by extensive viral infection involving the ciliated respiratory epithelial cells, apoptotic sloughing of these cells into the alveolar and bronchial lumen, and recruitment of an accompanying cellular infiltration into the airway lumen, composed mainly of polymorphonuclear cells. Mononuclear cells can be identified as minority populations within these occluded airway lumens, but mucus and mucins contribute very little if at all to airway obstruction. Polymorphonuclear cells are also present on histologic examination, as noted below.

Analysis of inflammatory responses from infants with fatal RSVLRTI identified inadequate (rather than excessive) innate and RSV-specific cell-mediated (CD8 and CD4) immune responses, robust viral replication, and apoptotic crisis. In addition, naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms also implicate reduced innate immune responses as contributing to RSV disease severity. RSV replication persists for a surprisingly long time in infants (≥ 2–3 weeks) and significantly longer than for similarly aged patients with influenza.

Although controversial at first, correlations between viral load and disease severity have now been established by multiple investigators using various techniques including quantitative culture and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In RSV bronchiolitis, an excellent correlation exists between initial viral load in the upper and lower airways in intubated children (enabling access to lower respiratory tract secretions for testing), thus making nasal viral load a useful, though not completely parallel, surrogate marker for lower respiratory tract viral load. Viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tracts decline in parallel once peak viral load is achieved. Studies of nasal viral load in naturally infected infants have shown that higher viral load collected shortly after hospital admission correlates with clinically meaningful outcomes, including longer duration of hospitalization, higher risk of requiring intensive care, and higher risk of requiring mechanical ventilation. In a multiple logistic regression modeled study of RSV dynamics, a more rapid rate of RSV clearance also correlated with more rapid clinical improvement in infants. At this time, viral load remains the most important biomarker of RSV disease severity, but although it is an important factor in disease severity, other environmental or host factors are also significant.

Introduction

Respiratory tract infections are particularly common in children; most are self limiting and the risk of complications is small. Recommended management therefore typically involves self care and treatment of symptoms. Nevertheless, such infections still account for over a third of paediatric consultations to primary care in the United Kingdom and the United States, and antibiotics are commonly prescribed in many countries despite limited evidence of effectiveness.

One of the most common questions that parents ask when consulting healthcare services is "how long will my child's symptoms last?" Accurate information about the expected course of respiratory tract infections in children is essential for both clinicians and parents, as it sets expectations and lets them know when the illness is deviating from the expected. This directly informs parents' decisions to seek medical attention, whether to re-consult, and when to use delayed prescriptions of antibiotics, as well as clinicians' decisions on when to prescribe antibiotics or consider other treatments.

Commonly used estimates of the expected time course of symptoms of common respiratory tract infections are highly variable and not always evidence based. For example, the 2008 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for treatment of respiratory tract infections include estimates of average duration of the illness (before and after seeing a doctor) of four days for acute otitis media, one week for acute sore throat, one and a half weeks for the common cold, and three weeks for acute cough or bronchitis. By contrast, information for patients from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describe sore throat as lasting one to two weeks, common cold lasting up to two weeks, and cough duration ranging from two to eight weeks. The durations quoted in these sources reflect findings based on expert opinion or from individual studies rather than from data synthesis of multiple studies and are not child specific. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature on symptom durations of the most common respiratory tract infections (earache, sore throat, cough, and common cold) in children presenting to primary care.

### Viral bronchiolitis [^5fae7d10]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Viral bronchiolitis is a common clinical syndrome affecting infants and young children. Concern about its associated morbidity and cost has led to a large body of research that has been summarised in systematic reviews and integrated into clinical practice guidelines in several countries. The evidence and guideline recommendations consistently support a clinical diagnosis with the limited role for diagnostic testing for children presenting with the typical clinical syndrome of viral upper respiratory infection progressing to the lower respiratory tract. Management is largely supportive, focusing on maintaining oxygenation and hydration of the patient. Evidence suggests no benefit from bronchodilator or corticosteroid use in infants with a first episode of bronchiolitis. Evidence for other treatments such as hypertonic saline is evolving but not clearly defined yet. For infants with severe disease, the insufficient available data suggest a role for high-flow nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure use in a monitored setting to prevent respiratory failure.

### The temporal pattern and lifestyle associations of respiratory virus infection in a cohort study spanning the first two years of life [^53a870e6]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

There is a general perception that breastfeeding is protective against respiratory tract infections. However, there is less robust evidence in the literature regarding a protective effect of breastfeeding on respiratory infection compared to gastrointestinal infection. The relationship is more complex particularly in a high-income setting, potentially dependent on a longer period of breastfeeding and modulated by other factors such as the extent of exposure to viral infections (for example through childcare or living with siblings), and the overall effect of breastfeeding is modest. In our cohort breastfeeding did not appear protective against either acquiring a respiratory viral infection or whether there were respiratory symptoms with this although we acknowledge we lacked power to refute an association, our study was not designed to look specifically at this association and our sampling moments were relatively infrequent. It may be that breastfeeding is protective against the development of more severe illness from respiratory viral infection for example lower respiratory tract infection rather than upper respiratory tract infection or asymptomatic infection. In a similarly sized study to ours, Alexandrino et al. found a relationship between breastfeeding duration and lower respiratory tract infection but not with upper respiratory infection. Wang et al. evaluated the association between breastfeeding and respiratory symptoms in a larger number of children in the community in the UK, and found limited evidence of a protective role of breastfeeding on respiratory infections in the first two years of life. Whilst this study did not include swabbing to detect respiratory viruses, their overall conclusion supports our findings. In another study, assessing respiratory viral detection in patients admitted with respiratory viral infection, exclusive breastfeeding at the time of symptoms onset was positively associated with respiratory viral infection, whereas longer breastfeeding duration was protective. The authors speculated this was secondary to breastfed infants having increased contact time with their mother and were more at risk of mother to infant respiratory virus transmission.

### Comparison of symptom duration between children with SARS-CoV-2 and peers with other viral illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic [^e32709ae]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can lead to severe symptoms. However, most children and young people (CYP) with SARS-CoV-2 experience asymptomatic disease or mild symptoms. Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may also be at risk of prolonged aftereffects, commonly referred to as "long COVID". Long COVID is defined by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as

signs, symptoms, and conditions that continue or develop after initial COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection. The signs, symptoms, and conditions are present four weeks or more after the initial phase of infection; may be multisystemic; and may present with a relapsing-remitting pattern and progression or worsening over time, with the possibility of severe and life-threatening events even months or years after infection.

The etiology of long COVID is poorly understood, particularly among CYP.

Several comprehensive systematic reviews have helped to define the current state of knowledge regarding long COVID in CYP. - The prevalence of long COVID varies widely across studies (4%-66%). Headache, fatigue, sleep difficulties, myalgias, and persistent upper respiratory symptoms comprise the most commonly reported long COVID symptoms. Persistent COVID symptoms may be more common among older children, females, and those with baseline physical and mental health conditions. - The severity of initial SARS-CoV-2 symptoms may also impact the risk of long COVID, with hospitalized CYP reporting more persistent symptoms.

Several critical limitations have prevented a clear understanding of the epidemiology of pediatric long COVID. These limitations include selection bias, misclassification bias, recall bias, and nonresponse bias. One of the most important limitations has been a lack of appropriate controls. Many studies of long COVID in CYP have included no control group or a seronegative control group that includes peers with no symptoms of upper respiratory infection (URI). - Comparing the duration of symptoms between CYP with SARS-CoV-2 infection and CYP infected with non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses could enhance our understanding of long COVID, while controlling for pandemic-related effects. This may be particularly important in outpatient settings, where anticipatory guidance regarding symptom duration and management can have beneficial impacts on clinical outcomes.

### Viral respiratory infections in very low birthweight infants at neonatal intensive care unit: prospective observational study [^2689fe41]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) are very common in childhood representing between 65% to 80% of hospital admissions, during the first 2 years of life. Many of these viruses colonise the nasopharynx without symptomsor may be associated with mild upper respiratory infections. In addition to the classical viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and rhinovirus (hRV), other species like metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus (CoV) or bocavirus (hBoV) are relevant agents causing VRI and associated morbidity, mainly in susceptible infants.

Very low birthweight (VLBW) infants are highly vulnerable to respiratory infections. However, there is a real gap of knowledge about the role of VRI in the preterm infant during neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. First, the prevalence is unknown because in the clinical suspicion of infection routine, virus search is not included, and this search is limited to RSVignoring the role of other viruses. VLBW infants usually do not develop classical signs of cold. Instead, they present with non-specific clinical features like apnoeas, need for increased respiratory support or feeding difficulties. In other words, clinical signs that mirror bacterial infection in these patients. This is the reason for the widespread use of antibiotics when facing these clinical courses which potentially lead to microbial resistance. On the other hand, failure to identify these VRIs carries the risk of transmission to other infants with the appearance of outbreaks.

Second, VRI may potentially worsen the clinical course in a given infant. VRIs associate inflammatory mechanism that, together with the effect of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy-derived lung damage, could be determinants in the progression towards chronic lung disease. In fact, Gagneurreported increased respiratory support and oxygen supply for longer periods in neonates and older infants with CoV respiratory infections. Bennettfound a 52% prevalence of VRI among infants below 33 weeks of gestation. Hospital stay, mechanical ventilation and duration of oxygen therapy were longer, and the prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was higher in positive infants. González-Carrasco, in a cohort of preterm and term newborns, found a 22% prevalence of VRI, the infants below 32 weeks being particularly vulnerable.

Finally, the relevance of the asymptomatic carriers might be crucial. Spreading time of respiratory viruses could last for several weeks, specially in infants.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years… [^baf06bf8]. publications.aap.org (2013). Low credibility.

Fever, when present in uncomplicated viral URI, tends to occur early in the illness, often in concert with other constitutional symptoms such as headache and myalgias. Typically, the fever and constitutional symptoms disappear in the first 24 to 48 hours, and the respiratory symptoms become more prominent. Close modal. The course of most uncomplicated viral URIs is 5 to 7 days. 9, – 12 As shown in Fig 2, respiratory symptoms usually peak in severity by days 3 to 6 and then begin to improve; however, resolving symptoms and signs may persist in some patients after day 10. 9,
10. Symptoms of acute bacterial sinusitis and uncomplicated viral URI overlap considerably, and therefore it is their persistence without improvement that suggests a diagnosis of acute sinusitis. Only a minority of children presenting with symptoms of URI will meet criteria for persistence.

3, 4, 11 As a result, before diagnosing acute bacterial sinusitis, it is important for the practitioner to attempt to differentiate between sequential episodes of uncomplicated viral URI from the onset of acute bacterial sinusitis with persistent symptoms and establish whether the symptoms are clearly not improving. A worsening course of signs and symptoms, termed "double sickening, " in the context of a viral URI is another presentation of acute bacterial sinusitis. 13, 17 Affected children experience substantial and acute worsening of respiratory symptoms or a new fever, often on the sixth or seventh day of illness, after initial signs of recovery from an uncomplicated viral URI.

Support for this definition comes from studies in children and adults, for whom antibiotic treatment of worsening symptoms after a period of apparent improvement was associated with better outcomes.
4. 9, 13, 18 Generally, the constitutional symptoms resolve in the first 48 hours and then the respiratory symptoms become prominent. In most uncomplicated viral infections, including influenza, purulent nasal discharge does not appear for several days. Accordingly, it is the concurrent presentation of high fever and purulent nasal discharge for the first 3 to 4 days of an acute URI that helps to define the severe onset of acute bacterial sinusitis. 13, 16, 18 This presentation in children is the corollary to acute onset of headache, fever, and facial pain in adults with acute sinusitis.

### Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review [^e7e61012]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Selection

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they recruited otherwise healthy children (birth to 18 years) with acute respiratory infections presenting to primary care or emergency department settings; were conducted in high income countries, as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; provided data on time to resolution of symptoms or complete duration of symptoms; involved placebo or no treatment arms of controlled non-surgical treatment trials or prospective observational studies; and reported in English. Although respiratory tract infections can include a cluster of various symptoms, certain symptoms (such as cough) predominate in clinical experience and in published trials, depending on a child's illness, ability to describe his or her symptoms, and/or parental recognition and interpretation of symptoms. Given this, we chose to not only include studies of children presenting with clustered symptoms (such as common cold or undifferentiated respiratory tract infections) but also those of individual symptoms (such as sore throat). We included studies of children presenting with primary complaints of earache (acute otitis media), sore throat (or pharyngitis or tonsillitis), cough (or acute bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or croup), and common cold (or upper respiratory tract infection).

We excluded studies of children with chronic, recurrent, or complicated infections; experimentally induced infection; or medical conditions associated with a high risk of serious infections (such as cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency). We also excluded studies conducted in inpatient settings or in low or middle income countries as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where the risk of complications from infection might be higher. Studies that reported data on both children and adults were included only if data were presented separately by age. We excluded trials comparing two active treatments, those of prophylactic or adjuvant treatments, and retrospective studies; studies with follow-up of 24 hours or less; and studies that presented symptom duration only before consultation, assessed only incidence or prevalence, or presented duration of symptoms by symptom score or individual pathogen.

Discussion

Our review provides parents, clinicians, and policy makers with up-to-date evidence based estimates of the expected length of symptoms for children presenting with the most common respiratory tract infections in primary care and emergency department settings in high income countries: earache, sore throat, cough, and non-specific cold symptoms. These infections were selected because they are common and drive most primary care consultations and antibiotic prescribing for children in high income countries. We used data from systematic searches for both randomised controlled trials (placebo arms) and observational studies conducted in high income countries. For many symptoms of respiratory tract infection the data were highly heterogeneous in terms of age, definition of infection, outcome assessment, and duration of illness before study entry; however, our data provide the most robust estimates available.

For some symptoms of respiratory tract infections our estimates of duration are much longer than those currently used (table 8). For example, for earache (otitis media) we found that 90% of children are better by seven to eight days, which is considerably longer than the average duration of four days cited by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and two days cited by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In contrast, for some symptoms current estimates seem to overestimate the expected duration. We found that acute cough symptoms are better in 50% of children by 10 days, in contrast with the longer average duration of 21 days cited by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Finally, for other symptoms, the currently cited estimates of symptom duration match closely (or are slightly longer) with our finding — for example, for sore throat/tonsillitis we found that 90% are better by two to seven days, whereas National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cite average durations of seven days and seven to 14 days, respectively. Similarly, the common cold seems to last from 10 (50% better) to 15 days (90% better), similar to advice from both National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (10–11 days) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (< 14 days).

### Viral respiratory infections in very low birthweight infants at neonatal intensive care unit: prospective observational study [^8a873a00]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Shedding of respiratory viruses is long, ranging from 1 week to 6 weeks. Transmission of respiratory viruses is described as high, either by direct contact or the aerosol route. There is transfer of virus from surfaces to hands during routine activities. Therefore, a high index of suspicion and systematic surveillance is needed to avoid epidemic outbreaks in neonatal units. In our study population, 54% of positive infants were asymptomatic and among the babies who showed any abnormal clinical sign, less than 40% presented with the classical features of cold. Other studies also remark that atypical, non-upper respiratory tract viral infection signs, such as increased number of desaturation episodes, apnoea, tachypnoea or respiratory stalemate, are more frequently shown in the positive preterm infants.

It is noteworthy that almost a third of infants had the first presumption diagnosis of bacterial sepsis so that antibiotics were prescribed. Failure to think about these VRIs has the immediate consequence of unnecessary antibiotic use and prolonged antibiotic treatment duration. Gagneurdescribed up to 85% antibiotic prescription in infants with documented VRI compared with those who were not infected. In addition, duration of antibiotic treatment was also significantly longer. Recent studies which searched for a viral aetiology in infants with clinical suspicion of late-onset bacterial sepsis have shown a prevalence of positive viral tests close to 10%.

VRIs associated with higher rates of morbidity. Infants with VRI had more need of supplementary oxygen, reached full enteral nutrition later and, consequently, had longer length of hospital stay, features already described. It is relevant to note that BPD was shown as an independent risk factor for viral infection in the Cox regression analysis, after adjusting by gestational age and birth weight. Infants with BPD had a fourfold increased risk of VRI, indicating a greater susceptibility to infection in these patients. This finding has only been previously described by Bennett.BPD is closely associated with antenatal inflammation, oxygen toxicity and ventilator-induced trauma. Babies with BPD also have a longer hospital stay and more antibiotic prescription, potentially affecting the establishment-promoting microbiota on respiratory mucosa. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines which modulate human airway epithelial responses to VRI have been shown in infants with BPD. All these factors may alter the immune system that, in addition to the genetic predisposition, could explain the increased susceptibility to VRIs in infants with BPD.

### Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review [^3a0c07ec]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

As with any systematic review, our findings and complexity of synthesis are limited by the number and quality of included studies and the data these provided. The included studies were inevitably clinically heterogeneous in many aspects. The definition of the respiratory tract infection syndromes differed (or were poorly defined) in some studies, which could affect less discrete conditions (such as the common cold) more than others (such as croup); though this is a problem with much research in this area. Secondly, the duration of illness before study entry varied and was not consistently recorded, which prevented us from calculating what would have been potentially more useful for parents — namely, the duration of illness from initial onset rather than presentation. However, this mirrors the situation in primary care where patients present in exactly this way. Thirdly, the lack of sufficient data on age in included studies meant that we were not able to conduct age specific analyses. For some infections, however, the age ranges of children in included studies were relatively narrow (such as for bronchiolitis and croup) as would be predicted clinically, so subgroup analysis might not have contributed much to their interpretation. For other infections, such as sore throat or cough, the age ranges were much broader and subgroup analysis based on age would have been useful clinically. Fourthly, the methods used in individual studies to measure and report symptoms were highly variable, and the absence of consistent (daily) reporting for similar durations of follow-up for each respiratory tract infection meant that we were not able to pool data for all infections studied. When possible, we attempted to pool results by calculating mean proportions and 95% confidence intervals, but this does not take account of the lack of homogeneity between studies. We attempted to mitigate this by including the individual study data in all our figures to give some idea of the variability in symptom projection. Thus, pooled means need to be interpreted cautiously.

### Respiratory viruses and children [^de328a38]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Respiratory viruses place a great disease burden especially on the youngest children in terms of high rates of infection, bacterial complications and hospitalizations. In developing countries, some viral infections are even associated with substantial mortality in children. The interaction between viruses and bacteria is probably much more common and clinically significant than previously understood. Respiratory viruses frequently initiate the cascade of events that ultimately leads to bacterial infection. Effective antiviral agents can substantially shorten the duration of the viral illness and prevent the development of bacterial complications. Viral vaccines have the potential to not only prevent the viral infection but also decrease the incidence of bacterial complications. At present, antivirals and vaccines are only available against influenza viruses, but new vaccines and antivirals against other viruses, especially for RSV, are being developed.

### SHEA NICU white paper series: practical approaches for the prevention of viral respiratory infections [^a72312de]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) viral respiratory infection (VRI) isolation duration — If respiratory signs were present at the time of VRI diagnosis, precautions should be continued for at least the duration of illness. In the context of an ongoing exposure concern and in the absence of respiratory signs, healthcare personnel (HCP) may consider repeat molecular testing and additional precautions until repeated testing is negative, and precautions may be discontinued if clinical signs are attributable to a noninfectious etiology and respiratory viral testing is negative. The duration of isolation following asymptomatic detection of respiratory viral pathogens is unclear, and testing of asymptomatic infants should be discouraged outside the outbreak setting. For influenza, isolation precautions are recommended for 7 days after illness onset or until 24 hours after the resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms, whichever is longer.

### Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review [^928ff5c8]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the expected duration of symptoms of common respiratory tract infections in children in primary and emergency care.

Design

Systematic review of existing literature to determine durations of symptoms of earache, sore throat, cough (including acute cough, bronchiolitis, and croup), and common cold in children.

Data Sources

PubMed, DARE, and CINAHL (all to July 2012).

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials or observational studies of children with acute respiratory tract infections in primary care or emergency settings in high income countries who received either a control treatment or a placebo or over-the-counter treatment. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias framework for randomised controlled trials, and the critical appraisal skills programme framework for observational studies.

Main Outcome Measures

Individual study data and, when possible, pooled daily mean proportions and 95% confidence intervals for symptom duration. Symptom duration (in days) at which each symptom had resolved in 50% and 90% of children.

Results

Of 22,182 identified references, 23 trials and 25 observational studies met inclusion criteria. Study populations varied in age and duration of symptoms before study onset. In 90% of children, earache was resolved by seven to eight days, sore throat between two and seven days, croup by two days, bronchiolitis by 21 days, acute cough by 25 days, common cold by 15 days, and non-specific respiratory tract infections symptoms by 16 days.

Conclusions

The durations of earache and common colds are considerably longer than current guidance given to parents in the United Kingdom and the United States; for other symptoms such as sore throat, acute cough, bronchiolitis, and croup the current guidance is consistent with our findings. Updating current guidelines with new evidence will help support parents and clinicians in evidence based decision making for children with respiratory tract infections.

### Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review [^ad0c6338]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction

Two authors (TAV and MT) independently extracted data using a predetermined template. Authors were not blinded to any aspect of the studies during extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus (TAV, MT, and DIB/CH). We extracted data on country and setting of study; population; length of follow-up; description of presenting symptom(s) and/or diagnostic criteria; description of intervention and control; definition of usual care in placebo arms of trials; specified outcome(s); outcome assessor (parent, child, clinician, or investigator); method of outcome assessment; and data on adverse events (complications, re-consultations, admission to hospital).

The outcomes of interest were time to resolution of symptoms or duration of symptoms. These included time taken for prespecified proportions (such as 50%) of children's symptoms to have resolved, the study population, proportion of children with unresolved symptoms at follow-up, or mean or median duration of symptoms. For studies of common cold or undefined/non-specific respiratory tract infections, we extracted data on symptom duration for the cluster of symptoms comprising a cold as defined in each study (reported in appendix 2). We extracted data from studies that reported proportions of children with symptoms at time points, provided continuous data from which proportions could be inferred, or presented mean (and 95% confidence interval) durations of symptoms. When available we also extracted data on symptom duration before consultation. We extracted data only from the non-intervention (that is, placebo) arms of included randomised controlled trials. Data from line graphs were extracted with DigitizeIt software (DigitizeIt 2010, version 4.0.2, Carrascal).

Quality assessment

Two authors (TAV and MT) independently assessed quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias framework for randomised controlled trialsand the critical appraisal skills programmeframework for observational studies. Disagreements were resolved by consensus (TAV, MT, and DIB/CH). Judgment regarding risk of bias ("high", "low", or "unclear risk of bias") was made for each criterion.

### Primary and repeated respiratory viral infections among infants in rural Nepal [^d1f98aa7]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Respiratory disease severity and duration were not significantly different between the first and second episodes for any of the respiratory viruses (Figure 2A and Table 4). The mean severity score for all first infections was 1.6, and the mean score for all second infections was 1.6. The mean duration of illness for all first infections was 7.3 days, and the mean duration for all second infections was 9.6 days. All repeatedly infected infants with severe disease (n = 32) were found to have HRV in the first, second, or both episodes. In addition, all repeatedly infected infants who had symptomatic illness for more than 50 days (n = 10) were infected with HRV. However, a coinfection with a different respiratory viral pathogen was detected during the first episode in 4 of these infants and during the second episode in another 4 infants. Because HRV was the most common etiology of repeated infections by the same virus, we examined the severity and duration of the paired first and second episodes for each infant with HRV (Figure 2B and C). More than half (51%) of the infants with repeated HRV infections experienced the same disease severity in both episodes.

### SARS-CoV-2 detection, viral load and infectivity over the course of an infection [^3bfcdd50]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To summarise the evidence on the detection pattern and viral load of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of an infection (including any asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic phase), and the duration of infectivity.

Methods

A systematic literature search was undertaken in PubMed, Europe PubMed Central and EMBASE from 30 December 2019 to 12 May 2020.

Results

We identified 113 studies conducted in 17 countries. The evidence from upper respiratory tract samples suggests that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaks around symptom onset or a few days thereafter, and becomes undetectable about two weeks after symptom onset; however, viral loads from sputum samples may be higher, peak later and persist for longer. There is evidence of prolonged virus detection in stool samples, with unclear clinical significance. No study was found that definitively measured the duration of infectivity; however, patients may not be infectious for the entire duration of virus detection, as the presence of viral ribonucleic acid may not represent transmissible live virus.

Conclusion

There is a relatively consistent trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 viral load over the course of COVID-19 from respiratory tract samples, however the duration of infectivity remains uncertain.

### Bronchiolitis needs a revisit: distinguishing between virus entities and their treatments [^391125b4]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

3 CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Acute bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis that requires epidemiological and virological data. In infants, few days of runny nose, fever, and cough typically precede the signs of lower respiratory distress (nasal flaring, tachypnea, and subcostal recessions) (Figure 2). 1, 2 In such a case, respiratory crackles are suggestive of RVS etiology, whereas bilateral wheezing is suggestive of RV etiology. 16 A plethora of other respiratory sounds can also be heard.

Figure 2
Signs of bronchiolitis. The classic clinical presentation of bronchiolitis starts with symptoms of viral upper respiratory infection. Lower respiratory tract symptoms including persistent cough, tachypnea, and increased work of breathing (as shown by intercostal retractions, use of accessory muscles, grunting, or nasal flaring) later follow. The latter symptoms may progress to severe hypoxemia and cyanosis. respiratory syncytial virus;, rhinovirus

Most infants with bronchiolitis present a mild clinical form that usually resolves in 1‐2 weeks and can be safely managed at home by well‐instructed parents. Adequate information concerning the signs of deterioration (including low oxygen saturations) and the need for urgent transfer to hospital is of critical importance.

It is still not clear whether the type of virus detected in the nasopharynx could determine the degree of severity of the infection. Most often RSV infection has been linked to more severe "non‐wheezy" bronchiolitis, need for possible intensive care unit admission, and prolonged duration of stay. 17, 18 However, in 2002, a Greek case‐control study showed that RV detected in the upper airways could be strongly associated with episodes of increased severity. 19 Other viruses have been less often linked to severe illness.

### Clinical characteristics and illness course based on pathogen among children with respiratory illness presenting to an emergency department [^cac32a39]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Upper respiratory illnesses due to viruses are the most common reason for pediatric emergency department (ED) visits in the United States. We explored the clinical characteristics, hospitalization risk, and symptom duration of children in an ED setting by respiratory pathogen including coinfections. A retrospective analysis was conducted from a randomized controlled trial evaluating a rapid molecular pathogen panel among 931 children 1 month to 18 years of age with acute respiratory illness. We assessed hospitalization risk by pathogen using multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance. Symptom duration was assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Among 931 children, 702 (75%) were aged 0–5 years and 797 (85%) tested positive for a respiratory pathogen. Children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/EV) had higher hospitalization risk compared with influenza (adjusted risk ratio [aRR]: 2.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17–7.45; 3.56, 95% CI: 1.05–12.02; aRR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.05–6.35, respectively). Children with RSV, parainfluenza and atypical bacterial pathogens had longer illness duration compared with influenza (adjusted hazards ratio [aHR]: 2.16 95% CI: 1.41–3.29; aHR: 1.67, 95% CI:1.06–2.64; aHR: 2.60 95% CI: 1.30–5.19, respectively). Children with RSV, hMPV, and atypical bacterial pathogens had higher illness severity and duration compared with other respiratory pathogens. Coinfection was not associated with increased illness severity.

Neonatal intensive care unit viral respiratory infections — incubation and isolation precautions are outlined as follows: adenovirus has an incubation of 2–14 with droplet and contact precautions; non-SARS-CoV-2 human coronaviruses 2–5 with droplet and contact; enterovirus 3–6 with droplet and contact; human metapneumovirus 3–7 with contact; influenza 1–4 with droplet; parainfluenza 2–6 with contact; respiratory syncytial virus 2–8 with contact; and rhinovirus 2–3 with droplet and contact. For all the respiratory viruses noted above, the minimum duration of isolation is the duration of illness, and young infants may shed viruses longer than older children and adults, and a more prolonged duration of isolation precautions may be indicated.

### Primary and repeated respiratory viral infections among infants in rural Nepal [^e1ba2817]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Respiratory viruses cause significant morbidity and death in infants; 99% of such deaths occur in resource-limited settings. Risk factors for initial and repeated respiratory viral infections in young infants in resource-limited settings have not been well described.

Methods

From 2011 to 2014, a birth cohort of infants in rural Nepal was enrolled and followed with weekly household-based active surveillance for respiratory symptoms until 6 months of age. Respiratory illness was defined as having any of the following: fever, cough, wheeze, difficulty breathing, and/or a draining ear. We tested nasal swabs of infants with respiratory illness for multiple respiratory viruses by using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The risk of primary and repeated infections with the same virus was evaluated using Poisson regression.

Results

Of 3528 infants, 1726 (49%) had a primary infection, and 419 (12%) had a repeated infection. The incidences of respiratory viral infection in infants were 1816 per 1000 person-years for primary infections and 1204 per 1000 person-years for repeated infection with the same virus. Exposure to other children and male sex were each associated with an increased risk for primary infection (risk ratios, 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06–1.20] and 1.14 [95% CI, 1.02–1.27], respectively), whereas higher maternal education was associated with a decreased risk for both primary and repeated infections (risk ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.95–0.98]). The incidence of subsequent infection did not change when previous infection with the same or another respiratory virus occurred. Illness duration and severity were not significantly different in the infants between the first and second episodes for any respiratory virus tested.

Conclusions

In infants in rural Nepal, repeated respiratory virus infections were frequent, and we found no decrease in illness severity with repeated infections and no evidence of replacement with another virus. Vaccine strategies and public health interventions that provide durable protection in the first 6 months of life could decrease the burden of repeated infections by multiple respiratory viruses, particularly in low-resource countries.

### Palivizumab prophylaxis in infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus infection [^7edbbcd3]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

RSV seasonality in the United States — timing and recent disruptions: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemiology was altered by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, with decreased cases in the traditional fall and winter seasons beginning in 2020 and substantial circulation during the spring, summer, and fall of 2021 and 2022; it is unknown if or when the typical seasonality will return. From July 2014 through July 2017, the median time for RSV onset was mid-October with the season lasting 31 weeks until early May, and the median national peak occurred in early February, with onsets for 2014 to 2017 approximately 2 weeks earlier than 2012 to 2014.

### Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review [^02421b28]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Search

We identified relevant intervention trials and observational studies using two search strategies (appendix 1). Firstly, we conducted searches in PubMed, DARE, and CINAHL (all databases searched through July 2012) to identify randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews of trials for each of the four symptoms of respiratory tract infection (sore throat, cough, common cold, and earache). Search terms included clinical syndromes and symptoms, study design, and paediatric population with both MeSH and free text terms. We also hand searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections and Ear, Nose and Throat Groups for systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials. Secondly, we searched PubMed (1966-July 2012) for observational studies of children with acute sore throat, cough, common cold, or earache using terms for clinical syndromes and symptoms, child, and limited by publication type (that is, excluding clinical trials and systematic reviews of clinical trials). We reviewed reference lists of selected studies identified using both of these strategies and searched related citations to identify additional references. One author (TAV) screened titles and abstracts using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two authors (TAV and MT) reviewed the full text of all potentially relevant studies to determine final inclusion.

### Comparison of symptom duration between children with SARS-CoV-2 and peers with other viral illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic [^b7f50155]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Data Collection

Data were collected via electronic survey, administered by trained research staff at the time of enrollment to prevent dropouts and eliminate nonresponse bias. Survey questions were adapted, in part, from the Household Pulse Survey, developed by the National Center for Health Statistics. On average, families completed the survey 4 (± 3) months after the diagnosis. The primary research outcome was duration of any symptom related to URI. The following symptoms were assessed for presence/absence and duration (in days): cough, runny nose, sore throat, rash, diarrhea, vomiting, sore muscles, fatigue, fever, and loss of smell. These symptoms were selected based on studies of common SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in children. Subjective, unobservable symptoms (ie, headache, loss of taste, dyspnea) were not included because they are difficult to accurately assess in infants and young children. Persistent symptoms (defined as any symptom lasting for ≥ 3 weeks) were also compared between groups. This definition was chosen based on the observation that few (7/372, 1.8%) CYP in the study met the criteria for the traditional definition of "long COVID" (symptoms lasting for > 4 weeks) and because anticipatory guidance regarding URIs typically involves resolution of symptoms within 3 weeks. Families self-reported the following medical and demographic information: CYP age, sex, race, ethnicity, asthma history, mental health history (including anxiety or depression), health insurance status, parent/guardian education, marital status, household income, and household size. Body mass index data were extracted from the electronic medical record.

### Etiology of acute respiratory infections in infants: a prospective birth cohort study [^12cccda9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There is paucity of studies on etiology of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in infants. The objective of this study is to document incidence and etiology of ARI in infants, their seasonal variability and association of clinical profile with etiology.

Methods

A birth cohort was followed for the first year of life; for each episode of ARI, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected to identify the causative respiratory virus(es) using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. For lower respiratory tract infections blood culture, serum procalcitonin, serum antibodies to Mycoplasma and Chlamydia and urinary Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen were also assayed.

Results

A total of 503 ARI episodes were documented in 310 infants for an incidence rate of 1.8 episodes per infant per year. Of these, samples were processed in 395 episodes (upper respiratory tract infection: 377; lower respiratory tract infection: 18). One or more viruses were detected in 250 (63.3%) episodes and viral coinfections in 72 (18.2%) episodes. Rhinovirus was the most common virus [105 (42%)] followed by respiratory syncytial virus [50 (20%)], parainfluenza virus [42 (16.8%)] and coronavirus [44 (17.6%)]. In lower respiratory tract infections, viral infections were detected in 12 (66.7%) episodes, bacterial infections in 17 (94.4%) episodes and mixed bacterial-viral infections in 8 (44.4%) episodes. Peak incidence of viruses was observed during February-March and September-November. There was no significant difference in symptom duration with virus types.

Conclusion

In this cohort of infants, ARI incidence was 1.8 episodes per year per infant; 95% were upper respiratory tract infections. Viruses were identified in 63.3% episodes, and the most common viruses detected were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus.

Upper respiratory tract infections in at-risk patients

Besides children and older adults, pregnant women, people with chronic medical conditions (such as chronic cardiac, renal, pulmonary, metabolic, liver, neurodevelopmental or hematologic diseases), and those with immunosuppressive conditions (such as HIV, malignancy or receiving chemotherapy/steroids) are also more susceptible to developing a more serious URTI or having an increased number of associated complications (for the possible effects of viral infections on patients with impaired immunity, see Fig. 2). These at-risk groups are briefly reviewed in turn.

Fig. 2
Evolution of viral URTIs.

Patients with a pre-existing metabolic and cardiovascular disease, specifically hypertension and coronary heart disease, are at a higher risk of developing severe and fatal upper and lower viral respiratory tract diseases. Diabetic patients are up to a 50% more likely to suffer fatal outcomes from upper and lower viral respiratory tract diseases than those without diabetes.

Healthcare workers also have a high risk of contracting influenza virus infections as they are constantly exposed to patients, which can further spread to particularly vulnerable individuals.

Excess weight is another risk factor for RTIs. Epidemiological studies have shown evidence that being overweight and obese is not only associated with a higher prevalence of RTIs but also longer disease duration and higher mortality rates –. Both upper and lower respiratory tract infections are more prevalent among obese subjects and weight gain appears to increase the risk of RTIs.

The alteration of the immune system may explain these increased rates of RTIs associated with excess weight. Obesity has been shown to have considerable effects on the immune system, possibly due to the structural and functional similarities between adipocytes and immune system cells, which can both produce mediators such as chemokines, cytokines, and adipokines. 'Low-grade inflammation' can arise when excess adipose tissue is assimilated into a state of chronic inflammation, causing cell necrosis and dysfunction locally on the adipose tissue itself and altering the immune response at a systemic level.

### SHEA NICU white paper series: practical approaches for the prevention of viral respiratory infections [^4892cba0]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Viral respiratory infections in the neonatal intensive care unit — burden, transmission, and scope — are characterized by variable incidence ranging from 1% to 8% in retrospective analyses of symptomatic patients, and prospective surveillance has identified unrecognized VRI in > 50% of infants at some point during their birth hospitalization. Infants may be infected from infected staff or visitors through the air or via contact with contaminated hands or shared patient equipment. It is important for healthcare personnel (HCP) to consider healthcare-associated VRI (HA-VRI) for infants who develop signs of infection during their hospitalization and investigate for a source and/or lapse in infection prevention practices. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic or mild upper-respiratory-tract illness to viral pneumonia, bronchiolitis, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, sepsis-like syndrome, and rarely, meningitis or encephalitis. Terminology and scope are specified: the term "infants" is used instead of "neonates" because patients in the NICU may be beyond 28 days of age, and pandemic-related measures are outside the scope of the document.

### Impact of breastfeeding on the incidence and severity of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated acute lower respiratory infections in infants: a systematic review highlighting the global relevance of primary prevention [^5e979312]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Breastfeeding strengthens infants' immune system, offering protection against serious childhood infections.WHO and UNICEF recommend breastfeeding to be initiated within the first hour of birth and to continue exclusively for the first 6 months. Afterwards solids may be offered while continuing breastfeeding for up to 2 years and beyond. Mothers own milk (MOM) is a source of several bioactive components, such as leukocytes, cytokines, and growth factors. Breastfeeding provides passive immunity during neonatal period by influencing the development of infant microbiome, immune system metabolites and modulators such as IgA antibodies.

Viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) including bronchiolitis is the leading cause of respiratory illness among infants and young children worldwide. Risk factors recognised for serious disease are prematurity, low income, presence of school-age siblings, passive cigarette smoke exposure, lack of breastfeeding and early introduction of infants to crèche or childcare. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of acute LRTI among infants and young children globally, contributing to over 50% of hospital admissions, with the highest incidence in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Currently, no effective vaccine is available against childhood RSV infections. Millions of infants and young children are hospitalised annually with RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), clinically manifesting mainly as bronchiolitis and pneumonia, resulting in high morbidity and mortality and posing considerable burden on healthcare systems worldwide. The onset, duration and severity of RSV epidemics vary among countries, often linked to seasonality, peaking in winter months. Modelling studies estimated that globally in 2019, 33.0 million episodes of RSV-ALRI occured. Furthermore, 3.6 million RSV-ALRI episodes, 1.4 million hospital admissions and 45 700 in-hospital deaths occurred in children under the age of 5 from RSV. Hospitalisation rates, duration of supplemental oxygen therapy and use of mechanical ventilation among infants increase as age declines, with highest incidence in the first few months of life.

### Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review [^a3b12d20]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Sore throat

We included six trials on 241 childrenand one observational study of 103 infants. Most trials took place in North America, with the remainder from the UK, Italy, and the Netherlands. The single observational study was conducted in Poland.

Characteristics of patients varied across studies (appendix 2). Average duration of illness before entry into the study ranged from less than one to less than four days. Outcomes were assessed by parents in all studies, clinicians in two studies, and children in three studies, with length of follow-up ranging from two days to a week or, in two studies, until symptoms resolved. Most studies had a low risk of bias, except one in which blinding of outcome assessors was impossible because of the mode of intervention delivery (intramuscular penicillin v oral placebo)(appendix 3). Measurement of outcomes varied considerably across studies, involving different methods, assessors, and lengths of follow-up. Outcome measurement was based on standardised scales in only two studies; the remainderused parental assessment (by questionnaire, symptom diary, or overall parental assessment), or clinician assessment.

Among the four studies that reported mean duration, symptoms of sore throat lasted from two days to 6.7 days(table 3). Though we could not pool data from the three studies that reported the proportion of children with symptoms because of insufficient data at several time points, 33–37% of children still had sore throat symptoms at day three(fig 4, table 3). Based on visual inspection of the data, time to complete resolution did not seem to be related to group A β haemolytic streptococcal infection or duration of symptoms before enrolment. The single study that reported on duration of fever reported that 17% of children had fever for less than a day, 11% had fever one to two days, 44% had fever for two to three days, and 28% had fever for more than three days.

### Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review [^7b4fc58c]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Among the four studies that reported mean duration, common cold symptoms lasted from seven to 15 days(fig 8, table 6). Based on the pooled data from five studies, by day 10 about 50% of children had improved. We did not have sufficient data to determine the time at which 90% improved, but based on visual inspection from figure 8 we estimated this as about 15 days. The largest study (n = 1314) reported common cold symptoms lasting 1.8 weeks (SD 1.3) for children aged 7 or younger.

Symptom duration before study onset was not reported in five studies (Hutton, Macknin, Gruber, Pappas, Steinweg), Jedrychowski et al reported duration < 48 hours.*Placebo arm; †no treatment arm; ‡children with clear rhinorrhoea; §children with purulent rhinorrhoea

Outcomes are for children with viral RTI.

The mean duration of non-specific respiratory symptoms ranged from four to 16 days(table 6). Data on the proportion of children with symptoms was obtained from 11 studiesand was highly variable across individual studies: 50% of children had improved by day seven to eight and 80% by day 14; we could not identify the time for 90% resolution, although a projected estimate would be around day 16 (table 7, fig 9). The studies that reported symptoms at day 14, however, showed an extremely wide range in the proportion still symptomatic, from 6%to 60%. The shorter length of symptom duration reported by both Butler and colleaguesand Jacobs and colleaguescould be explained by slightly longer average duration of symptoms before study entry. Taylor and colleagues reported duration of fever of 0.64 mean days (SD 1.16).

Lower-risk brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) — respiratory viral testing: "Clinicians Need Not Obtain Respiratory Viral Testing If Rapid Testing Is Available in Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, Weak Recommendation)". The benefit–harm assessment states that "The benefits of reducing unnecessary testing, pain, costs, false reassurance, and false-positive results, as well as alleviating caregiver and infant anxiety and challenges associated with providing test results in a timely fashion, outweigh the rare missed diagnostic opportunity for a viral infection", with risks including "Failure to diagnose a viral etiology" and benefits such as "Reduce costs, unnecessary testing, and caregiver/infant discomfort". As a cautionary note, viral detection on multiplex assays "may not prove causality", and some agents can persist "(up to 30 days)", so "In a lower-risk BRUE without respiratory symptoms testing for viral infection may not be indicated, but in the presence of congestion and/or cough, or recent exposure to a viral respiratory infection, such testing may provide useful information", and "Because lower-risk BRUE patients do not have these symptoms, clinicians need not perform such testing".

Timing of RSV monoclonal antibody administration — general infant population and regional variation — specifies that eligible infants born during the seasonal window (October 1–March 31 in most of the continental United States) should receive the dose within 1 week after birth, ideally during the birth hospitalization; eligible infants born outside the window (April–September) who have not yet received a recommended dose should receive RSV antibody at the earliest opportunity beginning in October; recommendations are intentionally flexible and public health authorities may provide revised guidance based on local surveillance, including extending or shortening the recommended administration period of October–March; administration before October can be considered where transmission increases earlier, administering beyond the end of March can be considered where transmission remains high, and beginning after October or ending before March can also be considered; Alaska often has a longer season than the national average, and tropical climates might have different or unpredictable patterns, with locations including southern Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Viral-induced wheezing in young children — frequency and diagnostic challenges: Recurrent wheezing occurs in a large proportion of children aged 5 years or younger and is typically associated with upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), which occur in this age group around 6–8 times per year; some viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus are associated with recurrent wheeze throughout childhood. A large proportion of wheezing episodes in young children is virally induced whether the child has asthma or not, making it difficult to determine whether wheeze with a respiratory infection is an isolated event versus a recurrent clinical presentation of childhood asthma; in children aged under 1 year, bronchiolitis may present with wheeze and is usually accompanied by chest signs such as crackles on auscultation.

### Factors contributing to symptom duration and viral reduction in outpatient children with respiratory syncytial virus infection [^db3d5ce9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is abundant in winter and may cause bronchiolitis or pneumonia in children. Most children are infected at or before 2 years of age. Infants that are preterm or have congenital heart diseases or chronic lung diseases are at a higher risk of lower respiratory tract infection and hospital admission. – The risk factors associated with acute lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV include preterm birth, low-birth weight, male gender, sibling number, maternal smoking, history of atopic dermatitis, non-breast-feeding and crowding. Among the serotypes A and B of RSV, the clinically more harmful one remains controversial.

Currently, palivizumab is approved for use in preterm infants and is useful in decreasing ICU or pediatric ward admission. As neither an antiviral medicine nor a vaccine for RSV infection is available, a better understanding of the clinical course of RSV infection and viral dynamics in vivo is considered necessary.

However, research regarding the clinical course of RSV infection in outpatients or viral reduction of RSV is limited. Although the association between primary symptoms and patient background information had been previously reported, symptom duration in outpatients infected with RSV remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to identify the patient characteristics that contribute to clinical RSV symptoms and viral reduction in RSV-infected children.

### Primary and repeated respiratory viral infections among infants in rural Nepal [^eec43415]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Medium credibility.

We also examined repeated infections with different respiratory viruses in our study. Results of epidemiologic studies have suggested that previous infection with HRV could decrease the risk of infection with either influenza or RSV. In our analysis, we did not find evidence to support the notion that a previous infection affects the incidence of a subsequent infection with a different virus. This finding is reassuring, because it implies that vaccination against one respiratory virus might not increase the burden of infection from other respiratory viruses. However, this result should be interpreted with caution, because the number of infants sequentially infected with multiple viruses was small, and this analysis was based on calculating the relative risk for being infected with either of 2 different viruses if the infant was infected with either virus previously rather than looking separately for an effect of each virus versus another.

Our study has several limitations. First, rhinorrhea was not used as part of the definition for symptomatic illness. Therefore, the burden of respiratory viral disease might actually have been higher than that observed in this study. Second, our study might have been subject to recall bias, because the mothers were visited weekly and asked to remember if their child was symptomatic. Third, the infants in the study generally did not undergo chest imaging to diagnose their LRTI. We followed the classification system established by the WHO for infants. The WHO classification scheme was used also in another study of RSV that we conducted, and we believe that this is important and relevant, because most vaccine trial end points include the prevention of LRTI. Fourth, it is possible that repeat infections were not truly distinct reinfections, despite a 14-day symptom-free period. In the case of influenza, four of the five infants with a repeat infection had a different influenza genus detected in the second episode than in the first episode, which confirms that each episode was derived from a distinct virus. Although critically ill infants with an LRTI can shed RSV for longer than 3 weeks, previous studies found that the average duration of shedding for RSV was 11.2 days (95% CI, 10.1–12.3 days) and used a period of 14 days to distinguish between episodes of infection. The Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study in Wisconsin found that detection of the same virus by molecular methods after 14 days was unusual. Four children in the Philippines were identified recently with homologous RSV subtype B reinfection. Viral sequencing revealed that antigenic site mutations might have contributed to the homologous reinfections observed. Coinfections, particularly with HRV, were also common and could have contributed to disease severity and duration. Because infants coinfected with multiple pathogens were counted separately for each virus, our results therefore describe the clinical presentation, incidence, and risk factors for having an infection with at least the virus specified. Last, time at risk for a respiratory viral infection might depend on when an infant is born because of the differences in seasonality between respiratory viruses. Therefore, we included birth during the monsoon season in our multivariate analysis, and we did not find a statistically significant association with risk for infection with any virus in aggregate.

### Unrecognized prolonged viral replication in the pathogenesis of human RSV infection [^d3cd0a91]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory symptoms in RSV persist long after the virus is no longer detected by culture. Current concepts of RSV pathogenesis explain this by RSV inducing a long-lasting pathogenic immune cascade. We alternatively hypothesized that prolonged unrecognized RSV replication may be responsible and studied this possibility directly in a human wild-type RSV experimental infection model.

Objective

The objective of the current report was to define the duration of true human RSV replication by studying it directly in immunocompetent adults experimentally infected with a clinical strain of RSV utilizing this previously established safe and reproducible model.

Study Design

35 healthy adult volunteers were inoculated with RSV-A (Memphis-37, a low11 passage clinical strain virus, manufactured from a hospitalized bronchiolitic infant) and evaluated over 12 days. Viral load by culture, parallel quantitative PCR (genomic, message) and RSV-specific IgA, were measured twice daily from serially collected nasal washes.

Results

After inoculation, 77% (27/35) of volunteers became RSV infected. As expected, culture-detectable RSV ceased abruptly by the 5–6 t h 15 infection day. However, infected volunteers demonstrated prolonged RSV presence by both genomic and message PCR. RSV-specific IgA rose within respiratory secretions of infected volunteers during same time frame.

Conclusions

RSV replication appears to continue in humans far longer than previously thought. The rise in nasal RSV-specific IgA shortly after infection likely neutralizes culture detectable virus producing misleadingly short durations of infection. Prolonged viral replication helps explain RSV's extended disease manifestations and increases the potential utility of antivirals.

### Viral codetection and clinical outcomes of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis: a multicenter cohort study [^af162b04]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Several studies have highlighted the prevalence and significance of viral codetections in pediatric patients with respiratory tract infections. These codetections, often involving respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus and influenza, occur in a substantial portion of pediatric patients, with reports showing rates ranging from 5% to over 30% in some cohorts. – However, their potential impact on the clinical outcomes is controversial. –

Bronchiolitis is a major cause of hospitalization in infants and young children, with RSV being the most frequent pathogen identified. While RSV alone is known to cause significant morbidity, the role of coinfections in disease severity, hospital stay duration and the need for intensive interventions remains controversial. – The presence of multiple viral pathogens might exacerbate the inflammatory response in infants with bronchiolitis, leading to more severe respiratory symptoms and a prolonged course of illness. On the other hand, some reports suggested that viral codetections might be associated with milder presentations and outcomes. Because data are conflicting and mainly come from monocenter studies before the COVID-19 pandemic, – there is a need to further understand the relevance of viral codetection in infants with bronchiolitis.

The primary objective of this multicenter study is to investigate whether infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis who test positive for RSV alone, RSV plus another viral pathogen or ≥ 2 viral agents distinct from RSV exhibit different clinical trajectories. The secondary aim is to evaluate if these possible different trajectories were similar before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Long term sequelae of mild RSV infections in healthy children aged 0–3 years in the primary care setting – A prospective two year follow up observational study [^86dcdc31]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

Mild RSV infections appear to lead to a lower incidence of wheezing in otherwise healthy toddlers and infants in the following years compared to other infections, whereas rhinovirus infections represent a more important risk factor. More precise analyses are needed in the future, especially in the primary health care sector, which mainly covers mild respiratory infections. It will be particularly interesting to analyze the effect of RSV prophylaxis programs for all children in the first year of life and their impact on wheezing and asthma in the following years.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety, and antiviral effects of multiple doses of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion protein inhibitor, JNJ-53718678, in infants hospitalized with RSV infection: a randomized phase 1b study [^54df1dd9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this first report of any direct-acting RSV antiviral treatment in a pediatric population, target JNJ-8678 exposures were reached in the dose cohorts evaluating the highest doses in each age group, providing potentially effective dose regimens for future studies. Our study design allowed target exposures to be readily identified: Patients were categorized by age (≥ 6 to ≤ 24 months; ≥ 3 to < 6 months; > 1 to < 3 months), and each age group started at a low dose (weight-based for each group), before a DRC reviewed PK and safety/tolerability data upon completion of treatment, to decide upon the initiation and dose of the next cohort. Treatment with JNJ-8678 administered for 7 days was well tolerated and, importantly, there were no new safety signals in this pediatric population compared with previous studies in healthy adults. Reported AEs were symptoms not uncommon in infants and typical of those which present during RSV infection.

There was a greater reduction in viral load with JNJ-8678 than placebo, suggesting a rationale to clinically evaluate JNJ-8678 for the treatment of RSV infection. However, the sample size was small, particularly for patients receiving placebo. Therefore, larger studies are needed to confirm viral load course; such studies should be powered to assess effects in clinical outcomes, to ascertain the clinical relevance of the JNJ-8678 antiviral effects. In addition, the small sample size did not allow detailed statistical analysis to model the PK/PD relationship, as recommended in the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines; however, this will be assessed in phase 2 (NCT03656510) and phase 3 trials. In a previous challenge study in adults, no clear dose-response relationship was observed across JNJ-8678 dose levels. However, longitudinal RSV dynamics in RSV-infected infants are very different from those in adults, with higher peak viral loads and longer duration of shedding exhibited in children, due to factors favoring prolonged RSV replication. Hence, future PK/PD studies in infants are crucial.

### Factors contributing to symptom duration and viral reduction in outpatient children with respiratory syncytial virus infection [^4d2ddf90]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Our results of longer fever duration with increased age are in line with previous studies. Previous reports had demonstrated fever duration to be longer with age and frequency of high fever to also increase concurrently with age. Therefore, fever may not be a prominent symptom, especially when children less than 6-months-old are infected with RSV. Thus, RSV infection should be considered at diagnosis even if an infant has a short fever duration but with other symptoms such as wheezing or rhinorrhea that are typical for RSV infections.

We observed daily viral reduction to increase with age in RSV-infected outpatients significantly. Most of the studies on viral load dynamics were reported from inpatients because serial sampling is more convenient for inpatient than outpatient. The previous study in hospitalized patients revealed viral reduction to be slower at a younger age. However, the findings were not statistically significant. Another study on inpatients showed that the period of viral shedding was longer with those less than 1-year-old than ≥ 1-year-old for RSV serotype A infection. Our results showed similar findings despite in outpatients. Although the reason why the duration of viral shedding was prolonged in younger patients was not apparent, it may be related to the maturation of host immune response by growth and the faster viral clearance at the time of the reinfection in older children. Therefore, RSV-infected children at a younger age, especially less than 1-year-old, should be controlled for infection more than others because those children have a higher chance to infect other people who take care of them.

Our data showed no association between the first viral load and each symptom duration upon RSV infection. Viral loads at enrolment were reported to be inversely correlated with the Clinical Disease Severity Score in outpatients in the previous study. Clinical Disease Severity Score comprised of 5 parameters, including respiratory rate, auscultation, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, retractions and level of activity. The higher score (0–15) indicates the more severe condition. The previous study suggested that children with higher viral load at the first clinic visit showed less-severe clinical manifestation in outpatients. It could be possible that higher RSV loads promote an early robust innate immune response that can protect from disease progression. The first viral load may be the determinant of initial severity of illness, although our study indicated that it might not be associated with the duration of symptoms.

### Evolving concepts in how viruses impact asthma: a work group report of the microbes in allergy committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^1abc2d4a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Dynamics of respiratory tract bacterial colonization during viral upper respiratory infection (URI) — Detection of viruses in the upper airway during peak viral seasons can be as high as 90% in prospective studies, and bacteria have been shown to increase upper and lower airway symptoms during viral infections. The upper airway microbiota develops over the first year of life, with alterations in natural development associated with increased risk for URIs during the first few years of life, and the most abundant bacteria within the upper airway of infants and children are Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Moraxella, Haemophilus, Dolosigranulum, and Corynebacterium. In infants, the presence of Streptococcus, Moraxella, or Haemophilus during a URI increases the likelihood of lower airway symptoms; during RSV bronchiolitis studies have reported links between an increased abundance of Streptococcus and Haemophilus, whereas RV-bronchiolitis is associated with an increased abundance of Moraxella and Haemophilus. In school-aged children, Streptococcus or Moraxella in the airway during a naturally occurring RV infection is associated with a higher likelihood of cold and asthma symptoms. Conversely, higher abundance of Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Dolosigranulum is often present in the absence of viral detection and clinical symptoms, and when these three are enriched, infants are less likely to have an acute respiratory illness and school-aged children are less likely to have a symptomatic illness during RV infection; high abundance of Lactobacillus during RSV illness is associated with a decreased risk of childhood wheeze.

### Acute otitis media and other complications of viral respiratory infection [^7a9a380e]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Viral upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URI, LRI) are common in infants. We determined the prevalence of viral URI and its complications, including acute otitis media (AOM) and LRI, and assessed the effect of bacterial-viral interactions, and genetic and environmental risks on AOM development.

Methods

Healthy infants were enrolled from near birth and followed to the first episode of AOM up to 12 months of age. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected at monthly intervals (months 1–6, 9) and during viral URI episodes for bacterial culture and viral polymerase chain reaction studies. Subjects were followed closely for AOM development.

Results

A total of 367 infants were followed for 286 child-years; 887 URI (305 infants) and 180 AOM episodes (143 infants) were documented. Prevalence of URI, LRI, and AOM in the first year was 3.2, 0.25, and 0.67 per child-year, respectively. Cumulative AOM incidence by ages 3, 6, and 12 months was 6%, 23%, and 46%. Infants with and without AOM had 4.7 and 2.3 URI episodes per child-year, respectively (P < .002). Pathogenic bacterial colonization rates by month were significantly higher in infants with AOM (P < .005). Breastfeeding reduced both URI and AOM risks (P < .05). Significant bacterial-viral interactions occurred with Moraxella catarrhalis and a variety of respiratory viruses and altered URI and AOM risks.

Conclusions

Almost half of infants experienced AOM by age 1. Important AOM risk factors included frequent viral URI, pathogenic bacterial colonization, and lack of breastfeeding. Bacterial-viral interactions may play a significant role in AOM pathogenesis and deserve further investigation.

### Viral genetic determinants of prolonged respiratory syncytial virus infection among infants in a healthy term birth cohort [^4b8af246]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

While this study has a number of significant strengths, including one of few population-based surveillance studies of first RSV infections during infancy among term healthy infants, our findings are also subject to some limitations. First, this study was not designed with the primary intention to examine infection duration, and additional sampling following initial RSV infection was triggered by a repeat acute respiratory illness. Asymptomatic prolonged infections would therefore not have been captured. Second, our study cohort was small, necessitating focus on viral surface glycoproteins, F and G, due to their variability and importance in host immunity. A larger cohort with serial sampling would be required to diminish the impact of colinearity of viral genotypes with antigenic groups and to perform informative viral whole-genome analysis. Genome-wide information might elucidate other determinants of prolonged infection or pathogen fitness that mediate and/or modulate effects of phenotype-driving variations. Third, again due to small sample size, we could only investigate host genetic risk for infection, not prolonged infection. While we have not specifically assessed subjects for rare monogenic variants that may underlie immunodeficiency, our enrolment criteria included only infants who were term and otherwise healthy. While we performed an interaction analysis for the outcome of host asthma, host genetics, and pathogen genetics and found no significant interaction, our sample size is unlikely sufficient to exclude such an interaction. Lastly, while we do not expect a role for immune memory in these first-in-life RSV infections, we cannot exclude modulatory effects of maternal antibody, which we did not measure. Despite these limitations, the results are novel and represent an in-depth comprehensive computational statistical analysis of both host and viral genetics, providing compelling evidence for RSV viral strain persistence in healthy human infants, a finding of significant importance to understanding the impact of RSV on chronic disease and viral endemicity.

### Incidence of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infections during the first 2 years of life: a prospective study across diverse global settings [^0b1119ae]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This is one of the largest prospective studies to date that evaluates disease burden of RSV-LRTI across diverse global settings. Our results support true regional variations in disease burden. RSV-LRTIs, severe RSV-LRTIs, and RSV hospitalizations were detected in all 8 countries, but incidence rates varied largely from one country to another.

In most countries, RSV-LRTI incidence was consistently highest in infants less than 6 months of age with an observed stepwise decline among those aged 6–11 and 12–23 months. This trend was less obvious in children enrolled from high-income countries such as Canada, Finland, and the United States. Overall, our results are similar to global estimates reported from meta-analyses of RSV disease epidemiology. The differences observed across age groups were even greater for severe RSV-LRTI and RSV-associated hospitalizations, where the incidences were 4.7 and 4.9 times higher in the 0–5 months versus the 11–23 months age group. It should be noted, however, that the proportion of children with RSV-LRTI cases in the 6–23 age group was comparable to that observed for infants aged 0–5 months, indicating that a substantial burden of RSV-LRTI continues well beyond the first 6 months of life. Overall, higher incidence rates for RSV-LRTI and severe RSV-LRTI were observed in Honduras, Bangladesh, and Argentina, consistent with previous estimations of a higher burden of disease in low- and middle-income settings. However, other factors that can at least partially contribute to differences in incidence rates across countries, such as the length of the RSV transmission period (and therefore of exposure to the virus), cannot be excluded. For instance, the RSV transmission period is all year round in Honduras and 9 months (from June to February) in Bangladesh. Of note, in Finland, a high-income country where we observed 9 continuous months of RSV activity, the observed incidence rates for RSV-LRTI were considerably lower. The timing of onset, peak, and duration of local RSV seasons are known to vary with altitude, climate, and across geographic locations, and this may also contribute to the heterogeneity of the results across countries. Our finding that RSV-related hospitalization rates differ substantially from one country to another is consistent with previous reports. Variation in medical practice could account for different hospitalization rates; we noted that among children with the same RSV-LRTI severity level hospitalization rates varied by country.

### Chronic manifestations of respiratory syncytial virus infection in premature infants [^2143a8fa]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in healthy infants born at term results in long term sequelae. Infants born prematurely are at increased risk of severe acute RSV infection; thus it would seem likely that such infants would be at increased risk of long term respiratory sequelae.

Methods

Methods of assessing the long term outcome of RSV infection are discussed and the results of retrospective and prospective studies investigating chronic respiratory morbidity after RSV infection in premature infants are reviewed.

Results

Documentation of all health care utilization, parental documentation of symptom status and lung function measurement provide a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of respiratory outcome. Studies that have included such outcome measures have demonstrated that RSV hospitalization in infants born between 32 and 35 weeks of gestational age and in those born more prematurely who developed chronic lung disease was associated with more hospital admissions, inpatient days, physician contacts and outpatient visits in the first 2 years after birth. Children born before 32 weeks of gestation who developed chronic lung disease also required more outpatient attendances and prescriptions and respiratory medications in years 2 through 4. Prospective data collection has demonstrated that chronic respiratory morbidity occurs in very premature infants, regardless of whether their RSV infection required hospitalization.

Conclusion

Chronic respiratory morbidity is increased in premature infants after RSV infection. The duration of this increased morbidity and the impact of other viral infections, particularly dual infection with RSV, on long term sequelae merit investigation.

### Viral codetection and clinical outcomes of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis: a multicenter cohort study [^658f6b41]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This large cohort study aimed to elucidate the impact of viral codetection on the clinical outcomes of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, with a particular focus on distinguishing between infections caused by RSV alone, RSV plus another virus and multiple viruses other than RSV. Furthermore, it tested if different clinical trajectories characterized the period before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and 3 pandemic periods.

This study showed a high prevalence of RSV in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, as documented in previous studies. In line with earlier research, we also observed notable differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes among infants testing positive for different viruses. Infants testing positive for multiple viruses other than RSV showed a lower duration of oxygen supplementation, intensive care stay and overall hospitalization compared with infants with RSV alone. These findings partially challenge the traditional assumption that viral coinfections usually worsen disease severity. This outcome could be attributed to complex immune responses triggered by the interaction of multiple viruses, potentially leading to a reduced inflammatory response to the infection. On the other hand, previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effect of infection by RSV alone or RSV plus another virus.– This variability could be attributed to differences in study design, patient populations and the specific viruses involved in the disease. This study, which included a large number of hospitalized infants, supports the view that the presence of 1 additional virus alongside RSV may not usually result in increased disease severity.

### Challenges and opportunities in developing respiratory syncytial virus therapeutics [^4460811c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Regulatory authorities in the United States will consider, among other factors, whether the following data would be sufficient to justify the initiation of RSV studies of a new agent in infants, assuming that the agent did not raise preclinical or clinical safety concerns and that there would be a prospect of direct clinical benefit from the intervention:
Substantial evidence of safety according to good laboratory practice toxicology studies (including appropriate toxicology studies of juveniles)
No clinically important safety findings observed in phase I studies in adult healthy volunteers evaluating exposures similar or higher than the weight-adjusted exposures to be evaluated in infants
Demonstrated relevant pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in a model — animal or human

Because most children ≥ 2 years old do not have severe enough RSV disease to warrant hospitalization, regulatory bodies regard as inappropriate the use of healthy older children as RSV therapy study subjects. However, younger children and infants generally have high enough risks for severe RSV disease to be able to justify enrolled in such studies.

Both an initial pharmacokinetic assessment and modeling would ideally be required for dose selection and movement directly into a treatment study in infants, but to some extent this might depend on the properties of the drug. For example, single-dose data might be sufficient if the drug has linear pharmacokinetics. Each new agent is likely to be reviewed by regulatory bodies on a case-by-case basis, with final judgments predicated on proper assessment of risk-benefit ratio.

Developing a safety database for a new therapy in adults before its introduction to children is helpful, although appropriate juvenile toxicity data will also be needed. Experimental infection model data may augment this safety database and suggest relevant treatment timing windows, to identify timing that will mimic the transition from URTI to LRTI in children. Whether a safety database in hospitalized infants is needed before initiating outpatient studies in infants has not been defined by regulatory bodies. In all likelihood it will be determined by animal toxicology and adult safety studies of individual experimental agents and will probably depend on the mode of action of the new agent, its route of administration, prior safety signals, the robustness of the safety analyses, the potential for the development of resistance and oversight of the pediatric protocol itself, and the population under study.

### Influenza A infection in young infants [^7d990f0d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the clinical characteristics of infants ≤ 2 months old hospitalised with influenza A.

Study Design

The study was a retrospective analysis of infants ≤ 2 months old hospitalised with fever, respiratory distress and/or sepsis. Clinical signs, laboratory values, hospital duration and outcome were compared between children with influenza A and other viruses.

Results

The charts of 268 infants were reviewed. 29 (11%) children had laboratory-confirmed influenza A infection. Unique features associated with influenza infection included the high number presenting with fever (97%) and a history of exposure to family members with a flu-like illness (69%). A significantly lower rate of respiratory distress was observed in the influenza group compared with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (24% vs 89%, p ≤ 0.001). Median duration of hospitalisation for influenza was shorter than RSV (4 days vs 6 days, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In young infants, influenza A is a relatively mild disease compared to RSV and is primarily associated with upper respiratory tract manifestations.

### RSV in infants and young children… [^2ff9bd58]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know
- RSV can be dangerous for infants and some young children.
- RSV is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the U. S.
- Immunizations can protect babies from getting very sick from RSV. Overview RSV can be dangerous for infants and some young children. Each year in the United States, an estimated 58, 000–80, 000 children younger than 5 years are hospitalized due to RSV. Children at greatest risk for severe illness from RSV include: Symptoms in infants and young children RSV may not be severe when it first starts. However, it can become more severe a few days into the illness. Early symptoms of RSV may include:

- Runny nose
- Eating or drinking less
- Cough, which may progress to wheezing or difficulty breathing. RSV in very young Infants Infants who get RSV almost always show symptoms. This is different from adults, who can sometimes get RSV and not have any symptoms.

In very young infants, the symptoms of RSV may include:

- Irritability
- Decreased activity
- Eating or drinking less
- Apnea Many infants will not have a fever with RSV infection. Severe RSV Most of the time RSV causes a mild, cold-like illness, but it can also cause severe illness such as:

- Bronchiolitis
- Pneumonia Two to three out of every 100 infants under 6 months are hospitalized with RSV every year. Those who are hospitalized may require oxygen, IV fluids, and mechanical ventilation. Most improve with this type of supportive care and are discharged in a few days. When to seek emergency care.

Immunizations to protect infants from severe RSV CDC recommends you use one of these two tools to protect your baby from getting very sick with RSV:
- An RSV vaccine given to the mother during pregnancy
- An RSV immunization given to infants and some older babies Most infants will not need both.

### Seasonality of long term wheezing following respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection [^22708eae]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Background

It is well known that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is associated with subsequent wheezing episodes, but the precise natural course of wheezing following RSV LRTI is not known. This study aimed to determine the continuous development of wheezing following RSV LRTI in children up to the age of 3 years.

Methods

A prospective cohort study was performed in 140 hospitalised infants with RSV LRTI. Continuous follow up data were obtained with a unique log in which parents noted daily respiratory symptoms.

Results

A marked decrease in wheezing was seen during the first year of follow up. The burden of wheezing following RSV LRTI was observed during the winter season. Signs of airflow limitation during RSV LRTI were strongly associated with wheezing during the follow up period. Total and specific serum immunoglobulin E levels, patient eczema, and parental history of atopy were not associated with wheezing.

Conclusions

Airway morbidity following RSV LRTI has a seasonal pattern, which suggests that viral upper respiratory tract infections are the predominant trigger for wheezing following RSV LRTI. There is a significant decrease in airway symptoms during the first 12 months after admission to hospital. Simple clinical variables, but not allergic risk factors, can predict the development of wheezing following RSV LRTI.

### Pneumococcal acute otitis media in relation to pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage [^cd9dff1f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is closely associated with viral upper respiratory tract infections, but the most common microbial agent found in the middle ear fluid during AOM is Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pnc). Pnc is also a common colonizer of the nasopharynx, and its prevalence is further increased during the viral infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the interplay between viral infection, pneumococcal acquisition and carriage in the development of Pnc AOM.

Methods

Pnc carriage was assessed in a longitudinal study of 329 infants at scheduled visits at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months of age (N = 1715). The clinical outcome of the first episode of respiratory infection ("sick visit", N = 774) in the following 3-month period was recorded. The occurrence and timing of Pnc AOM in relation to serotype specific carriage at the start of the observation period were assessed.

Results

The occurrence, timing and duration of symptoms of the sick visits or the frequency of overall AOM were not associated with preceding pneumococcal carriage. Pnc AOM was in each case associated with concurrent carriage and 3.8 times (95% confidence interval, 1.4–10.0) more often with carriage acquired after the start of the observation period than with carriage already present at the scheduled visit. In all, 79% (55 of 70) of Pnc AOM events were caused by a serotype acquired after the start of the period.

Conclusion

The majority of Pnc AOM events develop in association with newly acquired carriage of pneumococcus.

### The underrecognized burden of respiratory syncytial virus among infants presenting to US emergency departments [^378614e0]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness (LRI) in infants and young children and one of the most frequently detected respiratory viruses among hospitalized children. In the United States, the RSV season generally occurs between November and March; however, season onset and offset, duration, and peak can have considerable regional and local variability.

Many infants infected with RSV develop mild upper respiratory tract disease that resolves uneventfully in 8 to 15 days. However, pneumonia and bronchiolitis are apparent in up to 40% of children on their initial RSV infection.RSV disease is often not diagnosed as there is debate whether RSV testing of infants with bronchiolitis changes management. The American Academy of Pediatrics, in their bronchiolitis management guidelines, specifically does not recommend RSV testing. Although results are rapidly available with antigen testing, the lack of sensitivity and specificity limits its usefulness; cell culture and virus isolation lack sensitivity and are expensive, and results are not available for days. Although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive test available for RSV detection during peak and off-peak seasons, it is infrequently used in the emergency department (ED) setting owing to the expense and lack of available results while the child is in the ED. Given the limitations of routine diagnostic testing for RSV, it is likely that RSV in the ED setting is underrecognized. The objective of this analysis was to compare the prevalence of RSV assessed by RT-PCR with that of primary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis among infants presenting to US EDs with LRI or apnea.

After exposure to caregivers or visitors, "isolating or testing asymptomatic infants… is not routinely recommended, but oseltamivir prophylaxis for the infant could be considered after known influenza exposure". In an outbreak or possible in-hospital transmission, "active screening of asymptomatic infants may be considered", and to document resolution of infection, "HCP should continue precautions… for at least the duration of illness", with the option that "HCP may consider a strategy of repeated molecular testing and continued isolation until testing is negative".

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^22de786d]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory infections — background for pediatric residential facilities — note that people can become ill with upper tract or lower tract respiratory infections, and viruses that cause respiratory infections include rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and the new coronaviruses most commonly cause upper respiratory tract infections. In infants, RSV bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization for respiratory disease, and in severely immune compromised individuals and people with underlying conditions, RSV pneumonia carries high morbidity and mortality. Most respiratory viruses spread through respiratory droplets expelled during coughing and sneezing, and for certain respiratory viruses, such as RSV, a person also can get sick from direct contact with infected respiratory secretions or objects that have been contaminated with infectious droplets. Respiratory infections caused by bacteria spread by droplets expelled by the person who is sick before they have received 24 hours of effective antibiotics, and notable pandemics have included 2009 influenza virus H1N1 and late 2019 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 which quickly spread across the globe.

### Upper respiratory tract infections… [^f1d7bbf8]. publications.aap.org (2015). Low credibility.

Every day worried parents bring their children to clinicians for evaluation of coughs, runny noses, and sore throats. Most of these children have a simple cold and only require reassurance. However, clinicians must remain vigilant to not overlook a more severe possibility, such as secondary bacterial infection, an asthma exacerbation, or perhaps a foreign body. After ruling out a more severe issue, the most likely possibility is an everyday viral infection. These upper respiratory tract infections and pharyngeal infections have many causes, but their presentations tend to follow similar patterns, which allow clinicians to reassure and advise worried parents. On average, children are infected with two to eight URIs annually in the first 2 years after birth; those who attend day care may have as many as 14 annually. Even older children and adults may experience three to six URIs a year. In the United States, infants in the. Comments

### Clinical and viral factors associated with disease severity and subsequent wheezing in infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection [^d8b77d57]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in infants and young children worldwide. Here we evaluated host demographic and viral factors associated with RSV disease severity in 325 RSV-infected infants under 1 year of age from 3 European countries during 2017–2020. Younger infants had a higher clinical severity (ReSViNET) score and were more likely to require hospitalization, intensive care, respiratory support, and/or mechanical ventilation than older infants (< 3 months vs 3 to < 6 months and 3 to < 6 months vs ≥ 6 months). Older age (≥ 6 months vs < 3 months), higher viral load, and RSV-A were associated with a greater probability of fever. RSV-A and RSV-B caused similar disease severity and had similar viral dynamics. Infants with a more severe RSV infection, demonstrated by having a higher ReSViNET score, fever, and requiring hospitalization and intensive care, were more likely to have developed subsequent wheezing at 1 year of age.

### Zinc for prevention and treatment of the common cold [^4d326b19]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The common cold is an acute, self-limiting viral respiratory illness. Symptoms include nasal congestion and mucus discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough, and general malaise. Given the frequency of colds, they are a public health burden and a significant cause of lost work productivity and school absenteeism. There are no established interventions to prevent colds or shorten their duration. However, zinc supplements are commonly recommended and taken for this purpose.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of zinc for the prevention and treatment of the common cold.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS to 22 May 2023, and searched Web of Science Core Collection and two trials registries to 14 June 2023. We also used reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults that tested any form of zinc against placebo to prevent or treat the common cold or upper respiratory infection (URTI). We excluded zinc interventions in which zinc was combined with other minerals, vitamins, or herbs (e.g. a multivitamin, or mineral supplement containing zinc).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We independently extracted data. When necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed zinc (type and route) with placebo in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. Primary outcomes included the proportion of participants developing colds (for analyses of prevention trials only), duration of cold (measured in days from start to resolution of the cold), adverse events potentially due to zinc supplements (e.g. unpleasant taste, loss of smell, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhoea), and adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold (e.g. respiratory bacterial infections).

Main Results

We included 34 studies (15 prevention, 19 treatment) involving 8526 participants. Twenty-two studies were conducted on adults and 12 studies were conducted on children. Most trials were conducted in the USA (n = 18), followed by India, Indonesia, Iran, and Turkey (two studies each), and Australia, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Tanzania, Thailand, and the UK (one study each). The 15 prevention studies identified the condition as either common cold (n = 8) or URTI (n = 7). However, almost all therapeutic studies (17/19) focused on the common cold. Most studies (17/34) evaluated the effectiveness of zinc administered as lozenges (3 prevention; 14 treatment) in acetate, gluconate, and orotate forms; gluconate lozenges were the most common (9/17). Zinc gluconate was given at doses between 45 and 276 mg/day for between 4.5 and 21 days. Five (5/17) lozenge studies gave acetate lozenges and two (2/17) gave both acetate and gluconate lozenges. One (1/17) lozenge study administered intranasal (gluconate) and lozenge (orotate) zinc in tandem for cold treatment. Of the 17/34 studies that did not use lozenges, 1/17 gave capsules, 3/17 administered dissolved powders, 5/17 gave tablets, 4/17 used syrups, and 4/17 used intranasal administration. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain. There may be little or no reduction in the risk of developing a cold with zinc compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; I² = 20%; 9 studies, 1449 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no reduction in the mean number of colds that occur over five to 18 months of follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.90, 95% CI -1.93 to 0.12; I² = 96%; 2 studies, 1284 participants; low-certainty evidence). When colds occur, there is probably little or no difference in the duration of colds in days (MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.29 to 0.04; I² = 77%; 3 studies, 740 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in global symptom severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.04, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.43; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 101 participants; low-certainty evidence). When zinc is used for cold treatment, there may be a reduction in the mean duration of the cold in days (MD -2.37, 95% CI -4.21 to -0.53; I² = 97%; 8 studies, 972 participants; low-certainty evidence), although it is uncertain whether there is a reduction in the risk of having an ongoing cold at the end of follow-up (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.27; I² = 65%; 5 studies, 357 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or global symptom severity (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.50; I² = 78%; 2 studies, 261 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in the risk of a change in global symptom severity (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.23; 1 study, 114 participants; low-certainty evidence). Thirty-one studies reported non-serious adverse events (2422 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of adverse events with zinc used for cold prevention (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1517 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or an increase in the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.57; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 1563 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is probably an increase in the risk of non-serious adverse events when zinc is used for cold treatment (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55; I² = 44%; 2084 participants, 16 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); no treatment study provided information on serious adverse events. No study provided clear information about adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings suggest that zinc supplementation may have little or no effect on the prevention of colds but may reduce the duration of ongoing colds, with an increase in non-serious adverse events. Overall, there was wide variation in interventions (including concomitant therapy) and outcomes across the studies, as well as incomplete reporting of several domains, which should be considered when making conclusions about the efficacy of zinc for the common cold.

### Viral infections and chronic rhinosinusitis [^72c02918]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Viral infections are the most common cause of upper respiratory infections; they frequently infect adults once or twice and children 6 to 8 times annually. In most cases, these infections are self-limiting and resolve. However, many patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) relay that their initiating event began with an upper respiratory infection that progressed in both symptom severity and duration. Viruses bind to sinonasal epithelia through specific receptors, thereby entering cells and replicating within them. Viral infections stimulate interferon-mediated innate immune responses. Recent studies suggest that viral infections may also induce type 2 immune responses and stimulate the aberrant production of cytokines that can result in loss of barrier function, which is a hallmark in CRS. The main purpose of this review will be to highlight common viruses and their associated binding receptors and highlight pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with alterations in mucociliary clearance, epithelial barrier function, and dysfunctional immune responses that might lead to a further understanding of the pathogenesis of CRS.

### Palivizumab prophylaxis in infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus infection [^51566501]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic use of palivizumab in active RSV infection — Controlled studies have demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies have no therapeutic benefit in the treatment of RSV-infected children. In one randomized study, intravenous palivizumab reduced RSV viral load in the lower respiratory tract but had no effect on upper respiratory tract concentration and no difference in disease severity versus placebo. A Cochrane review of 7 randomized controlled trials in 486 hospitalized infants found no impact on mortality, length of hospital stay, or severity of illness, and another study of patients with hematologic diseases treated from 2007 to 2016 observed no effect on mortality.

### Oxygen saturation targets in infants with bronchiolitis (BIDS): a double-blind, randomised, equivalence trial [^e511e50c]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Oxygen saturation targets standardise clinical care in patients with acute disease, aiming to maintain tissue oxygenation and improve clinical outcomes. No randomised clinical trial has assessed oxygen saturation targets in management of patients with acute lower respiratory infection (LRTI). The most common acute LRTI in early life is acute viral bronchiolitis, which causes about 128 000 hospital admissions each year in the USA at an estimated cost of US$1·73 billion. Applying standard unit cost estimates to annual rates in the UK reveals that the annual cost of paediatric bronchiolitis to NHS England would be about £83·8 million. This figure is based on 37 200 cases of paediatric bronchiolitis per yearwith an average cost per case of £2254. In 2006, two evidence-based guidelines for the management of bronchiolitis included contrasting recommendations for oxygen saturation targets. The UK SIGN guideline (SIGN 91) recommended a normoxic pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2) target (≥ 94%), whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)recommended a permissive hypoxaemic SpO 2 target (≥ 90%; reiterated 2014). The AAP's advice is consistent with WHO's recommended SpO 2 target of 90% and higher in infants with LRTI. However, WHO's recommendation is considered pragmatic advice for best use of scarce oxygen availability in low-resource settings, and neither AAP or WHO targets have been tested in a randomised controlled trial.

Despite AAP's guidance, recommended SpO 2 targets for infants with bronchiolitis continue to vary between national guideline portals for the USA, Europe,… This inconsistency might show clinical hesitance to adopt a lower SpO 2 target for infants than is currently recommended for older children with pneumonia (≤ 92%)and asthma (< 94%), or a reticence to use hypoxaemic targets provided by expert opinion when similar recommendations have been associated with unanticipated adverse events once tested in a randomised controlled trial. We aimed to assess whether a target oxygen saturation of 90% or higher would be equivalent to 94% or higher for resolution of illness in acute viral bronchiolitis. To do this we assessed time to resolution of cough, which is associated with airway inflammation and might be influenced by hypoxia. Cough is a ubiquitous symptom in bronchiolitis consistently identified by parents and has a duration well documented in many trials.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2024–2025: technical report [^910deedd]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Rationale for influenza treatment in children — goals, timing, and evidence: The guideline states the aims are "threefold: (1) reduce the duration of symptoms; (2) reduce complication of influenza, including hospitalization and death; and (3) potentially reduce transmission". It reports that among outpatients, "timely treatment (optimally ≤ 2 days from symptom onset) can reduce the duration of influenza symptoms and fever in children and adults", and that "Observational studies in pediatric and adult populations suggest that antiviral agents are safe and could reduce the risk of certain influenza complications, including hospitalization and death". It also notes "Potential limitations of the trials conducted to date in children include the study size… variations in the case definition of influenza illness… time of treatment administration in relation to the onset of illness, and inclusion of children of varying ages and underlying health conditions".

### Illness duration and symptom profile in symptomatic UK school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2 [^cf33ff43]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than, as of July 21, 2021. In adults, SARS-CoV-2 causes a predominantly respiratory illness;, children are often asymptomatic (in 43–68% of cases) or have mild symptoms, and life-threatening illness and death fromare rare. The pandemic has also resulted in the emergence of a new rare condition, termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), presenting at about 2–4 weeks after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

COVID-19 in children is usually asymptomatic or manifests as a mild illness of short duration. Concerns have been raised regarding prolonged illness in children, with no clear resolution of symptoms several weeks after onset, as is observed in some adults. How common this might be in children, the clinical features of such prolonged illness in children, and how this might compare with illnesses from other respiratory viruses (and with general population prevalence of these symptoms) is unclear. A final database search was done in PubMed using the search terms (("COVID-19" OR "SARS-CoV-2") AND child*) on June 28, 2021.

Added value of this study

We provide a detailed description of the illness duration and symptom burden for COVID-19 in UK school-aged children (age 5–17 years). Our data, collected in a digital surveillance platform through one of the largest UK citizen science epidemiological studies, show that long illness duration after SARS-CoV-2 infection in school-aged children does occur, but is uncommon. Only a small proportion of children had illness duration beyond 4 weeks, and their symptom burden decreased over time. Almost all children had symptom resolution by 8 weeks, providing reassurance about long-term outcomes. Additionally, the symptom burden in children with what has been termed long COVID-19 was not greater than that in children with long illnesses due to causes other than SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### About common cold… [^4f41aa83]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Different respiratory viruses can cause a cold.
- You can get a cold any time of year.
- Colds usually last less than a week. Overview A cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:

- Runny nose or nasal congestion
- Cough
- Sneezing
- Sore throat
- Headache
- Mild body aches
- Fever. Complications Complications from infection with respiratory viruses can include: Mild to moderate:

- Middle ear infections
- Sinus infections.

Potentially severe:

- Asthma attacks
- Bronchiolitis
- Bronchitis
- Pneumonia
- Worsening of chronic medical conditions Some respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness. This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems. Causes and spread Causes More than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and human metapneumovirus.

Spread Different respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.

### Independent and interactive effects of viral species on early-life lower respiratory tract illness [^d5026184]. The Journal of Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the association between viral species and odds of severe lower respiratory tract illnesses (sLRI) versus upper respiratory illness (URI) among children under 2 years of age.

Methods

Infants (n = 2061) enrolled in the Puerto Rican Infant Metagenomic and Epidemiologic Study of Respiratory Outcomes were surveilled for respiratory illnesses until age 2 years (March 2020 to April 2024). Nasal swabs from 1363 illnesses (774 participants) were screened for 21 pathogens.

Results

RSV infections occurred in 23% of sLRIs and increased odds of sLRI vs URI (OR = 9.28; 95% CI, 5.43–15.85). Metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, and non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus also increased odds of sLRIs, while SARS-CoV-2 was associated with lower risk of sLRIs. Rhinovirus (43%) and bocavirus (16.1%) were commonly detected, but were not associated with sLRI risk. Co-infection with multiple viral species was associated with 2.92-fold greater odds of sLRI (95% CI, 2.05–4.16) compared to single viral species infections. Rhinovirus-bocavirus was the most common co-infection, and interaction between these viruses was associated with increased odds of sLRI.

Conclusions

Diverse viral pathogens drive early-life sLRIs. Some (e.g. RSV and metapneumovirus) have an intrinsic propensity to cause sLRIs, while other viruses' lower airway pathogenicity depends on other factors, including co-infection.

### Factors contributing to symptom duration and viral reduction in outpatient children with respiratory syncytial virus infection [^5af53e5b]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study had some limitations. First, the procedure of collecting nasal specimen was not standardized and might affect the viral load measurement. Second, parents were asked to record patient symptoms; although it is easy to assess fever, cough and rhinorrhea, it might be difficult for them to determine retraction. Additionally, appetite loss and "ill feeling" are subjective symptoms compared with cough or rhinorrhea, and hence, the duration of these symptoms may not be more objective. Finally, the viral reduction was calculated using 2 viral load measurements because the serial sampling was difficult for outpatients. Calculations using more than two measurements might be more accurate.

Despite the limitations, our study revealed that several patient characteristics were related to the duration of symptoms in RSV-infected infants. Therefore, we suggest that age, household smoking, gender, gestational age and birth weight should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of RSV infection. Gestational age is an essential factor in applying palivizumab to preterm infants. Our study suggested that viral loads are higher in younger children. This is important when we consider infection control measurements for RSV-infected patients. Our results will help healthcare professionals to diagnose and manage RSV infection appropriately in young children.

### Maternal respiratory syncytial virus vaccination [^cc4f305f]. ACOG (2023). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus infection, more specifically with respect to immunization, maternal, ACOG 2023 guidelines recommend to offer a single dose of an approved RSV vaccine in pregnant individuals at 32–36 weeks of gestation, using seasonal administration (for example, September-January in most of the continental US), to prevent RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection in infants through age 6 months.

### Respiratory syncytial virus load predicts disease severity in previously healthy infants [^0ef192f8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Elucidating the relationship between viral load and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease severity is critical to understanding pathogenesis and predicting the utility of antivirals.

Methods

Previously healthy, naturally RSV-infected infants < 24 months old not treated with ribavirin, passive antibody, or corticosteroids were prospectively studied (n = 141). Viral loads were measured by fresh quantitative culture from nasal washes collected at a single time point shortly after hospitalization.

Results

The subjects' mean age was 112.1 days, and the mean estimated gestational age at birth was 38.38 weeks. RSV load decreased with longer durations of symptoms before specimen collection (P = 0.01). Male subjects had higher RSV loads than female subjects (P = 0.036). Significant independent predictors of longer hospitalization were congenital anomaly (P < .0001), lower weight on admission (P = 0.028), and higher nasal RSV load (P = 0.008). A 1-log higher RSV load predicted a 0.8-day longer hospitalization. Lower weight and higher RSV load were also independently associated with respiratory failure (P < .0005 and P = 0.0049, respectively) and requirement for intensive care (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0048, respectively).

Conclusions

In previously healthy infants, higher RSV loads measured at capturable time points after symptom onset predict clinically relevant measures of increased disease severity.

### The role of breastfeeding in acute respiratory infections in infancy [^249d26fd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) affect the respiratory tract, are often caused by viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus, and present symptoms such as coughing, fever, respiratory distress, and breathing difficulty. The global adherence to exclusive breastfeeding (BF) for the first 6 months of life has reached 44%, supported by the World Health Organization and United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund efforts. BF provides vital nutrients and contributes to infant immune system development, protecting against infections. The role of BF in preventing and reducing complications of ARIs in infants is gaining attention, prompting a review of current data and future research needs. This review aims to summarize the evidence on the role of BF in reducing the risk and severity of ARIs in infants, elucidate the adaptations in breast milk composition during infections, and identify relevant research needs.

Methods and Results

Human milk (HM) is rich in immunoglobulins, antimicrobial peptides, and immunomodulatory factors that protect against various pathogens, including respiratory viruses. Several studies have demonstrated that BF is associated with a significant reduction in hospitalization, oxygen requirements, and mortality in infants with ARIs. The effectiveness of BF varies according to the specific respiratory virus, and a longer duration of exclusive BF appears to enhance its protective effect. It is documented that the composition of HM adjusts dynamically in response to infections, fortifying the infant's immune defenses. Specific immunological components of HM, including leukocytes and immunoglobulins, increase in response to infection in the infant, contributing to the enhancement of the immune defense in infants. Immune-boosting microRNAs enhance immune transfer to the infants and promote early gut maturation, and the HM microbiome along with other factors modifies the infant's gut microbiome and immune system.

Conclusions

BF defends infants from respiratory infections, and the investigation of the microRNAs in HM offers new insights into its antiviral properties. The promotion of BF, especially in vulnerable communities, is of paramount importance in alleviating the global burden of ARIs in infancy.

### Identification of biomarkers for disease severity in nasopharyngeal secretions of infants with upper or lower respiratory tract viral infections [^e1cabc8f]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) produced by viruses are the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in children younger than 5 years of age. The immune response triggered by viral infection can induce a strong inflammation in the airways and cytokines could be considered as biomarkers for disease severity as these molecules modulate the inflammatory response that defines the outcome of patients. Aiming to predict the severity of disease during respiratory tract infections, we conducted a 1-year follow-up observational study in infants who presented upper or lower respiratory tract infections caused by seasonal respiratory viruses. At the time of enrollment, nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were obtained from infants to measure mRNA expression and protein levels of IL-3, IL-8, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. While all cytokines significantly increased their protein levels in infants with upper and lower respiratory tract infections as compared to control infants, IL-33 and IL-8 showed a significant increase in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-infected patients with LRTI as compared to patients with upper respiratory tract infection. We also found higher viral loads of RSV-positive samples with a greater IL-8 response at the beginning of the symptoms. Data obtained in this study suggest that both IL-8 and IL-33 could be used as biomarkers for clinical severity for infants suffering from LRTIs caused by the RSV.

### Motavizumab treatment of infants hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus infection does not decrease viral load or severity of illness [^7ff7a49e]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This study was conducted to determine whether treatment with motavizumab, an anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) monoclonal antibody, would decrease viral load and improve clinical outcomes in previously healthy term infants hospitalized with RSV lower respiratory tract infection.

Methods

Infants hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infection and a positive RSV test performed locally were randomized to receive 1 intravenous dose of motavizumab (30 or 100 mg/kg) or placebo. Nasal wash samples were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction at a central laboratory to determine viral load. Clinical data were collected during RSV hospitalization and at 12-month follow up.

Results

Of 118 infants, 112 were confirmed RSV positive by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In each study group, median (range) RSV load (log10 copies/mL) decreased at a similar rate from baseline to study day 7 [motavizumab 30 mg/kg: 8.35 (2.5–9.5) to 5.03 (2.5–6.8); motavizumab 100 mg/kg: 8.22 (5.5–9.7) to 4.25 (2.5–8.0); placebo: 8.02 (6.7–9.8) to 5.17 (2.5–7.3)]. Median (range) duration of hospitalization was 3.05 (0.8–16.0), 2.99 (1.0–25.0) and 2.88 (0.8–11.7) days for the motavizumab 30 mg/kg, motavizumab 100 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively. Six (8%) motavizumab and 0 placebo recipients were admitted to the intensive care unit and 4 required mechanical ventilation. The incidence of wheezing episodes during the 12-month follow up was comparable for all 3 groups.

Conclusions

Motavizumab had no appreciable effect on RSV viral load measured in the upper respiratory tract of children hospitalized for RSV lower respiratory tract infection. No differences were observed for duration of hospitalization, severity of illness measures or wheezing episodes during 12-month follow up in children treated with motavizumab or placebo.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2024–2025: policy statement [^751e971e]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics 2024–2025 influenza antivirals in children — treatment indications and timing are specified as follows: Antiviral treatment of influenza is recommended for children with suspected (eg, influenza-like illness [fever with either cough or sore throat]) or confirmed influenza who are hospitalized or have severe or progressive disease or have underlying conditions that increase their risk of complications of influenza, regardless of duration of illness, and antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. In the outpatient setting, antiviral treatment may be considered for symptomatic children who are not at high risk for influenza complications with suspected or confirmed influenza disease, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset.

### Comparison of symptom duration between children with SARS-CoV-2 and peers with other viral illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic [^61626deb]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Some children and young people (CYP) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) experience persistent symptoms, commonly called "long COVID". It remains unclear whether symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 persist longer than those of other respiratory viruses, particularly in young children. This cross-sectional study involved 372 CYP (0–15 years) tested for SARS-CoV-2. Character and duration of symptoms (cough, runny nose, sore throat, rash, diarrhea, vomiting, sore muscles, fatigue, fever, loss of smell) were compared between CYP with a positive test (n = 100) and those with a negative test (n = 272), while controlling for medical/demographic covariates. The average duration of symptoms for CYP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (8.5 ± 10 days) did not differ from that of CYP with a negative test (7.2 ± 5 days, P = 0.71, d = 0.046). A positive SARS-CoV-2 test did not increase the risk (36/372, 10%) of symptoms persisting for ≥ 3 weeks (odds ratio = 0.96, 95% confidence interval = 0.45–2.0). These results suggest CYP with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections experience a similar duration of symptoms as peers with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Recommendations for the prevention of RSV disease in infants and children: policy statement [^54d9d0b3]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus infection, more specifically with respect to immunization, infants and children, AAP 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that high-risk criteria include the following:

- children with chronic lung disease of prematurity who required medical support, such as chronic corticosteroid therapy, diuretic therapy, or supplemental oxygen, at any time during the 6-month period before the start of the second RSV season

- children with severe immunocompromise

- children with cystic fibrosis who have either manifestations of severe lung disease, such as previous hospitalization for pulmonary exacerbation in the first year of life or abnormalities on chest imaging that persist when stable, or weight-for-length < 10th percentile

- American Indian or Alaska Native children.

### Symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory viral infections in the first year of life: association with acute otitis media development [^96ac47ba]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sensitive diagnostic assays have increased the detection of viruses in asymptomatic individuals. The clinical significance of asymptomatic respiratory viral infection in infants is unknown.

Methods

High-throughput, quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect 13 common respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal specimens collected during 2028 visits from 362 infants followed from near birth up to 12 months of age. Specimens were collected at monthly interval (months 1–6 and month 9) and during upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) episodes. Subjects were followed closely for acute otitis media (AOM) development.

Results

Viruses were detected in 76% of 394 URTI specimens and 27% of asymptomatic monthly specimens. Rhinovirus was detected most often; multiple viruses were detected in 29% of the specimens. Generalized mixed-model analyses associated symptoms with increasing age and female sex; detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and adenovirus was highly associated with symptoms. Increasing age was also associated with multiple virus detection. Overall, 403 asymptomatic viral infections in 237 infants were identified. Viral load was significantly higher in URTI specimens than asymptomatic specimens but did not differentiate cases of URTI with and without AOM complication. The rate of AOM complicating URTI was 27%; no AOM occurred following asymptomatic viral infections. AOM development was associated with increasing age and infection with RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus.

Conclusions

Compared to symptomatic infection, asymptomatic viral infection in infants is associated with young age, male sex, low viral load, specific viruses, and single virus detection. Asymptomatic viral infection did not result in AOM.

### Community surveillance of respiratory viruses among families in the Utah better identification of germs-longitudinal viral epidemiology (BIG-LoVE) study [^6cb650cb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This study: (1) describes the viral etiology of respiratory illness by prospectively collecting weekly symptom diaries and nasal swabs from families for 1 year, (2) analyzed data by reported symptoms, virus, age, and family composition, and (3) evaluated the duration of virus detection.

Methods

Twenty-six households (108 individuals) provided concurrent symptom and nasal swab data for 4166 person-weeks. The FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC) was used to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Viral illnesses were defined as ≥ 1 consecutive weeks with the same virus detected with symptoms reported in ≥ 1 week.

Results

Participants reported symptoms in 23% and a virus was detected in 26% of person-weeks. Children younger than 5 years reported symptoms more often and were more likely to have a virus detected than older participants (odds ratio [OR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.08–2.94 and OR 3.96, 95% CI, 3.35–4.70, respectively). Compared with single person households, individuals living with children experienced 3 additional weeks of virus detection. There were 783 viral detection episodes; 440 (56%) associated with symptoms. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and influenza A detections were usually symptomatic; bocavirus and rhinovirus detections were often asymptomatic. The mean duration of PCR detection was ≤ 2 weeks for all viruses and detections of ≥ 3 weeks occurred in 16% of episodes. Younger children had longer durations of PCR detection.

Conclusions

Viral detection is often asymptomatic and occasionally prolonged, especially for bocavirus and rhinovirus. In clinical settings, the interpretation of positive PCR tests, particularly in young children and those who live with them, may be confounded.

The average duration of symptoms for CYP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (8.5 ± 10 days) did not differ from that of CYP with a negative test (7.2 ± 5 days, P = 0.71, d = 0.046). A positive SARS-CoV-2 test did not increase the risk (36/372, 10%) of symptoms persisting for ≥ 3 weeks (odds ratio = 0.96, 95% confidence interval = 0.45–2.0).

### The impact of viral genotype on pathogenesis and disease severity: respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinoviruses [^21c896b3]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) and viral death in infants. RSV disease in infants is characterized by epithelial desquamation, neutrophilic bronchiolitis and pneumonia and obstructive pulmonary mucus. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are by far the most common cause of symptomatic upper respiratory tract infection (URI) in people and are more recently appreciated as a significant cause of LRI. RSV and HRV are also implicated in asthma pathogenesis. Within both RSV and HRV, viral genetic differences play a role in disease severity and/or prevalence in patient populations, and viral genetic differences affect pathogenesis. Here, we review data on how viral genetic differences impact disease using RSV and HRV as examples, including effects on the host immune response. Virus genotype–phenotype relationships can be exploited in the laboratory to gain insight into mechanisms by which respiratory viruses modulate host immune responses and cause disease.

### Viral etiologies of infant bronchiolitis, croup and upper respiratory illness during 4 consecutive years [^629c3d0f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Prospective data on viral etiology and clinical characteristics of bronchiolitis and upper respiratory illness (URI) in infants are limited.

Methods

This prospective cohort enrolled previously healthy term infants during inpatient or outpatient visits for acute URI or bronchiolitis during September to May 2004 to 2008. Illness severity was determined using an ordinal bronchiolitis severity score. Common respiratory viruses were identified by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.

Results

Of 648 infants, 67% were enrolled during inpatient visits and 33% during outpatient visits. Seventy percent had bronchiolitis, 3% croup and 27% URI. Among infants with bronchiolitis, 76% had respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 18% human rhinovirus (HRV), 10% influenza, 2% coronavirus, 3% human metapneumovirus and 1% parainfluenza virus. Among infants with croup, 39% had HRV, 28% parainfluenza virus, 28% RSV, 11% influenza, 6% coronavirus and none human metapneumovirus. Among infants with URI, 46% had HRV, 14% RSV, 12% influenza, 7% coronavirus, 6% parainfluenza virus and 4% human metapneumovirus. Individual viruses exhibited distinct seasonal, demographic and clinical expression.

Conclusions

The most common infections among infants seeking care in unscheduled medical visits for URI or bronchiolitis were RSV and HRV. Demographic differences were observed between patients with different viruses, suggesting that host and viral factors play a role in phenotypic expression of viral illness.
