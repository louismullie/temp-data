## Question

An 84-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of lower back pain and lower extremity weakness for 3 weeks. Over the past week, he has also found it increasingly difficult to urinate. He has a history of prostate cancer, for which he underwent radical prostatectomy 8 years ago. His prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was undetectable until a routine follow-up visit last year, when it began to increase from 0.8 ng/mL to its present value of 64.3 ng/mL (N < 4). An MRI of the spine shows infiltrative vertebral lesions with a collapse of the L5 vertebral body, resulting in cord compression at L4–L5. The patient receives one dose of intravenous dexamethasone and subsequently undergoes external beam radiation. Which of the following cellular changes is most likely to occur as a result of this treatment?
A. Formation of pyrimidine dimers
B. Intercalation of neighbouring DNA base pairs
C. Generation of hydroxyl radicals
D. Formation of DNA crosslinks

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cellular change is most likely to occur as a result of external beam radiation therapy for spinal metastases causing cord compression, with options including pyrimidine dimers, intercalation, hydroxyl radicals, and DNA crosslinks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental mechanism of ionizing radiation at clinically relevant energies. Then, I should verify which of the listed options are classic consequences of that mechanism. Next, I will consider indirect versus direct DNA damage and the role of water radiolysis. Finally, I will eliminate the distractors that reflect non-radiation or non-therapeutic mechanisms and confirm the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism relevance. External beam radiation therapy in this setting uses high-energy photons that interact predominantly via the Compton effect, producing energetic electrons and secondary ionizations that drive biological damage, especially to DNA, which is the critical target for cell killing in radiation therapy [^e3c1bcc7].

> I need to check the primary mechanism of DNA damage. Most clinically relevant DNA injury from photon therapy is indirect, mediated by reactive oxygen species generated when radiation ionizes water to produce hydroxyl radicals, which then damage DNA bases and create strand breaks. Direct ionization of DNA contributes but is less frequent at therapeutic energies, and clustered damage from locally multiply damaged sites is a key determinant of lethality [^e3c1bcc7] [^1f1001c6].

> Now, let me examine each option carefully. Pyrimidine dimers are a hallmark of ultraviolet radiation damage, not ionizing radiation, so I should exclude A. Intercalation between base pairs is a drug-DNA interaction seen with chemotherapeutic agents like anthracyclines or acridines, not with radiation, so B is incorrect. DNA crosslinks can occur with certain chemotherapies such as platinum agents, but they are not the principal lesion from ionizing radiation, making D less likely than the indirect ROS mechanism. Hydroxyl radicals are the canonical mediators of radiation-induced DNA damage via water radiolysis, which fits the mechanism of external beam photon therapy [^e3c1bcc7] [^1f1001c6].

> Wait, let me verify the balance of direct versus indirect effects to ensure I'm not overstating direct damage. Multiple sources emphasize that indirect damage via hydroxyl radicals predominates at therapeutic photon energies, with oxygen fixing free radical injury into irreversible peroxides, which explains radiosensitivity dependence on oxygenation and the clinical efficacy of fractionation in exploiting repair differences between tumor and normal tissue [^e3c1bcc7] [^1f1001c6].

> Hold on, I should also consider whether any of the distractors could plausibly arise secondarily in irradiated tissue. While radiation can produce diverse DNA lesions, including base damage and single- or double-strand breaks, the options provided are mutually exclusive in terms of mechanism, and only hydroxyl radical generation aligns with the dominant indirect pathway in external beam photon therapy, reinforcing C as the best choice [^e3c1bcc7].

> Final answer: C. Generation of hydroxyl radicals, because external beam radiation at therapeutic energies primarily damages DNA indirectly through hydroxyl radicals produced by water radiolysis, leading to base damage and strand breaks that underlie tumor cell death and clinical response [^e3c1bcc7] [^1f1001c6].

---

The most likely cellular change from external beam radiation for spinal metastases is **hydroxyl radical generation** [^e3c1bcc7], which causes DNA damage and cell death. This indirect effect predominates over direct DNA ionization and is the principal mechanism of radiation cytotoxicity in this setting [^1f1001c6].

---

## Mechanism of action of external beam radiation therapy

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) delivers high-energy photons that interact with tissue to produce **ionization and free radicals**, predominantly hydroxyl radicals (·OH) from water radiolysis [^e3c1bcc7]. These radicals rapidly damage DNA, causing base modifications, single- and double-strand breaks, and clustered lesions that impair replication and transcription, leading to mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis [^1f1001c6].

---

## Cellular changes induced by external beam radiation

Among the listed options, **hydroxyl radical generation** is the primary cellular change from EBRT [^e3c1bcc7]. The other options reflect different mechanisms:

| **Option** | **Mechanism** | **Relevance to ebrt** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Formation of pyrimidine dimers | UV-induced DNA damage | Not produced by ionizing radiation |
| B. Intercalation of neighboring DNA base pairs | Chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. anthracyclines) | Not produced by radiation |
| C. Generation of hydroxyl radicals | Water radiolysis from ionizing radiation | Primary EBRT mechanism |
| D. Formation of DNA crosslinks | Chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. platinum agents) | Not produced by radiation |

---

Thus, **hydroxyl radical generation** is the correct answer because it is the principal cytotoxic mechanism of EBRT in this scenario [^e3c1bcc7].

---

## Clinical implications of hydroxyl radical generation

Hydroxyl radical–mediated DNA damage underpins the therapeutic effect of EBRT in metastatic prostate cancer, including **pain relief**, neurologic improvement, and local control of spinal metastases [^2f258ff0] [^e806f253]. It also explains radiation's oxygen-dependent cytotoxicity and the rationale for fractionation to maximize tumor kill while sparing normal tissue [^e3c1bcc7].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cellular change from EBRT for spinal metastases is **hydroxyl radical generation**, which drives DNA damage and tumor cell death; the other options reflect non-radiation mechanisms and are incorrect in this context [^e3c1bcc7].

### Metastatic prostate cancer: complications and treatment [^f39e3625]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Despite highly successful treatments for localized prostate cancer, approximately 35% to 40% of men will eventually experience a detectable rise in serum prostate specific antigen. A portion of these men will go on to experience clinically expressed extracapsular disease, with as many as two-thirds having evidence of bone involvement. Diagnosis of skeletal involvement involves serum markers of disease progression and radiological evaluation. Skeletal-related events are numerous and include bone pain, spinal cord compression, vertebral collapse, and pathological fractures. Current treatments for advanced prostate cancer include individual or combined hormonal therapies, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical treatments, and most recently, antiresorptive medications.

### Observation versus screening spinal MRI and pre-emptive treatment for spinal cord compression in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and spinal metastases in the UK (PROMPTS): an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^1f8f98c9]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Despite the substantial incidence of rSCC, the development of cSCC in both study groups was lower than anticipated. Cumulative incidence of cSCC at 12 months, the primary endpoint of the trial, was 6·7% (95% CI 3·8–10·6) in the control group and 4·3% (2·1–7·7) in the intervention group. The rSCC screen-positive subgroup were at particular risk (11·5% [95% CI 5·0–21·0] cumulative incidence at 12 months) of the subsequent development of cSCC. In the MRI screen-negative group, the incidence of cSCC was very low at 1·3% (0·2–4·4) at 12 months, but then increased to 7·6% (4·0–12·6) at 24 months, which is in accordance with previous suggestions of a 12-month so-called protective window of a negative spinal MRI from single-centre studies.A population-based study suggested a 7% prevalence of metastatic SCC in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer,although single institution estimates have been as high as 24%.Data from more recent trials using the new generation of life-prolonging therapies (eg, chemotherapies, new-generation hormonal treatments, and isotope therapy) have reported slightly lower incidences of cSCC (between 3% and 8%).,,Patients enrolled in the PROMPTS trial had biochemically progressing disease and additional systemic treatments were given as clinically appropriate. Effective systemic treatments reduce both the incidence of skeletal-related events, including cSCC,,,and are likely to have an effect on the progression of rSCC to cSCC. Assuming a similar but undetected rate of rSCC in the control group as in the intervention group, the rate of development of cSCC was considerably less than the rate of detection of rSCC. The reduction of use of systemic treatments in the intervention group in the 12 months after randomisation was unexpected, but a plausible mechanism might be through the effect of radiotherapy on progression in major sites of bone disease.In particular, the use of radiotherapy to treat sites of oligoprogression, arising from resistant subclones, might allow the continuation rather than change of systemic treatments.

### Harnessing the potential of therapeutic agents to safeguard bone health in prostate cancer [^8bdfa3e6]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The skeleton is a common site of metastases in prostate cancer; indeed, more than 90% of patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have evidence of bone metastases. The factors that determine the location of secondary tumors are complex; however, blood flow patterns and cell signaling pathways, such as the C-X-C motif chemokine 12–C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 axis, are both influential. The propensity for bone metastases also reflects the favorable microenvironment that results from release of growth factors during bone resorption.

Patients with bone metastases may develop skeletal complications, known as skeletal-related events (SREs), which include pathologic fracture, radiation, or surgery to bone and spinal cord compression. Spinal cord compression is of particular concern in prostate cancer given the high frequency of metastases at this site and its debilitating consequences, which can include paralysis. However, pathologic fracture and radiation to bone (used to treat bone pain) are also common in this population owing to bone instability in osteoblastic metastatic lesions. Patients with bone metastases can experience multiple SREs each year, placing a considerable burden on patients and healthcare systems. SREs are associated with increased mortality, substantial pain, and reduced quality of life (QoL).

### Characteristics and predictors of radiographic local failure in patients with spinal metastases treated with palliative conventional radiation therapy [^b93ef761]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately two-thirds of patients with cancer develop bony metastases during their lifetime, with the highest prevalence of bony metastases of 65% to 75% in patients with breast and prostate cancers.The most common site of bony metastasis is the spine.The main goals of treatment for spinal metastases are aimed at improving site-related symptoms, optimizing local control, and reducing risk of site-related spinal events, such as fracture and cord compression.,,Conventional external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has traditionally been the primary modality of treatment for spinal metastases, with larger doses of radiation delivered in a single fraction or smaller doses over a multifractionated regimen. The treatment dose limitation in conventional EBRT is the toxicity of radiation to the spinal cord.Among patients with a more favorable prognosis or with radioresistant tumors, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as a method for delivering high doses of radiation in a dose-escalated manner to the target vertebral region while minimizing radiation to nearby critical structures such as the spinal cord. For patients presenting with spinal cord compression, studies have also shown the benefits of radiation therapy (RT) combined with surgery in improving functional status.,In situations of spinal instability or vertebral collapse, surgery or vertebroplasty may restore spinal stability.

Although current treatments may palliate symptoms or improve functional status, there are minimal data describing patterns of local failure (LF) in patients with spinal metastases treated with conventional EBRT alone, despite its relatively common occurrence. The few studies that have reported on LF for spinal metastases after treatment with conventional EBRT have focused on metastatic spinal cord compression and reirradiation as endpoints of LF, which may not sufficiently capture true radiographic LF events and their clinical sequelae.,,Given the clinical implications of recurrence in the spine, understanding patterns of LF after EBRT is critical. Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate for rates, consequences, and predictors of radiographic LF within a cohort of patients treated with conventional EBRT alone for spinal metastases, to inform clinical decision-making for patients treated with this modality of RT.

18F-PSMA-11 was found to be noninferior to 68Ga-PSMA-11 in detecting PC in men with newly diagnosed or biochemically recurrent PC after RP. 3With only a 40% chance of correctly identifying recurrent disease at PSA levels <0. 2 ng/mL, many insurers in the United States will not reimburse a PSMA-PET scan unless the patient has documented PSA failure as per the American Urological Association/American Society for Radiation Oncology/Society of Urologic Oncology definition. 4, 5. Methods Patient Population and Treatment 6were excluded as were patients with a persistent PSA after RP. Therefore, patients included in this study could have at most one high-risk factor and needed to have achieved an undetectable PSA after RP. Follow-Up and Determination of the Cause of Death 4, 5or European Association of Urology.

7To assign PC-specific mortality as the cause of death, castrate-resistant metastatic PC on the basis of a rising PSA level in the setting of a testosterone level <20 ng/dL before death needed to be confirmed and in addition the treating oncologist or urologist at the time of death needed to assign PC as the primary cause of death and record this on the death certificate. Although the use of the ultrasensitive PSA after RP began during the conduct of the study, our finding of an increased ACM-risk when initiating sRT at a PSA cutpoint >0. 25 ng/mL versus
0. 25 ng/mL or less should not have been affected by the ultrasensitive PSA assay that measure PSA levels as low as 0. 01 ng/mL given that the PSA levels that were measurable at the start of our study were
0. 20 ng/mL or higher. Fourth, in the Radiotherapy and Androgen deprivation after local surgery-RT randomized trial.

Our results are consistent with this finding in that in our patient population where men could have at most one high-risk factor, we found no significant difference in ACM-risk for the use of aRT compared with sRT delivered when the PSA level was ≤0. 25 ng/mL.

indication to stop treatment

The panel stressed the fact that treatments with a proven survival benefit should in general not be stopped for PSA progression alone (in the absence of radiographic or clinical progression). There was consensus (82% of the panel) that at least two of three criteria (PSA progression, radiographic progression and clinical deterioration) should be fulfilled to stop treatment. In the case of unequivocal progression of visceral disease without clinical deterioration or PSA progression, treatment should be stopped and a biopsy can be considered to rule out secondary malignancy or small-cell histology. In case of significant clinical progression that is very likely related to disease without a rise in PSA or radiographic progression, treatment should be changed. It should be recognised that men with CRPC can often have worsening bone pain related to non-malignant processes such as degenerative disorders or osteoporotic fractures. Similarly, fatigue/asthenia can be a side-effect of treatment and may therefore not be a sign of disease progression.

use of osteoclast-targeted agents for reducing risk of SREs and SSEs in men with CRPC

In men with CRPC and bone metastases, two agents (zoledronic acid and denosumab) have been approved for reducing risk of SREs defined as: radiation to the bone, surgery to the bone, fractures, spinal cord compression and (for zoledronic acid only) change in antineoplastic therapy. In the pivotal trial by Saad et al. zoledronic acid was given at a dose of 4 mg every 3 weeks for a total of 20 cycles (15 months) with an option to continue for an additional 9 months extension (24 months). It is of note that the trial included a third arm using 8 mg every 3 weeks, which was reduced subsequently to 4 mg because of renal toxicity, and this arm did not show significant reduction of SREs compared with controls.

### External beam radiation therapy for palliation of symptomatic bone metastases: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^461172e4]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2024). High credibility.

ASTRO clinical practice guideline—methods and evidence review for external beam radiation therapy (RT) for symptomatic bone metastases describes a multidisciplinary task force, peer review, and an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) systematic review informing the recommendations. The task force included radiation, medical, and surgical oncologists, palliative care specialists, and a patient representative; the guideline was reviewed by 15 official peer reviewers and posted for public comment from November to December 2023. AHRQ searched multiple databases from January 1, 1985, to January 30, 2023; eligible designs included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative nonrandomized studies, and each comparative study included an external beam RT arm. In total, 53 RCTs and 31 nonrandomized studies were included for data abstraction, and the systematic review was not otherwise extended past January 30, 2023; given the relevance of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0631, this trial was additionally evaluated by AHRQ after its publication in April 2023 and added to the AHRQ report as an addendum. Outcomes of interest included pain (level and duration), skeletal function (overall function), relief of spinal cord or cauda equina compression, and quality of life, with secondary outcomes including reirradiation, local recurrence, fracture, use of pain medication, need for non-RT pain interventions, and overall survival, and caution should be used when comparing results across studies.

### Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases? [^3f743b80]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze, retrospectively, the patterns and behavior of metastatic lesions in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and to investigate whether patients with < or =5 lesions had an improved outcome relative to patients with >5 lesions.

Methods and Materials

The treatment and outcome of 369 eligible patients with Stage T1-T3aN0-NXM0 prostate cancer were analyzed during a minimal 10-year follow-up period. All patients were treated with curative intent to a mean dose of 65 Gy. The full history of any metastatic disease was documented for each subject, including the initial site of involvement, any progression over time, and patient survival.

Results

The overall survival rate for the 369 patients was 75% at 5 years and 45% at 10 years. The overall survival rate of patients who never developed metastases was 90% and 81% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. However, among the 74 patients (20%) who developed metastases, the survival rate at both 5 and 10 years was significantly reduced (p <0.0001). The overall survival rate for patients who developed bone metastases was 58% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and patients with bone metastases to the pelvis fared worse compared with those with vertebral metastases. With regard to the metastatic number, patients with < or =5 metastatic lesions had superior survival rates relative to those with >5 lesions (73% and 36% at 5 and 10 years vs. 45% and 18% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p = 0.02). In addition, both the metastasis-free survival rate and the interval measured from the date of the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer to the development of bone metastasis were statistically superior for patients with < or =5 lesions compared with patients with >5 lesions (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). However, the survival rate and the interval from the date of diagnosis of bone metastasis to the time of death for patients in both groups were not significantly different, statistically (p = 0.17 and 0.27, respectively).

Conclusions

Patients with < or =5 metastatic sites had significantly better survival rates than patients with >5 lesions. Because existing sites of metastatic disease may be the primary sites of origin for additional metastases, our findings suggest that early detection and aggressive treatment of patients with a small number of metastatic lesions is worth testing as an approach to improving long-term survival.

### Pathologic fracture and metastatic spinal cord compression in patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases [^b917c5c8]. BMC Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Forty-nine percent of patients had bone pain already at baseline and 89% eventually required external beam radiotherapy and/or radioisotopes during the course of disease. In a recent Japanese study, the corresponding figures were 45% and 51%, respectively. In that study, 14% of patients experienced bone fracture compared to 13% in the present one. A study from the US arrived at a rate of radiotherapy utilisation of 89% and development of PF in 23%. The threshold for radiotherapy utilisation versus medical management of pain might vary from case to case or centre to centre. This introduces a possible source of bias when reporting skeletal-related events (SRE) and was the reason for focusing the present study on major skeletal complications. It should be noticed that androgen deprivation therapy might result in bone loss and osteoporotic fractures. Depending on imaging modality, differentiation between osteoporotic and metastatic fractures might be challenging. In our own series, only 2 patients were thought to have had osteoporotic fractures. When adding these patients to the 9 with PF, the overall bone fracture rate increased to 18%. Additional PF after the first event developed in 3 patients. Most events occurred before initiation of treatment with zoledronic acid and/or taxotere, i.e. during the phase where patients developed castration-resistant disease. In some cases, PF led to the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Berruti et al. reported that 5% of all SRE developed before the onset of castration-resistant disease. Not all patients in our series were treated with zoledronic acid. The main reasons for withholding treatment were severe renal dysfunction and anticipated short survival, e.g. in patients with considerable extraskeletal metastases unfit for chemotherapy. Zoledronic acid significantly reduces the skeletal morbidity rate. Early treatment initiation in patients at high risk of PF and other SRE might thus be beneficial. We will later discuss the potential risk factors for SRE, which includes a broader range of events, and major skeletal complications, which we defined as MSCC and PF. In a series of 68 surgically treated patients with PF or impending fracture, median survival from surgery was 1 year. In our own series, all 8 patients with PF survived for more than 1 year (median 16 months).

### Skeletal-related events significantly impact health-related quality of life in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: data from PREVAIL and AFFIRM trials [^3c51774e]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The more pronounced effect of spinal cord compression on HRQoL likely reflects not only its magnitude of effect on HRQoL but also the timing of HRQoL measurement. As HRQoL data is only measured every 12 weeks, SREs may occur up to 3 months beforehand. Thus, for example, patients undergoing radiotherapy for pain may experience some resolution of symptoms and some level of recovery and relief before their next HRQoL assessment. Also, for example, in the case of a moderate fracture, many of its effects also may have resolved when HRQoL is next measured. In contrast, spinal cord compression has a longer duration of impact and sequelae are often still present when patients undergo HRQoL assessment.

Radiation or surgery to bone was associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful declines in FACT-P and FACT-G total scores in AFFIRM; however, in PREVAIL, none of the changes in FACT-P outcomes were clinically meaningful, although several showed statistically significant changes. These results are consistent with a previous study in advanced prostate cancer, where radiation to bone was associated with statistically significant declines in four of five FACT-G domains and a statistically significant reduction in EQ-5D utility index and EQ visual analog scale scores.However, although radiotherapy has the potential for beneficial effects such as alleviating bone pain, it can be associated with pervasive negative effects on HRQoL such as adverse events and the negative psychological effect of a patient realizing that the cancer is sufficiently severe to require radiotherapy and repeated hospital visits for treatment.

Pathologic bone fractures were not associated with statistically significant changes in any FACT-P outcomes in either study, although in PREVAIL they were associated with significant declines in EQ-5D utility index. In AFFIRM, although changes in FACT-P/FACT-G outcomes associated with pathologic bone fractures were not statistically significant, they were clinically significant; the lack of statistical significance perhaps reflects the small sample size. This contrasts with the study by Weinfurt et al. where pathologic fractures were associated with significant declines in two of five FACT-G domains and in EQ visual analog scale and EQ-5D utility index in patients with metastatic prostate cancer (some of whom were receiving antineoplastic therapy). Pathologic fractures can seriously affect HRQoL of cancer patientsand have been correlated with reduced survival in malignant bone disease.It may be that, in the context of the effect sizes associated with this variable, the small sample size caused the 95% CIs to include zero in this subgroup and precluded detection of statistical significance. Furthermore, pathologic fractures vary considerably in severity; it may be that the fractures in our analysis were not particularly severe.

### Radiation for treatment of painful bone metastases [^c8174c3b]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Several variables may be considered when deciding on optimal modality of radiation therapy for each cancer patient with bone pain, including prognosis, tumor histology, location and extent of metastases, and association with cord compression. Hypofractionated external beam radiation therapy is as effective as a multiple fraction radiotherapy course in most cases, although retreatment rates are higher after a single dose of radiation. Stereotactic body radiation may be used in cases of oligometastatic disease, repeat irradiation, and radiation-resistant tumors. Radiopharmaceuticals may be used for pain from diffuse bone metastases and have an overall survival benefit in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer.

ASTRO clinical practice guideline—indications for external beam radiation therapy (RT) in palliative treatment: For patients with symptomatic bone metastases, RT is recommended to reduce pain from osseous metastasis. For patients with symptomatic spine bone metastases, including those causing compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina, RT is recommended to improve ambulatory status, sphincter function, and reduce pain, with an implementation remark that before initiating RT, evaluation for spine stability and surgery are necessary. For patients with symptomatic bone metastases and an anticipated life expectancy of ≥4 weeks, RT is conditionally recommended to improve quality of life (eg, functional status, mobility).

### Risks and benefits of bisphosphonates [^2715d9fd]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Bone is a common site for metastasis in patients with solid tumours arising from the breast, prostate, lung, thyroid and kidney. Approximately 70% of patients with advanced prostate cancer or breast cancer and up to 40% of patients with other advanced solid tumours will develop bone metastases. Additionally, in more than 50% of men with advanced prostate cancer and around 20% of women with advanced breast cancer, metastatic disease appears clinically confined to the skeleton.

Bone metastases are typically referred to as osteoblastic, osteolytic or mixed, based on the radiographic appearance of the lesions. However, osteoblastic and osteolytic bone lesions represent two extremes of a spectrum and osteoclast activity is increased in most bone metastases, including the typical osteoblastic metastases from prostate cancer. Pathological activation of osteoclasts appears to play a central role in most disease-related skeletal complications and is, thus, a rational therapeutic target and the basis for the use of bisphosphonates across the range of cancers affecting bone.

Metastatic bone disease disrupts the normal homeostasis of bone, a dynamic process that involves the coupled and balanced osteoclast-mediated osteolysis and osteogenesis by osteoblasts. The resulting increased and unbalanced bone metabolism leads to a loss of bone integrity, which may result in skeletal morbidity. This includes bone pain, pathological fractures, a need for orthopaedic surgery to prevent or repair major structural damage, spinal cord and nerve root compression and hypercalcaemia of malignancy. Bone pain is the most prevalent of all cancer-associated types of pain, and may be severe, necessitating opiate analgesics and palliative radiation therapy and often accompanied by a substantial decline in patient-reported quality of life. Despite the many advances in the treatment of advanced cancer over recent decades, skeletal morbidity remains a major clinical problem with annual fracture rates of 20–40% and the occurrence of a significant skeletal complication every 3–6 months in the absence of bone-targeted therapies, such as bisphosphonates.

In Reply We agree with Lane et al that a standardized approach to assess for a persistent prostate-specific antigen post–radical prostatectomy would be beneficial in the clinical trial setting to advance our knowledge of how to improve cancer control outcomes for patients with a persistent PSA who have undergone RP for prostate cancer and moreover, to avoid the potential for overtreatment in patients who are entering our practice today. In our study1 we observed that the median time to an undetectable PSA for the patients with a persistent PSA assessed at 1. 5 to
2. 0 months post-RP and then observed without initiation of salvage treatment until at least 6 months post-RP was 3. 22 months with an upper quartile of
4. 04 months.

Therefore, one could consider the following approach to accurately document a persistent PSA post-RP. Obtain the first PSA assessment 3. 0 months after RP and, if detectable as Lane et al suggest, performing a confirmatory PSA to see if it is still detectable
1. 0 to 2. 0 months later before initiating salvage therapy for a persistent PSA. This should significantly reduce overtreatment and provide a more robust definition of a persistent PSA by reducing the false-positive rate.

### Bone health management in endocrine-treated patients with prostate cancer: a summary of evidence [^e11c0447]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Many individuals suffering from castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) endure painful metastatic bone involvement. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is proven to be highly effective, even when given as a single dose. In cases where radiation therapy is not feasible, a single administration of third-generation bisphosphonates can serve as an alternative treatment. Research indicates that third-generation bisphosphonates, such as ibandronate, are notably effective in treating patients with bone metastatic prostate cancer, particularly in alleviating pain. A study conducted by Peter Hoskin examined the outcomes of a single intravenous infusion of ibandronate compared to a single dose of radiation therapy in the management of metastatic bone pain. The findings revealed that radiation therapy produced a quicker initial response; however, no statistically significant difference in pain relief was observed between the two methods at both the 4-week and 12-week assessments. This suggests that while single-dose radiation therapy may offer superior pain control during the initial four weeks, effective overall pain management can also be achieved with a single dose of third-generation bisphosphonates. Common issues linked to bone metastases include vertebral collapse or deformity, pathological fractures, and spinal cord compression. The use of cementation can provide effective relief for painful spinal fractures, irrespective of their cause, significantly enhancing both pain relief and quality of life (QoL). It is essential to provide standard palliative surgical interventions, which can be beneficial in treating osteoblastic metastases. Recognizing impending spinal cord compression is a medical emergency that should be identified promptly; patients need to be informed about warning signs. If suspected, high-dose corticosteroids should be given, and an MRI should be performed as quickly as possible. A coordinated consultation with a neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon should be set up to consider possible decompression, followed by EBRT. Alternatively, EBRT combined with or without systemic treatment remains the preferred therapeutic approach.

Table 2 
Local radiology assessment of sites of rSCC and comparison of local and centrally reviewed radiology assessments of ESCC scores from screening MRI scans in the intervention group

Radiotherapy was given to sites of rSCC in 50 (82%) of 61 screen-positive patients (figure 1), with patients receiving a dose of 20 Gy in five fractions for 52 (91%) of 57 treatment sites (appendix p 7). Adverse events were uncommon after spinal radiotherapy for rSCC (appendix p 8). Grade 1–2 events occurring in at least 10% of patients were constipation (eight [16%] of 50 patients) and back pain (seven [14%]); one (2%) patient had a grade 3 adverse event of chest pain. Corticosteroids were given to 28 (46%) of 61 patients (median dose of dexamethasone was 8 mg [IQR 4–16], and the median duration of treatment was 11 days [IQR 7–19]).

Protocol-defined follow-up MRI was done in 32 (73%) of 44 screen-positive patients treated with radiotherapy and alive at 6 months. In these 32 evaluable patients, 39 (57%) of 69 assessable and treated metastases with rSCC had improved ESCC scores, 27 (39%) were stable, and three (4%) had progressed (two metastases from 1a–b to 1c and one metastasis from 1c to 3; figure 2 ; appendix p 9). However, in addition, 21 new sites of rSCC were seen in eight patients (figure 2 appendix p 9). At 12 months, in 21 evaluable patients (58% of 36 patients alive at 12 months), 37 (80%) of 46 assessable and treated sites with rSCC had improved ESCC scores, seven (15%) were stable, and two (4%) had progressed (two metastases from 1a–b to 1c; figure 2). A clinical decision was made not to treat 18 sites in four patients with rSCC (all ESCC score 1a–b or 1c); 12 (67%) of 18 sites had an improved ESCC score and six (33%) were stable, based on 6-month MRI assessment, and none had progressed by 12 months (figure 2).

### Real-world evaluation of primary versus secondary prevention of skeletal-related events in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^02ee00eb]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bone-related morbidity is a major concern in patients dying of prostate cancer. It is estimated 90% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) will have bone involvement before death.Bone metastases may result in a set of complications called skeletal-related events (SREs). SREs are defined as a composite of bone radiotherapy, bone surgery, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression.Palliative radiotherapy to bone for pain or fracture is the most common SRE with approximately 40% of patients undergoing palliative bone radiotherapy prior to death due to pain or fracture.Furthermore, rates of palliative bone radiotherapy are increasing over time and most patients treated with palliative bone radiotherapy receive multiple courses.SREs are a significant source of morbidity. They result in higher pain levels, poorer mobility, and worse quality of life indices.On a system level, SREs are linked with high health care utilization and expenditures.As such, minimizing SREs is an important goal for both patients and the health care system.

His next line of therapy was enzalutamide, a potent AR antagonist, and peripheral blood was collected for cfDNA (WCM63_1). He experienced a PSA response with decline of >90%, reflected in an estimated tumor fraction of 0.002, yet with rising PSA he was treated after 13 months with the addition of unconjugated anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody J591 on study (NCT02552394). With clinical progression (bone pain) and rising PSA, the bone-seeking alpha-emitting radiotherapy Radium-223 was administered with enzalutamide. Upon development of worsening back pain and immediate associated PSA rise, imaging revealed enlarging retroperitoneal nodes and a mid-thoracic spinal mass with soft tissue component. At this transition, a second plasma sample was collected for cfDNA analysis (WCM63_2), yielding a tumor fraction of 0.375, a 187-fold increase from the first plasma sample. Given extraosseous progression, systemic therapy was switched to the CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone acetate and prednisone (AAP). Biopsy of the soft tissue and bone spinal mass (WCM63_B) unexpectedly was found to be a carcinoma with squamous features (Fig. 1b (middle)). Suspicion was highest for a second primary of a squamous tissue origin, now metastatic to spine, although the possibility of this tumor being derived from a prostate primary was considered. A third cfDNA sample (WCM63_3) was collected during this interval prior to progression with a corresponding decrease in tumor fraction to 0.193. Following a brief PSA decline of nearly 50%, his PSA rose and radiographic progression was noted within 6 months of AAP initiation, including in viscera (liver and lungs), as well as prior sites of disease. A liver biopsy (WCM63_C) showed adenocarcinoma without variant histologic features and a fourth cfDNA sample was collected (WCM63_4)(Fig. 1b (bottom)), showing an increase in tumor fraction to 0.347. Abiraterone acetate was held and, given visceral disease and prior therapies, he was initiated on combination chemotherapy with cabazitaxel and carboplatin. PSA continued to rise with radiographic progression in liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and bones, prompting empiric initiation of chemotherapy with a small cell lung cancer-like regimen of cisplatin and etoposide, followed by progression in pulmonary metastases. The patient received carboplatin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab, the last added given evidence of HER2 amplification on WCM63_C via FISH (ratio > 2.0). After three cycles, the patient developed hemoptysis requiring hospitalization and bronchoscopy. Following discharge a single cycle of vinorelbine was attempted. cfDNA was collected (WCM63_5) with the tumor fraction peaking at 0.704, and the patient expiring 3 days later. A rapid autopsy was completed, as part of the WCM Rapid Autopsy program, which corresponds to samples WCM63_D-L (prostate, lymph node, soft tissue, lung [3], and liver [3]). A diagram of all anatomical sites sampled as part of this study is shown in Fig. 1c.

Radiation for distant metastases—external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for bone pain palliation: EBRT “is an effective means of palliating isolated bone metastases from prostate cancer,” and “a short course of 8 Gy x 1 is as effective as, and less costly than, 30 Gy in 10 fractions.” In a randomized trial of 898 patients, grade 2–4 acute toxicity occurred less often in the 8-Gy arm (10%) than in the 30-Gy arm (17%) (P = .002), but retreatment was higher in the 8-Gy group (18%) than in the 30-Gy group (9%) (P < .001). Another study of 425 patients found a single 8 Gy dose was non-inferior to 20 Gy in multiple fractions for overall pain response, whereas the SCORAD randomized trial did not show non-inferiority for ambulatory status of single-fraction 8-Gy EBRT to 20 Gy in 5 fractions. The Panel notes that 8 Gy as a single dose is as effective for pain palliation at any bony site as longer courses of radiation, but re-treatment rates are higher; other regimens, 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions, may be used as alternative palliative dosing depending on clinical scenario (both category 2B).

### Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression among elderly patients with advanced prostate cancer [^f009f643]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A recent randomized trial demonstrated that for metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC), a complication of advanced prostate cancer, surgical decompression may be more effective than external beam radiation therapy (RT). We investigated predictors of MESCC, its treatment, and its impact on hospital length of stay for patients with advanced prostate cancer.

Methods

We used the SEER-Medicare database to identify patients >65 years with stage IV (n=14,800) prostate cancer. We used polytomous logistic regression to compare those with and without MESCC and those hospitalized for treatment with surgical decompression and/or RT.

Results

MESCC developed in 711 (5 %) of patients, among whom 359 (50 %) received RT and 107 (15 %) underwent surgery±RT. Median survival was 10 months. MESCC was more likely among patients who were black (OR 1.75, 95 %CI 1.39-2.19 vs. white) and had high-grade tumors (OR 3.01, 95 %CI 1.14-7.94), and less likely in those younger; with prior hormonal therapy (OR 0.73, 95 %CI 0.62-0.86); or with osteoporosis (OR 0.63, 95 %CI 0.47-0.83). Older patients were less likely to undergo either RT or surgery, as were those with ≥1 comorbidity. Patients with high-grade tumors were more likely to undergo RT (OR 1.92, 95 %CI 1.25-2.96). Those who underwent RT or surgery spent an additional 11 and 29 days, respectively, hospitalized.

Conclusions

We found that black men with metastatic prostate cancer are more likely to develop MESCC than whites. RT was more commonly utilized for treatment than surgery, but the elderly and those with comorbidities were unlikely to receive either treatment.

### Observation versus screening spinal MRI and pre-emptive treatment for spinal cord compression in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and spinal metastases in the UK (PROMPTS): an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^92f56c19]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was incidence of and time to development of confirmed cSCC, with the timepoint of primary interest being 1 year after randomisation, according to local assessment. Participants were considered to have developed cSCC if they had a compromised Frankel score (ie, grade A–D) with supportive radiological findings. If there was diagnostic uncertainty, cases were centrally reviewed (by AH or JM) without knowledge of randomisation group using available data from MRI, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, and radiotherapy or surgical records.

Secondary outcomes were rate of detection of rSCC (Bilsky score [ie, ESCC score] of 1a–3) on baseline screening MRI (intervention group only) according to local assessment; 1 year and 2 year incidences and time (from randomisation) to functional neurological deficit (FND; Frankel score grade A–D) and irreversible FND (defined as Frankel score not returning to normal [grade E] after 3 and 6 months); incidence of any SCC (rSCC and cSCC ESCC 1–3) at 1 year after randomisation according to local assessment; overall survival; cost effectiveness; pain (using the short-form BPI); and patient-reported outcomes at 1 year after randomisation. Cost-effectiveness analyses were not done in light of primary results.

Statistical analysis

We estimated a 1-year cSCC incidence of 15·6% in the control group based on a baseline rSCC prevalence of 12·9% (calculated as the average rSCC rate reported in asymptomatic patients in retrospective studies,), median overall survival of 19 months,and assuming all participants with rSCC and 3·2% of those without rSCC at screening would develop cSCC by 1 year if untreated.A hazard ratio (HR) of 0·48 would be equivalent to a reduction in 1 year cSCC rate to 7·8% in the intervention group. Sample size calculations were based on a log-rank test with 5% two-sided significance. With 90% power, the original target sample size was 541 patients. In November, 2016, the statistical power was reduced to 85% to allow for timely completion of recruitment. The revised sample size of 414 patients (71 events) was based on uniform accrual over a 4 year period and a minimum of 1 year of follow-up for all participants. No adjustment for non-compliance with screening MRI was done.

### Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test-NCI (...) [^90ddbdfb]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

The PSA test measures the level of PSA in the blood. This test is used in several different ways:
- to monitor the progression of prostate cancer in men who have already been diagnosed with the disease
- to follow up on prostate symptoms, such as painful or frequent urination, blood in urine or semen, and pelvic and/or back pain
- to screen for prostate cancer in men who do not have symptoms of the disease. In general, a PSA level above 4. 0 ng/mL is considered abnormal and may result in a recommendation for prostate biopsy. However, because PSA levels increase with age, some doctors apply a higher cutoff for older men and a lower cutoff for younger men. In addition, a lower cutoff for abnormal is used in men taking certain drugs, including finasteride and dutasteride, which are used to treat BPH. These drugs lower the PSA level. What is done if a screening test shows an elevated PSA level.

If someone who has no symptoms of prostate cancer chooses to undergo prostate cancer screening and is found to have an abnormal PSA level, the doctor may recommend another PSA test in 6 to 8 weeks to confirm the original finding. If the PSA level is still elevated, the doctor may recommend continued observation with repeat PSA tests along with digital rectal exams to watch for any changes over time. If the PSA level continues to rise—especially if it rises quickly—or if a lump is detected during a DRE, the doctor may recommend additional tests. These may include additional blood- or urine-based tests, or imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging or high-resolution micro-ultrasound. Overtreatment exposes a person unnecessarily to potential complications.

These include urinary, bowel, and sexual side effects, such as leaking of urine following surgery; increased frequency and urgency of urination following radiation; loose stools or, less commonly, rectal bleeding, following radiation; and loss of erections or decreased erections, following both surgery and radiation. However, a single elevated PSA measurement in someone who has a history of prostate cancer does not always mean that the cancer has come back. Someone who has been treated for prostate cancer should discuss an elevated PSA level with their doctor. The doctor may recommend repeating the PSA test or performing other tests to check for evidence of a recurrence. The doctor may look for a trend of rising PSA level over time rather than a single elevated PSA level.

### Observation versus screening spinal MRI and pre-emptive treatment for spinal cord compression in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and spinal metastases in the UK (PROMPTS): an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^f50c4b44]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Most patients with cSCC (28 [72%] of 39) in the trial remained ambulant after initial cSCC diagnosis, with Frankel scores of D or lower, with similar scores between the treatment groups. The incidence of FND seems to be lower than in past reports. Most patients with prostate cancer and SCC have previously been reported to be non-ambulatory;,,however, this disease-related morbidity has improved in more recent years, although most patients still have motor deficits.We suspect the intended strict application of NICE guidelines for immediate assessment of new back painand protocol-required 3-monthly follow-up for 2 years might have had a favourable effect in both treatment groups. Early detection of cSCC might encourage use of more contemporary treatment techniques to treat spinal metastasis that are more effective in achieving local control (eg, stereotactic body irradiation,,,,). However, enthusiasm for early intervention after screening MRI should be tempered by the likelihood of overtreatment.

More imaging and radiotherapy resources were used in the intervention group than in the control group. This can be balanced against decreased use of new systemic treatments and possible reduction in FND in the intervention group. Refinement in the selection of patients for MRI screening would be helpful. In common with other investigators, we found that ECOG performance status, ALP, and PSA concentrations were related to survival.However, with the exception of ALP, we could not confirm previous observations that biochemical, clinical, or pathological parameters were risk factors for the development of cSCC.This finding might be because of the relatively small number of patients developing cSCC and the intervention for rSCC. We found that baseline PSA and ALP concentrations are related to the presence of rSCC, but neither covariate alone or in combination appeared to usefully stratify the patient population. We did not record data on extent of disease on technetium bone scan. Previous reports suggest that the number of spinal metastases or whole vertebral body involvement can be used to identify high-risk groups for the development of cSCC,,,,which might assist patient selection for screening MRI to detect clinically occult SCC.It would be helpful to assess the association between extent of spinal disease on MRI and other imaging methods and rSCC and cSCC and also whether the extent of spinal disease at the time of first development of bone metastases or at the time of development of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer might assist in stratification of patients for screening MRI.

### EANM guideline for radionuclide therapy with radium-223 of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^cfe1e330]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Radium Ra-223 dichloride (radium-223, Xofigo®) is a targeted alpha therapy approved for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease. Radium-223 is the first targeted alpha therapy in this indication providing a new treatment option, with evidence of a significant survival benefit, both in overall survival and in the time to the first symptomatic skeletal-related event. The skeleton is the most common metastatic site in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Bone metastases are a clinically significant cause of morbidity and mortality, often resulting in bone pain, pathologic fracture, or spinal cord compression necessitating treatment. Radium-223 is selectively accumulated in the bone, specifically in areas of high bone turnover, by forming complexes with the mineral hydroxyapatite (the inorganic matrix of the bone). The alpha radiation generated during the radioactive decay of radium-223 produces a palliative anti-tumour effect on the bone metastases. The purpose of this guideline is to assist nuclear medicine specialists in evaluating patients who might be candidates for treatment using radium-223, planning and performing this treatment, understanding and evaluating its consequences, and improving patient management during therapy and follow-up.

Surgery and postoperative RT for bone metastases—evidence and dose-fractionation—indicate that an RCT of direct decompressive surgery and postoperative RT compared with RT alone showed that among a select patient population with compression of the spinal cord, more patients receiving the combination of surgery and RT (3000 cGy in 10 fractions) maintained (94% vs 74%) and regained (62% vs 19%) ambulatory status as compared with RT alone; no RCTs have compared surgery alone with surgery and postoperative RT for nonspine bone metastases and spine metastases without cord or cauda equina compression; RT after surgery for bone metastases is recommended, regardless of whether surgery is prophylactic or reactionary after a pathologic fracture; and reported regimens range from 800 cGy in 1 fraction to 3000 to 4500 cGy in conventionally fractionated and hypofractionated regimens, with multifraction regimens such as 3000 cGy in 10 fractions being most common.

Radiotherapy, Radioisotopes, and Bone-Modifying Agents for Metastasis

Metastatic bone disease is a significant source of morbidity and is a common manifestation of advanced cancer, particularly primary malignancies of the prostate, lung, and breast. The most common sites of metastases include the spine and sacrum, with patients often presenting with pain, pathologic fractures, and spinal cord compression.

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is perhaps the most common treatment modality for painful metastatic disease, with short fractionated regimens now being favored over more protracted schedules. A single treatment fraction of 8 Gray (Gy) has been demonstrated to provide equivalent pain relief as conventional 30 Gy treatments delivered in 10 treatment fractions.Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), which employs multiple beams of radiation to provide highly conformal treatment, may be preferred for patients with radio-resistant cancers (ie, melanoma) or those with oligometastatic disease.

Radiopharmaceutical therapy is reserved for patients who have failed traditional radiotherapy or those with polymetastatic disease who are not candidates for palliative radiation. These agents are administered IV and selectively irradiate sites of metastatic bone involvement. The most commonly used radioisotopes include samarium-153 (153Sm), strontium-89 (89Sr), and radium-223 (223-Ra). Radium-223 is generally reserved for patients with multifocal disease from castration-resistant prostate cancer, while samarium-153 and strontium-89 may be used for other cancers. Most of the treatment efficacy data for radioisotope therapy is found in patients with metastatic prostate and breast cancer; therefore, its true clinical utility for other malignancies is unknown.

Bisphosphonates and denosumab may also be used for painful metastatic disease. These agents inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, potentially reducing the risk of bone fracture and related bone pain. In a Cochrane review of patients with metastatic breast cancer, bisphosphonates were demonstrated to significantly improve pain scores.The analgesic potential of osteoclast inhibitors has been questioned for other cancers, particularly in patients with non-small cell lung cancer where a systematic review showed no high-level evidence that these agents reduce pain or improve quality of life metrics.The use of calcitonin to reduce metastatic bone pain is also controversial, with limited evidence supporting its use.

### Assessing response in bone metastases in prostate cancer with diffusion weighted MRI [^da81f880]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether changes in ADC of bone metastases secondary to prostate carcinoma are significantly different in responders compared with progressors on chemotherapy.

Methods

Twenty-six patients with known bone metastases secondary to prostate carcinoma underwent diffusion-weighted MRI of the lumbar spine and pelvis at baseline and 12 weeks following chemotherapy. RECIST assessment of staging CT and PSA taken at the same time points were used to classify patients as responders, progressors or stable. ADC (from b=0,50,100,250,500,750 smm⁻²) and ADC(slow) (from b=100,250,500,750 smm⁻²) were calculated for up to 5 lesions per patient.

Results

Mean ADC/ADC(slow) in lesions from responders and progressors showed a significant increase. Although the majority of lesions demonstrated an ADC/ADC(slow) rise, some lesions in both responders and progressors demonstrated a fall in ADC beyond the limits of reproducibility.

Conclusions

Mean ADC is not an appropriate measure of response in bone metastases. The heterogeneity of changes in ADC is likely to be related to the composition of bone marrow with changes that have opposing effects on ADC.

### Observation versus screening spinal MRI and pre-emptive treatment for spinal cord compression in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and spinal metastases in the UK (PROMPTS): an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^13089dd1]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis of malignant spinal cord compression (SCC) is crucial because pretreatment neurological status is the major determinant of outcome. In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, SCC is a clinically significant cause of disease-related morbidity and mortality. We investigated whether screening for SCC with spinal MRI, and pre-emptive treatment if radiological SCC (rSCC) was detected, reduced the incidence of clinical SCC (cSCC) in asymptomatic patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and spinal metastasis.

Methods

We did a parallel-group, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3, superiority trial. Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were recruited from 45 National Health Service hospitals in the UK. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years, with an Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, asymptomatic spinal metastasis, no previous SCC, and no spinal MRI in the past 12 months. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a minimisation algorithm with a random element (balancing factors were treatment centre, alkaline phosphatase [normal vs raised, with the upper limit of normal being defined at each participating laboratory], number of previous systemic treatments [first-line vs second-line or later], previous spinal treatment, and imaging of thorax and abdomen), to no MRI (control group) or screening spinal MRI (intervention group). Serious adverse events were monitored in the 24 h after screening MRI in the intervention group. Participants with screen-detected rSCC were offered pre-emptive treatment (radiotherapy or surgical decompression was recommended per treating physician's recommendation) and 6-monthly spinal MRI. All patients were followed up every 3 months, and then at month 30 and 36. The primary endpoint was time to and incidence of confirmed cSCC in the intention-to-treat population (defined as all patients randomly assigned), with the primary timepoint of interest being 1 year after randomisation. The study is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN74112318, and is now complete.

Findings

Between Feb 26, 2013, and April 25, 2017, 420 patients were randomly assigned to the control (n=210) or screening MRI (n=210) groups. Median age was 74 years (IQR 68 to 79), 222 (53%) of 420 patients had normal alkaline phosphatase, and median prostate-specific antigen concentration was 48 ng/mL (IQR 17 to 162). Screening MRI detected rSCC in 61 (31%) of 200 patients with assessable scans in the intervention group. As of data cutoff (April 23, 2020), at a median follow-up of 22 months (IQR 13 to 31), time to cSCC was not significantly improved with screening (hazard ratio 0·64 [95% CI 0·37 to 1·11]; Gray's test p=0·12). 1-year cSCC rates were 6·7% (95% CI 3·8-10·6; 14 of 210 patients) for the control group and 4·3% (2·1-7·7; nine of 210 patients) for the intervention group (difference -2·4% [95% CI -4·2 to 0·1]). Median time to cSCC was not reached in either group. No serious adverse events were reported within 24 h of screening.

Interpretation

Despite the substantial incidence of rSCC detected in the intervention group, the rate of cSCC in both groups was low at a median of 22 months of follow-up. Routine use of screening MRI and pre-emptive treatment to prevent cSCC is not warranted in patients with asymptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with spinal metastasis.

### Radiosensitization in prostate cancer: mechanisms and targets [^1f1001c6]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 1 
Cellular Effects of Ionizing Radiation. Photons of radiation produce direct DNA damage, but it is less likely than indirect damage, where photons eject electrons from target biomolecules in the cytoplasm, creating multiple ionizations, especially in oxygen compounds and producing free radicals, which break DNA.

According to the Compton effect, multiple ionizations are created and this leads to multiple free radical formation. It is believed that these radicals are produced in clusters and in discrete areas. Thus, it is thought that the multiple broken bonds and subsequent nucleic acids damage are likely to be clustered as well. Often, the term “locally multiply damaged site” is used to refer to this phenomenon. It has been suggested that clustered DNA damage is critical to clinically significant effects. These effects truly depend on the cellular response following a radiation insult, including the ability to repair DNA damage and to activate survival mechanisms.

### Proper definition of postprostatectomy prostate-specific antigen persistence (...) [^3b8aed76]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor Patients with post–radical prostatectomy prostate-specific antigen persistence represent an understudied population. In their recent article, Tilki et al1 assessed the association between timing of postoperative PSA and secondary treatment. They concluded higher persistent PSA levels were associated with a worse prognosis and that PSA should be assessed for at least 3 months to minimize overtreatment. We commend the authors for investigating this important topic and agree with these conclusions to some extent but note that a more precise PPP definition is needed to inform research reproducibility and clinical trial design. We propose that PPP requires an initial PSA between 35 and 90 days after surgery, and a second, confirmatory PSA test be obtained when the initial value is detectable.

The false-positive rate for PSAs within 5 weeks is high—given the 2- to 3-day half-life of PSA—and a likely explanation for the paradoxical findings in the study by Tilki et al1 of lower all-cause mortality for patients with PSA levels higher than 20 ng/mL, generally considered a high-risk feature, compared with those with lower PSA levels. Their results indicate approximately 20% of PSAs were obtained within 5 weeks without mention of repeated testing. Similarly, in the MUSIC registry, we note that approximately 15% of patients have a PSA obtained outside the 35- to 90-day window and therefore, cannot be adequately characterized because they represent a mixed population consisting of detectable post-RP PSA with early false-positive testing results, true PPP, or early biochemical recurrence with late PSA testing.

We suspect that adoption of our more precise PPP definition will confirm the authors’ findings that higher post-RP PSA value is associated with PCSM and additionally show that higher pre-RP PSA will be associated with both increased incidence of PPP and ACM, as one would expect based on clinical risk. The problem of incomplete post-RP evaluation with PSA is common. Future studies and clinical trials should maintain a standard definition of PPP, separating these particularly at-risk patients from those with biochemical recurrence. Corresponding Author: Brian R.

### Symptoms predicting health-related quality of life in prostate cancer patients treated with localized radiation therapy [^be9cc4bf]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

With increased survival rates and advanced treatment techniques, general well-being and functional performance have become important outcomes for oncology treatments. For example, patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has become a key outcome measure in evaluating the effectiveness of cancer treatments. In addition, patient-reported HRQOL measures can guide treatment planning as well as symptom management for oncology patients.

In 2017, prostate cancer is the second most prevalent malignancy for American men, with 161,360 new diagnoses, and is the third leading cause of overall cancer death. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is one of the standard and effective treatments offered as curative therapy for men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Although radiation techniques have improved and EBRT has increased survival for men with prostate cancer, these advances still adversely affect physical, urinary, bowel, and sexual functions during treatment, and into survivorship following treatment completion, they negatively impacting their HRQOL.

A recent study reported significant urinary (i.e. frequency, nocturia) and bowel (i.e. diarrhea, urgency) issues experienced by men who had undergone or not undergone prior prostatectomy during the course of their EBRT. These symptoms persist for 12–24 months following EBRT completion. However, the reported short-term and long-term effects of these symptoms on HRQOL for this clinical population are inconsistent [,,–], most likely related to differences in the instruments and approaches used to measure HRQOL.

Clustering of symptoms related to cancer therapy has been associated with inflammation and an altered immune response. EBRT alters expression of genes and proteins associated with mitochondrial bioenergetics and biogenesis in prostate cancer patients receiving EBRT, which can impair cellular energy supply and possibly lead to inflammation under hypoxic conditions. Alterations in the expression of genes and proteins related to inflammation and mitochondrial function have been associated with symptoms related to EBRT. Investigation of the association of the expression of these genes and proteins with HRQOL of men undergoing EBRT may help us further understand the biologic underpinning of the relationship of symptoms and HRQOL.

Understanding specific symptoms that can predict overall HRQOL during cancer treatments can help patients and their clinicians better plan care during treatment, as well as the timing and design of optimal treatment options. The primary goal of this study was to identify symptoms that can predict changes in overall HRQOL during EBRT in patients with localized prostate cancer.

### External beam radiation therapy for palliation of symptomatic bone metastases: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^c009fc27]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Dose fractionation for initial palliative external beam RT in adults with symptomatic bone metastases—multiple RCTs determined that 800 cGy in 1 fraction was superior to other single-fraction dose regimens (eg, 400 cGy), and more than 10 RCTs have evaluated multifraction regimens with 2000 cGy in 5 fractions and 3000 cGy in 10 fractions among the most commonly used; most trials were limited to “uncomplicated” bone metastases without existing or impending fracture, spinal cord or cauda equina compression, or history of prior RT. Other multifraction regimens used included 2250 cGy in 5 fractions, 4000 cGy in 20 fractions, and 2400 cGy in 6 fractions, with 2400 cGy in 6 tested in the largest multicenter RCT (n = 1117) of single versus multifraction RT. Across 9 RCTs, overall pain response at 4 weeks ranged from 49% to 83% for single-fraction versus 53% to 89% for multifraction, after which there was no statistically significant difference in pain reduction, and shorter fractionation regimens (eg, 800 cGy in 1 fraction) are preferred given equivalence in pain outcomes.

### The role of intravenous zoledronic acid in the management of high-risk prostate cancer [^9fcf7b4f]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There are limited effective therapies that would persuade most urologists actively to screen for and treat patients who have developed asymptomatic bone metastases.

Recent Findings

Recently published trials regarding new treatment options for patients with high-risk metastatic prostate cancer are now available, which describe the utility of the intravenous bisphosphonate zoledronic acid.

Summary

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men in the United States. Many prostate cancer patients, especially those with aggressive and advanced disease, are at increased risk of developing bone metastases and, subsequently, skeletal-related events. Skeletal-related events may result both from disease and/or treatment of disease, and include bone pain, pathological fractures and spinal cord compressions. Furthermore, bone radiation and surgery to address bone-related pain, prevent pathological fractures and/or spinal cord compression are also considered skeletal-related events. These sequelae of bone metastases are both painful and debilitating, and severely compromise a patient's quality of life.

Conclusions

Our retrospective study has demonstrated that decompression and reconstruction surgery for symptomatic MSCC from PC might contribute to a favorable functional outcome among men with PC. Hormone-naïvety and mechanical/neurological function might be correlated with the postoperative outcome. The treatment strategy should be determined by shared decision-making among patients, urologists, radiation oncologists, and orthopedic surgeons.

### Solitary leptomeningeal recurrence from prostate adenocarcinoma after treatment with cytotoxic gene therapy, radiation therapy, and androgen deprivation therapy [^8c048896]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Leptomeningeal disease in prostate adenocarcinoma is very rare. Solitary leptomeningeal recurrence from prostate adenocarcinoma has only been previously reported once in the published literature.

Methods and Materials

A 63-year-old man with high-risk prostate cancer was treated in a phase I-II trial with androgen deprivation, radiation therapy, and cytotoxic gene therapy. He initially had biochemical control but experienced solitary leptomeningeal recurrence 47 months after diagnosis.

Results

He received androgen deprivation, radiation therapy to the lumbar and sacral spine, and stereotactic radiosurgery to 3 intracranial foci of disease. He died 14 months after leptomeningeal recurrence. Autopsy showed diffuse spinal leptomeningeal disease, leptomeningeal based intracranial lesions, and no other metastasis.

Conclusions

The cause for solitary leptomeningeal recurrence in this patient is unknown. Although there may be many possible mechanisms, we speculate that it could be related to his initial treatment with cytotoxic gene therapy along with radiation therapy and androgen deprivation.

### Burden of skeletal-related events in prostate cancer: unmet need in pain improvement [^0335562b]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Up to 75% of patients with prostate cancer experience metastatic bone disease, which leads to an increased risk for skeletal-related events (SREs) including pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Our objective was to systematically review the literature on the impact of SREs on quality of life (QOL), morbidity, and survival with a primary focus on the impact of SREs on pain in prostate cancer patients.

Methods

We searched PubMed, limiting to peer-reviewed English-language human studies published in 2000-2010. The search was based on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency definition of an SRE, which includes pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression (SCC), hypercalcemia of malignancy, and radiotherapy or surgery to bone resulting from severe bone pain.

Results

A total of 209 articles were screened, of which 173 were excluded, and 36 were included in this review. Patients with SREs had more pain and worse survival compared with no SREs. Pathologic bone fractures worsened QOL and were associated with shorter survival. Radiation therapy of SCC alleviated pain and improved morbidity. SCC was associated with decreases in patient survival. Radiation therapy and surgery to bone improved pain.

Conclusions

Specific SREs are associated with worse outcomes, including increased pain, poorer QOL, morbidity, and survival. Treatment of SREs is associated with improved pain, although there remains a need for more effective treatment of SREs in prostate cancer patients.

Results

Patient and treatment characteristics

The median age of the cohort was 66 years (range, 32-90). The median follow-up time was 7 months (range, 1-126). Seventy (93.3%) patients had a KPS ≥ 70. Most patients had either lung (n = 27; 31.4%), prostate (n = 18; 20.1%), or breast (n = 12; 13.9%) cancer as their primary site of disease. Six (6.9%) of the 86 cases presented with documented radiographic cord compression. Most cases were treated using IMRT (n = 51; 59.3%), while the remainder were treated using 3D-CRT (n = 19; 22.1%) or nonconformal technique (n = 16; 18.6%). The majority of cases (n = 38; 95.0%) with known spinal cord dose had a point maximum dose (D max) of <110% of the prescription dose (Fig E1), with the 1 exception a case that had a spinal cord D max of 28.5 Gy (114.2%) and another with a D max of 27.52 Gy (110.1%). All cases with known cauda equina dose had a D max of <110% (Fig E2). The majority of cases (n = 51; 87.9%) had a D max ≤ 27 Gy (D max of <108%).

The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

If new neurological symptoms suggestive of cSCC or new onset clinically significant back pain developed, spinal MRI was done, ideally within 24 h of onset, in accordance with NICE and local guidelines, regardless of randomisation group. All MRI scans leading to a diagnosis of rSCC or cSCC and a minimum 10% random sample of negative baseline scans were centrally reviewed (by AS, PR, JGH) and iterative feedback given to participating radiologists and oncologists.

For both study groups, the protocol recommended rSCC was treated (pre-emptively) with radiotherapy or surgery and that NICE guidelineswere followed for cSCC. Short courses of high-dose corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone 8–24 mg total dose per day) were permitted. Radiotherapy was to be delivered within 1 week of diagnosis of rSCC and within 48 h of diagnosis of cSCC. The recommended radiotherapy dose was 20 Gy given daily in five fractions, prescribed to at least the mid-point of the spinal cord or cauda equina. Radiotherapy was to be planned by conventional or CT-based virtual simulation using MRI information to determine the level and length of the radiotherapy field, which should extend to at least one or more vertebral level beyond the site or sites of rSCC or cSCC.

### Antagonizing CD105 enhances radiation sensitivity in prostate cancer [^19d3857c]. Oncogene (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in men. The standard of care for localized prostate cancer is radiotherapy or surgical resection. Radiation is also used as an adjuvant therapy following surgery, salvage therapy after biochemical recurrence, and for palliation in the setting of distant metastasis. Up to 30% of localized prostate cancer patients treated with definitive radiation therapy develop recurrent radio-resistant disease and the most common anatomic site of recurrence is within the prostate itself, even in patients at high risk of metastasis. Further, 50% of patients that undergo salvage radiation therapy after biochemical recurrence will have disease progression. Although dose escalation improves biochemical control, toxicity remains a significant obstacle in optimizing local control. Accordingly, sensitizing agents are needed to improve tumor eradication and minimize toxicity to normal structures. With the rational that targeting mechanisms of radio-resistance can yield durable sensitization, we identified a novel pathway affecting both DNA repair and energy demands manifested by irradiation of prostate cancer cells.

### Observation versus screening spinal MRI and pre-emptive treatment for spinal cord compression in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and spinal metastases in the UK (PROMPTS): an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^f286f503]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Limitations of this study include the non-blinded screening intervention allocation and the emphasis on patient and clinical staff appreciation of cSCC, which, although in line with NICE guidelines,might have led to earlier detection of cSCC than in usual clinical practice. With fewer events than expected, the study is likely to have been underpowered for the primary endpoint. Any assessment of the effect of radiotherapy treatment as an intervention is confounded by the use of additional systemic treatment options, but these are standard of care for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and included life-prolonging options.,,A pragmatic decision was made to use the short Frankel instrument to assess FND in oncology clinics rather than more detailed neurological assessments. Data completeness decreased with duration of follow-up, as might be anticipated in an increasingly frail population, but was similar in the two study groups. A full cost-effectiveness analysis is outside the scope of this report. Such a report would need linkage to hospital episodes statistics data for robustness and ideally include a contemporary non-trial cohort with cSCC for comparison.

In summary, we found reproducibility of an ESCC scale and we recommend its widespread adoption in oncology practice.We found no significant differences in incidence of cSCC or irreversible FND between the MRI-screened intervention group and the control group. Severity of cSCC, judged by Frankel scores, were similar between the two groups, although scores were lower than in previous reports. MRI screen-detected early rSCC does not always progress to cSCC with contemporary systemic management of castration-resistant prostate cancer and observation might be sufficient for ESCC grade 1a–b rSCC. However, particular vigilance is recommended for these patients with a low threshold for recommending spinal MRI if any new back pain manifests because they are at substantial risk of developing new sites of cSCC. Further efforts to better identify patients at high risk for rSCC and cSCC are warranted to refine selection of groups for screening spinal MRI. The low rates of neurological impairment suggest that patients in both the intervention and control groups might have gained benefit from trial entry and emphasise the importance of the early detection and management of cSCC in line with NICE guidelines.

Estimates were adjusted for known prostate cancer prognostic factors, age at RP, year of RP, and the time-dependent use of post-RP radiation therapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy. To convert PSA to μg/L, multiply by 1. pPSA indicates persistent prostate-specific antigen; uPSA, undetectable prostate-specific antigen. Meaning PSA level should be assessed for at least 3 months postoperatively to minimize overtreatment, and a higher persistent PSA level was associated with a worse prognosis. Importance Whether the conventional 1. 5-month to
2. 0-month time interval following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer is sufficient to accurately document a persistent prostate-specific antigen remains unanswered. Conclusions and Relevance PSA level assessed for at least 3 months after RP may minimize overtreatment, and in this study, a higher persistent PSA level was associated with a worse prognosis.

A persistent prostate-specific antigen following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer is associated with a worse prognosis compared with achieving an undetectable PSA level. 1, 2 While 1. 5 to
2. 0 months following RP is considered an acceptable interval to assess for persistent PSA. As shown in Table 2, based on the first PSA assessment after RP, patients with a persistent PSA level up to the median value of 0. 37 ng/mL were significantly more likely compared with patients with an undetectable PSA level after RP to have a pre-RP PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL, prostatectomy Gleason score 8 to 10, prostatectomy T3b/4, positive surgical margins, and positive pelvic lymph nodes. Some results deserve further discussion.

First, the shorter distribution of times to an undetectable PSA in observed patients with PSA greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less may be explained by the shorter time intervals from RP to PSA assessments in patients with a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL. This reversal of outcome may be explained by a higher proportion of patients with a pre-RP PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL compared with 20 ng/mL or less who were going to achieve an undetectable PSA if observed for a longer period before initiating post-RP therapy.

### Radium ra 223 dichloride (Xofigo) [^13343de0]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy and safety of Xofigo were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases. Patients with visceral metastases and malignant lymphadenopathy exceeding 3 cm were excluded. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. A key secondary efficacy endpoint was time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) defined as external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to relieve skeletal symptoms, new symptomatic pathologic bone fracture, occurrence of spinal cord compression, or tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention. There were no scheduled radiographic assessments performed on study. All patients were to continue androgen deprivation therapy. At the cut-off date of the pre-planned interim analysis, a total of 809 patients had been randomized 2:1 to receive Xofigo 55 kBq (1.49 microcurie)/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (n = 541) plus best standard of care or matching placebo plus best standard of care (n = 268). Best standard of care included local EBRT, corticosteroids, antiandrogens, estrogens, estramustine or ketoconazole. Therapy was continued until unacceptable toxicity or initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotope, hemi-body EBRT or other investigational drug. Patients with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, prior hemibody radiation or untreated imminent spinal cord compression were excluded from the study. In patients with bone fractures, orthopedic stabilization was performed before starting or resuming treatment with Xofigo.

### Skeletal-related events significantly impact health-related quality of life in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: data from PREVAIL and AFFIRM trials [^bbbfe585]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background:

We investigated the impact of skeletal-related events (SREs) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in phase III trials of enzalutamide versus placebo.

Methods:

Patients with mCRPC experiencing at least one SRE during AFFIRM and PREVAIL were assessed for trajectory-adjusted mean change in HRQoL by first SRE using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P; AFFIRM, three domains, and PREVAIL, nine domains) and EQ-5D (PREVAIL) instruments.

Results:

First SREs caused HRQoL deterioration in both trials. Spinal cord compression had the largest impact, with clinically meaningful reductions in seven of nine FACT-P domains in PREVAIL and all three in AFFIRM (mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) change in FACT-P total score –16.95 (–26.47, –7.44) and –9.69 (–16.10, –3.27), respectively). In PREVAIL, first SREs caused clinically meaningful declines in EQ-5D utility index, irrespective of category; spinal cord compression had the largest impact (mean (95% CI) change –0.24 (–0.39, –0.08)). In AFFIRM, FACT-P and FACT-General total scores showed clinically meaningful declines after radiation/surgery to bone.

Conclusions:

SREs were associated with clinically meaningful functional declines in the daily lives of patients with mCRPC. Spinal cord compression had the largest impact on HRQoL.

### Bone health management in endocrine-treated patients with prostate cancer: a summary of evidence [^950f2966]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Novel endocrine agents targeting the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway and cell cycle-related cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are the two standard treatment modalities for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Long-acting LHRH agonists currently represent the primary forms of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). These synthetic analogues of LHRH are administered via depot injections at intervals of one, two, three, six months, or annually.Decreased androgen levels in prostate cancer patients undergoing endocrine therapy can result in adverse effects such as hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures, cognitive changes, and depression. These effects can impact the physical and psychological well-being of the patient, ultimately leading to a diminished quality of life. Over 85% of CRPC patients develop distant metastases, specifically metastatic denervation-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), with bone being the most common site of metastasis. Bone metastasis-related adverse events (SRE), including pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, hypercalcemia, and bone pain, can significantly impact patients' quality of life and decrease survival rates. The focus on bone health in prostate cancer patients undergoing endocrine therapy has been growing, with increasing attention in recent years. Effective management of this chronic condition necessitates patient self-management, though discrepancies exist in healthcare professionals' knowledge regarding bone health management in patients receiving endocrine therapy for prostate cancer.Nursing staff may lack a comprehensive assessment of osteoporosis and fracture, leading to challenges in accurately identifying patients at high risk of fracture.Additionally, doctors may not have evaluated the bone health of their patients or implemented targeted measures based on their bone health status. Currently, there are clear practice recommendations for managing bone health in endocrine-treated prostate cancer patients. This study aims to consolidate the best evidence on bone health management in this patient population, drawing from guidelines, systematic evaluations, and expert consensus. The findings will serve as a valuable resource for healthcare professionals in enhancing the management of bone health in endocrine-treated patients with prostate cancer and improving the overall quality of clinical nursing practice.

### The percentage of high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma in prostate biopsies significantly improves on grade groups in the prediction of prostate cancer death [^59d75b29]. Histopathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients

Cases of prostate cancer were identified from three cancer registries in Great Britain. Within each region, collaborating hospitals were sought, and cases from these hospitals were reviewed. Men were included in this study if they were aged <76 years at the date of diagnosis and had clinically localised prostate cancer diagnosed by needle biopsy in 1990–2003 inclusive. The median date of diagnosis was May 2002. Patients treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy within 6 months of diagnosis were excluded. This was a practical measure to ensure that all men were not initially treated with radical therapy. Only initial hormone therapy was permitted. In addition, those with objective evidence of metastatic disease (by bone scan, X‐ray, radiograph, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, bone biopsy, lymph node biopsy, or pelvic lymph node dissection) or clinical indications of metastatic disease (including pathological fracture, soft tissue metastases, spinal compression, or bone pain), or a prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) measurement of >100 ng/ml at or within 6 months of diagnosis, were also excluded. Men who had received hormone therapy prior to the diagnostic biopsy were also excluded, because of the influence of hormone treatment on Gleason pattern. We also excluded men who died within 6 months of diagnosis or had <6 months of follow‐up.

### Re-treatment with radium-223: 2-year follow-up from an international, open-label, phase 1 / 2 study in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases [^d872eadf]. The Prostate (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the study focus on the design (nonrandomized), and the fact that patients were selected for non‐bone progression during their first course of radium‐223 and for their continued good performance status and good hematologic parameters at baseline before the repeat course of radium‐223. Outcomes for a control population with similar parameters are not available. DNA repair alterations were not assessed in this study in a systematic manner, but such studies could be informative with regard to understanding those individuals having more favorable responses to radium‐223. Patients with DNA‐repair defects have tumors that may be more susceptible to DNA‐damaging agents, such as radium‐223 or platinum‐based chemotherapy. 9, 10, 11, 12

### Observation versus screening spinal MRI and pre-emptive treatment for spinal cord compression in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and spinal metastases in the UK (PROMPTS): an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^bd7e97c1]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial to assess the role of screeningusing spinal MRI to detect and treat rSCC in metastatic prostate cancer. We found no significant reduction in the proportion of patients with cSCC at 12 months, with a difference in the cumulative incidence between control and intervention groups of −2·4% (95% CI −4·2 to 0·1). We chose to use a validated ESCC scale, with minor modifications. This scale was developed by Bilsky and colleagues,,,for assessing rSCC on both screening and additional MRI scans. Although this scale is not routinely used in the UK, we found that specialist radiologists in the participating centres rapidly adapted to the scoring system with iterative feedback from the central review team.All vertebral levels were scored and levels of rSCC were reliably identified by local and central radiologists as suggested previously.

We identified rSCC in 61 (31%) of 200 patients with assessable screening MRI scans. This proportion was similar to the 27–32% reported from previous single institution studies,,although higher than the incidence of 12·9% seen in asymptomatic patients. Any differences are probably due to patient selection factors varying between historical and contemporary cohorts and MRI reporting methods. 43 (70%) of 61 screened patients had ESCC grade 1a or b (ie, early rSCC), with a further 20% graded as 1c, and 10% graded 2 or greater. In the screened population, 82% of screen-positive patients went on to have pre-emptive treatment. Although consideration of surgical options,,,was encouraged in the protocol, treatment was uniformly done with radiotherapy. The protocol standard dose of 20 Gray in five fractions was used most commonly, which aligns with current practice for treatment of cSCC.The effectiveness of radiotherapy is usually judged clinically according to ambulatory status. We had the additional opportunity to assess response radiologically, and repeat MRI after 6 months showed only three (4%) of 69 treated metastases had progressed in two patients. However, 21 new sites of rSCC had appeared in eight patients.

3.3 Exploratory efficacy

All patients in the safety data set (N = 44) were included in the exploratory efficacy analysis. Radiographic bone progression occurred in 5 (11%) patients. The median time to radiographic bone progression was not estimated because 39 (89%) patients were censored (Figure 4 A). The maximum follow‐up time for radiographic bone progression was 16.3 months. Median rPFS was 9.9 months (Figure 4 B), and 19 (43%) patients had an rPFS event (radiographic progression or death), 6 of which occurred during the active follow‐up period, including 2 in bone, 1 non‐bone event, and 3 deaths. Censoring affected 25 (57%) patients. The maximum follow‐up time for rPFS was 17.7 months. Median OS was 24.4 months (Figure 4 C), and 28 of 44 (64%) patients died. The median follow‐up for OS was 31.6 months. OS was estimated at 78% at 12 months and 50% at 24 months.

Kaplan‐Meier analysis of time to radiographic bone progression (A), radiographic progression‐free survival (B), overall survival (C), time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) (D), SSE‐free survival (E), time to total alkaline phosphatase (tALP) progression (F), and time to prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) progression (G) [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

The median time to first SSE was 16.7 months (Figure 4 D); 14 of 44 (32%) patients experienced at least 1 SSE, although 3 patients were censored due to new cancer treatment, leaving 11 for inclusion in the Kaplan‐Meier analysis. First SSEs were EBRT for bone pain in 10 (23%) patients, pathologic bone fracture in 3 (7%), and spinal cord compression in 1 (2%). Median SSE‐free survival was 12.8 months (Figure 4 E), and 18 (41%) patients had an SSE‐free survival event, which included 7 deaths. Maximum follow‐up time for first SSE or SSE‐free survival was 27.8 months.

### Neurologic complications of prostate cancer [^3eda1d1a]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Neurologic complications continue to pose problems in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. From 15 to 30 percent of metastases are the result of prostate cancer cells traveling through Batson's plexus to the lumbar spine. Metastatic disease in the lumbar area can cause spinal cord compression. Metastasis to the dura and adjacent parenchyma occurs in 1 to 2 percent of patients with metastatic prostate cancer and is more common in those with tumors that do not respond to hormone-deprivation therapy. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the most frequent form of brain metastasis in prostate cancer, has a grim prognosis. Because neurologic complications of metastatic prostate cancer require prompt treatment, early recognition is important. Physicians should consider metastasis in the differential diagnosis of new-onset low back pain or headache in men more than 50 years of age. Spinal cord compression requires immediate treatment with intravenously administered corticosteroids and pain relievers, as well as prompt referral to an oncologist for further treatment.

### Prostate cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^60ae65c5]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer—rising PSA after radical prostatectomy: Early salvage external beam radiation therapy is supported when the treatment PSA is low, as treatment PSA level is below 0.5 ng/mL, and post-recurrence EBRT was shown to be most beneficial when the PSADT time was less than 6 months in a cohort analysis of 635 patients, while another study of 519 patients reported mortality reduction for both those with PSADT less than 6 months and those with PSADT greater than or equal to 6 months. Most patients with prolonged PSADT may be observed safely. Six months of concurrent/adjuvant ADT can be coadministered with radiation in patients with rising PSA levels based on the results of GETUG-16, but a secondary analysis of RTOG 9601 found that patients with PSA ≤0.6 ng/mL had no OS improvement with the addition of bicalutamide to EBRT. Two years instead of 6 months of ADT can be considered in addition to radiation for patients with persistent PSA after radical prostatectomy or for PSA levels that exceed 1.0 ng/mL at the time of initiation of therapy, and for 2 years of ADT, level 1 evidence supports 150 mg bicalutamide daily but an LHRH agonist could be considered as an alternative. ADT alone becomes the treatment when there is proven or high suspicion for distant metastases after PSA recurrence; pelvic radiation is not recommended but may be given to the site of bone metastasis if in weight-bearing bones or if the patient is symptomatic. Observation remains acceptable for selected patients, with ADT delayed until symptoms develop or PSA levels suggest that symptoms are imminent, and in all cases, the form of primary or secondary systemic therapy should be based on the hormonal status of the patient.

### Radiosensitization in prostate cancer: mechanisms and targets [^e3c1bcc7]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Cellular effects of ionizing radiation

To understand the mechanism and role of various radiosensitizing agents, it is important to review briefly the cellular response to radiation. Radiation is clinically administered either by an external source, linear accelerator, directed toward the tumor or an internal source, radioactive decay from within the tumor. Five mechanisms have been described to explain the way radiation interacts with matter, including coherent scattering, the photoelectric effect, the Compton effect, the pair production, and the photodisintegration. However, the Compton effect is widely viewed as the mode of interaction most relevant for the range of energies used in clinical radiation therapy. In the Compton effect, the observed biologic effect results from photons creating multiple ionizations by ejection of electrons from the target biomolecule. In this regard, the extent of biologic effects in cells after exposure to ionized radiation is largely due to oxygen with the subsequent production of free radicals. These free radicals can break chemical bonds present in critical cell structures and molecules, namely cellular DNA.

DNA is by far the critical target for the biologic effects of radiation. Cell death is strongly associated with the extent of DNA damage with radiosensitivity being more pronounced in cells that cannot effectively repair DNA damage [-]. Furthermore, cell death occurs at a higher rate when radiation is focused on the nucleus as opposed to the cytoplasm [-]. Disruption of DNA takes place via both direct and indirect effect of radiation. Taking into account the size of the cell and the small amount of DNA in the cell, most of the damage occurs indirectly. This means that the photons of radiation are less likely to directly damage the DNA, but more likely to ionize surrounding molecules, which subsequently destabilize nucleic acids. The mechanism behind oxygen radiosensitizing is related to this process of indirect damage (Figure 1). The presence of oxygen in irradiated tissues prevents repair of free radical-induced damage by forming irreversible peroxides in the fractured molecules. This process is sometimes called “fixing” the radiation. Many types of damage to DNA molecules, dimers, adducts, oxidative base damage, intra- and intercross-links, DNA-protein cross-links, single- and double-strand breaks can be detected after radiation exposure.

### A 64-year-old man with low-risk prostate cancer: review of prostate cancer treatment [^e12121da]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Earlier detection of prostate cancer in the past decade has been accompanied by greater reduction in US prostate cancer mortality than that seen with any other cancer. Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed at early stages and is most commonly treated by prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. For intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancers, randomized clinical trials have shown survival benefit subsequent to prostatectomy or to combined radiation with androgen-suppressive therapy. However, prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and brachytherapy each can lead to distinct adverse effects. Moreover, for the lowest-risk categories of early stage prostate cancer, evidence supporting an intervention is only indirect. New approaches to surveillance of prostate cancer have consequently emerged that do not eschew treatment altogether. Instead "active" surveillance aims to implement definitive intervention effectively for those low-risk cancers that show a propensity for progression as evidenced by histopathological or serological change during the surveillance interval.

### Skeletal-related events significantly impact health-related quality of life in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: data from PREVAIL and AFFIRM trials [^47a7ab35]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We investigated the impact of skeletal-related events (SREs) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in phase III trials of enzalutamide versus placebo.

Methods

Patients with mCRPC experiencing at least one SRE during AFFIRM and PREVAIL were assessed for trajectory-adjusted mean change in HRQoL by first SRE using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P; AFFIRM, three domains, and PREVAIL, nine domains) and EQ-5D (PREVAIL) instruments.

Results

First SREs caused HRQoL deterioration in both trials. Spinal cord compression had the largest impact, with clinically meaningful reductions in seven of nine FACT-P domains in PREVAIL and all three in AFFIRM (mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) change in FACT-P total score -16.95 (-26.47, -7.44) and -9.69 (-16.10, -3.27), respectively). In PREVAIL, first SREs caused clinically meaningful declines in EQ-5D utility index, irrespective of category; spinal cord compression had the largest impact (mean (95% CI) change -0.24 (-0.39, -0.08)). In AFFIRM, FACT-P and FACT-General total scores showed clinically meaningful declines after radiation/surgery to bone.

Conclusions

SREs were associated with clinically meaningful functional declines in the daily lives of patients with mCRPC. Spinal cord compression had the largest impact on HRQoL.

2.3 Endpoints

The primary endpoint was safety. During the active follow‐up period, AEs and serious AEs were recorded if considered to be related to the study medication or if related to an SSE, and all occurrences of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis, primary bone cancer, or any other new primary malignancy were recorded.

Exploratory time‐to‐event endpoints included rPFS defined as the time from treatment start to radiographic progression or death by any cause, time to radiographic bone progression, time to tALP progression defined as greater than or equal to 25% increase above the nadir value to at least 1.5 × upper limit of normal, time to PSA progression defined as greater than or equal to 25% increase above nadir and an increase in absolute value greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL above nadir, OS, time to ﬁrst SSE, and SSE‐free survival defined as time from treatment start to first SSE or death. SSEs included external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to relieve skeletal pain, new symptomatic pathologic bone fractures, spinal cord compression, and tumor‐related orthopedic surgical intervention. Time‐to‐event exploratory efficacy endpoints were calculated from the day of first radium‐223 injection (day 1) to the end of the 2‐year follow‐up period.

2.4 Assessments

Assessments conducted during treatment were described in the initial report. 8 Assessments during active follow‐up were vital signs, physical condition, complete blood counts, blood chemistries including tALP and PSA, ECOG PS, and SSE evaluations every 4 weeks for 12 weeks and then every 12 weeks until 2 years after the last dose of radium‐223 was received. Radiographic progression was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, chest x‐ray, and whole‐body technetium‐99 bone scans every 12 weeks until disease progression, start of a new anticancer treatment, or as needed to confirm suspected lesions. If progression was detected by bone scan, a confirmatory bone scan was required greater than or equal to 6 weeks later per PCWG2 criteria to confirm radiographic bone progression.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^8d02b4a0]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

NCCN Central nervous system cancers—spinal metastases with radiographic spinal cord compression are characterized by deformation of the spinal cord due to epidural tumor or retropulsed bone fragment, and for tumors occurring below L1, any canal compression of 50% or more should be considered of equal importance as spinal cord compression. Patients with radiographic cord compression should start on dexamethasone (10–100 mg) to alleviate symptoms, and decompressive surgery (concomitant stabilization if indicated) and adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is the preferred treatment (category 1) where there is spinal instability and no surgical contraindication. Primary external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) alone is appropriate for patients with radiosensitive cancers and without evidence of spinal instability; many fractionation schemes are available (8 Gy in 1 fraction, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, or 30 Gy in 10 fractions); the most common is a total of 30 Gy in 3-Gy daily fractions for 10 days. Primary systemic therapy is also an option for chemo-responsive tumors in the absence of clinical myelopathy with close neurologic monitoring, and in general, a treatment interval of at least 6 months is recommended.

### Effect of mechanical forces on cellular response to radiation [^adee3c55]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and perspectives

It appears clearly that the main receptors sensing external mechanical forces and the cellular pathways transducing this signal are also involved in the modulation of the cellular radiation response (Fig. 2). Despite a lack of reliable direct evidence, it is therefore conspicuous to assume that mechanical forces can play an important role in the radiosensitivity status of a tissue. The few studies that already investigated cell’s fate after irradiation as a direct consequence of changes triggered by mechanical stresses showed that mechanical cues indeed modify cellular radiosensitivity. Either if the increase in mechanical load radio-protect or sensitize tissue, or by which mechanisms these mechanical forces modify the radiation response, the answers to these questions are still unclear as the preliminary results appear paradoxical. This contradiction is probably the consequence of the complex environment in which the cells develop and the multiple interactions that both irradiation and mechanical stress can trigger within the tissue. For example, the attempt of combining RT with integrin inhibitor monotargeting in invading tumors led to a high rate of relapse and metastasis, and a recent study highlighted a better efficacy when targeting several integrin subunits, suggesting that a potential crosstalk and feedback regulation altering the biological response could occur between the different mechanoreceptors in response to either radiation and/or environment. To investigate such effect, there is a need for more developed models that should consider both chemical and mechanical cues.
