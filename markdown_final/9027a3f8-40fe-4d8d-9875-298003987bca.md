Oral flora

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the oral flora (oral microbiome), specifically its composition, biogeography, transmission, interactions with host immunity, and its roles in health and disease, culminating in clinical implications and a concise summary. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and scope to anchor terminology. Then, I should verify the core composition and diversity across domains. Next, I will examine spatial biogeography and niche specificity. After that, I need to review transmission dynamics and colonization. Then, I will analyze host–microbe immune interactions and homeostasis. Next, I should review functional contributions to health and the mechanisms of dysbiosis. Finally, I will synthesize systemic disease links, antimicrobial resistance considerations, and clinical implications, and close with a concise summary that ties these threads together.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. The oral flora, more accurately the oral microbiota or oral microbiome, refers to the community of microorganisms inhabiting the oral cavity, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses, and protozoa, along with their collective genes and functions. This community is highly diverse and structured across distinct oral niches, interfacing with host immunity and systemic health [^114MSDGh] [^1111Rgp1].

> I will now examine the core composition and diversity. The oral cavity typically harbors over 700 bacterial species, with estimates approaching 1,000, dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Spirochaetes. Common genera include Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Neisseria, Haemophilus, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium, though relative abundances vary by site and host factors [^1111Rgp1] [^115WjuPF] [^113QoD6P]. Wait, let me verify the non-bacterial components: fungi such as Candida are present and clinically relevant, particularly in immunocompromised hosts, and viruses including herpesviruses contribute to oral inflammatory disease; archaea and protozoa are less well characterized but are part of the ecosystem [^112qb1gT] [^111twEiG] [^114MSDGh].

> Next, I should review biogeography and niche specificity. The oral cavity is a mosaic of microenvironments — saliva, tongue dorsum, buccal mucosa, hard and soft palate, supra- and subgingival plaque — with distinct oxygen gradients, pH, redox potential, and salivary flow shaping community structure; for example, subgingival sites are more anaerobic and harbor periodontal pathogens, whereas buccal and palatal surfaces are more aerobic [^114MSDGh] [^113gnSWx]. Hold on, I should verify cross-niche connectivity: despite niche specificity, there are measurable correlations across oral sites, and saliva acts as a conduit for microbial exchange, influencing community dynamics and recovery after perturbation [^111s7htH] [^115WjuPF] [^115Vacsm].

> I need to check transmission and colonization dynamics. Unlike the gut, where maternal vertical transmission is prominent, the oral microbiome transmits largely horizontally within households, with strain-sharing rates rising with cohabitation duration; mother-to-infant oral strain sharing is detectable but less dominant than for the gut [^115kP8Dh] [^116u7yqw]. Let me consider ecological succession: early colonizers such as streptococci establish biofilms, enabling later taxa to integrate, and communities can recover after disturbance, though recovery trajectories vary by site and host context [^11527V3d] [^115Vacsm].

> Now, I will examine host–microbe immune interactions and homeostasis. The oral mucosa is unique because teeth create transmucosal interfaces lacking tight junctions, necessitating specialized defenses; neutrophils form a barrier in the gingival sulcus, and epithelial signaling (for example, IL-8 gradients) coordinates antimicrobial and inflammatory responses to maintain homeostasis [^117T6boR] [^116imiQn]. Hold on, I should verify tolerance mechanisms: balanced immunoregulation prevents overt inflammation to commensals while enabling pathogen control, and early-life imprinting shapes lifelong oral mucosal immunity and disease susceptibility [^116aNQhh].

> Next, I should review functional contributions to health. The oral microbiome participates in nitrate–nitrite–nitric oxide metabolism, influencing vascular tone and cardiometabolic outcomes; it supports digestion and nutrient processing, and contributes to immune maturation and barrier integrity, illustrating that oral microbes are not mere passengers but active metabolic partners [^115BqCQD] [^114TFptV]. Wait, let me double-check the nitrate pathway claim: yes, oral nitrate-reducing bacteria augment systemic NO bioavailability, linking oral ecology to blood pressure regulation and metabolic homeostasis [^115BqCQD].

> I will now examine dysbiosis and disease mechanisms. Dysbiosis arises from ecological shifts driven by diet, smoking, antibiotics, and host inflammation; in periodontitis, pathobionts such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum disrupt immune homeostasis and foster polymicrobial pathogenesis, while caries reflects sugar-driven acidogenic shifts in biofilm metabolism [^114U4AUQ] [^116GycT8]. But wait, what if oral bacteria contribute beyond the mouth? Indeed, oral bacteria can translocate to the gut and other sites, especially under inflammatory or barrier-compromised conditions, contributing to systemic disease risk [^11512Zjc].

> Let me consider systemic disease links, and I should be cautious not to overstate causality. Robust associations link oral dysbiosis to cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, respiratory diseases, and neurodegenerative conditions; mechanisms include bacteremia, immune activation, and microbial metabolism, with Fusobacterium nucleatum repeatedly implicated as a key pathobiont in colorectal cancer and IBD pathogenesis [^111d2zK5] [^111z2yhS] [^113nHEXs] [^113J6EV9] [^1141NPGH]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: many data are observational; still, convergent evidence supports oral–gut and oral–systemic axes, and oral bacteria have been detected in distant organs, supporting plausible causal pathways in select contexts [^11675AZ8] [^11512Zjc].

> I should confirm antimicrobial resistance implications. The oral cavity contains a high abundance but lower diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes compared with the gut, with body site–specific ARG–species associations; early-life acquisition and household sharing shape the oral resistome, and mobile genetic elements, including recently described giant extrachromosomal elements, expand adaptive capacity in oral bacteria [^112sUUba] [^111FZfeM] [^1136KeA1]. Wait, I need to ensure I'm precise: while oral ARG abundance can be high, diversity is typically lower than in the gut, and pharmacokinetic exposure differs, influencing selection pressures and ARG persistence across sites [^112sUUba] [^113fVHHK].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and interventions. Standard oral hygiene reduces pathogenic biofilm burden, and professional periodontal care mitigates systemic inflammatory risk. In oncology and transplant settings, oral care protocols reduce mucositis and may influence immunotherapy tolerability, underscoring oral health as a modifiable risk factor [^114QGdfR] [^112sAez7]. Let me verify antimicrobial rinse effects: chlorhexidine gluconate reduces plaque bacterial counts substantially during use, with minimal systemic absorption and no durable resistance emergence in trials, though ecological disruption remains a concern with repeated or indiscriminate use [^114b7gRd] [^112VZbMP]. I should also note that oral microbiome profiling is being explored for biomarker discovery and precision prevention, but translation requires standardized sampling and longitudinal validation [^115Vacsm].

> Finally, I will synthesize a concise summary. The oral microbiome is a highly diverse, spatially structured ecosystem of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea that co-evolves with the host. It is shaped by transmission within households, niche-specific ecology, and immune homeostasis, and it contributes essential metabolic and immunomodulatory functions. Dysbiosis perturbs local and systemic health via immune activation and microbial translocation, offering clinically actionable opportunities through hygiene, periodontal care, and targeted microbiome strategies [^114MSDGh] [^115kP8Dh] [^11675AZ8].

---

The oral flora is a complex, dynamic ecosystem of **700–1,000 microbial species** [^114MSDGh] [^1111Rgp1] (bacteria, fungi, viruses, archaea) that varies by site [^112SCcdH] and is shaped by hygiene, diet, smoking, and antibiotics [^1111Rgp1] [^117R2y2W] [^116LMvAJ]. It provides barrier defense, aids digestion, and modulates immunity [^114QGdfR] [^114TFptV]; dysbiosis drives caries, periodontitis, and halitosis, and is linked to systemic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and respiratory infections [^111d2zK5] [^113J6EV9]. Oral bacteria can translocate to the gut and lungs [^11675AZ8], influencing distant health [^11512Zjc] [^112tiJyE]. Maintaining oral health through hygiene, diet, and judicious antibiotic use preserves microbial balance and overall health [^117R2y2W] [^115UaNq8].

## Composition of oral flora

The oral cavity harbors a **highly diverse microbial community**, including:

- **Bacteria**: Predominant phyla include Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Spirochaetes [^115WjuPF]. Common genera include Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Porphyromonas [^113QoD6P].

- **Fungi**: Candida species, particularly Candida albicans, are common commensals but can become pathogenic under immunosuppressed conditions [^112qb1gT] [^115AYN4E].

- **Viruses**: Herpesviruses and other viral communities are present and associated with oral diseases [^111twEiG].

- **Archaea**: Methanobrevibacter species are identified in the oral cavity, though their role remains less well understood [^notfound].

---

## Distribution and biogeography

Microbial distribution varies across oral sites, reflecting **local environmental conditions** such as oxygen availability, pH, and salivary flow [^113gnSWx]:

| **Oral site** | **Predominant microbial genera** |
|-|-|
| Saliva | - Streptococcus <br/> - Prevotella <br/> - Veillonella <br/> - Neisseria <br/> - Haemophilus [^113QoD6P] |

## Factors influencing oral flora

Several factors influence the **composition and diversity** of oral microbial communities:

- **Hygiene practices**: Poor oral hygiene promotes pathogenic bacterial overgrowth, leading to dysbiosis [^113J6EV9].

- **Diet**: High sugar intake fosters acidogenic bacteria, increasing caries risk [^115bQ36b].

- **Smoking**: Alters microbial composition, increasing periodontal pathogens and reducing beneficial species [^notfound].

- **Antibiotics**: Significantly disrupt microbial balance, often leading to overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens [^113295y3].

---

## Role in health

The oral flora plays a **critical role in maintaining oral and systemic health**:

- **Barrier protection**: Prevents colonization by pathogenic microorganisms [^114QGdfR].

- **Digestion**: Initiates carbohydrate metabolism and nitrate reduction, influencing systemic nitric oxide availability and cardiovascular health [^114TFptV].

- **Immune modulation**: Shapes immune responses, promoting tolerance to commensals while defending against pathogens [^114QGdfR].

---

## Consequences of dysbiosis

Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, leads to **various oral and systemic diseases**:

- **Oral diseases**: Dental caries, periodontitis, gingivitis, and halitosis [^114U4AUQ].

- **Systemic diseases**: Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory infections, and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^111d2zK5] [^113J6EV9].

- **Cancer**: Associations with colorectal cancer and other malignancies through bacterial translocation and inflammation [^111z2yhS] [^111zWxFt].

---

## Interactions with other body systems

The oral microbiome interacts with other body systems through **microbial translocation** and **immune modulation**. The **oral-gut axis** allows oral bacteria to migrate to the gut, influencing gastrointestinal health and disease [^11675AZ8] [^111zWxFt], while the **oral-respiratory axis** involves aspiration of oral bacteria into the lungs, contributing to respiratory infections and chronic lung diseases [^113J6EV9] [^115vuFux].

---

## Clinical implications and interventions

Understanding oral flora has significant clinical implications:

- **Preventive care**: Regular oral hygiene, fluoride use, and dietary control maintain microbial balance and prevent disease [^notfound].

- **Therapeutic interventions**: Probiotics, prebiotics, and antimicrobial mouthwashes are being explored to restore healthy microbial communities [^114Ca8Zv] [^115UaNq8].

- **Personalized medicine**: Microbiome profiling may inform individualized treatment strategies for oral and systemic diseases [^112SCcdH].

---

The oral flora is a **complex microbial ecosystem** essential for oral and systemic health. Dysbiosis contributes to disease, and maintaining balance through hygiene, diet, and targeted interventions is key to overall health.

Conclusions

In this cross-sectional study of the oral microbiome of adults who participated in 2 cycles of NHANES, we characterized the composition, diversity, and correlates of the oral microbiome (colloquially, the mouth of America). The NCHS made all the NHANES results available to the research community. This comprehensive characterization, along with the anticipated use of the data by the scientific community, portends a deeper understanding of the role of the oral microbiome in human health. It also provides a contemporary reference standard for future studies.

### Quantitative metaproteomics of medieval dental calculus reveals individual oral health status [^112yAM1N]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The challenges associated with studying and comparing oral microbiome bacteria are mainly due to the individuality of oral flora, differences in sampling strategies and their localities, and the large number of very different microorganisms. Furthermore, many oral bacterial species have only recently been discovered via 16S rRNA studies, and many have proven difficult or even impossible to culture, and thus, remain poorly understood. The metaproteomes of dental calculus displays very different bacterial generic profiles compared to a number of clinical genomics-based studies. The curation of comparative DNA/RNA/Protein databases is crucial for meaningful identification of species, and it stands to reason that there may be human oral taxa that are no longer present in modern Western populations and, therefore, absent in the core databases. The oral microbiome is highly individual, and even varies within the mouth, as the two samples (#2 and #10) taken from the same individual demonstrate. There is a general agreement that bacterial composition shifts in healthy versus diseased microbiomes leading to dysbiosis, but global comparisons across individuals are still complicated to perform due to individuality, and it has even been suggested that microbiomes are as unique as fingerprints.

### Is the oral microbiome a source to enhance mucosal immunity against infectious diseases? [^116fhhwo]. NPJ Vaccines (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The diversity of the microbiome has been implicated as a driver for differences in vaccine efficacy across geographical regions. In this vein, the use of probiotics has been investigated as a method to improve vaccine response with some successes. In a meta-analysis of probiotic-use in vaccine clinical study, the authors found that while there was significant variability, the probiotic effect was most notable for orally applied vaccines. Some of the studies that were highlighted as successful showcased outcomes that included increased IgA responses and elicited cell-mediated and humoral immunity. It is not known whether the successes of the probiotic applications were due to direct effect of the probiotic or the specific activity of the host-microbiome. Together, these studies underscore the potential of the host-bacterial constituents as a powerful source of adjuvant-activity that could be harnessed for immune-modulation of the vaccine response and may offer a path around the steep regulatory hurdle that most adjuvants incur during development. The oral microbiome is a rich source of potential with regard to adjuvant activity which is convenient since the oral cavity is also the ideal site for vaccine inoculation. Investigation into the microbial products, metabolites responsible for coordinating specific immune protection will likely be a fruitful endeavor for identifying adjuvants, and will also provide a better understanding of how immunity is shaped by our microbiome.

### The oral microbiome: diversity, biogeography and human health [^114MSDGh]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

The human oral microbiota is highly diverse and has a complex ecology, comprising bacteria, microeukaryotes, archaea and viruses. These communities have elaborate and highly structured biogeography that shapes metabolic exchange on a local scale and results from the diverse microenvironments present in the oral cavity. The oral microbiota also interfaces with the immune system of the human host and has an important role in not only the health of the oral cavity but also systemic health. In this Review, we highlight recent advances including novel insights into the biogeography of several oral niches at the species level, as well as the ecological role of candidate phyla radiation bacteria and non-bacterial members of the oral microbiome. In addition, we summarize the relationship between the oral microbiota and the pathology of oral diseases and systemic diseases. Together, these advances move the field towards a more holistic understanding of the oral microbiota and its role in health, which in turn opens the door to the study of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies.

### The role of oral microbiome in respiratory health and diseases [^113J6EV9]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The oral cavity (mouth) has various microbial habitats, including, teeth, gingival sulcus, gingiva, tongue, inner cheek, hard palate, and soft palate. The human oral cavity houses the second most diverse microbiome in the body harboring over 700 bacterial species. The fine-tuned equilibrium of the oral microbiome ecosystem maintains oral health. Oral dysbiosis caused by food habits and poor oral hygiene leads to various oral diseases such as periodontitis, caries, gingivitis, and oral cancer. Recent advances in technology have revealed the correlation between the oral microbiome and systemic diseases such as pulmonary diseases, cardiovascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and other metabolic diseases. Since the oral cavity directly connects with the upper respiratory tract, the oral microbiome has easier access to the respiratory system compared to other organ systems. Direct aspiration of oral microflora in the respiratory system and oral dysbiosis-induced host immune reaction and inflammation are mainly responsible for various pulmonary complications. Numbers of literature have reported the correlation between oral diseases and pulmonary diseases, suggesting the possible role of the oral microbiome in respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, pneumonia, lung cancer, etc. This paper reviews the current evidence in establishing a link between the oral microbiome and pulmonary diseases. We also discuss future research directions focusing on the oral microbiome to unravel novel therapeutic approaches that could prevent or treat the various pulmonary complications.

### Beyond microbial community composition: functional activities of the oral microbiome in health and disease [^116yYQNP]. Microbes and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

The oral microbiome plays a relevant role in the health status of the host and is a key element in a variety of oral and non-oral diseases. Despite advances in our knowledge of changes in microbial composition associated with different health conditions the functional aspects of the oral microbiome that lead to dysbiosis remain for the most part unknown. In this review, we discuss the progress made towards understanding the functional role of the oral microbiome in health and disease and how novel technologies are expanding our knowledge on this subject.

### Abundance and diversity of resistomes differ between healthy human oral cavities and gut [^113fVHHK]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Antibiotic use leading to acquisition of ARGs is another potential factor. Pharmacokinetics of orally administered antibiotics suggests that the oral cavity and oesophagus would be only briefly exposed to the antibiotic during swallowing, whilst the gut is exposed over a more prolonged period. As antibiotics transit through the intestinal tract, they are gradually absorbed via the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream. Therefore, microbes in the gut exposed to antibiotics for a longer period of time due to their increased bioavailability will receive higher antibiotic selection pressures than those in the oral cavity. The incidences where the oral cavity is likely to acquire ARGs from selective pressures of local antibiotics are from topical antibiotics for periodontal infections or orally administered antibiotics being absorbed into the bloodstream.

The differences in ARG profiles across body sites has significant implications for the characterisation and interpretation of resistome studies. Previous shotgun metagenomic studies have focused almost exclusively on the resistome from the human gut –. Whilst the gut may be a diverse reservoir of ARGs, whether these genes are particularly prevalent or have the potential for expression sufficient to drive resistant infections at other body sites is not clear. It is therefore imperative that to test potential applications of non-culture-based metagenomic AMR surveillance, we need to characterise the resistome at different body sites with different pharmacokinetic exposures to antimicrobials. This information can then be integrated with culture-based susceptibility tests, culturomicsand functional metagenomic screensto determine the expression potential of these ARGs. In doing so, we will obtain a more complete picture of the state of AMR within a population.

### Oral inflammation and microbiome dysbiosis exacerbate chronic graft-versus-host disease [^1126ij9R]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent advances in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) improved the long-term survival of HCT recipients and with this the incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD).cGVHD affects multiple organs including the hematopoietic system, significantly impairing the quality of life for long-term HCT survivors. The intensified immunosuppressive therapy for extensive or refractory cGVHD dampens the immune response, resulting in greater risk of infection and malignancy relapse. In light of this, current cGVHD therapeutic strategies are expanding into promoting tissue tolerance.

The gut microbiome influences the pathophysiology of acute GVHD (aGVHD). Similarly, shifts in the gut microbiome are associated with cGVHD development and shape inflammatory T-cell responses in murine cGVHD models. Microbiota-based therapeutic interventions targeting gut microorganisms including fecal microbiota transplantation and prebiotics have been proposed to prevent and treat aGVHD. Although the gut microbiome is critical for the pathogenesis of acute and likely chronic GVHD, the relationship between the microbiota of other tissues and GVHD remains poorly understood. The oral microbiome, second only to the gastrointestinal tract in bacterial abundance, has recently garnered significant attention because of its complex immune system interactions. The importance of basic oral care for the prevention of oral mucositis (OM) during cancer treatment is widely acknowledged, with guidelines available that address its impact on the oral microbiome. Numerous studies have indicated that these guidelines can reduce the incidence and severity of OM. Current research, albeit limited, suggests a significant link between oral dysbiosis and the risk of aGVHD, and oral dysbiosis may serve as a reservoir for pathogens contributing to GVHD. Furthermore, the prevalence of periodontitis, which is caused by oral dysbiosis, in patients undergoing HCT is high at 50% to 66%, suggesting that a large portion of HCT recipients may benefit from optimizing oral health. However, the mechanisms underlying how oral microbiota contribute to acute and chronic GVHD are still not well understood.

### Shaped by the epithelium-postnatal immune mechanisms of oral homeostasis [^116aNQhh]. Trends in Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

The first encounter of mucosal barriers with the microbiota initiates host-microbiota feedback loops instructing the tailored development of both the immune system and microbiota at each mucosal site. Once established, balanced immunological interactions enable symbiotic relationships with the microbiota in adult life. This process has been extensively investigated in the mammalian monolayer epithelium-covered intestine and lung mucosae; however, the postnatal mechanisms engaged by the oral mucosa to establish homeostasis are currently being discovered. Here, we discuss the early life dialogue between the oral mucosa and the microbiota, with particular emphasis on the central role the multilayer epithelium plays to protect the oral mucosa. These intricate and unique postnatal immunological processes shape oral homeostasis, which can potentially affect buccal and systemic health in adult life.

### Shaping the oral mycobiota: interactions of opportunistic fungi with oral bacteria and the host [^112qb1gT]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

The oral mycobiota is an important component of the oral microbiota that has only recently received increased attention. The diversity and complexity of the oral mycobiota in healthy humans is greater than any other body site. Dysbiotic imbalance of indigenous fungal communities in immunosuppressed hosts has been proposed to lead to oropharyngeal fungal infections. As in other body sites, to survive and thrive in the oral cavity fungi have to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with the resident bacterial microbiota and the host. Here we review our current understanding of the composition of the oral mycobiota and how it may be influenced by oral commensal bacteria and the host environment.

### Diversity and bias in oral microbiome research: a commentary [^1111Rgp1]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The oral cavity has the second largest and most diverse microbiota of the human body, harbouring over 700 microbial species. Oral microbial communities are dominated by bacteria, but also contain archaea, viruses, and eukaryotes, whose roles in oral health and disease are less well understood. Lifestyle, diet, and other host-related factors, such as ethnicity or ancestry, are associated with the composition of these microbial communities, and oral microbiome variation may affect the assessment, response, and effectiveness of disease interventions. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how oral microbiome traits are associated with oral health in diverse human populations. Currently, microbiome research is dominated by gut microbiome studies and is strongly biased towards populations of European descent. Such populations, by definition, provide a poor basis from which to understand microbiome-health relationships in under-studied populations, including groups who carry the highest burdens of disease.

ORAL MICROBIAL COMMUNITY

The Basic Composition of the Oral Microecosystem

The human microbiota includes oral, gastrointestinal, skin, and urogenital microbiota. Microecosystems are influenced by factors such as age, sex, and body mass index, and the human microbial community is almost stable over time. The human oral microbiota is one of the most diverse microbial communities in the body, and includes viruses, fungi, protozoa, archaea, and bacteria. Approximately 1000 bacterial species have been identified, with more than 94% of the oral microbiota comprising Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Spirochetes.

An oral microecosystem refers to the microbial communities found in the human oral cavity, also known as the oral microbiota or oral microbiome. The oral microbiota is one of the most diverse and numerous microbial communities in the human body, with the most differentiated microbiota (over 700 species), second only to the colonic microbiota, and in close proximity to many anatomic regions. The anatomic structure of the oral cavity is complex and its internal ecological environment is diverse. This inherent structure provides an ideal environment for colonization by oral microbes. Different types of microbes are distributed in 7 main areas of the human oral cavity, namely, the gingival sulcus, cheek, attached gingiva, teeth, tongue, lips, hard palate, and soft palate, forming relatively independent microenvironments. Saliva and gingival crevicular fluid continuously moisten these areas, thereby nourishing the oral microbiota, promoting nutrient supply, allowing communication and interaction between different environments, and facilitating the circulation of immune and microbial factors (including antibodies and adhesion molecules). – The physicochemical properties of saliva, such as pH, oxygen content, temperature, and redox potential, determine the formation of oral microecosystems. The microbial communities residing in these areas are not harmful to human health, as long as they do not aggregate in other areas of the body.

### Unlocking modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease: does the oral microbiome hold some of the keys? [^112RAW8q]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

THE ORAL MICROBIOME AND AD

A number of pathways contribute to neurological disease, including the gut microbiome, which has seen significant recent interest with respect to relevance to AD and cognition. However, there is a growing rationale from epidemiological and experimental research which implicates the microbiome from sites external to the gut, in particular the oral cavity, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders.

The oral cavity contains distinct microbial communities including in the oral mucosa, tongue, plaque, cheek, and gingiva, which collectively house over 700 prevalent bacteria, some 57% of which have been formally identified. In healthy individuals, these microbes comprise mostly bacteria, with a smaller abundance of resident fungi, archea, and viruses. While saliva has no indigenous microbes, bacteria from other oral surfaces are transferred to saliva and its composition is dominated by Streptococcus, Veilonella, and Prevotella.

As in human microbiomes of other niches, there is relative stability in the oral microbiome of an adult with good oral health. The development of common oral diseases, such as caries and gum (periodontal) disease, is caused by members of the oral microbiome and typified by dysbiosis across the whole oral microial community. Independent of oral health state, there are changes in the oral microbiome makeup across the life-course due to key milestones, such as birth, early feeding practices, the emergence of teeth, later dietary changes, lifestyle factors including smoking and hormonal changes, such as during pregnancy. These events see the gradual enrichment in diversity of the oral microbiome, from a narrow diversity ecosystem, dominated by Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Lactobacillus species in infancy, to one which has wider diversity in early adulthood, typified by an increased abundance of periodontal disease associated taxa, such as Porphymonas, Actinomyces, and Neisseria, in addition to Fusobacterium nucleatum. Advancing age in adulthood, independent of AD, is generally associated with an increase in dysbiosis in the oral microbiome, with an increased abundance of bacteria associated with periodontal disease, in addition to fungal species, Candida Albicans, which causes oral thrush. This increased disease potential oral environment in older age is driven by reduced production and quality of saliva, which hampers the buffering capacity of the oral environment and lessens oral microbial clearance, in addition to declining nutritional quality, which reduces diversity of available macronutrients and is driven by reduced masticatory function, tooth loss, and potentially impaired taste perception.

### The oral microbiome in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease [^111d2zK5]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Despite advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of many cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and expansion of available therapies, the global burden of CVD-associated morbidity and mortality remains unacceptably high. Important gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanisms of CVD and determinants of disease progression. In the past decade, much research has been conducted on the human microbiome and its potential role in modulating CVD. With the advent of high-throughput technologies and multiomics analyses, the complex and dynamic relationship between the microbiota, their 'theatre of activity' and the host is gradually being elucidated. The relationship between the gut microbiome and CVD is well established. Much less is known about the role of disruption (dysbiosis) of the oral microbiome; however, interest in the field is growing, as is the body of literature from basic science and animal and human investigations. In this Review, we examine the link between the oral microbiome and CVD, specifically coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, infective endocarditis and rheumatic heart disease. We discuss the various mechanisms by which oral dysbiosis contributes to CVD pathogenesis and potential strategies for prevention and treatment.

### Oral fungal dysbiosis and systemic immune dysfunction in Chinese patients with schizophrenia [^117V451k]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The oral cavity is one of the important habitats in the human body, consisting of a diverse microbial community that includes bacteria and fungi, both of which play crucial roles in maintaining oral health and influencing systemic health through various interactions and metabolic activities. Historically, research has predominantly focused on the bacterial component of the oral microbiota, often overlooking the importance of fungi. Despite representing a small fraction of the total microbiome, fungi are indispensable for a balanced oral microbiota and exert significant effects on various physiological and pathological processes in both oral and systemic contexts. The advent of next-generation sequencing techniques has revolutionized our understanding of the fungal community within the oral microbiota, revealing their roles in microbial balance, immune modulation, and metabolic pathways. This advanced molecular approach has also elucidated fungal contributions to oral diseases and their potential impact on systemic inflammatory disorders. Understanding the fungal contributions is pivotal for advancing our knowledge of oral health and its broader implications for overall well-being. Elucidating the intricate roles of fungi within the oral microbiota will help reveal new strategies for managing both oral and systemic diseases.

### Gut microbiome and health: mechanistic insights [^1159MY5J]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

The human gut microbiome

The human microbiome is considered here as the collection of microbes, their genes and their products that colonise our body since birth and are transferred vertically. While all body sites are colonised (figure 1), the highest microbial numbers are found in the gut that has been studied extensively. Here, we review the main and most recent findings that address the way gut microbes, their activities and mediator molecules can contribute to our health.

Figure 1
Total abundance of bacteria according to the different body sites. Bounds for bacteria number in different organs, derived from bacterial concentrations and volume.

In healthy subjects, the oral and saliva microbiomes contain millions of microbes that are swallowed daily with our food, but their persistence in the gut is impeded by many factors, including the acidity of the stomach, the production of bile acids (BAs), digestive enzymes and antimicrobial proteins in the duodenum and beyond. A great number of other major variables affect further downstream microbial colonisation, such as chemical parameters like pH, oxygen concentrations and redox potential, the biological production of mucus, bile and antibodies, as well as physical aspects, including gut architecture, peristalsis and transit times (figure 1). Hence, a concentration gradient of microbes is found along the small intestine, as microbial abundance in duodenal aspirates were found to be a 1000-fold lower than that of oral samples, although consisting of somewhat similar microbial taxa. Consequently, the small intestine contains an increasing number of thousands to several hundred million of cells per gram of content with partly oxygen-tolerant Firmicutes and Proteobacteria as major phyla. This all culminates in the lower gut where climax communities of up to 100 billion cells per gram reside for up to a few days, since transit in the colon is over a dozen times longer than that in the small intestine. Hence, the colonic microbiome is dominated by mainly anaerobic bacteria, including thousands of species and millions of genes, distributed among the major phyla of Firmicutes (predominantly Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (Akkermansia)(figure 1). Excreted as faeces, it is this biomass that makes up what is usually termed the gut microbiome that has been associated with a plethora of diseases and is highly modifiable by diet and drugs (table 1). It provides the starting material for faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) that has been shown to cure patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections and other diseases.

### Human gut microbiome: hopes, threats and promises [^111CqFP8]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion and perspectives

We are living with a tremendous amount of microorganisms in our guts, ranging from bacteria, archaea to virus and fungi. There is no doubt about the fact that we have progressed in the analysis of the composition of the microbiota and of the key metabolites produced and even in the discovery and isolation of novel bacteria. However, we must acknowledge that a large number of the studies published the last couple of years have reported differences in the microbiome under different conditions. Although most of them are very well performed, we still need more work to go beyond the simple associations and we need to provide as much as possible more complex analysis (eg, multiomics and time series measurements) if we want to finally approach the final causality. Indeed, simple associations may lead to misinterpretation or overselling of expected results when translated into the human context. Thus, both types of approaches are important, that is, comparing diseased and healthy conditions and then showing the causality as a proof of concept. However, the general population as well as health practitioners should be rigorous when drawing conclusions from papers that assume that the discovery of differences in gut microbiota composition is potentially strongly associated with a specific disease or its overall evolution (box 1).

Key definitions

Microbiota: This term refers to a collection of all taxa constituting microbial communities, such as bacteria, archeae, fungi and protists. When it refers to a specific environment, the term is preceded by the said location, for example, 'the gut microbiota' refers to the intestinal tract and the 'oral microbiota' is used when speaking about all the microbes from the oral cavity.

Microbiome: This term was initially used to refer to the genes harboured by microbes; however, currently, the term 'microbiome' is also commonly used to refer to the microorganisms themselves (ie, the microbiota).

Probiotics: These are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host.

Prebiotics: These are substrates that are selectively utilised by host microorganisms conferring health benefits.

Metagenome: This term refers to the entire genetic material present in a sample. The metagenome is composed of the genomes of several individual organisms, for instance, the genomes of human cells and of the gut microorganisms that are present in faecal material.

Metabolome: This term refers to the quantitative complement of all the low molecular-weight molecules present in a biological sample.

Virome: This term refers to the entire viral genetic material present in a sample. The virome consists of the genomes of viruses.

### Microbiota-mediated mechanisms of mucosal immunity across the lifespan [^112wz8No]. Nature Immunology (2025). High credibility.

The microbiota has a fundamental role in regulating homeostasis and inflammation across the barrier surfaces of the body. The gut is a unique bioreactor where the high concentration of microorganisms, microbial and dietary metabolites, microbial-derived molecular structures, immune cells, stroma and neurons form a complex, highly interactive and precisely regulated system. The mucosal immune system in the gut has profound local and systemic effects, influencing both health and disease. A critical period of immune imprinting occurs early in life, shaped by the neonatal microbiota and nutrition, to influence immune development and long-term disease susceptibility. Microbiota-derived metabolites have crucial roles in immune modulation, influencing epithelial integrity, oral tolerance and inflammatory responses. This Review explores the interactions between the microbiota and the mucosal immune system from infancy to adulthood, highlighting the impact on health and disease. We also discuss therapeutic interventions, including microbiota-derived molecules, dietary metabolites and emerging microbiome-based co-therapies.

### Tracking human migration patterns through the oral bacterial flora [^1129VzAK]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

As modern humans (Homo sapiens) migrated out of Africa to different parts of the world, their obligate indigenous bacterial biota accompanied them. As both evolved, the accumulations of mutations in their DNA can reveal their phylogenies. Here, we describe the evolutionary history of an indigenous bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, from the oral cavity. Using several genetic markers, four distinct clusters of S. mutans genetic traits coincide with individuals of distinct geographic or racial groups comprised of two African clades and an Asian and a Caucasian clade. The evolutionary lineage of S. mutans is in agreement with anthropological artifacts marking the trail of human migrations.

The normal flora of the head and neck exists in a delicate balance within tightly regulated ecologic niches, counterbalanced by a highly efficient innate immune system of the host. Invasion by the normal oral flora is rare when mucosal defenses remain intact. An understanding of the indigenous microflora and the innate mucosal defense mechanisms is necessary for an appropriate evaluation of infections and therapies in this area.

### The butterfly effect: collateral damage and impacts of antimicrobial strategies on the oral microbiome [^117R2y2W]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

The oral cavity is a complex environment hosting diverse microbial biofilms on different surfaces, all immersed in saliva that enables recolonisation and spread. These microbial populations fluctuate with diet, hygiene, antimicrobials, and disease. While biofilm control measures aim to protect health, they may cause unintended effects, including antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Persistent resistant microbes reshape oral and systemic niches through ecological disruption and genetic adaptation, which may negatively impact human health.

### Study of oral microbiome describes the mouth of America-NCI… [^116LMvAJ]. dceg.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Study of Oral Microbiome Describes the Mouth of America, by Brittany Cordeiro, B. A. In a new study, NCI researchers characterized the oral microbiome of US adults to create comprehensive data and provide a deeper understanding of its role in human health. The findings published in JAMA Network Open on May 5, 2025. Their findings show that nearly all US adults have five phyla and six bacterial genera in their mouths. The genera indicate a limited universal oral microbiome in our populaiton. A different set of genera were associated with a higher proportion of variability in oral microbiome beta diversity, showing there are key genera that potentially affect oral microbiome diversity across individuals.

Factors like age, race and ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, alcohol use, and periodontal disease were associated with the oral microbiome. Observations included enrichment of Actinobacteria among current smokers and red complex bacteria in individuals with severe periodontal disease. In addition, they observed an unexpected pattern for the number of types of bacteria present, with complexity increasing until age 30 and then declining thereafter. This measure of community complexity was significantly lower among non-Hispanic Whites, and increased with greater BMI, alcohol use, and periodontal disease severity. This study was supported by a grant from the FDA Center for Tobacco Products and NCI Intramural Research Program and provides a contemporary reference standard for the oral bacterial microbiome, a complex ecosystem encompassing 37 phyla and over 1000 genera.

Alterations in the oral microbiome have been associated with several chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. The key findings of the study can be a starting point for future studies to identify potential biological mechanisms linking oral microbes to health outcomes. REFERENCE Abnet CC, et. al.

### Decoding the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of microbiota using pan-body pan-disease microbiomics [^113vixvp]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Recent advancements in the field of microbiota research have spotlighted the complex interplay between non-communicable diseases and the human microbiome, offering novel avenues for understanding disease pathogenesis, identifying biomarkers, and developing new therapies –. Respective studies demonstrate site-specific changes in microbiota linked to disease development and progression. Large-scale metagenomic initiatives, such as the Human Microbiome Project, International Human Microbiome Consortium, the American Gut Project, and other hallmark studies –, have compiled thousands of microbiota samples leading to results arguing all in the very same direction. Data on the impact of an organ-confined disease process in the microbiota of remote body sites remain, however, sparse. Understanding the dynamic relationship between health and disease, especially in the context of frequent co-morbidities, necessitates a holistic exploration of the human microbiome. One example is the discovery of the gut-brain axis, a refined communication between the intestinal microbiota, intestinal host cells, and the central nervous system via the vagal nerve. Overall, the microbiome can be modified at sites remote from the primary disease process. Thus, understanding the composition of metagenomes in health and disease in a systemic manner might be key to improving patient care.

Especially considering the growing health challenges spurred by demographic shifts and social influences, the imperative for enhanced treatment strategies becomes increasingly evident. For example, chronic inflammatory diseases encompass a diverse array of conditions such as periodontitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, cardiovascular diseases, heart failure, and ulcerative colitis, among others –. Respective ailments collectively pose a significant burden on individuals and healthcare systems alike. This calls for an in-depth exploration of underlying molecular mechanisms. These and other non-communicable diseases are associated with chronic local and systemic inflammation and often occur as multimorbidities. Processes driving the development of multimorbidity are largely unknown but include a state of systemic hyperinflammation, metabolic changes, and senescence. While the underlying mechanisms leading to these (co)morbidities are not yet fully explored, emerging evidence suggests that chronic inflammatory diseases are intrinsically linked to perturbations in the composition and function of the human microbiota. Imbalances in microbial communities residing at various body sites, including the oral cavity, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, have been implicated in the initiation and perpetuation of inflammatory cascades –. This has led to the paradigm-shifting realization that the microbiota, once considered a bystander, plays a pivotal role in disease progression and resolution.

### Oral health implications in Parkinson's disease [^113k12yd]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The gut-brain axis, through dysregulation of oral and intestinal microbiota, plays a crucial role in PD pathogenesis and progression, linking oral health directly to systemic inflammation and neurodegeneration. Research has demonstrated a strong link between the gut microbiota, neurodevelopment, and neurological disorders, with the gut-brain axis (GBA) serving as a critical connection –. The GBA illustrates the bidirectional communication between the nervous system and the gut, where gut-derived metabolites can influence neural function, and the gut is modulated by neural inputs. Various intestinal conditions have been implicated in the increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). For example, inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are associated with a 22–35% increased risk of developing PD. The GBA is a complex and dynamic system that connects the gut and the brain. In 2003, Braak hypothesized that gastrointestinal factors could contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Key PD symptoms, such as GBA dysfunction, neural system infection, and dopaminergic system impairment, are associated with alterations in gut bacterial species. Variations in gut bacteria are considered environmental factors that may drive the progression of PD. Additionally, the metabolism of levodopa, a primary treatment for PD, can be influenced by gut bacteria, leading to altered drug efficacy. The gut microbiota has also been linked to PD symptoms, including disease onset, muscle rigidity, tremors, cognitive impairment, and the variability in drug requirements among patients. In summary, the pathogenesis and clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease may be linked to disruptions in the gut-brain axis. Although these findings suggest a critical role of the gut microbiota in PD progression, conclusive evidence that gut microbial variations are the primary drivers of PD onset is still lacking. The interrelationship between gut microbiota, oral diseases, and Parkinson's disease is illustrated in the diagram below (Fig. 1). Normally, gut microbiota is stable, but it can become imbalanced due to environmental and host factors, leading to changes in microbial species and composition — a state known as ecological imbalance. Evidence indicates that the gut microbiota in PD patients differs significantly from that of healthy individuals and is often imbalanced. While variations exist across populations, most reports highlight an increase in the relative abundance of Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium and a decrease in Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. Although PD patients generally have lower gut bacterial diversity compared to healthy individuals, absolute bacterial counts are often not reported, and bacterial levels tend to decline as PD progresses.

### The oral-gut microbiome axis in health and disease [^11675AZ8]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

The human body hosts trillions of microorganisms throughout many diverse habitats with different physico-chemical characteristics. Among them, the oral cavity and the gut harbour some of the most dense and diverse microbial communities. Although these two sites are physiologically distinct, they are directly connected and can influence each other in several ways. For example, oral microorganisms can reach and colonize the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the context of gut dysbiosis. However, the mechanisms of colonization and the role that the oral microbiome plays in causing or exacerbating diseases in other organs have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we describe recent advances in our understanding of how the oral and intestinal microbiota interplay in relation to their impact on human health and disease.

### Viruses of the oral cavity: prevalence, pathobiology and association with oral diseases [^111twEiG]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

The human oral cavity contains a plethora of habitats and tissue environments, such as teeth, tongue, and gingiva, which are home to a rich microbial flora including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Given the exposed nature of the mouth, oral tissues constantly encounter infectious agents, forming a complex ecological community. In the past, the discussion of microbiological aspects of oral disease has traditionally focused on bacteria and fungi, but viruses are attracting increasing attention as pathogens in oral inflammatory diseases. Therefore, understanding viral prevalence, pathogenicity, and preference regarding oral tissues is critical to understanding the holistic effects of viruses on oral infections. Recent investigations have demonstrated the abundance of certain viruses in oral inflammatory diseases, suggesting an association between viruses and disease. Human herpesviruses are the most extensively studied viruses in different oral inflammatory diseases. However, challenges in viral detection and the lack of reproducible in vitro and in vivo infection models have limited our progress in understanding viruses and their contribution to oral diseases. This review presents a summary of major mammalian viruses and associated diseases in the human oral cavity. The emergence of a recent pathogen SARS-CoV-2 and its tropism for salivary and periodontal tissues further highlights the relevance of the oral cavity in host-pathogen interaction. Understanding how these different viruses present clinically and influence oral health will advance our understanding of multifactorial oral diseases and their association with viruses.

### The person-to-person transmission landscape of the gut and oral microbiomes [^116u7yqw]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

The human microbiome is an integral component of the human body and a co-determinant of several health conditions. However, the extent to which interpersonal relations shape the individual genetic makeup of the microbiome and its transmission within and across populations remains largely unknown. Here, capitalizing on more than 9,700 human metagenomes and computational strain-level profiling, we detected extensive bacterial strain sharing across individuals (more than 10 million instances) with distinct mother-to-infant, intra-household and intra-population transmission patterns. Mother-to-infant gut microbiome transmission was considerable and stable during infancy (around 50% of the same strains among shared species (strain-sharing rate)) and remained detectable at older ages. By contrast, the transmission of the oral microbiome occurred largely horizontally and was enhanced by the duration of cohabitation. There was substantial strain sharing among cohabiting individuals, with 12% and 32% median strain-sharing rates for the gut and oral microbiomes, and time since cohabitation affected strain sharing more than age or genetics did. Bacterial strain sharing additionally recapitulated host population structures better than species-level profiles did. Finally, distinct taxa appeared as efficient spreaders across transmission modes and were associated with different predicted bacterial phenotypes linked with out-of-host survival capabilities. The extent of microorganism transmission that we describe underscores its relevance in human microbiome studies, especially those on non-infectious, microbiome-associated diseases.

### Periodontal disease and cirrhosis: current concepts and future prospects [^116v3mxg]. Egastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral-gut-liver axis and associated pathogenesis with periodontal disease

The gut microbiome is defined as the community of microbes and their associated function within the gut of a host species. The gut microbiome has emerged as playing a significant role in several functions, including those related to circadian rhythm, nutrition, metabolism and immunity. The gut microbiome has been referred to as an 'additional organ' and has emerged as a popular topic in translational science. An imbalance or maladaptation of microbes, known as gut microbial dysbiosis (figure 1), along with associated bacterial translocation, commonly referred to as a 'leaky gut', has been implicated as a contributing factor in various disease processes, including T2DM, inflammatory bowel disease and opioid tolerance. Furthermore, gut microbial dysbiosis has also been implicated in systemic inflammation and altered liver glucose metabolism. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is currently being investigated as a potential risk factor for the development of liver disease, especially metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), through its effect on caloric management, host metabolism and proinflammatory signalling via direct hepatotoxicity from bacterial byproducts.

Figure 1
Oral and gut microflora associated with healthy states and dysbiosis.

Dysbiosis of the oral microbiota may also be contributory to systemic inflammatory effects. The oral cavity constitutes one of the largest reservoirs of microbiota in the body. While some studies have shown that some individuals may harbour an oral microbiome composed of more than 175 bacterial species; Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria account for the majority of the composition of the normal oral microflora. Patients with periodontitis typically show an increase in oral bacterial phyla such as Bacteroides, Spirochetes and Fusobacteria, with Porphyromonas gingivalis typically identified as a key causative microbe (see figure 1).

Although the flora of the oral cavity is distinct from the gut flora, it has been hypothesised that salivary microbiology can affect the bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract as saliva containing these bacteria is constantly being swallowed. In murine models, administering P. gingivalis orally has been linked to the development of gut dysbiosis. This resulted in an increase in Bacteroidetes, a decrease in Firmicutes and higher serum endotoxin levels. Metagenomic analysis of both oral and gut microbiome composition has further demonstrated correlation. Therefore, periodontal disease and associated changes in the oral microbiome may similarly be theorised to also alter the gut microbiome's function and composition, potentially leading to a maladaptive inflammatory injury leading to liver disease.

### The microbiota and microbiome in aging: potential implications in health and age-related diseases [^1145jtBG]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

Advances in bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing allow for characterization of the human commensal bacterial community (microbiota) and its corresponding genome (microbiome). Surveys of healthy adults reveal that a signature composite of bacteria characterizes each unique body habitat (e.g., gut, skin, oral cavity, vagina). A myriad of clinical changes, including a basal proinflammatory state (inflamm-aging), that directly interface with the microbiota of older adults and enhance susceptibility to disease accompany aging. Studies in older adults demonstrate that the gut microbiota correlates with diet, location of residence (e.g., community dwelling, long-term care settings), and basal level of inflammation. Links exist between the microbiota and a variety of clinical problems plaguing older adults, including physical frailty, Clostridium difficile colitis, vulvovaginal atrophy, colorectal carcinoma, and atherosclerotic disease. Manipulation of the microbiota and microbiome of older adults holds promise as an innovative strategy to influence the development of comorbidities associated with aging.

### Defining the normal bacterial flora of the oral cavity [^115Xt5UU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

More than 700 bacterial species or phylotypes, of which over 50% have not been cultivated, have been detected in the oral cavity. Our purposes were (i) to utilize culture-independent molecular techniques to extend our knowledge on the breadth of bacterial diversity in the healthy human oral cavity, including not-yet-cultivated bacteria species, and (ii) to determine the site and subject specificity of bacterial colonization. Nine sites from five clinically healthy subjects were analyzed. Sites included tongue dorsum, lateral sides of tongue, buccal epithelium, hard palate, soft palate, supragingival plaque of tooth surfaces, subgingival plaque, maxillary anterior vestibule, and tonsils. 16S rRNA genes from sample DNA were amplified, cloned, and transformed into Escherichia coli. Sequences of 16S rRNA genes were used to determine species identity or closest relatives. In 2,589 clones, 141 predominant species were detected, of which over 60% have not been cultivated. Thirteen new phylotypes were identified. Species common to all sites belonged to the genera Gemella, Granulicatella, Streptococcus, and Veillonella. While some species were subject specific and detected in most sites, other species were site specific. Most sites possessed 20 to 30 different predominant species, and the number of predominant species from all nine sites per individual ranged from 34 to 72. Species typically associated with periodontitis and caries were not detected. There is a distinctive predominant bacterial flora of the healthy oral cavity that is highly diverse and site and subject specific. It is important to fully define the human microflora of the healthy oral cavity before we can understand the role of bacteria in oral disease.

### Unveiling the immune dynamics ofpersistent oral colonization [^113bB9uk]. Infection and Immunity (2024). Medium credibility.

Commensal bacteria are crucial in maintaining host physiological homeostasis, immune system development, and protection against pathogens. Despite their significance, the factors influencing persistent bacterial colonization and their impact on the host still need to be fully understood. Animal models have served as valuable tools to investigate these interactions, but most have limitations. The bacterial genus Neisseria, which includes both commensal and pathogenic species, has been studied from a pathogenicity to humans perspective but lacks models that study immune responses in the context of long-term persistence. Neisseria musculi, a recently described natural commensal of mice, offers a unique opportunity to study long-term host-commensal interactions. In this study, for the first time, we have used this model to study the transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional dynamics of immune cell signatures in the mucosal and systemic tissue of mice in response to N. musculi colonization. We found key genes and pathways vital for immune homeostasis in palate tissue, validated by flow cytometry of immune cells from the lung, blood, and spleen. This study offers a novel avenue for advancing our understanding of host-bacteria dynamics and may provide a platform for developing efficacious interventions against mucosal persistence by pathogenic Neisseria.

### Updated perspectives on the contribution of the microbiome to the pathogenesis of mucositis using the MASCC / ISOO framework [^114QGdfR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

The host and its microbiome

The oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract (GIT), collectively termed the alimentary tract, are home to the human body's richest and most complex microbial communities. The human immune system and resident microorganisms have co-evolved over thousands of years, leading to a mutually beneficial relationship. Colonization of the mucosal surfaces early in life helps shape and mature the host's immune system. Despite a high load and diversity of microorganisms on several mucosal and skin surfaces, the immune system is tolerant of these commensal microorganisms, and this symbiotic alliance enables activation of protective immune responses towards pathogens and maintenance of immune tolerance responses to harmless (commensal) antigens.

One of the key functions of the oral microbiome is to prevent colonization by external organisms, achieving this through competing for ligands, receptors, and nutrient substrates in the mouth. Furthermore, metabolic functions of oral microbiota dictate the oral microenvironment, creating a hostile environment that restricts the entry and expansion of exogenous organisms while also working to cross-feed commensals and thus maintain a healthy oral microbiota. The oral microbiota can initiate chronic inflammation when the composition becomes dysbiotic (altered in its composition and diversity). Prominent disease examples arising from oral dysbiosis include periodontal-related diseases, Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric cancers. Overexpression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) is a key mechanism linking oral microbiota to disease pathogenesis, inducing nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) and downstream production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-8 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α.

### Development of the oral resistome during the first decade of life [^111FZfeM]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The human microbiome includes reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) which are part of a network of resistomes (collections of ARGs) that exist in a variety of animal and environmental microbiomes. Surveillance of resistomes is a key tenet of the One Health approach to combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR). One Healthrecognises the interconnectivity between human and animal health in our shared environment and is a transdisciplinary approach to tackling AMR, a worldwide health and economic issue. The oral microbiome comprises the second most significant microbial presence within the body (after the gut) and is an important interface between the body and the external environment, e.g. eating. Therefore, characterising the AMR potential of the human oral microbiome is important. Antimicrobial resistance genes have been identified in the oral microbiome throughout human historyand have been found in all ages of the human population from neonates to adults. Moreover, the oral microbiome is a known site for acquisition and transfer of resistance via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which can contribute to the systematic development of antimicrobial-resistant infections.

The acquisition and development of AMR amongst both commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the oral microbiome during childhood are largely unknown. Childhood is characterised by major changes in the composition of the oral microbiome, namely increasing diversity as children grow older. These changes are driven by diet, with the introduction of solid foods, and the emergence of teeth, which provide a non-shedding surface for biofilm maturation. While the environment is a known major modulator of the oral microbiome, host geneticshave also been shown to influence oral bacteria which carry ARGs. To examine the role of the environment in the development of the oral resistome, studies are required that are nested within a population structure designed to measure both the influence of the environment and host genetics. The classical twin study design allows comparison of a phenotype such as AMR between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, to estimate host genetics in relation to the environment.

### Multispecies biofilms and host responses: "discriminating the trees from the forest" [^1127dWPi]. Cytokine (2013). Low credibility.

Periodontal diseases reflect a tissue destructive process of the hard and soft tissues of the periodontium that are initiated by the accumulation of multispecies bacterial biofilms in the subgingival sulcus. This accumulation, in both quantity and quality of bacteria, results in a chronic immunoinflammatory response of the host to control this noxious challenge, leading to collateral damage of the tissues. As knowledge of the characteristics of the host-bacterial interactions in the oral cavity has expanded, new knowledge has become available on the complexity of the microbial challenge and the repertoire of host responses to this challenge. Recent results from the Human Microbiome Project continue to extend the array of taxa, genera, and species of bacteria that inhabit the multiple niches in the oral cavity; however, there is rather sparse information regarding variations in how host cells discriminate commensal from pathogenic species, as well as how the host response is affected by the three-dimensional architecture and interbacterial interactions that occur in the oral biofilms. This review provides some insights into these processes by including existing literature on the biology of nonoral bacterial biofilms, and the more recent literature just beginning to document how the oral cavity responds to multispecies biofilms.

### Fusobacterium nucleatum: ecology, pathogenesis and clinical implications [^111z2yhS]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Fusobacterium nucleatum, a commensal microorganism and opportunistic pathogen (a pathobiont), has emerged as a key player in both local and systemic diseases. In humans, F. nucleatum is found in the oral microbiota, but under certain conditions, it can spread to other ecological niches within the body, such as the gut microbiota. Importantly, F. nucleatum has a pathogenic role in periodontal disease, inflammatory bowel disease and various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. F. nucleatum can promote oncogenesis via several mechanisms, including virulence factors, chronic inflammation, immune evasion and direct interactions with tumour cells. The strong link between this pathobiont microorganism and cancer has led to the emergence of several potential diagnostic strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. Given its increasing association with cancer progression and poor clinical outcomes, understanding the role of F. nucleatum in disease treatment offers critical insights for future research and clinical applications. This Review underscores the importance of F. nucleatum in microbiology, oncology and translational medicine.

### Oral and gut dysbiosis leads to functional alterations in Parkinson's disease [^117Dyt7u]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting more than 6 million people worldwide. The non-motor symptoms of PD, such as constipation, impaired olfaction, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders, are frequently present before the onset of motor symptoms, which might be explained by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the peripheral nervous system before spreading to the substantia nigra. The progressive spreading of alpha-synuclein from peripheral nerves into the brain was previously proposed in neuropathologic studies and also demonstrated in mouse models, where injection of preformed alpha-synuclein fibrils into the gastric muscular layers resulted in the spread of pathologic alpha-synuclein into the brain, while truncal vagotomy prevented the spread. These findings led to the hypothesis that the pathology of PD may initiate in the gut.

Animal studies have clarified the role of the gut microbiome in PD. Germ-free mice showed limited alpha-synuclein pathology, while mice with microbiota from PD patients exhibited enhanced motor dysfunction. Human studies have also revealed distinct gut microbial compositions associated with PD –, but little is known about the alteration of the oral microbiome in PD. Dysbiosis of the oral microbiome has been observed in systemic diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and gastrointestinal diseases. The systemic effects of oral dysbiosis can be explained by local and systemic inflammation as well as the oral-gut connection. In general, the oral bacteria poorly colonize in a healthy digestive system. However, in pathological circumstances, oral pathogens could affect the gut environment, enhancing the oral-gut dysbiosis connection. For example, an increased abundance of the oral-associated microbiome was observed in the gut in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and liver cirrhosis. Oral dysbiosis could also affect the pathogenesis of PD through the oral-gut connection. However, the number of studies on the oral microbiome in PD is limited, especially on its link with the gut microbiome.

### The role of the human microbiome in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery: a contemporary review [^115CXroQ]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The human microbiome represents the collective genomes and gene products of microbes living within and on humans. The objective of this review is to provide a summary of the current microbiome literature pertaining to otolaryngology-head and neck surgery.

Data Source

Ovid MEDLINE.

Methods

Scientific publications with clinical correlates.

Results

Human microbiome studies have been facilitated by culture-independent, high-throughput sequencing methods. Data from the Human Microbiome Project has shown that the composition of the human microbiome is specific to each body site and that each individual has a unique microbiome. Alterations in the human microbiome are associated with some disease states; thus, novel therapeutic strategies are being developed based on concepts and findings stemming from microbiome research.

Conclusions

Although a growing body of research shows potential significance of the human microbiome for human health and disease, there is a paucity of microbiome studies in otolaryngology. More studies are required to increase our understanding of the indigenous microbiota and their effects on diseases of the head and neck.

### Defining the biogeographical map and potential bacterial translocation of microbiome in human' surface organs' [^114WZLRu]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The microbiome in a specific human organ has been well-studied, but few reports have investigated the multi-organ microbiome as a whole. Here, we aim to analyse the intra-individual inter-organ and intra-organ microbiome in deceased humans. We collected 1608 samples from 53 sites of 7 surface organs (oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, appendix, large intestine and skin; n = 33 subjects) and performed microbiome profiling, including 16S full-length sequencing. Microbial diversity varied dramatically among organs, and core microbial species co-existed in different intra-individual organs. We deciphered microbial changes across distinct intra-organ sites, and identified signature microbes, their functional traits, and interactions specific to each site. We revealed significant microbial heterogeneity between paired mucosa-lumen samples of stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Finally, we established the landscape of inter-organ relationships of microbes along the digestive tract. Therefore, we generate a catalogue of bacterial composition, diversity, interaction, functional traits, and bacterial translocation in human at inter-organ and intra-organ levels.

### Oral SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk for long COVID [^115VfMdM]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Understanding the interplay between SARS‐CoV‐2 and oral health is critical for developing comprehensive strategies to mitigate the impact of the virus, particularly in vulnerable populations. As the pan‐epidemic continues, it is essential to explore the role of the oral cavity in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19 and its long‐term sequelae. Addressing oral health as part of the broader public health response to COVID‐19 could help reduce the burden of both acute and chronic complications associated with the virus. This review details the important and consequential interactions between SARS‐CoV‐2, the oral microbiome, and the immune system, specifically emphasizing (1) the mechanisms of SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into the oral cavity, (2) the role of poor oral and systemic health, along with oral bacterial pathogens, in facilitating SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and immune clearance deficiency, (4) the contribution of oral fluid dynamics and epithelial turnover in SARS‐CoV‐2 persistence, and (5) the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 and pre‐existing conditions on oral mucosal immunity. The ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes and inform future therapeutic interventions.

This review provides a unifying framework for future oral biology studies of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We discuss and present specific environmental‐initiated molecular and biochemical features permitting SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the oral cavity. There is a current lack of information regarding oral mucosal immune responses to changes in the microbiome and the organization of host immune reactivity to viral infections such as SARS‐CoVID‐2. Essential roles for oral microbiome and associated molecular biology need discussion. In this review, we have organised knowledge of oral microbiome, biology, and mucosal immunity to suggest novel biology affecting SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Attention to this relationship is important because of early and persistent oral pathology and clinically important consequences (e.g. loss of taste, "dry mouth", loss of smell, and neurologic complications). We further suggest that this review fosters oral mucosal immune studies, suggesting novel opportunities for early diagnosis, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and other oral pathogens. We discuss some unique molecular enzymatic biology that affects not only oral immunologic characteristics but also explains oral epithelial susceptibility to this virus, parallelling similar biology in non‐oral tissues and microenvironments.

### Probiotics as oral health biotherapeutics [^114Ca8Zv]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Oral health is affected by its resident microorganisms. Three prominent oral disorders are dental caries, gingivitis and periodontitis, with the oral microbiota playing a key role in the initiation/progression of all three. Understanding the microbiota and the diseases they may cause is critical to the development of new therapeutics. This review is focused on probiotics for the prevention and/or treatment of oral diseases.

Areas Covered

This review describes the oral ecosystem and its correlation with oral health/disease. The pathogenesis and current prevention/treatment strategies of periodontal diseases (PD) and dental caries (DC) are depicted. An introduction of probiotics is followed by an analysis of their role in PD and DC, and their potential role(s) in oral health. Finally, a discussion ensues on the future research directions and limitations of probiotics for oral health.

Expert Opinion

An effective oral probiotic formulation should contribute to the prevention/treatment of microbial diseases of the oral cavity. Understanding the oral microbiota's role in oral disease is important for the development of a therapeutic to prevent/treat dental diseases. However, investigations into clinical efficacy, delivery/dose optimization, mechanism(s) of action and other related parameters are yet to be fully explored. Keeping this in mind, investigations into oral probiotic therapies are proving promising.

### The balance and imbalance of microbial communities: oral-gut microbiota and colorectal cancer [^113FCQwC]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Balance and Imbalance of the Oral Microecosystem

Members of the oral microbiota mainly coexist and thrive by forming complex multispecies microbial communities, that is, "biofilms". Various bacterial species, whether aerobic or anaerobic, maintain homeostasis of the oral ecosystem in this symbiotic state, are resistant to environmental stimuli, establish a balance between pathogens and symbiotic bacteria, and thus help them survive.

Oral microecosystems play important roles in human health. The stability of the oral microecosystem is beneficial to human health. Its complex composition can resist stimulation by foreign pathogens and prevent colonization, thereby protecting the health of the host. These microbes coexist, antagonize, and interact with each other in different parts of the oral cavity to achieve a dynamic balance. However, their defensive capacity is limited. Overloaded physical and chemical factors, bacterial factors, and changes in host factors can disrupt microecological balance to varying degrees. When this state is disrupted and the balance of the oral ecosystem is disrupted, it may lead to pathogen infection and adversely affect the host.

An imbalance of the oral microecosystem can lead to the occurrence of oral and systemic diseases. When the microecosystem is unbalanced, the oral microecosystem interacts with the body through direct colonization, entry into the bloodstream, and activation of systemic inflammatory responses, thereby affecting the health of the body. Disease stimuli further exacerbate the imbalance in the oral microecosystem, forming a vicious positive feedback loop. Determining the composition of oral microbiota is crucial for understanding its role in health and disease, as it is the main participant in maintaining oral homeostasis.

### Oral microbiome dysbiosis is associated with precancerous lesions and disorders of upper gastrointestinal tract: a population-based study [^115XJEds]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The oral microbiota is one of the most diverse and complex microbial communities in the human body, comprising over 700 species that inhabit various locations within the oral cavity. There is growing evidence linking poor oral health and periodontal pathogens to an increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, suggesting that the oral microbiota may contribute to the development of these malignancies.

Among GI cancers, advanced esophageal and gastric cancers are among the deadliest types of GI cancer, arising from well-recognized histopathological changes in the mucosa. Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), for instance, has been associated with long-term or severe reflux symptoms, progressing through stages that include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, dysplasia, and ultimately EAC. Ekheden et al showed that inflammatory changes in the esophagus can increase the risk of EAC by 2 to 5 times. In the gastric carcinogenesis cascade, Helicobacter pylori -associated chronic active gastritis is the usual initiating point, which may progress toward atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and eventually gastric cancer. In Western populations, it is estimated that 1 in 85 patients with gastritis, 1 in 50 with gastritis with atrophy, 1 in 39 patients with intestinal metaplasia, and 1 in 19 patients with dysplasia will develop gastric cancer within 20 years.

Understanding the role of bacteria in these precancerous lesions could lead to the discovery of new biomarkers for early cancer detection and monitoring of disease progression. However, the influence of oral microbiota on the progression of esophageal and gastric precancerous lesions remains largely unexplored. To date, few studies with a hospital-based design and small sample sizes reported oral microbiota dysbiosis, which refers to changes in the composition of bacteria, in patients with GERD, Barrett's esophagus, and gastric lesions. Moreover, the microbiota of the oral cavity is extraordinarily complex. Depending on oxygen level, pH, and carbohydrate concentration, each surface of oral cavity harbors unique bacteria, of which their clinical manifestations are also different. While previous research has primarily focused on saliva microbiota, the microbial composition at other oral sites remains underexplored.

In this study, we aimed to determine the microbiota composition at 3 specific sites within the oral cavity, namely saliva (planktonic state but bacterial transmission zone), subgingival (low-oxygen area), and buccal mucosa (oxygen-enriched area) and to compare the microbiota profiles between subjects with well-characterized esophageal and gastric diseases in a random population-based study.

### Oral health implications in Parkinson's disease [^115RL4GJ]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral health affects Parkinson's disease

Oral diseases can further aggravate the progression of PD, with the role of the oral microbiota being particularly significant. The brain-gut axis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD, highlighting the interconnectedness between oral health, gut health, and neurological conditions. Systemic inflammation resulting from oral infections can exacerbate PD, contributing to the overall inflammatory burden in the body. Additionally, many oral diseases cause eating discomfort, for example, periodontal disease causes the destruction of oral tissue and inflammation, and temporomandibular disorders cause masticatory dysfunction and myalgia, which can result in malnutrition — a common complication that further deteriorates the health of PD patients. Oral diseases can also worsen cognitive dysfunction, as inflammation and poor oral health are linked to the progression of neurological symptoms in PD.

### Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse [^112VZbMP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse provides antimicrobial activity during oral rinsing. The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse's antimicrobial activities is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54–97% through six months use. Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six month clinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline.

Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic studies with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse indicate approximately 30% of the active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is retained in the oral cavity following rinsing. This retained drug is slowly released into the oral fluids. Studies conducted on human subjects and animals demonstrate chlorhexidine gluconate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean plasma level of chlorhexidine gluconate reached a peak of 0.206 mcg/g in humans 30 minutes after they ingested a 300-mg dose of the drug. Detectable levels of chlorhexidine gluconate were not present in the plasma of these subjects 12 hours after the compound was administered. Excretion of chlorhexidine gluconate occurred primarily through the feces (~90%). Less than 1% of the chlorhexidine gluconate ingested by these subjects was excreted in the urine.

### Giant extrachromosomal element "Inocle" potentially expands the adaptive capacity of the human oral microbiome [^1136KeA1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Bacteria residing in humans are exposed to various stressors, including nutrient competition, drugs for humans, antibiotics, and human immune responses. To survive these multiple stressors, bacteria expand their adaptive capacity by acquiring accessory genes corresponding to environmental stress tolerance. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are the major mechanism by which bacteria obtain accessory genes from other bacteria. Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and transposons are intrachromosomal MGEs that transfer the accessory genes to host bacteria by integrating their sequences into the host bacterial chromosome. In addition, bacteria obtain accessory genes via extrachromosomal elements (ECEs), which are genetic elements independent of chromosomes. Microbiological research targeting pathogenic bacteria has revealed that ECEs, such as plasmids, confer environmental stress resistance on host bacteria, including antibiotic resistance. This infers that ECEs contribute to expanding the adaptive capacity of human commensal bacteria.

Several advanced strategies for predicting ECEs from metagenomic sequences have revealed that human commensal bacteria harbor diverse ECEs, such as bacteriophages (phages) –, plasmids, and viroid-like elements. However, current metagenomic analysis based on a limited set of reference genomes may overlook ECEs that could not be classified using existing knowledge, and it is largely unknown the genetic diversity and functional roles of ECEs in human commensal bacteria.

Here, we identified the novel giant ECEs from the oral cavity of most individuals in the world, which are considered plasmid-like elements encoding multiple genes related to adaptation to intracellular and extracellular stresses. We have characterized this novel plasmid-like element, termed "Inocle", focusing on its genetic and ecological significance. Moreover, we elucidated the significant associations of Inocles with human immune statuses and certain cancer types. This study demonstrates that human commensal bacteria adapt to changes in their habitat conditions and human physiological alterations, utilizing giant ECEs.

### The balance and imbalance of microbial communities: oral-gut microbiota and colorectal cancer [^111zWxFt]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

The microbiome is a significant multimicrobial community that coexists with the human body in a symbiotic relationship. These microbial communities participate in mechanisms, such as defense against infections, absorption of nutrients, and maintenance of internal homeostasis. Although the microbiome is involved in physiological processes that are beneficial to host health, it can also lead to serious problems. Despite being far apart, the oral cavity and colon are both highly colonized by different microbial communities. Studies have shown that oral bacteria can migrate to and colonize the colon, which is most evident in diseases such as periodontitis. These oral pathogenic bacteria, which contain a large number of carcinogenic factors such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, can penetrate the large intestine and cause intestinal microbial imbalance and dysfunction, thereby stimulating carcinogenesis. Increasing evidence suggests that oral microbiota, especially certain periodontal pathogens, may be used as biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC). Understanding the exact mechanisms of microbiome interactions and their impact on CRC will provide future opportunities for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer, and is an important prerequisite for its use as a precise noninvasive biomarker, which is crucial for the early detection of CRC. This review aims to summarize the current research status of oral microbiota, gut microbiota, and their association with CRC, and to evaluate the effectiveness of oral microbiome-derived biomarkers.

### Microbial transmission, colonisation and succession: from pregnancy to infancy [^116L5VwN]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

The second problem corresponds to the real source of the intrauterine microbiome detected using various methods. Several studies have indicated that diseases such as endometritis and bacterial vaginosis may result in bacteria accessing the uterus, seriously affecting the development of the fetus. On the other hand, bacteria in maternal blood and the oral cavity may be transferred into the uterus and fetus through the maternal circulation, which may be caused by serious blood diseases, periodontitis or mild inflammation or infection during pregnancy. Various abnormal conditions could result in the detection of bacteria in uterine or fetal tissues. Pathogens from other locations of the maternal body are obviously a poor example of bacterial colonisation, which cannot strongly support a stable community in utero. Further evidence is needed to demonstrate that the colonisation of the microbiome truly occurs in utero rather than via transient resident transfer from other organs or tissues under a diseased or inflammatory condition.

Due to the lack of culture-dependent methods in most studies, there is doubt that the bacteria detected in these experiments are likely to be bacterial fragments rather than viable microbes. Some have questioned whether no differences will be observed in prenatal and postnatal development if such fragments or low biomass microbes neither form a stable community nor perform biological functions. While numerous previous studies have failed to prove the functionality of the detected microbiome, recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of live bacteria in utero is not required for immunomodulatory effects, and some bacterial molecules can be transferred to offspring with maternal antibodies.

Whether bacterial colonisation occurs in utero remains an open question, and the present evidence is not sufficient to completely reject the sterile womb hypothesis. If the uterus is free of a microbiome, how can infants survive and immediately adapt when they leave a completely sterile environment and are exposed to a complex environment filled with bacteria at the time of delivery? If the microbiome truly exists, divides and colonises in utero, what function does it actually have? Where do these bacteria come from and when do they colonise? These are all problems that must be handled with caution.

There is still a long way to go before the debate is completely resolved. On the one hand, new ideas and observations are greatly encouraged to open our minds and reshape our views, pushing the field forwards; at the same time, rigorous and well-designed experiments are highly required to look for more evidence to support or oppose the hypothesis. On the other hand, novel technologies are urgently needed to improve the sensitivity and accuracy in analysing low biomass samples, as well as to improve bioinformatic strategies based on sequencing data.

### Prelude to oral microbes and chronic diseases: past, present and future [^113PSgXK]. Microbes and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Associations between oral and systemic health are ancient. Oral opportunistic bacteria, particularly, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, have recently been deviated from their traditional roles as periodontal pathogens and arguably ascended to central players based on their participations in complex co-dependent mechanisms of diverse systemic chronic diseases risk and pathogenesis, including cancers, rheumatoid-arthritis, and diabetes.

### Pathogens and host immunity in the ancient human oral cavity [^113PKzpw]. Nature Genetics (2014). Medium credibility.

Calcified dental plaque (dental calculus) preserves for millennia and entraps biomolecules from all domains of life and viruses. We report the first, to our knowledge, high-resolution taxonomic and protein functional characterization of the ancient oral microbiome and demonstrate that the oral cavity has long served as a reservoir for bacteria implicated in both local and systemic disease. We characterize (i) the ancient oral microbiome in a diseased state, (ii) 40 opportunistic pathogens, (iii) ancient human-associated putative antibiotic resistance genes, (iv) a genome reconstruction of the periodontal pathogen Tannerella forsythia, (v) 239 bacterial and 43 human proteins, allowing confirmation of a long-term association between host immune factors, 'red complex' pathogens and periodontal disease, and (vi) DNA sequences matching dietary sources. Directly datable and nearly ubiquitous, dental calculus permits the simultaneous investigation of pathogen activity, host immunity and diet, thereby extending direct investigation of common diseases into the human evolutionary past.

### Stress and mental health symptoms in early pregnancy are associated with the oral microbiome [^111gMBZQ]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

Poor mental health affects > 15–20% of pregnant women worldwideand significantly reduces maternal well-being, impairs mothers' capacity for infant caregiving, and imperils child development. The biological determinants of poor maternal mental health are numerous and include circulating steroid and peptide hormones, neurosteroids, monoamine neurotransmitters and inflammatory cytokines. Recent studies have further proposed relations between maternal mental health and the bacteria existing on and within the human body. These microorganisms in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts, oral cavity, lungs, genitourinary tract, skin and elsewhere have been thought to be both causes and consequences of our physical health. These relations have been extended to mental health. For instance, a meta-analysis confirmed differences between people with and without major depression in their lower gut microbiome and also that altering the gut microbiome with probiotics significantly improved depression symptoms.

### Oral microbiome profile of the US population [^113QoD6P]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Previous studies characterizing the oral microbiome have used convenience samples or individuals with specific health conditions. The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) established a community structure for the oral cavity across 7 oral sites, including saliva from healthy individuals with no serious oral diseases. In the HMP, the genera with the highest relative abundance in saliva were Prevotella, Veillonella, Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, an unclassified Pasteurellaceae, Neisseria, and Porphyromonas, making up 60.7% of the mean genus-level relative abundance. In the buccal mucosa, the top genera were Streptococcus, Gemella, an unclassified Pasteurellaceae, Veillonella, Haemophilus, and Neisseria, making up 76.1% of the total. Of the top 6 genera (from oral rinses) in the present study, 4 were highly abundant in saliva or the buccal mucosa in the HMP. The observed differences could be due to the different collection methods since oral rinse samples have been observed to have greater α diversity than samples from other oral sites and have microbial communities most similar to those in saliva. It is also possible that the differences in these data compared with the HMP are due to the nonrepresentative nature of the HMP sample or varying laboratory handling or bioinformatic processing of data.

### The effects of treatment of acute otitis media with a low dose vs a high dose of amoxicillin on the nasopharyngeal flora… [^113295y3]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

A, A change from 92 organisms before treatment to 60 after treatment is shown; B, the change is from 86 organisms before treatment to 36 after treatment. HI indicates Haemophilus influenzae; MC, Moraxella catarrhalis; SA, Staphylococcus aureus; SP, Streptococcus pneumoniae. Conclusions The oral flora at the end of therapy with a high dose of amoxicillin is more depleted of organisms with interfering capability than following treatment with a low dose of amoxicillin. These changes may contribute to the greater recovery rate of patients infected with S aureus who received a high dose of amoxicillin. 2–4 These organisms include the aerobic α-hemolytic streptococci, anaerobic streptococci, and Prevotella melaninogenica. 4, 5. Administration of antimicrobial agents can affect the composition of the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora.

6 Oral flora organisms with interfering capability are generally susceptible to amoxicillin. These include aerobic and anaerobic streptococci, as well as penicillin-susceptible P melaninogenica. The inhibitory activity of these AHS was through the production of hydrogen peroxide. 11 These data suggest that AHS may play a role in prevention of colonization with MRSA. The oral flora at the end of amoxicillin-clavulanate therapy was found to be more depleted of aerobic and anaerobic organisms with interfering capability than following cefdinir therapy. The differences between the 2 therapy groups persisted for at least 60 days. A faster reacquisition of potential pathogenic bacteria occurred in those treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate than in those treated with the cephalosporin. The ability of the indigenous normal nasopharyngeal flora to inhibit colonization with potential pathogens has been studied.

α-Hemolytic streptococci were found to inhibit the colonization in patients and in vitro growth of a variety of pathogenic bacteria. These include S pneumoniae, group A β-hemolytic streptococci, and S aureus. 4, 8 The production of bacteriocin and other inhibitory substances that suppress some bacterial growth or the use of nutrients in the nasopharyngeal environment essential for the potential pathogens may explain this phenomenon. 4, 13, 14.

### Periodontitis: a polymicrobial disruption of host homeostasis [^116GycT8]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Periodontitis, or gum disease, affects millions of people each year. Although it is associated with a defined microbial composition found on the surface of the tooth and tooth root, the contribution of bacteria to disease progression is poorly understood. Commensal bacteria probably induce a protective response that prevents the host from developing disease. However, several bacterial species found in plaque (the 'red-complex' bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola) use various mechanisms to interfere with host defence mechanisms. Furthermore, disease may result from 'community-based' attack on the host. Here, I describe the interaction of the host immune system with the oral bacteria in healthy states and in diseased states.

### Genomics, microbiomics, proteomics, and metabolomics in bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^113BYHBE]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Microbiomics

Human microbiome refers to the diverse microbial population that reside within or on various surfaces of the human body. Around 10–100 trillion human microbial cells are harbored by each personand human microbiome research has expanded significantly over the past few years. The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) was added to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap for Medical Research in 2017 and since then, several human body sites including the nares, oral cavity, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and urogenital tract have been studied by the HMP. Many studies have established that the microbiome influences the host immune system and plays a significant role in acquiring as well as preventing disease states. Many studies on the microbiome have so far focused mainly on the role of the gut microbiome. The study of the airway microbiome in perspective with pulmonary health is still an area of emerging field of research. Until recently, evidence of pathogenic roles for specific alterations in airway microbiota was strongest in lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, but it was not clear how the airway microbiome is initially established in newborn infants.

### Topographical continuity of bacterial populations in the healthy human respiratory tract [^115vAb9W]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Rationale

Defining the biogeography of bacterial populations in human body habitats is a high priority for understanding microbial-host relationships in health and disease. The healthy lung was traditionally considered sterile, but this notion has been challenged by emerging molecular approaches that enable comprehensive examination of microbial communities. However, studies of the lung are challenging due to difficulties in working with low biomass samples.

Objectives

Our goal was to use molecular methods to define the bacterial microbiota present in the lungs of healthy individuals and assess its relationship to upper airway populations.

Methods

We sampled respiratory flora intensively at multiple sites in six healthy individuals. The upper tract was sampled by oral wash and oro-/nasopharyngeal swabs. Two bronchoscopes were used to collect samples up to the glottis, followed by serial bronchoalveolar lavage and lower airway protected brush. Bacterial abundance and composition were analyzed by 16S rDNA Q-PCR and deep sequencing.

Measurements and Main Results

Bacterial communities from the lung displayed composition indistinguishable from the upper airways, but were 2 to 4 logs lower in biomass. Lung-specific sequences were rare and not shared among individuals. There was no unique lung microbiome.

Conclusions

In contrast to other organ systems, the respiratory tract harbors a homogenous microbiota that decreases in biomass from upper to lower tract. The healthy lung does not contain a consistent distinct microbiome, but instead contains low levels of bacterial sequences largely indistinguishable from upper respiratory flora. These findings establish baseline data for healthy subjects and sampling approaches for sequence-based analysis of diseases.

### The oral-lung axis: the impact of oral health on lung health [^115vuFux]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Poor oral health has long been recognized as a clinical risk factor for developing lung infections. Recent data using culture-independent techniques assessing the microbiome in healthy subjects have demonstrated that chronic microaspiration establishes a very similar microbial community between the mouth and lung, suggesting these 2 anatomic regions are closely intertwined. Dental disease is driven and aided by a dysbiosis in the oral microbiome, and evidence is mounting that implicates the microbiome in a variety of lung diseases including asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and pneumonia. This review describes common dental conditions and potential mechanisms by which poor oral health may contribute to lung disease. We also review the current literature drawing associations between poor oral health and lung disease.

### Oral streptococciandinduce distinct morphological, inflammatory, and metabolic signatures in macrophages [^11527V3d]. Infection and Immunity (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Microbes that are in constant interaction with the host engage in varied interactions spanning symbiosis, and the outcomes range from damage, benefit, or indifference. The delicate interaction between the body's resident microbiota and the immune system is vital for maintaining homeostatic balance. Disruption in this immune homeostasis due to dysbiosis can be elicited by various lifestyle factors like tobacco consumption, chronic alcohol exposure, inadequate oral hygiene, dietary changes, or antibiotic usage. While host damage is often a requirement for the induction of a pathogen-specific immune response, the extent and nature of the damage incurred during the early stages and/or subsequent phases between host and microbial interactions determine the outcome of the host-microbe relationship. The occurrence of damage isn't solely attributed to the presence and proliferation of pathogens; rather, it can also stem from the deficiency of commensal bacteria that typically inhibit the colonization of these pathogens.

Oral commensal streptococci or viridans group streptococci (VGS) are Gram-positive cocci that are catalase-negative facultative anaerobes. While most exhibit alpha hemolysis, variations exist, with some demonstrating beta hemolysis or displaying no hemolytic activity when cultured on blood agar. Streptococci are the first organisms to colonize oral surfaces, and most of them are typically deemed non-pathogenic due to their lack of virulence factors, like exotoxin production, and due to their non-invasive potential found in other pathogenic organisms. Being early colonizers of the oral cavity, Streptococcus species like Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius play a significant role in maintaining oral homeostasis by establishing a stable multispecies dental biofilm. Despite being traditionally considered non-pathogenic, they can also become opportunistic pathogens, evidenced by their involvement in a diverse range of clinical diseases, including infective endocarditis, bacteremia, and infections related to malignancy.

### Updated perspectives on the contribution of the microbiome to the pathogenesis of mucositis using the MASCC / ISOO framework [^111s7htH]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods of sample collection and data analysis

The oral cavity consists of several microbial niches, such as the gingiva, tongue, dental tissue, and palate. However, significant cross-niche correlations exist between different sample types and need to be considered relative to the research question. Most large studies into the oral microbiome use saliva or an oral rinse, as they are easy to collect. While these sample types do not represent a specific oral niche, they do resemble the microbiota on mucosal surfaces. While access to the oral cavity is relatively simple, the rest of the gastrointestinal tract is not well accessible, leading to a more clinical focus of oral studies and animal focus for specific regions of the gastrointestinal tract. In animal models studying the gut microbiome in relation to gastrointestinal mucositis, the possibilities for sampling a specific part of the intestine are greater than in humans. Hence, the ability to sample the caecal and colon content in euthanized rats and mice, and feces in live mice are reported, while in humans, feces are sampled rather than caecal or colon content. One distinct advantage of feces is the ability to conduct repeated sampling.

Once samples are collected, careful consideration must be taken in DNA extraction and library preparation. It is critically important to reduce variability in both methods and reagents used for these processes and to include a blank sample at every step to detect possible contamination. Among the sequencing methods, there is the possibility of sequencing a specific gene (16S rRNA gene for bacteria) or the whole bacterial genome. The method should again be chosen depending on the hypothesis/goal of the study. To find the phylogenetic and microbial community information of the sample, sequencing the 16S rRNA is a fast and cost-effective method. Another advantage of target-gene sequencing is that the presence of human DNA in the sample has little or no effect on the results. Whole genome sequencing, also called metagenomics analysis, extracts more genomic information and enables us to find a higher taxonomic resolution.

In contrast to the greater amount of data, it is more expensive and requires more careful analysis. A great advantage is the reduction of biases caused by the library construction steps and database choice, as the results are inferred directly from the genomics of the sample. It is beyond the scope of this review to suggest how microbiome datasets should be analyzed, as there are many thorough resources available in this area. However, understanding the points of confusion and standardizing the possible methodological and clinical points is important to achieve clinically impactful results.

### Abundance and diversity of resistomes differ between healthy human oral cavities and gut [^112sUUba]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The global threat of antimicrobial resistance has driven the use of high-throughput sequencing techniques to monitor the profile of resistance genes, known as the resistome, in microbial populations. The human oral cavity contains a poorly explored reservoir of these genes. Here we analyse and compare the resistome profiles of 788 oral cavities worldwide with paired stool metagenomes. We find country and body site-specific differences in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes, classes and mechanisms in oral and stool samples. Within individuals, the highest abundances of antimicrobial resistance genes are found in the oral cavity, but the oral cavity contains a lower diversity of resistance genes compared to the gut. Additionally, co-occurrence analysis shows contrasting ARG-species associations between saliva and stool samples. Maintenance and persistence of antimicrobial resistance is likely to vary across different body sites. Thus, we highlight the importance of characterising the resistome across body sites to uncover the antimicrobial resistance potential in the human body.

### The balance and imbalance of microbial communities: oral-gut microbiota and colorectal cancer [^116xXUMd]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

Patients with gastrointestinal tumors exhibit characteristic changes in their oral microbiota, and the occurrence of oral diseases may be associated with gastrointestinal tumors. Compared with the gut microbiota, oral microbiota offers the advantage of being a noninvasive test that is more convenient and safe, with broad application prospects. Specific bacteria in the oral cavity can translocate to other organs of the digestive system through hematogenous or enteral routes and participate in tumor development. The oral microbiota is associated with various cancers and diseases through the toxicity of bacteria and their products, as well as indirect effects through inflammatory pathology and signal transduction. However, the causal relationship and specific mechanisms between changes in oral microbiota and the occurrence of gastrointestinal tumors are still not fully understood. Studying the impact of bacteria on tumors in different parts of the body, analyzing the causal role of the microbiota, and identifying the pathologic effects caused by oral microbiota dysbiosis can provide diagnostic criteria for gastrointestinal tumors and assist in early screening and prognosis. A better understanding of the role of the oral-gut microbiota axis in pathogenesis will be beneficial for the precise diagnosis and prognosis of CRC, as well as for effective treatment. More research is needed to provide greater application value for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of gastrointestinal tumors using oral microbiota.

### Are the view of Helicobacter pylori colonized in the oral cavity an illusion? [^114FYas8]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The association between stomach and oral H. pylori infection

Whether the oral H. pylori are transient or permanent in the mouth, the fundamental question is, 'Can oral H. pylori be a reservoir for gastric H. pylori infection?' One might be first address whether there is an association between oral and gastric H. pylori carriage. Several studies have reported there is positive link oral with gastric H. pylori. Conversely, there was a study that indicated there were no such association. Song et al. reported that H. pylori exist in the oral cavity of 97% of patients that has characteristic distribution independent of the status of stomach infection. This is why they consider H. pylori may belong to the normal oral microflora, which is nothing link with stomach infection. However, recent studies show the bacterial involving oral cavity and stomach has an identical or closely species which related strains of H. pylori that provided a good evidence of the role of the oral cavity link with gastric infection.

### Infections as ecosystems: community metabolic interactions in microbial pathogenesis [^1142yw9F]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Microbial communities are present on nearly every surface of the human body. These microbiomes exist as dynamic ecosystems that are influenced by heterogeneous nutritional and chemical landscapes, the ability to attach to surfaces, and interactions with the host immune system. Microbes within microbial communities exist within a metabolic economy, dictated by the sequestration and exchange of nutrients, that is central to controlling bacterial physiology, establishment within a niche, and co-existence with other community members. Furthermore, in pathogenesis, microbial metabolism is known to play a central role in virulence and the ability of pathogens to survive and persist within a host. Although studies into the mechanisms of pathogenesis have occurred for over 200 years, until only recently, these mechanistic studies have primarily focused on single organisms in isolation and have largely ignored the metabolic influence of the resident microbiota and how interactions between organisms impact disease. While this work has been foundational toward understanding how microbes cause disease, the collective role of microbiome metabolism in pathogenesis has been largely overlooked. Here, we will expand on this framework and discuss the interplay between the host environment and microbiome metabolism and the impacts on disease progression in host-associated polymicrobial communities. Although the concepts we will address are applicable to a wide range of host-associated microbiomes, for the purpose of this mini-review, we will primarily focus on interactions that occur in the oral and respiratory tracts where we have expertise. We will first discuss how the host environment influences community metabolism and disease outcomes, with an emphasis on how these environments are inherently dynamic and heterogeneous. We will then discuss microbial interactions in host-associated communities and the context-dependent nature of these interactions. Our overall goal is to provide insights about microbiome metabolism in a host and its impacts on disease progression. Increased understanding of community metabolism may allow these collective interactions to be leveraged to support more resilient microbiomes that prevent the progression of disease and improve human health.

In the past decade, the human microbiome has been associated with alterations in insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular disease, behavioral disorders, susceptibility to allergies and infection, and even cancer treatment outcomes in populations in North America and Europe. Yet, while we have learned that human gut and oral microbiomes are categorically different across the globe, research that links microbiota to health concerns of populations in the rest of the world has been noticeably lagging. The development of microbial therapeutics is imminent and may have relevance for major global health problems such as malnutrition, resilience to infection, and the growing threat of obesity and other metabolic disorders. To achieve this goal, it is first imperative to better understand whether reported microbiome effects are truly 'global'

### Host defense against oral microbiota by bone-damaging T cells [^117T6boR]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The interaction between host and microbial communities contributes to human health and disease. The human body surface is mostly covered by an epithelial layer, a physical barrier that functions as the first line of defense against pathogen invasion as well as in response to commensal microbiota. The oral mucosa, however, is exceptional in that the teeth are effectively a trans-mucosal organ, and the interface between each tooth and the mucosa lacks integrity of tight junctions, making it susceptible to infection by oral bacteria. Periodontitis affects > 47% adults in the U.S. and is considered one of the most frequent infectious diseases. Thus, unlike microbiota in other mucosal sites, such as gut and skin, the oral microbiota may have direct and distinct effects on the immune system as well as the health and well-being of the host.

The causal role of the oral microbiome in systemic diseases was first reported in 1891 by the American dentist Willoughby D. Miller. This concept was termed "oral sepsis" and led to the development of a focal infection theory, which was widely accepted until the middle of the twentieth century. However, the theory was discredited and forgotten due to a lack of concrete evidence and ill-advised aggressive tooth extraction. Recent studies have revisited the importance of the oral microbiota based on the close relationship between periodontitis and systemic pathological conditions, including cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and diabetes. Oral bacteria have been suggested to enter into the systemic circulation via inflamed gingiva and directly affect other organs –; therefore, the host may have a specialized defense system to protect against oral microbiota, but this mechanism has never been identified.

### Host-microbiota interactions in immune-mediated diseases [^115m5WHQ]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2020). High credibility.

Host-microbiota interactions are fundamental for the development of the immune system. Drastic changes in modern environments and lifestyles have led to an imbalance of this evolutionarily ancient process, coinciding with a steep rise in immune-mediated diseases such as autoimmune, allergic and chronic inflammatory disorders. There is an urgent need to better understand these diseases in the context of mucosal and skin microbiota. This Review discusses the mechanisms of how the microbiota contributes to the predisposition, initiation and perpetuation of immune-mediated diseases in the context of a genetically prone host. It is timely owing to the wealth of new studies that recently contributed to this field, ranging from metagenomic studies in humans and mechanistic studies of host-microorganism interactions in gnotobiotic models and in vitro systems, to molecular mechanisms with broader implications across immune-mediated diseases. We focus on the general principles, such as breaches in immune tolerance and barriers, leading to the promotion of immune-mediated diseases by gut, oral and skin microbiota. Lastly, the therapeutic avenues that either target the microbiota, the barrier surfaces or the host immune system to restore tolerance and homeostasis will be explored.

### The role of oral bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease [^113nHEXs]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Over the past two decades, the importance of the microbiota in health and disease has become evident. Pathological changes to the oral bacterial microbiota, such as those occurring during periodontal disease, are associated with multiple inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease. However, the degree to which this association is a consequence of elevated oral inflammation or because oral bacteria can directly drive inflammation at distal sites remains under debate. In this Perspective, we propose that in inflammatory bowel disease, oral disease-associated bacteria translocate to the intestine and directly exacerbate disease. We propose a multistage model that involves pathological changes to the microbial and immune compartments of both the oral cavity and intestine. The evidence to support this hypothesis is critically evaluated and the relevance to other diseases in which oral bacteria have been implicated (including colorectal cancer and liver disease) are discussed.

### Association between nitrate-reducing oral bacteria and cardiometabolic outcomes: results from ORIGINS [^115BqCQD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Increasing evidence suggests that the digestive tract microbiome (ie, bacteria colonizing the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal tract) may contribute to the development of insulin resistance, 1, 2 type 2 diabetes mellitus, 3, 4 and hypertension. 5, 6 These associations between the oral microbiome and increased cardiometabolic risk are most commonly hypothesized to result from a chronic inflammatory response to a dysbiotic subgingival microbiome. 7 However, a possible alternative mechanism is via the production of the physiologically important gaseous transmitter, nitric oxide (NO).

NO is an important signaling molecule involved in many physiological processes, including endothelial function, vasodilation, immune function, glucose metabolism, and blood pressure (BP) control. 8 A loss of NO production and bioavailability has been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and hypertension. 9, 10 NO production was originally thought to occur solely through the endogenous conversion of‐arginine and oxygen into NO and‐citrulline by NO synthases found in the endothelium and other tissues. However, it has recently been discovered that NO production can also occur via the reduction of salivary nitrates by nitrate‐reducing oral bacteria to form nitrites, which are then swallowed and made systemically bioavailable for further reduction into NO in the blood vessels and tissues. 8 This so‐called enterosalivary nitrate‐nitrite‐NO pathway presents a novel and biologically plausible mechanism by which oral bacteria might influence the systemic bioavailability of NO and the development of related clinical cardiometabolic outcomes in humans.

### Oral health care for the critically ill: a narrative review [^115bQ36b]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The oral cavity houses the second largest microbiota in the human body and includes bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea. The majority of micro-organisms within the oral cavity are found within biofilms consisting of mostly commensal bacteria that are considered beneficial for the host. However, dysbiosis of the microbial biofilm can lead to dental diseases such as periodontitis and tooth decay. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the supporting tissues of the teeth and is generally caused by oral anaerobic bacteria in a susceptible individual. The disease is highly prevalent, with severe forms affecting 10% of the population. Tooth decay, on the other hand, is caused by acid produced by oral bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates. Untreated dental caries is the 2nd most common chronic disease, with 2.4 billion individuals affected worldwide. Untreated caries can ultimately lead to the death of the tooth and subsequent abscess formation in the underlying tissues.

Localised oral diseases, including periodontitis and caries-induced infections, have previously been shown to have systemic connections. Oral bacteria commonly gain entrance to the circulation through ulcerated gingiva crevicular tissue that surrounds the teeth. Invasion of the cariogenic Gram positive bacterium Streptococcus mutans into vascular endothelial cells is considered an exacerbating factor in infective endocarditis. Additionally, oral bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, Enterococcus faecalis, and others have been implicated in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. Poor oral hygiene in this regard, has been shown to be associated with an increased risk for infective endocarditis. Gram negative oral bacteria and the local inflammatory response associated with periodontitis, can contribute to systemic inflammation and the initiation and progression of chronic inflammatory based diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and respiratory disease.

This narrative review aims to provide an overview on the links between oral health and respiratory disease with particular consideration to the critically ill. We also consider the roles oral health assessment and oral care interventions have in the critically ill. A comprehensive search of the published English literature was conducted in PubMed, Medline, and Scopus until March 2021, using the following keywords: ("oral health" OR "oral disease" OR "periodontitis" OR "caries" OR "oral health assessment" OR "oral health care" OR "oral prophylaxis") AND ("critically ill" OR "critical care" OR "intensive care" OR "VAP"). Two of our investigators independently searched the databases (IEK and LW) and reviewed each of the retrieved articles.

### Oral microbiome profile of the US population [^114TFptV]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The community of bacteria and other microbiota in the human oral cavity, the oral microbiome, is increasingly recognized to play a role in health and disease. The oral microbiome is involved in digestion and metabolism of nutrients (eg, dietary nitrates and carbohydrates) and carcinogens (eg, conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde), blood pressure and metabolic homeostasis, and regulation of oral and systemic immunity and inflammation. Certain oral bacteria contribute to periodontitis and poor oral health, and alterations in the oral microbiome have been associated with several chronic diseases, including cancer (eg, upper aerodigestive and colorectal), diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders.,

Understanding the relevance of the oral microbiome in human health requires a population reference standard of the composition of the oral bacterial ecosystem and prevalence, relative abundance, and interrelationships of taxa, established through characterization of the oral microbiome in a representative population sample. Such a reference standard could serve as a critical comparator to explain the disease relevance of alterations in the oral microbiome. However, few population-representative characterizations exist in the literature. Most prior studies of the oral microbiome have been conducted in nonrepresentative groups or highly selective subgroups.,

Here, we address the lack of population-representative studies. Specifically, we aimed to characterize the composition; diversity; and demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, anthropometric, metabolic, and clinical correlates of the oral microbiome in a representative sample of US adults.

### The person-to-person transmission landscape of the gut and oral microbiomes [^115kP8Dh]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

The human microbiome is an integral component of the human body and a co-determinant of several health conditions 1,2. However, the extent to which interpersonal relations shape the individual genetic makeup of the microbiome and its transmission within and across populations remains largely unknown 3,4. Here, capitalizing on more than 9,700 human metagenomes and computational strain-level profiling, we detected extensive bacterial strain sharing across individuals (more than 10 million instances) with distinct mother-to-infant, intra-household and intra-population transmission patterns. Mother-to-infant gut microbiome transmission was considerable and stable during infancy (around 50% of the same strains among shared species (strain-sharing rate)) and remained detectable at older ages. By contrast, the transmission of the oral microbiome occurred largely horizontally and was enhanced by the duration of cohabitation. There was substantial strain sharing among cohabiting individuals, with 12% and 32% median strain-sharing rates for the gut and oral microbiomes, and time since cohabitation affected strain sharing more than age or genetics did. Bacterial strain sharing additionally recapitulated host population structures better than species-level profiles did. Finally, distinct taxa appeared as efficient spreaders across transmission modes and were associated with different predicted bacterial phenotypes linked with out-of-host survival capabilities. The extent of microorganism transmission that we describe underscores its relevance in human microbiome studies 5, especially those on non-infectious, microbiome-associated diseases.

### Interkingdom networking within the oral microbiome [^115f8BDa]. Microbes and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Different sites within the oropharynx harbour unique microbial communities. Co-evolution of microbes and host has resulted in complex interkingdom circuitries. Metabolic signalling is crucial to these processes, and novel microbial communication factors are progressively being discovered. Resolving interkingdom networks will lead to better understanding of oral health or disease aetiology.

### Tracing the accumulation of in vivo human oral microbiota elucidates microbial community dynamics at the gateway to the GI tract [^115Vacsm]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

As the gateway and source of microbial down-transmission to the GI tract, the oral cavity is in a vital position. Our study uncovered the recovery and long-term stability of the oral microbiota after strong disturbance, and identified the key time points and phases of the most dramatic community changes and structural recovery. These findings suggest that when considering the use of oral bacteria as biomarkers to predict digestive system diseases, collection time and site should be taken into consideration. This study provides an opportunity to evaluate whether oral bacteria are suitable for disease prediction and promotes the development of non-invasive diagnostic techniques.

### The gut microbiota and host health: a new clinical frontier [^111SnBhS]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Current understanding of the gut microbiota

In the last decade, several large-scale projects, for example, the human microbiome project, have investigated the microbiota of a variety of bodily niches, including the skin as well as the oral, vaginal and nasal cavities. While some of these are relatively easy to access, the GI tract remains a challenging environment to sample, and to describe. Currently the majority of research is focused on the gut microbiota, since this is where the greatest density and numbers of bacteria are found, with most data being derived from faecal samples and, to a lesser extent, mucosal biopsies. While it is relatively easy to obtain fresh faecal samples, the information obtained from them does not represent the complete picture within the gut. From a number of limited studies, we know that the small intestine contains a very different abundance and composition of bacteria, with much more dynamic variation compared with the colon. The colonic microbiota is largely driven by the efficient degradation of complex indigestible carbohydrates but that of the small intestine is shaped by its capacity for the fast import and conversion of relatively small carbohydrates, and rapid adaptation to overall nutrient availability. While faeces are not an ideal proxy for the GI tract, they do give a snapshot of the diversity within the large intestine. Furthermore, the majority of the data comes from North American and European studies with very few studies in Asia, Africa or South America. Hence we have a somewhat biased view of the gut microbiota.

This rapid increase in interest in the microbiome has also been driven by the application of multi-'omic' technologies; we refer the reader to Lepage et al for more detailed explanation of these (see also box 1).

### Effects of periodontitis on cancer outcomes in the era of immunotherapy [^112sAez7]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2023). High credibility.

Periodontitis results from dysbiosis of the oral microbiome and affects up to 70% of US adults aged 65 years and older. More than 50 systemic inflammatory disorders and comorbidities are associated with periodontitis, many of which overlap with immunotherapy-associated toxicities. Despite the increasing use of immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer, uncertainty remains as to whether the microbial shift associated with periodontal disease can influence response rates and tolerance to cancer immunotherapy. We herein review the pathophysiology of periodontitis and the local and systemic inflammatory conditions related to oral dysbiosis, and discuss the overlapping adverse profiles of periodontitis and immunotherapy. The effects of the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a key pathogen in periodontitis, highlight how the oral microbiome can affect the hosts' systemic immune responses, and further research into the local and systemic influence of other microorganisms causing periodontal disease is necessary. Addressing periodontitis in an ageing population of people with cancer could have potential implications for the clinical response to (and tolerability of) immunotherapy and warrants further investigation.

### Unlocking modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease: does the oral microbiome hold some of the keys? [^1141NPGH]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Advancing age is recognized as the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however approximately one third of dementia cases are attributable to modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and obesity. Recent research also implicates oral health and the oral microbiome in AD risk and pathophysiology. The oral microbiome contributes to the cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative pathology of AD via the inflammatory, vascular, neurotoxic, and oxidative stress pathways of known modifiable risk factors. This review proposes a conceptual framework that integrates the emerging evidence regarding the oral microbiome with established modifiable risk factors. There are numerous mechanisms by which the oral microbiome may interact with AD pathophysiology. Microbiota have immunomodulatory functions, including the activation of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines. This inflammation can affect the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, which in turn modulates translocation of bacteria and their metabolites to brain parenchyma. Amyloid-β is an antimicrobial peptide, a feature which may in part explain its accumulation. There are microbial interactions with cardiovascular health, glucose tolerance, physical activity, and sleep, suggesting that these modifiable lifestyle risk factors of dementia may have microbial contributors. There is mounting evidence to suggest the relevance of oral health practices and the microbiome to AD. The conceptual framework presented here additionally demonstrates the potential for the oral microbiome to comprise a mechanistic intermediary between some lifestyle risk factors and AD pathophysiology. Future clinical studies may identify specific oral microbial targets and the optimum oral health practices to reduce dementia risk.

### Unlocking modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease: does the oral microbiome hold some of the keys? [^1163iSbv]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

As we will describe in the following section, the oral microbiome has important immune interactions which are distinct from those of the gut microbiome. However, the two sites are not entirely independent; while oral microbes are considered poor colonizers of the intestine, there is some evidence of microbial transfer from mouth to gut. An overlap of approximately half of bacterial species has been shown in oral and gut microbiota in healthy participants contributing to the Human Microbiome Project and in a study of patients with liver cirrhosis. Indeed, the 'ectopic' translocation of bacteria from oral cavity to large intestine via swallowed saliva represents a potential mechanism for observed links between periodontal and systemic diseases, in addition to the more direct route of translocation via bacteremia and systemic inflammation. This hypothesis has been supported by evidence that the principal bacteria causing chronic periodontitis, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is associated with orodigestive cancers. This same bacteria has been detected in circulating leukocytes and in aortic tissues, where it is thought to have pro-atherogenic effects.

### Is the oral microbiome a source to enhance mucosal immunity against infectious diseases? [^116imiQn]. NPJ Vaccines (2021). Medium credibility.

Immune landscape of the oral mucosa

Humans are host to a multitude of microorganisms that co-develop from birth, and are dependent on the host genome, nutrition, and lifestyle. The oral microbes have evolved with host tissues over thousands of years and are specifically adapted to the mucosal tissues. The human oral cavity is home to one of the most complex microbial ecosystems within the body. Estimates suggest there are more than 750 bacterial species in the human oral cavity, many of which have been implicated in local and systemic diseases. The sequential organization of the oral microbiome is complex, niche-dependent, and distinct in health and disease. Salivary mucins and proline-rich proteins help initiate bacterial colonization and biofilm formation, but also act to aggregate and clear the bacteria from oral surfaces. Although biomechanical and biochemical cues control initial adhesion of microbial biofilms on hard and soft tissue surfaces, multiple signaling molecules facilitate, such as cytokines, protect microbial colonization as well as participate in the development and maintenance of a healthy immunity at the mucosal border. For example, the gingival crevice has been shown to express an interleukin 8 (IL-8) gradient in the junctional epithelium which serves to recruit neutrophils into the tooth pocket where bacteria naturally accumulate. Once in the gingival sulcus/pocket, neutrophils form a barrier between the junctional epithelium and the subgingival biofilm. The neutrophil-wall prevents the apical migration of the bacteria deeper into tissues, which is essential to maintain periodontal homeostasis. Thus, preventing microbial access to connective tissue, major blood vessels and migration to systemic sites.

### Oral bacteria relative abundance in faeces increases due to gut microbiota depletion and is linked with patient outcomes [^112tiJyE]. Nature Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

The detection of oral bacteria in faecal samples has been associated with inflammation and intestinal diseases. The increased relative abundance of oral bacteria in faeces has two competing explanations: either oral bacteria invade the gut ecosystem and expand (the 'expansion' hypothesis), or oral bacteria transit through the gut and their relative increase marks the depletion of other gut bacteria (the 'marker' hypothesis). Here we collected oral and faecal samples from mouse models of gut dysbiosis (antibiotic treatment and DSS-induced colitis) and used 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing to determine the abundance dynamics of oral bacteria. We found that the relative, but not absolute, abundance of oral bacteria increases, reflecting the 'marker' hypothesis. Faecal microbiome datasets from diverse patient cohorts, including healthy individuals and patients with allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation or inflammatory bowel disease, consistently support the 'marker' hypothesis and explain associations between oral bacterial abundance and patient outcomes consistent with depleted gut microbiota. By distinguishing between the two hypotheses, our study guides the interpretation of microbiome compositional data and could potentially identify cases where therapies are needed to rebuild the resident microbiome rather than protect against invading oral bacteria.

### Microbes translocation from oral cavity to nasopharyngeal carcinoma in patients [^11512Zjc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Trillions of microbes inhabit both inside and outside of the body, including the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, skin, etc. Specific parts of our body possess specialized microbial communities deemed to be essential for maintaining human health. However, heterologous microbes could colonize other adjacent or distant tissues ectopically, altering the local microenvironment and increasing the risk of diseases, particularly the translocations of the oral microbiota. For example, some specific oral microbes, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, could overcome physical and/or chemical barriers to ectopically accumulate in the gut under pathological conditions, and participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer –. Similarly, the interactions between oral and pulmonary microbiota have been recently identified, with the enrichment of oral microbes in the lung related to pulmonary pro-inflammatory phenotype and worse prognosis in lung cancer patients. The nasopharynx is the gateway of the upper airway and an important niche for microbiota. In general, the oral cavity and nasopharynx maintain different ecological niches with various commensal residents. The loss of niche differences between these two sites has been observed in some upper respiratory tract infections. The interactions between oral and nasopharyngeal microbiota and their association with other disease phenotypes, such as cancers, remain to be elucidated.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor arising from the nasopharyngeal mucosa. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, in 2020, there were about 133 thousand new cases of NPC, accounting for 0.7% of all cancer diagnoses. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, host genetics and environmental factors are closely associated with the occurrence and progression of NPC. Recently, the clinical significance of nasopharyngeal microbiota in NPC is starting to gain attention since the local microbiota seem to be associated with NPC therapy response, side effects and prognosis –. However, the detailed characterization of nasopharyngeal microbiota, its' association with oral microbiota, the tripartite interactions among nasopharyngeal microbiota, host and EBV, and its role in carcinogenesis remain unclear. Particularly, what alterations occurred in nasopharyngeal and oral microbiota between normal people and NPC patients? How do these microbiotas in different locations communicate? Could the nasopharyngeal microbiota interact with EBV infection to promote the onset and progression of NPC?

### The person-to-person transmission landscape of the gut and oral microbiomes [^113Ug9EJ]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Our genome is inherited from our parents and remains stable over our lifetime, with limited accumulation of nucleotide variations. By contrast, the genetic makeup of our microorganism complement (the human microbiome) is seeded at birth and changes over time, displaying both high temporal variability and personalization. Factors including diet and lifestyle are well known to modulate the composition of the human microbiome, but as very few members of the microbiome can thrive outside the human body, most microorganisms must be acquired from other individuals. Indeed, colonization of the human gut by microorganisms is largely seeded by maternal transmission –, but maternal seeding alone cannot account for the large diversity of microorganisms found in adults. How members of the microbiome are acquired and transmitted by individuals and spread in populations, and how this shapes the personal microbiome genetic makeup remain largely unexplored — especially in humans, — with only preliminary findings to date. So far, research has been hindered by the limited number and size of accurately designed studies, and by the difficulties in consistently and comprehensively profiling microorganism conspecific strains — that is, genetic variants within species.

Strains are the individual-specific building blocks of the human microbiome. They can be highly genomically and functionally divergent within a species, and their profiling is a necessary prerequisite to distinguish transmission of microorganisms from microbiome convergence towards an overlapping set of species. Identifying the features of microbiome transmission will advance our understanding of the complexity of the human microbiome, and can help address the 'communicable' factor that microbiome transmission adds to diseases and conditions currently considered non-communicable. Here, we characterize and quantify the patterns of person-to-person microbiome strain sharing across multiple scenarios to provide a comprehensive description of the microbiome transmission landscape.

### The interpersonal and intrapersonal diversity of human-associated microbiota in key body sites [^1143HrA7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

The human body harbors 10 to 100 trillion microbes, mainly bacteria in our gut, which greatly outnumber our own human cells. This bacterial assemblage, referred to as the human microbiota, plays a fundamental role in our well-being. Deviations from healthy microbial compositions (dysbiosis) have been linked with important human diseases, including inflammation-linked disorders, such as allergies, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease. Characterizing the temporal variations and community membership of the healthy human microbiome is critical to accurately identify the significant deviations from normality that could be associated with disease states. However, the diversity of the human microbiome varies between body sites, between patients, and over time. Environmental differences have also been shown to play a role in shaping the human microbiome in different cultures, requiring that the healthy human microbiome be characterized across life spans, ethnicities, nationalities, cultures, and geographic locales. In this article we summarize our knowledge on the microbial composition of the 5 best-characterized body sites (gut, skin, oral, airways, and vagina), focusing on interpersonal and intrapersonal variations and our current understanding of the sources of this variation.

### Mechanisms of oral tolerance [^116JnWnS]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Oral tolerance is an active process of local and systemic immune unresponsiveness to orally ingested antigens such as food. The gut immune system must balance responses to commensal bacteria (microbiome), innocuous antigens, and pathogens. Although it is clear that specialized populations of immune cells and lymph nodes create a unique environment in the gut, there remains evidence to suggest that systemic effector sites also are critical to establishing and maintaining oral tolerance.

### Dynamics and associations of microbial community types across the human body [^112SCcdH]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

A primary goal of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) was to provide a reference collection of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences collected from sites across the human body that would allow microbiologists to better associate changes in the microbiome with changes in health. The HMP Consortium has reported the structure and function of the human microbiome in 300 healthy adults at 18 body sites from a single time point. Using additional data collected over the course of 12–18months, we used Dirichlet multinomial mixture models to partition the data into community types for each body site and made three important observations. First, there were strong associations between whether individuals had been breastfed as an infant, their gender, and their level of education with their community types at several body sites. Second, although the specific taxonomic compositions of the oral and gut microbiomes were different, the community types observed at these sites were predictive of each other. Finally, over the course of the sampling period, the community types from sites within the oral cavity were the least stable, whereas those in the vagina and gut were the most stable. Our results demonstrate that even with the considerable intra- and interpersonal variation in the human microbiome, this variation can be partitioned into community types that are predictive of each other and are probably the result of life-history characteristics. Understanding the diversity of community types and the mechanisms that result in an individual having a particular type or changing types, will allow us to use their community types to assess disease risk and to personalize therapies.

### Chlorhexidine gluconate [^114b7gRd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse provides antimicrobial activity during oral rinsing. The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse's antimicrobial activities is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54–97% through six months use.

Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six month clinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline.

Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetic studies with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse indicate approximately 30% of the active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is retained in the oral cavity following rinsing. This retained drug is slowly released into the oral fluids. Studies conducted on human subjects and animals demonstrate chlorhexidine gluconate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean plasma level of chlorhexidine gluconate reached a peak of 0. 206 mcg/g in humans 30 minutes after they ingested a 300-mg dose of the drug. Detectable levels of chlorhexidine gluconate were not present in the plasma of these subjects 12 hours after the compound was administered. Excretion of chlorhexidine gluconate occurred primarily through the feces (~90%). Less than 1% of the chlorhexidine gluconate ingested by these subjects was excreted in the urine.

We defined a core pathway to be strongly enriched in a particular body site if the first quartile of the abundance of the pathway at that site was > 2× larger than the third quartile of abundance at sites from all other body areas (that is, the focal and background abundance distributions must be very well separated, as opposed to just significantly different). Notably, this definition only requires core pathways at oral body sites to separate well from non-oral sites, and not other oral sites (very few core pathways at oral body sites were strongly enriched relative to other oral sites).

We investigated the relationship between coreness and essentiality of functions using a dataset of around 300 essential COGgene families determined in E. coli (the 'Keio collection'). We computed COG abundance across the 1,087 metagenomes introduced above by summing the abundance of individual UniRef gene families (as computed by HUMAnN2) according to UniProt-derived COG annotations. We considered a COG to be confidently detected in a sample if its relative abundance exceeded 10⁻⁴. Among detected COGs, essential COGs (n = 272) were both more globally prevalent than non-essential COGs (n = 3,629; median 0.94 versus 0.24) and core to more body sites (mean 4.7 versus 1.2; core defined here as > 75% prevalent within-site); both trends were highly statistically significant (P < 0.001) by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and robust to a smaller detection threshold (10⁻⁶).

### A spatial gradient of bacterial diversity in the human oral cavity shaped by salivary flow [^113gnSWx]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Here, we identified a gradient in community composition that encompasses the entire spatial extent of the oral cavity. Communities inhabiting very distinct habitats conformed to this gradient, which appeared to be modified in individuals with low saliva production. Our work suggests that characterizing the type and extent of spatial patterns in the human microbiota enables mechanistic studies of the processes that generate, maintain, and disrupt those patterns, and their relationship to health and disease.

### Microbiota restoration: natural and supplemented recovery of human microbial communities [^115UaNq8]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2011). Medium credibility.

In a healthy host, a balance exists between members of the microbiota, such that potential pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms can be found in apparent harmony. During infection, this balance can become disturbed, leading to often dramatic changes in the composition of the microbiota. For most bacterial infections, nonspecific antibiotics are used, killing the non-pathogenic members of the microbiota as well as the pathogens and leading to a substantial delay in the restoration of a healthy microbiota. However, in some cases, infections can self-resolve without the intervention of antibiotics. In this Review, we explore the mechanisms underlying microbiota restoration following insult (antibiotic or otherwise) to the skin, oral cavity, and gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, highlighting recovery by natural processes and after probiotic administration.

### Defining the biogeographical map and potential bacterial translocation of microbiome in human' surface organs' [^114WQfnU]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Surface organs (organs with direct or indirect contact with the ambient air), including the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract (GI), and skin, are the largest organs in human body with widespread involvement in physiological, metabolic, and immunological processes. Surface organs are inhabited by trillions of microbes and harbored diverse microbial communities. The location and functional features of each surface organ create specific environmental conditions that gives rise to regional specificity in microbial populations. To date, emerging studies focusing on regional differences have unveiled numerous physiological roles of the microbiome that are crucial for human life. Whereas few has reported the heterogeneity in microbiome among different body parts. Such inter-organ microbial disparity also contributes to variation and plasticity in the functional traits of gut microbiome. However, only a few investigations deciphered the microbiome along the digestive organs with limited sampling sites from the same individual. To fully uncover the human microbiome, it is necessary to assess microbiome composition in surface organs of digestive system (lumen and mucosa) and skin with much denser sampling as a whole.

Microbiome in different regions/or sites of an organ could be varied, exemplified by the difference in microbiome between proximal and distal colon. We recently reported the presence of microbial heterogeneity in a single colorectal tumor. Understanding whether there are discernible patterns of microbial communities along the GI tract and elucidating regional microbial niches, are of great importance for complete mapping of the human microbiome. However, it has been challenging to collect samples from multiple sites within an organ, especially in the small intestine. Moreover, it remains undetermined whether microbiome in lumen samples is similar or different from microbiome in mucosa samples of the whole GI tract.

The microbial crosstalk among organs is emerging as an essential indicator of human health. Yet, little is known about the routine inter-organ contacts of the microbiome. For instance, how the oral microbial community correlates with microbiome in other organs is completely unknown. Sampling a breath of intra-individual surface regions therefore offer an opportunity to decipher how microbial residents might translocate from one site/organ to another, respond to changing environments, and shape host physiology.

### The oral microbiota: dynamic communities and host interactions [^114U4AUQ]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The dynamic and polymicrobial oral microbiome is a direct precursor of diseases such as dental caries and periodontitis, two of the most prevalent microbially induced disorders worldwide. Distinct microenvironments at oral barriers harbour unique microbial communities, which are regulated through sophisticated signalling systems and by host and environmental factors. The collective function of microbial communities is a major driver of homeostasis or dysbiosis and ultimately health or disease. Despite different aetiologies, periodontitis and caries are each driven by a feedforward loop between the microbiota and host factors (inflammation and dietary sugars, respectively) that favours the emergence and persistence of dysbiosis. In this Review, we discuss current knowledge and emerging mechanisms governing oral polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis that have both enhanced our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and aided the design of innovative therapeutic approaches for oral diseases.

### Spatial and temporal variability of the human microbiota [^112jxNvq]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

The knowledge that our bodies are home to microbes is not new; van Leeuwenhoek first saw the microbes of the mouth and gut over three centuries ago. However, next generation sequencing technologies are enabling us to characterize our microbial consortia on an unprecedented scale, and are providing new insights into the range of variability of our microbiota and their contributions to our health. The microbiota far outnumber the human component of our selves, with 10 times more cells and at least 100 times more genes. Moreover, while individuals share over 99.9% of their human genome sequence, there are vast differences in the microbiome (the collection of genes of our associated microbes). This raises the question of the extent to which our microbial community determines our human physiological responses and susceptibility to disease. In order to develop technologies that allow us to manipulate the microbiome to improve health we must first understand the factors that influence spatial and temporal variation, stability in response to perturbation, and conditions that induce community-wide changes.

Factors influencing mucositis development

Oral environment and microbiota are considered of crucial importance in the development of mucositis.

The oral cavity is one of the most complex environments in the human body. Saliva, constantly produced by salivary glands, contains bacteria, fungi and viruses, and moistens every part of the oral mucosa. A dysbiotic milieu may alter the metabolism of the host and determine increased inflammation.

Studies in literature based on animal models demonstrated that a peak in bacterial loads coincided with a peak in mucositis severity. Moreover, other studies showed that higher concentrations in Gram-negative bacteria were observed during ulceration phases, and spontaneous ulcer resolution happened after a reestablishment of normal bacterial proportions.

Recently, a different way of looking at microbiota is emerging, showing that there is a complex interaction between the host and diverse bacterial species.

In this reality, treatment-related dynamic changes are important both in oral and intestinal mucositis.

Studies conducted in the last years focused on different topics: oral flora changes in chemotherapy regimens and its relationship with oral mucositis; microbiota impacts on healing process; and functional changes in bacteria when exposed to radiation and their impact on mucositis. In this field, rapid advances have also been achieved in the area of intestinal mucositis. A handful of papers have been published also for oral and oropharyngeal mucositis. The dynamic variation in oral microbiota during RT and its association with oropharyngeal mucositis progression/aggravation were prospectively evaluated in a cohort of nasopharyngeal cancer patients. Several bacteria, including Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Treponema and Porphyromonas, not only showed obvious dynamic synchronous shifts in their abundances throughout RT, but their peaks often coincided with the onset of severe mucositis. Similar results were reported by Zhu et al. Two studies only investigated on oral microbiota treatment-related changes and identified species potentially involved in mucositis pathogenesis.

### Infections as ecosystems: community metabolic interactions in microbial pathogenesis [^11697Ejq]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbes rarely exist alone; instead, they live in dynamic multi-species communities with a range of metabolic capacities. To establish within a polymicrobial community, an organism must compete with the other members of the community for space and nutrients. In addition, microbes form complex metabolic interdependencies in polymicrobial environments, and these nutrient exchanges are central to overall community function. Interactions between microbial community members dictate key processes, including nutrient cycling, tolerance to disturbances, and disease progression, and these interactions are known to depend on the environment in which they are measured. Therefore, understanding these ecological interactions is fundamental to our understanding of community composition, function, and impacts on disease. In this mini-review, we will describe the mechanisms microbes use to exchange nutrients in host-associated environments, with a focus on the oral and respiratory tracts. We will particularly emphasize the environmental factors that influence community composition and how interactions between organisms, ranging from cooperation to competition, impact nutrient bioavailability and overall community function during infection.

### Role of the microbiome in human development [^111tGwWk]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

What is a healthy microbiome?

Individuals differ enormously in the taxonomic content of their microbiota, and even the same person over time can appear dramatically different from their own prior representation. Functional redundancy makes the characterisation of the healthy microbiome extremely complex, because different taxonomic profiles can lead to ecosystems with similar behaviour. It is also unclear whether 'normal' in a human population implies healthy, because the health optimum might be context-dependent both at a population and at an individual level — is the average microbiome of lean 20-year-olds, half of whom will become chronically ill 70-year-olds, really healthy? Studies of healthy children in 10 locales in Asia showed substantial variation in the composition of the gut microbiota, yet there was a clear North-South pattern in terms of predominant taxa, likely related to different levels of socioeconomic modernisation and market integration. Thus, we do not yet know what are the key features of healthy microbiomes, beyond the descriptive composition that characterises body sites: Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Veillonella, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas or Treponema species in the oral cavity, with shared lifestyle, environment and genetic factors playing a role; Acinetobacter and Aeribacillus in the ocular surface, Pseudomonas on the lid margin and conjunctiva; Actinobacteria (Corynebacteriaceae and Propionibacteriaceae and Firmicutes — mostly Staphylococcaceae, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in the skin, lipophilic organisms such as Propionibacterium spp. and the fungus Malassezia spp. in areas of higher density of sebaceous glands (face or back), Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, including Bacteroides, Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, the Verrucomicrobia Akkermansia and the archaeal Methanobrevibacter smithii in the mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract, and Lactobacillus spp. in the women's genital tract. The ubiquity of the 'core' dominant metabolismscontrasts with the variability of niche-specific low abundant functions, many of which remain uncharacterised. A possible approach to the complexity of the human microbiome variability and disease risks is to obtain longitudinal data from multiple cohorts in global studies from which subjects developing any diseases throughout their lifespan are excluded, and only the healthy subjects (lacking a disease phenotype) are considered. In ecosystems like the gut, the extent of diversity is one proxy for health. Immigrants from developing countries lose diversity across human generations, as they develop westernised lifestyles and diseases.
