## Question

HCV with HIV

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing hepatitis C virus (HCV) in people with HIV coinfection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about epidemiology and why coinfection matters clinically. Then, I should verify the natural history and disease acceleration in HIV. Next, I will review screening and diagnostic algorithms, including nuances in immunosuppression. After that, I need to assess fibrosis staging and treatment candidacy. Then, I will examine drug–drug interactions and select an appropriate DAA regimen, including when a simplified approach is suitable. I should confirm monitoring plans, SVR confirmation, and reinfection prevention. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize a practical, guideline-concordant algorithm with key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and clinical significance. Approximately one-third of people with HIV are coinfected with HCV in the United States and Europe, largely due to shared blood-borne transmission routes, and liver disease has become a leading cause of non-AIDS morbidity and mortality in the ART era, which underscores the urgency of addressing HCV in this population [^115pUbXw] [^112jjAzW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about disease course without verifying acceleration. HIV coinfection accelerates HCV fibrosis progression roughly threefold compared with HCV monoinfection, with faster progression at lower CD4 counts, and ART slows but does not normalize this risk, so I need to ensure timely HCV therapy rather than relying on HIV control alone to mitigate liver disease [^1111xe7k] [^116bgNYr].

> Next, I should review screening and diagnosis. All persons with HIV should be screened for HCV at baseline and at least annually if ongoing risk, with reflex HCV RNA testing when antibody is positive; in advanced immunosuppression (CD4 < 200), false-negative antibodies can occur, so I should consider direct RNA testing if suspicion is high, and in suspected acute infection within 6 months, RNA testing is preferred because seroconversion may be delayed [^115qFXoz] [^116tb1Pm] [^114jXRQq].

> Wait, let me verify the pre-treatment evaluation steps. I need to confirm active viremia with HCV RNA, determine genotype (though pangenotypic regimens reduce the urgency), stage liver disease to guide regimen and duration, screen for HBV because of reactivation risk during DAA therapy, and review the ART regimen for drug–drug interactions; noninvasive fibrosis assessment with transient elastography or serum biomarkers is appropriate, and I should avoid interrupting ART to accommodate HCV therapy whenever possible [^1138AizG] [^1112Bw2z] [^114zzG98].

> I will now examine fibrosis staging and treatment candidacy. Let me think about thresholds: patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis are generally eligible for standard or even simplified DAA regimens, whereas decompensated cirrhosis typically requires specialist referral and modified DAA strategies; importantly, HCV treatment should not be withheld solely due to perceived poor ART adherence or untreated HIV, so I should prioritize linkage to HIV care rather than deferring HCV cure [^116hhPkA] [^117JGGDg].

> Now, I need to check drug–drug interactions carefully because they are the primary constraint in coinfection. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir should not be coadministered with efavirenz, etravirine, or nevirapine; elbasvir/grazoprevir should not be used with cobicistat, efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, or boosted HIV protease inhibitors; and voxilaprevir with darunavir/ritonavir or elvitegravir/cobicistat warrants enhanced hepatotoxicity monitoring; when conflicts arise, I should switch the ART component to a compatible agent rather than compromising HCV cure rates [^113oaXw5] [^115ArTHZ] [^117Tptor] [^116HLJpC].

> Let me consider regimen selection next. For most treatment-naive patients with HIV coinfection and without cirrhosis, a pangenotypic, ribavirin-free regimen such as glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8–12 weeks or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks is appropriate, with high real-world SVR12 rates exceeding 90–95%; in compensated cirrhosis, extending to 12 weeks is reasonable, and in decompensated cirrhosis, I should coordinate with hepatology for 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir plus ribavirin or alternative strategies per current guidance [^115VnFum] [^1117m5RB] [^111cwn4m].

> But wait, what if the patient qualifies for a simplified approach. The 2023 AASLD/IDSA update supports a minimal monitoring pathway for treatment-naive people with HIV without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, using fixed-duration pangenotypic therapy without routine on-treatment labs, with SVR12 confirmation at 12 weeks; exclusions include prior HCV treatment, decompensated cirrhosis, certain ART incompatibilities, untreated HBV, and pregnancy, so I should double-check these before choosing the simplified path [^116hhPkA] [^116d3grq] [^112kzgaY].

> I should confirm monitoring and follow-up. For simplified therapy, routine on-treatment labs are not required, though some payers request a week-4 RNA; regardless, I need to document SVR12 with undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after completion, and if SVR is achieved in a patient without cirrhosis, ongoing liver disease monitoring can stop; in those with cirrhosis, I should continue HCC surveillance with ultrasound every 6 months indefinitely and counsel on reinfection risk with periodic RNA testing at least annually if ongoing risk behaviors persist [^113xXbrV] [^115PeC69].

> Hold on, I should verify reinfection prevention and linkage to care. After cure, annual HCV RNA testing is advised for people with ongoing risk, with more frequent testing tailored to risk, and I should integrate harm reduction services, syringe programs, and addiction treatment to reduce reinfection; notably, achieving SVR reduces but does not eliminate HCC risk in those with cirrhosis, reinforcing the need for continued surveillance and risk modification counseling [^113xXbrV] [^116tb1Pm].

> Let me consider special populations and edge cases. In pregnancy, I should defer HCV therapy until after delivery and ensure perinatal screening protocols are in place; in children and adolescents, I should follow AASLD/IDSA pediatric guidance and coordinate with pediatric HIV care; in people who inject drugs, I should not withhold therapy due to ongoing use, as treatment is effective and reduces transmission; and in decompensated cirrhosis or transplant candidates, early hepatology referral and coordination with transplant centers are essential [^115EWAz8] [^115C782a] [^112LeP1U].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought HIV coinfection might blunt DAA efficacy, but I should double-check that assumption. Contemporary data show SVR12 rates in coinfection are comparable to monoinfection when drug–drug interactions are managed, so my earlier concern was misplaced; the key is selecting compatible ART and following guideline-endorsed regimens rather than assuming inferior outcomes [^1117m5RB].

> To synthesize a practical algorithm, I need to ensure each step aligns with guidelines. Screen all people with HIV for HCV at baseline and annually, confirm active infection with RNA, stage fibrosis, screen for HBV and manage reactivation risk, review ART for interactions and switch if needed, select a pangenotypic DAA regimen with attention to cirrhosis status, consider the simplified pathway when eligible, confirm SVR12, and implement reinfection prevention and HCC surveillance where indicated; critically, do not defer HCV cure for HIV-related reasons when treatment is indicated [^115qFXoz] [^111cwn4m] [^116hhPkA] [^117JGGDg].

> Key takeaway, and I should confirm this is explicit: treat HCV promptly in people with HIV using pangenotypic DAAs, manage ART interactions proactively, and leverage simplified pathways to expand access; with these steps, SVR exceeds 90–95% and is comparable to monoinfection, transforming coinfection from a historically "difficult-to-treat" condition into a routinely curable comorbidity [^115VnFum] [^1117m5RB] [^116d3grq].

---

HIV/HCV coinfection is common and accelerates liver disease progression, increasing risks of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality [^1111xe7k] [^116bgNYr]. Modern **direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)** achieve > 95% sustained virologic response (SVR) in coinfected patients, with regimens and durations matching those for HCV monoinfection [^116ZEHRF] [^111cwn4m]. Treatment should not be delayed due to HIV status; **ART can be adjusted** to avoid drug–drug interactions, and simplified DAA strategies are available for eligible patients [^116hhPkA] [^117JGGDg]. All patients with HIV should be screened for HCV at baseline and annually, with confirmatory RNA testing and fibrosis staging to guide therapy and monitoring [^115qFXoz] [^1138AizG]. Post-SVR, monitor for reinfection and hepatocellular carcinoma, and manage HBV coinfection to prevent reactivation during HCV therapy [^113xXbrV] [^115dKp1r].

---

## Epidemiology and transmission

- **Prevalence**: Approximately 30% of HIV-infected individuals are coinfected with HCV globally, with higher rates among people who inject drugs (PWID) and men who have sex with men (MSM) [^111Sityw] [^115C782a].

- **Transmission**: Shared routes include injection drug use, blood transfusions, and sexual contact (particularly among MSM with high-risk sexual practices) [^115mb9Kx].

---

## Pathogenesis and clinical implications

- **Accelerated liver disease**: HIV coinfection accelerates HCV-related liver disease progression, increasing risks of fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [^1111xe7k] [^116bgNYr].

- **Immune impairment**: HIV-induced immunosuppression exacerbates HCV replication and persistence, complicating disease management [^112jjAzW].

- **Increased mortality**: Liver-related mortality is significantly higher in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals compared to those with HCV monoinfection [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

- **Screening**: All HIV-infected individuals should be screened for HCV at baseline and annually thereafter [^notfound].

- **Confirmatory testing**: HCV RNA testing is essential to confirm active infection, particularly in acute infection or advanced immunosuppression [^114jXRQq].

- **Fibrosis assessment**: Non-invasive fibrosis assessment (e.g. transient elastography) is recommended to guide treatment decisions and monitoring [^1138AizG].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Historical treatment

Historically, **interferon-based therapy** with pegylated interferon and ribavirin achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 27–40% in coinfected patients, with significant side effects and limited tolerability [^116bZHjA] [^115tut9u].

---

### Current treatment: direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)

- **High efficacy**: DAAs have revolutionized HCV treatment, achieving SVR rates > 95% in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, comparable to HCV monoinfection [^116ZEHRF] [^1117m5RB].

- **Recommended regimens**: Preferred DAA regimens include glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, with treatment durations typically 8–12 weeks [^notfound].

- **Simplified treatment**: Minimal monitoring strategies have been validated, reducing treatment barriers and improving access [^116d3grq] [^116hhPkA].

---

## Drug-drug interactions and management

Drug–drug interactions require **careful management**; certain antiretroviral regimens (e.g. efavirenz, boosted protease inhibitors) may interact with DAAs, necessitating ART adjustments or alternative DAA selection [^116HLJpC] [^113oaXw5]. For **individualized care**, ART regimens should be selected or adjusted to minimize interactions and optimize outcomes [^111bvwoE] [^111vQCJX].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Curing HCV with DAAs improves liver function, reduces liver-related complications, and enhances quality of life. HCV cure also **reduces mortality**, including liver-related and all-cause mortality, in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients [^116ZEHRF] [^1117m5RB].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Post-treatment, **SVR confirmation** with HCV RNA testing 12 weeks after therapy completion is recommended [^113xXbrV]. Reinfection monitoring should include periodic HCV RNA testing for patients with ongoing risk behaviors [^113xXbrV]. In patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, continued hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance is advised [^115PeC69].

---

## Special considerations

- **HBV coinfection**: HBV reactivation can occur during HCV treatment; HBV-active ART is recommended for patients with HBV coinfection [^115dKp1r] [^116Zqztz].

- **Pregnancy**: DAA therapy is generally avoided during pregnancy; treatment should be deferred until postpartum [^notfound].

- **Pediatric populations**: DAA therapy is approved for children aged ≥ 3 years, with pediatric-specific dosing and monitoring guidelines [^115JzTXv] [^115EWAz8].

---

HIV/HCV coinfection is a major public health concern, but **DAAs have transformed management**, enabling high cure rates and improved clinical outcomes. Treatment should be individualized, with attention to drug interactions, comorbidities, and patient-specific factors.

### Management of hepatitis C / HIV coinfection in the era of highly effective hepatitis C virus direct-acting antiviral therapy [^113uEhSo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The increased life expectancy of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in renewed attention to non-HIV-related diseases exacerbated by HIV infection. Coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a particular area of concern, as the global prevalence has been estimated at 2.5–5 million people. In this article, we discuss the epidemiology of HCV infection and reinfection, HCV-related liver disease progression in the era of effective ART, and the efficacy of emerging HCV treatment strategies in persons with HIV/HCV coinfection. New data regarding treatment of persons with HIV/HCV coinfection suggest that HCV treatment should be a priority in those with HIV. Results from recent studies using all-oral HCV regimens have shown high rates of sustained virologic response in both clinical trials and real-world settings. A multidisciplinary approach to HCV treatment in those with HIV is recommended for optimal patient management. Following HCV cure, practitioners also need to be mindful of the risks for HCV reinfection and educate patients on protective measures.

### Treatment algorithm for the management of hepatitis C in HIV-coinfected persons [^113mesSv]. Journal of Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

In the era of highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HCV-related liver disease has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Accordingly, expert panels have recommend that coinfected patients undergo medical evaluation for HCV-related liver disease, consideration for HCV treatment and, if indicated, orthotopic liver transplantation. While the treatment of such patients is complicated by medical, and psychiatric comorbidities, HIV disease, and concurrent antiretroviral therapy, randomized controlled trials support the safety, tolerability and efficacy of HCV treatment with peginterferon alfa (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) in HIV-infected persons. Although, the available data has led to consensus among experts regarding the need to medically manage HCV disease in HIV-infected persons, uncertainty remains regarding the best treatment algorithm for coinfected patients.

### Treatment of the hepatitis C virus in patients coinfected with HIV [^115Wc4cW]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection is common among individuals with HIV, and the progression of liver disease is accelerated in coinfected individuals compared with those with HCV alone. HCV coinfection also can decrease tolerability of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Additionally, the presence of HCV appears to increase morbidity and mortality in these individuals, and as such the management of both HCV and HIV in coinfected individuals requires careful consideration. Although coinfected patients should be considered for HCV therapy, the limited information to date indicates a lower rate of virologic response with current HCV therapies. Moreover, interactions between HCV and HIV antiviral medications may occur and potentially affect treatment efficacy. Thus, the decision to undertake HCV treatment must be individualized.

Objective

To review the current management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in persons coinfected with HIV.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-February 2006) was conducted, using key words such as HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C, interferon, pegylated interferon, and therapy. Article bibliographies and conference abstracts were also reviewed to identify relevant studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies that examined HCV treatment in individuals coinfected with HIV and articles that focused on HCV/HIV coinfection were considered for this review.

Data Synthesis

Coinfection with HIV leads to a more rapid and severe course of HCV-related liver disease. Treatment of HCV with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin therapy is relatively well tolerated in individuals coinfected with HIV, with overall sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 27–40%. High relapse rates and poor response in HCV-genotype 1 contribute to the lower SVR in coinfected individuals compared with HCV monoinfection. Treatment of HCV is more complicated in HIV-infected persons due to increased risk of myelosuppression, drug interactions, hepatotoxicity of antiretroviral therapy, and the relative contraindication to interferon therapy in advanced HIV disease. Current guidelines recommend that all HIV-positive patients with chronic HCV infection be considered as treatment candidates for anti-HCV therapy due to the higher risk of liver disease progression. Further studies are needed, however, to define the appropriate dose and duration of therapy in HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals.

Conclusions

Response to treatment with PEG-IFN and ribavirin is poorer in patients coinfected with HCV/HIV than in those infected with HCV alone. The benefits of anti-HCV therapy, including viral eradication, need to be weighed against the risks of adverse effects and drug-drug interactions between anti-HCV and antiretroviral medications.

### Therapeutic issues in HIV / HCV-coinfected patients [^113MnX7s]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2007). Low credibility.

The importance of treating hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated morbidities in a growing population of patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy. As a result, investigative attention is turning to HCV-related liver disease and treatment-associated issues in coinfection. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients have higher HCV RNA loads and show more rapid progression of fibrosis than do monoinfected patients. Combination therapy with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (RBV) is the standard of care for HCV in coinfected patients. Therapy slows fibrosis progression, but toxicity prevents identification of the most effective RBV dose. Coinfected patients have about a threefold greater risk of antiretroviral therapy-associated hepatotoxicity than patients with HIV only. Other challenges include anaemia, mitochondrial toxicity, drug-drug interactions and leucopenia. Thus, chronic hepatitis C should be treated in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, but steps must be taken to prevent and treat potential toxicities. The first European Consensus Conference on the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B and C in HIV Co-infected Patients was held March 2005 in Paris to address these issues. This article reviews the peer-reviewed literature and expert opinion published from 1990 to 2005, and compares results with presentations and recommendations from the Consensus Conference to best present current issues in coinfection.

### Hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus coinfections [^111Sityw]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is estimated that 30% to 50% of patients with HIV are coinfected with HCV. Advances in antiretroviral therapy and improved life expectancy of HIV patients have resulted in an emergence of HCV-induced liver disease as a leading cause of significant morbidity and death in this population. Clinically, hepatitis C is a more severe disease in HIV-infected individuals, characterized by rapid progression toward end-stage liver disease. Highly active antiretroviral therapy is the mainstay of current acquired immunodeficiency syndrome management. One of the limiting side effects of combination therapy for HIV is hepatotoxicity, which is more common and often more serious in patients with underlying liver disease. Management of coinfected patients has no strict guidelines, but it is generally accepted that HIV infection needs to be treated before HCV. Hepatitis C in coinfected individuals is probably best treated using combination therapy (interferon alpha and ribavirin). It appears that combination therapy can safely be administered to this population and that previous concerns about ribavirin/zidovudine antagonism are unsubstantiated in clinical practice. Although initial results using only interferon alpha showed poor results in HIV coinfected patients, combination therapy seems to be as effective as in the general population. All HIV-HCV coinfected patients should be vaccinated against hepatitis B and hepatitis A; vaccines are safe and effective.

### Treatment of hepatitis C: a systematic review [^112tUdoV]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects more than 185 million individuals worldwide. Twenty percent of patients chronically infected with HCV progress to cirrhosis. New, simpler therapeutics using direct-acting antivirals that target various stages of the HCV life cycle are in development to eradicate HCV without concomitant interferon.

Objectives

To summarize published evidence on safety, efficacy (measured by a sustained virologic response [SVR], which is the treatment goal of undetectable plasma HCV RNA 12 or 24 weeks after therapy completion), and tolerability of current US Food and Drug Administration-approved interferon-based regimens and oral interferon-free regimens used for treating HCV infection and coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV; to provide treatment recommendations for specialists and generalists based on published evidence.

Evidence Review

A literature search of Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Agricola, Cochrane Library, Cinahl Plus, ClinicalTrials.gov, Conference Papers Index, Gideon, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Oaister was conducted from January 1, 2009, to May 30, 2014. Publications describing phase 2, 3, and 4 studies evaluating the treatment of HCV were included. Forty-one studies involving 19,063 adult patients were included. Strength of clinical data and subsequent HCV treatment recommendations were graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

Findings

Patients infected with HCV genotype 1 represent 60% to 75% of HCV infections in the United States. Hepatitis C virus genotype 1 is more difficult to cure than genotype 2 or genotype 3. Patients with HCV genotype 1 should receive treatment with sofosbuvir+pegylated interferon+ribavirin because of the shorter duration of therapy and high rates of SVR (89%-90%). Simeprevir+pegylated interferon+ribavirin is an alternative for patients with HCV genotype 1 (SVR, 79%-86%). Patients with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, representing 20% to 29% of US HCV infections, should receive therapy with sofosbuvir+ribavirin alone (SVR for genotype 2, 12 weeks' duration: 82%-93%; SVR for genotype 3, 24 weeks' duration, 80%-95%). Patients with HIV-HCV coinfection and patients with compensated cirrhosis (ie, cirrhosis but preserved synthetic liver function) should receive the same treatment as HCV-monoinfected patients.

Conclusions and Relevance

New, short-duration, simpler therapies result in high SVR rates for HCV-infected patients. In conjunction with increased screening for HCV as suggested by recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, availability of new therapies may lead to the treatment of many more people with chronic HCV infection.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis C virus infection, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV co-infection, AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines recommend to treat and re-treat patients with human immunodeficiency and HCV coinfection the same as patients without HIV infection after recognizing and managing interactions with antiretroviral medications.

### Consensus conference on chronic viral hepatitis And HIV infection: updated Spanish recommendations [^115eTkDK]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B and C represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients worldwide. New treatment options against both hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses have prompted us to update previous recommendations for the management of coinfected individuals. Fifteen topics (nine related to HCV, five to HBV and one to both viruses) were selected for this purpose. A panel of Spanish experts in the field was invited to review these areas and propose specific recommendations, which were scored according to the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) grading system. These guidelines represent a comprehensive and updated overview on the management of hepatitis B and C in HIV-infected patients.

### Treatment of hepatitis C in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus in the direct-acting antiviral era [^116CbXM6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C is a leading cause of clinical complications and mortality in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Approval for the first direct-acting antiviral (DAA) against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been eagerly awaited for treating patients coinfected with HIV/HCV. The use of first-generation HCV protease inhibitors is challenged by complicated dosing schedules, frequent serious toxicities, unwanted drug interactions, drug resistance, and high cost. First-generation DAAs will eventually be replaced by more potent, well-tolerated, and convenient agents. HIV/HCV co-infection will become restricted to individuals without proper access to health care.

### HIV and hepatitis C virus co-infection [^115pUbXw]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

Since the decline in HIV-related morbidity and mortality after introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996, liver disease caused by chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients infected parenterally with HCV in more developed countries. A third of HIV-infected individuals in Europe and the United States have HCV co-infection. HIV accelerates HCV liver disease especially when HIV-associated immunodeficiency progresses. With the introduction of pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, greatly improved treatment options for patients with HIV and HCV co-infection have become available and have led to sustained virological response rates of up to 40%. Furthermore, recent cohort analyses have shown that immune reconstitution induced by HAART can improve the course of hepatitis C leading to a decline in liver-related mortality. However, patients with HCV co-infection are at increased risk of hepatotoxicity from HAART. Owing to the high rates of HIV and HCV co-infection worldwide, new improved treatment strategies and guidelines for the management of co-infection remain a major future goal.

### Therapeutic management of hepatitis And HIV infection in co-infected patients: results of a survey performed before the 2005 consensus conference [^111K6FHV]. Journal of Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The First European Consensus Conference on the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B and C in HIV Co-infected Patients aimed to produce recommendations that could be applied across Europe. However, some important differences exist around Europe, in terms of access to treatment and tests for monitoring. This short survey of 24 European countries showed that access to anti-HCV treatment is low (approximately 10%) in patients with HCV/HIV co-infection — generally access is higher in Western Europe than in Eastern or Northern Europe. This low use of anti-HCV therapy is not a result of poor availability (of drugs or virological tests), which are available in all countries surveyed. Recently published trials in co-infected patients and the outcome from this Consensus Conference will hopefully lead to wider access to anti-HCV therapy and better management of co-infected patients across Europe.

### Hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus infection [^112jjAzW]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

In the United States, an estimated 200,000 persons are infected with both hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As the lives of HIV-infected persons have been prolonged by use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, liver disease has emerged as an important, and in some settings, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Human immunodeficiency virus infection appears to adversely affect all stages of hepatitis C infection, leading to increased viral persistence and accelerated progression of HCV-related liver disease. In turn, hepatitis C may affect the management of HIV infection, increasing the incidence of liver toxicity caused by antiretroviral medications. The medical management of hepatitis C in HIV-infected persons remains controversial, in part because of the complexity of both infections and potential drug interactions, but chiefly because there is so little published information. Nonetheless, the burden of liver disease is too high to delay management of HIV/HCV-coinfected persons while awaiting better data. Instead, the management of hepatitis C today must be based on data generated on persons without HIV and an understanding of both infections. Properly designed studies of therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected persons are needed to help guide management of these patients in the future.

Simplified HCV treatment eligibility — based on the minimal monitoring study findings, treatment-naive persons with HIV/HCV coinfection are newly eligible for a simplified HCV treatment approach, and this inclusion is consistent with the DHHS Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117JGGDg]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease — practice notes include that a simplified approach to HCV treatment can be used in treatment-naive patients with any genotype and without cirrhosis and includes standardized treatment with no on-treatment testing or in-person follow-up and limited follow-up to confirm SVR; characteristics that exclude patients from receiving simplified approach to therapy are outlined in Box 1 of the Hepatitis C Virus section. See the Hepatitis C Virus section to review a summary of drug-drug interactions between HCV therapy and ARV drugs. HCV treatment should not be withheld solely due to perceived lack of adherence to ART or untreated HIV (BIII). Effort should be made to document SVR (HCV RNA less than lower limits of quantification) at least 12 weeks after completion of therapy (AI), and patients without cirrhosis who achieve SVR do not require continued liver disease monitoring. Recommendations for treatment after DAA failure are not provided, with referral to the corresponding section in the AASLD/IDSA HCV treatment guidance.

### Hepatitis C in HIV-positive patients – treatment and liver disease outcomes [^115tut9u]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Many human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected persons are coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and with the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, liver disease from HCV has become an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The current guidelines recommend that human immunodeficiency virus and HCV coinfected patients be evaluated and treated for HCV if there are no major contraindications to treatment. Coinfected patients treated with pegylated interferon-a and ribavirin have sustained virologic responses (SVRs) of 27% to 40% which for a variety of reasons are lower than those reported in HCV mono-infected patients. Understanding that most patients will not achieve SVRs, strategies to evaluate for the role of maintenance interferon in delaying complications of liver disease are being evaluated. In patients who have failed prior treatment, cannot tolerate treatment, or who have contraindications to HCV treatment, the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy with careful monitoring for hepatotoxicity and aggressive counseling on alcohol and substance abuse may slow down fibrosis progression. As the data on liver transplantation in coinfected patients accumulate, patients with end stage liver disease should be referred early for evaluation in a transplant center. As new drugs for HCV are being developed, it will be of utmost importance to include coinfected patients earlier in the process on new drug trials and therapeutic strategies.

### Management of patients coinfected with HCV and HIV: a close look at the role for direct-acting antivirals [^112a8og3]. Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

With the development of effective therapies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with both infections (coinfection). In addition to the high prevalence of chronic HCV, particularly among HIV-infected injection drug users, the rate of incident HIV infections is increasing among HIV-infected men who have sex with men, leading to recommendations for education and screening for HCV in this population. Liver disease is the second leading and, in some cases, a preventable cause of death among coinfected patients. Those at risk for liver disease progression are usually treated with a combination of interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), which is not highly effective; it has low rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), especially for coinfected patients with HCV genotype 1 and those of African descent. Direct-acting antivirals might overcome factors such as immunodeficiency that can reduce the efficacy of IFN. However, for now it remains challenging to treat coinfected patients due to interactions among drugs, additive drug toxicities, and the continued need for combination therapies that include pegylated IFN. Recently developed HCV protease inhibitors such as telaprevir and boceprevir, given in combination with pegylated IFN and RBV, could increase the rate of SVR with manageable toxicity and drug interactions. We review the latest developments and obstacles to treating coinfected patients.

### Therapy insight: management of hepatitis C in patients coinfected with HIV [^114Jzf5H]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Infection with HCV is common in HIV-infected patients and is an increasingly important public health problem. The medical management of hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients is complicated by immune suppression, potential drug interactions and toxicities, and the relative paucity of health-care providers with expertise in the management of both diseases. Nonetheless, there are now data to support the safety, tolerability and efficacy of hepatitis C treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin in HIV-infected patients, and the impetus to treat these patients is, therefore, strong. Although the standard of care for the treatment of hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients has been more clearly defined, the delivery of care for hepatitis C remains inconsistent in many settings. The development and implementation of single-center multidisciplinary programs that combine the expertise of HIV specialists, hepatologists, gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, and addiction specialists, are needed to improve hepatitis C treatment outcomes in HIV-infected patients. This review considers the management of HCV infection in HIV-infected patients.

### Hepatitis C virus elimination in the human immunodeficiency virus-coinfected population: leveraging the existing human immunodeficiency virus infrastructure [^112E77Ry]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to consider how existing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infrastructure may be leveraged to inform and improve hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment efforts in the HIV-HCV coinfected population. Current gaps in HCV care relevant to the care continuum are reviewed. Successes in HIV treatment are then applied to the HCV treatment model for coinfected patients. Finally, the authors give examples of HCV treatment strategies for coinfected patients in both domestic and international settings.

Table 1
Summary of key drug-drug interactions between HIV drugs and the licensed DAAs and dosing recommendations

Taking into consideration all the complex issues surrounding anti-HCV treatment in this group of patients, particularly drug-drug interactions and side-effects, it is important that these patients are managed in centers with experience in managing HCV/HIV co-infected patients. Many physicians may want to start HCV/HIV co-infected patients on cART therapies that will have the least potential for drug-drug interactions, although it would be possible to switch cART during the period of DAA-based therapy. It is important to ensure that all co-medications, and not just cART components, that patients are on are documented and scrutinized for potential drug-drug interactions with the new DAAs. It is also imperative that as many patients as possible are included in the forthcoming clinical trials.

### Viral hepatitis And HIV coinfection [^115mb9Kx]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Persons at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are also likely to be at risk for other infectious pathogens, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). These are bloodborne pathogens transmitted through similar routes; for example, via injection drug use (IDU), sexual contact, or from mother to child during pregnancy or birth. In some settings, the prevalence of coinfection with HBV and/or HCV is high. In the context of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), liver disease has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected persons. Further, coinfection with viral hepatitis may complicate the delivery of ART by increasing the risk of drug-related hepatoxicity and impacting the selection of specific agents (e.g., those dually active against HIV and HBV). Expert guidelines developed in the United States and Europe recommend screening of all HIV-infected persons for infection with HCV and HBV and appropriate management of those found to be chronically infected. Treatment strategies for HBV infection include the use of nucleos(t)ide analogues with or without anti-HIV activity and/or peginterferon alfa (PegIFN) whereas HCV treatment is limited to the combination of PegIFN and ribavirin (RBV). Current approaches to management of HIV-infected persons coinfected with HBV or HCV are discussed in this review.

### Management of hepatitis C virus / HIV coinfection among people who use drugs in the era of direct-acting antiviral-based therapy [^115C782a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Where active antiretroviral therapy (ART) is accessible, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a survivable illness and effective ART can reduce HIV transmission. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a threat to the survival of individuals harboring both HCV and HIV, due to high prevalence and aggressive disease course. The HCV/HIV coinfection epidemic has been driven by people who inject drugs (PWID), although incident HCV is rising among HIV-infected men who have sex with men in the absence of drug injection. Coinfected individuals warrant aggressive treatment of both viruses; although early ART initiation is recommended to reduce the rate of liver disease progression, the most effective way to decrease HCV-related morbidity and mortality in coinfection is to achieve HCV viral eradication. Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents will soon revolutionize HCV treatment. Clinical data are needed regarding the efficacy of DAAs in coinfected PWID. Drug-drug interaction studies between ART, DAAs, and opiate substitution therapy must be expedited. Coinfected PWID should have equitable and universal access to HIV/AIDS, HCV, and addiction prevention, care, and treatment. Essential basic steps include improving screening for both infections and engaging coinfected PWID in HIV and HCV care early after diagnoses. Developing strategies to expand access to HCV therapy for coinfected PWID is imperative to stem the HCV epidemic and limit the morbidity and mortality of those at greatest risk for HCV disease progression. The ultimate goal must be the elimination of HCV from all coinfected PWID.

### Management and treatment of hepatitis C virus infection in HIV-infected adults: recommendations from the veterans affairs hepatitis C resource center program and national hepatitis C program office [^1134XaWM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Nearly 40% of human immunodeficiency virus- (HIV-) infected veterans on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the United States are coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). With the increased survival due to declining opportunistic infections as a result of HAART, HCV-associated liver disease has become a leading cause of death in HIV-infected individuals. HCV infection has been shown to lead to rapid progression of HCV-related liver disease in HIV infection. Results from recent clinical trials in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients show improved response rates using pegylated formulations of interferon plus ribavirin when compared to standard interferon plus ribavirin. However, the treatment of HCV in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients can be complicated by the hepatotoxic and myelosuppressive effects of HIV therapy and HIV infection itself. Prior to initiating HCV therapy, HIV therapy should be optimized by improving immune suppression and avoiding specific antiretroviral drugs that may cause hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression. In the event of treatment-related neutropenia or anemia during HCV therapy, the use of growth factors should be considered to maximize sustained virologic response to HCV therapy. In HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with end-stage liver disease, liver transplantation is being investigated and shows promise as a potential therapeutic option. With the recent advances in the treatment of HCV in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals, all HIV/HCV-coinfected patients eligible for HCV treatment should be evaluated for HCV combination therapy with careful consideration of their HIV disease.

### Options for treatment of hepatitis C in HIV-infected persons [^114YqT3H]. Journal of Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Irrespective of whether a patient has HIV infection, the optimal treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is peginterferon alpha and ribavirin. In both HIV-infected and uninfected persons, sustained virologic response (SVR) rates are higher for genotype 2 and genotype 3 HCV infection and for patients with lower pre-treatment HCV RNA levels. HIV-infection does not alter either the reality that persons who fail to achieve a 2log(10) reduction in HCV RNA level after 12 weeks of therapy rarely achieve a SVR, or the theoretical benefits of maintenance therapy in those without viral responses. The same adverse treatment effects can occur in HIV-infected and uninfected persons, but treatment of HIV-infected persons is complicated by interactions between ribavirin and antiretroviral medications and effects of HCV treatment on the course of HIV. The optimal treatment doses and durations are not known for HIV-infected persons, who are also less likely to achieve a SVR. A final difference is that the benefits of HCV treatment breakthroughs are usually realized in patients without HIV years before those with HIV. Future research must focus both on improving outcomes with currently available medications and rapidly evaluating the safety and efficacy of forthcoming antiviral compounds in HIV/HCV coinfected persons.

### Management of hepatitis C in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients [^116tmDWC]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2002). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus-related liver disease and its associated complications are steadily emerging health concerns in persons co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The increasing number of liver-related deaths in human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus co-infected individuals supports the compelling argument for more aggressive treatment in these patients. The safety and efficacy of interferon/ribavirin in human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus co-infected patients is currently under evaluation. Despite well-documented concern over highly active antiretroviral therapy-associated hepatotoxicity human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus co-infected patients should be offered antiretroviral therapy. Since management of co-infected patients is complex a multidisciplinary approach is needed in order to facilitate care and help patients to achieve a positive outcome.

### Hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus coinfection in the era of direct-acting antiviral agents: No longer a difficult-to-treat population [^1117m5RB]. Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV)-infected individuals has been historically marked by low sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in comparison to those without HIV infection, resulting in the Food and Drug Administration labeling those coinfected as a "special population with an unmet medical need". We systematically reviewed the treatment of chronic HCV infection in those infected with HIV. We propose that with the advent of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, patients coinfected with HCV and HIV have similar SVR rates as HCV-monoinfected persons and that DAAs address an unmet medical need in this population. A review was performed using Medical Subject Heading terms within the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases to search for studies dated between January 2004 and July 2017. Keywords used in the study included "hepatitis C", "HIV", "coinfection", and "direct-acting antiviral". SVR rates for those with HCV and HIV coinfection treated with interferon-based therapies were substantially lower that SVR rates of HCV-monoinfected individuals. The advent of DAA agents has resulted in similar SVR rates between monoinfected and coinfected individuals, with SVR > 93%. These medications have been demonstrated to have improved safety, efficacy, and tolerability in comparison to interferon-based regimens.

Conclusion

The designation of a "special population" for those with coinfection requires reconsideration; DAA therapies have resulted in similarly high rates of SVR for HCV infection in those with and without HIV infection; despite these improvements, however, clinicians must be cognizant of negative predictors of SVR and barriers to treatment that may be more common in the coinfected population. (Hepatology 2018;67:847–857).

### Hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients – therapeutic approach [^115sryvP]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has extended the lifespan of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As the prognosis of HIV infection has improved, liver disease associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become clinically significant in patients with HIV, liver failure being a frequent cause of death in this population. HIV infection may accelerate the course of liver disease in patients co-infected with HCV, so infection with HCV should be treated like any other opportunistic disease in these patients. Nowadays, combination therapy with interferon-alpha and ribavirin is the standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C in HIV-negative patients. Preliminary results of combination therapy in HIV/HCV co-infected patients have been promising, showing a sustained response rate in 40% of these patients. Patients with higher CD4 counts and lower HCV/HIV viral load and those infected with HCV genotype 3a have a better response to therapy. Potential drug interactions between HAART therapy and interferon and ribavirin treatment emphasize the importance of initiating treatment of HCV infection in HIV-positive individuals as soon as possible and ideally before the need for anti-HIV therapy. Recent case reports have suggested that liver transplantation might be an appropriate procedure in HIV patients with undetectable HIV viral load, high CD4 counts and HCV advanced liver disease. However, the limited amount of available information and the complexities of drug interactions between HAART therapy and immunosuppressive drugs oblige us to be prudent within considering such a procedure.

### Challenges in the treatment of patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus: need for team care [^114xPPjn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

We estimate that only one-third of patients coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are eligible for therapy for HCV with interferon (IFN) and ribavirin, and, of those who are eligible, two-thirds decline treatment. To date we have initiated treatment with IFN and ribavirin for 8% of coinfected patients evaluated, and < 1% of patients have had a sustained virological response. During this process, we have identified many problems that significantly limit our ability to initiate and complete treatment with IFN in this population and have categorized these difficulties into 4 main challenges. They include access to care, contraindications or barriers to treatment, patients' reluctance to start treatment with IFN, and the low tolerability of treatment. If patients coinfected with HCV and HIV are to be treated for hepatitis C in greater numbers, these issues will need to be addressed.

### Pharmacologic considerations in the treatment of hepatitis C virus in persons with HIV [^117SARfF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Roughly one-third of individuals living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are coinfected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) due to shared routes of transmission. HIV accelerates the progression of HCV disease; thus, coinfected individuals are at high priority for HCV treatment. Several new HCV therapies, called direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), are available that achieve cure rates of > 90% in many patient populations including individuals with HIV. The primary consideration in treating HCV in HIV-infected persons is the potential for drug interactions. We describe the clinical pharmacology and drug interaction potential of the DAAs, review the interaction data with DAAs and antiretroviral agents, and identify the knowledge gaps in the pharmacologic aspects of treating HCV in individuals with HIV coinfection. This review will focus on DAAs that have received regulatory approval in the United States and Europe and agents in late stages of clinical development.

### Managing HIV / hepatitis C co-infection in the era of direct acting antivirals [^114vUDwR]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Morbidity and mortality from co-morbid hepatitis C (HCV) infection in HIV co-infected patients are increasing; hence, the management of hepatitis co-infection in HIV is now one of the most important clinical challenges. Therefore, the development of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) for treatment of HCV has been eagerly awaited to hopefully improve HCV treatment outcome in co-infected individuals. Indeed, the availability of the first HCV protease inhibitors (PI) boceprevir and telaprevir for HCV genotype 1 patients has changed the gold standard of treating hepatitis C allowing for substantially improved HCV cure rates under triple HCV-PI/pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy. Moreover, numerous other new DAAs are currently being studied in co-infected patient populations, also exploring shorter treatment durations and interferon-free treatment approaches promising much easier and better tolerated treatment regimens in the near future. Nevertheless, numerous challenges remain, including choice of patients to treat, potential for drug-drug interactions and overlapping toxicities between HIV and HCV therapy. The dramatically improved rates of HCV cure under new triple therapy, however, warrant evaluation of these new treatment options for all co-infected patients.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112v5PSM]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) direct-acting antiviral (DAA) retreatment in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) shows underrepresentation of HIV in available series, with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for genotype 1 sofosbuvir plus NS5A inhibitor failures including a small number of people with HIV (~5%), and real-world retreatment reports noting all < 5% except one with 15%. Drawing on initial DAA therapy where people with HIV have nearly identical outcomes to persons with HCV infection alone, treatment approaches for DAA failures should be the same as those for persons with HCV mono-infection (AIII), and clinicians should refer to the most recent HCV treatment guidance for up-to-date recommendations.

### New paradigms in the management of hepatitis C virus co-infections [^113rYuvA]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

Liver disease has emerged as a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV infection. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a key element in the etiology of liver-associated injury in this population. Increased rates of fibrotic progression have been described and are mediated by alcohol use, the severity of immunosuppression, the use of antiretroviral therapy, and other factors. Large clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin and highlighted issues related to management of patients with HIV/HCV co-infection. Although treatment for HCV infection in this group remains a challenge, achievement of a sustained virologic response is feasible in approximately 35% of patients. Treatment must be individualized and attention must be paid to the potential for drug-drug interactions.

### Therapeutic interventions for HIV infection and chronic viral hepatitis [^117GTXFB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Combination antiretroviral therapy reduces overall and liver-specific morbidity and mortality in coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and represents the most beneficial pharmaceutical treatment intervention for most coinfected patients. Antiviral therapy for HCV infection is potentially organ- and life-saving but, in general, should be reserved for patients who achieve suppression of HIV RNA and immune restoration from combination antiretroviral therapy or for patients with nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte levels of > 350 cells/microL. Safe and virologically active treatment of coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus can be concurrently achieved by the use of combination antiretroviral therapy regimens containing lamivudine and/or tenofovir.

### Managing HIV / hepatitis C co-infection in the era of direct acting antivirals [^113JScrJ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

HCV therapy has also dramatically changed with the advent of the first DAAs in the HIV/HCV co-infected population with the promise of much higher cure rates and potentially shortened treatment durations. Nevertheless, complex drug interactions as well as significant additional toxicities and challenging overall management issues have limited the uptake of these new treatment strategies to date. With easier to take, better tolerated and optimally interferon-free HCV treatment approaches on the horizon in the very near future, HCV treatment initiation can be delayed in all patients with low fibrosis stages. For patients with more advanced fibrosis, however, the new treatment modalities should at least be discussed in order not to miss out on further liver disease progression and HCC development.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis in HIV care — screening and confirmatory testing states that on entry into HIV care, all HIV-infected patients should undergo routine HCV screening, and initial testing should use the most sensitive immunoassays licensed for detection of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) in blood; for at risk HCV-seronegative individuals, HCV antibody testing is recommended annually or as indicated by risk exposure; false-negative anti-HCV antibody results are uncommon (< 1%) in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression, and following acute HCV infection the window period prior to seroconversion ranges from 2 weeks to 12 weeks; elevated ALT early in acute infection should prompt testing for HCV RNA if serologic test results are negative or indeterminate in at-risk individuals; individuals who test positive for HCV antibody should undergo confirmatory testing using a sensitive quantitative assay to measure plasma HCV RNA level; plasma HCV RNA viral load does not correlate with HCV disease severity and should not be monitored serially in patients not taking HCV treatment, but plasma HCV RNA levels provide important prognostic information about the likelihood of response to HCV treatment.

### Provisional guidance on the use of hepatitis C virus protease inhibitors for treatment of hepatitis C in HIV-infected persons [^117DCbpZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

In May 2011, hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors (PIs) were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat persons with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but not those dually infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although critical safety and efficacy data are lacking, the availability of the drugs and substantial medical need justify the off-label use of HCV PIs in select HIV/HCV-coinfected persons. Pending results of ongoing investigations, this article represents provisional guidance on the use of HCV PIs in HIV-infected persons.

### Treatment of hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus co-infection [^1155asuQ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Co-infection with hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus results in increased fibrotic progression, decreased time to development of cirrhosis, and higher mortality associated with end-stage liver disease than infection with hepatitis C virus alone. Therefore, effective treatment intervention is critical. Standard combination therapy with interferon plus ribavirin historically has failed to provide consistent and significant sustained viral response rates. Recent efforts have focused on evaluation of peginterferons combined with ribavirin. Major randomized multicenter clinical trials have redefined the treatment of choice with yields of sustained viral response for hepatitis C up to 40% with peginterferon and ribavirin in co-infected patients. Human immunodeficiency virus control can be maintained during and after therapy for hepatitis C virus. Important adverse-event profiles associated with drug interactions between didanosine and ribavirin have been described.

### Understudied populations with hepatitis C [^112Pvh9T]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Managing patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection consists primarily of antiviral treatment, currently with peginterferon and ribavirin. Unfortunately, treatment recommendations derive largely from trials that have focused on highly selected patient populations. As a consequence of the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria in these studies, more than half of all HCV-infected patients would be ineligible for enrollment. Even among the selected patients enrolled into studies, only 50% achieve a sustained virological response (SVR). Patients not eligible for current therapies include those with mild disease and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, patients with advanced and decompensated liver disease, children, the elderly, patients with ongoing or recent alcohol and substance abuse, renal disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, severe psychiatric or neurologic illness, autoimmune disorders, solid organ transplant, and other significant comorbid conditions. Because these patients have been excluded from most clinical trials, little is known about the safety or efficacy of therapy in these populations. The expense and side effects of therapy are also an impediment to treatment of patients who are on public assistance, in prisons, and in institutions. Clearly, new efforts and new approaches are needed to expand the eligibility for antiviral therapy of hepatitis C and make treatment more available for understudied populations with this disease.

In summary, both pilot trials in naïve HIV/HCV co-infected patients have demonstrated statistically superior treatment outcome responses in patients receiving DAA-based HCV therapy over dual therapy with pegIFN/RBV alone. Therefore, within the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) hepatitis co-infection guidelines (please also see), HCV treatment in HCV genotype 1 patients is recommended with triple therapy, including either of the HCV protease inhibitors boceprevir or telaprevir in combination with pegIFN and RBV where available.

Antiretroviral therapy in HCV/HIV coinfection — Initiation of antiretroviral therapy should follow the recommendations for all persons with HIV infection, considering the need for concurrent HCV treatment with oral DAA regimens, the potential for drug–drug interactions, and the individual's HBV status. The same regimens recommended for initial treatment of HIV in most ART-naive persons also are recommended for patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, and when both HIV and HCV treatments are indicated, the antiretroviral regimen should be selected with careful consideration of potential drug–drug interactions with the HCV treatment regimen. In patients with HCV/HBV coinfection, HBV reactivation has been observed during HCV treatment with DAAs.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

### Update on chronic hepatitis C in HIV / HCV-coinfected patients: viral interactions and therapy [^113JpW9W]. AIDS (2003). Low credibility.

With highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected patients can now live longer and healthier lives, and other comorbid diseases, such as chronic hepatitis C, have emerged as a significant health concern. Coinfection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) may limit life expectancy because it can lead to serious liver disease including decompensated liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV-induced fibrosis progresses faster in HIV/HCV-coinfected persons, although HAART may be able to decrease this disease acceleration. Combination therapy for HCV with interferon and ribavirin can achieve a sustained viral response, although at a lower rate than in HCV-monoinfected patients. Combination treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin will probably emerge as the next HCV therapy of choice for HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. HCV combination therapy is generally safe, but serious adverse reactions, like lactic acidosis, may occur. Cytopenia may present a problem leading to dose reductions, but the role of growth factors is under study. All HIV/HCV-coinfected patients should be evaluated for therapy against the hepatitis C virus. A sustained viral load will probably lead to regression of liver disease, and even interferon-based treatment without viral clearance may slow down progression of liver disease. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who have progressed to end-stage liver disease have few therapeutic options other than palliative care, since liver transplants are generally unavailable. The mortality post-transplant may be higher than in HCV-monoinfected patients. We are entering an era where safe and effective HCV therapy is being defined for HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, and all eligible patients should be offered treatment.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112kzgaY]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Simplified approach to HCV treatment in people with HIV — eligibility and exclusions: The current AASLD/IDSA HCV guidance for simplified HCV treatment of treatment-naive adults (without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis) excludes persons with HIV. The Panel recommends an approach that allows most people with HIV to qualify for simplified HCV treatment, and this simplified approach is appropriate except in certain people with HIV with conditions noted in Box 1. Exclusions include prior HCV treatment (reinfection after prior successful therapy is not an exclusion), decompensated cirrhosis, a TDF-containing regimen with an eGFR < 60mL/min, being on efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, or boosted HIV-1 protease inhibitors, untreated chronic HBV infection, and pregnancy. People with HIV and HCV infection who meet these exclusion criteria should be treated for HCV following standard approaches.

### Review of the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels in human immunodeficiency virus and HCV coinfection [^115CdP5X]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The effect of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment on hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels in HIV-HCV-coinfected persons is uncertain. Although it is commonly believed that, with the initiation of HIV treatment, there may be an initial increase followed by a gradual decrease of HCV RNA levels to lower than those at pretreatment, the published studies evaluating this are of small and heterogeneous populations, are limited in follow-up, and have conflicting results. A prospective clinical trial of sufficient size and duration may help clarify this issue. This may be clinically relevant, because lower HCV RNA levels are a predictive factor for favorable response to HCV antiviral therapy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116bgNYr]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) clinical manifestations and progression in people with HIV indicate that both acute and chronic HCV infections are usually minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic, and elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels may be the only laboratory finding during acute and chronic infection; recognition of acute HCV with new-onset liver enzyme elevations is clinically important because early initiation of HCV treatment can lower the likelihood of poorer outcomes and prevent transmission to others; cirrhosis develops in 20 to 40% of patients with chronic HCV infection within 20 years after infection, and HIV coinfection adversely affects the course of HCV with significantly accelerated progression, particularly in those with advanced immunodeficiency (CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] count < 200 cells/mm3).

### Delivering therapy for hepatitis C virus infection to incarcerated HIV-seropositive patients [^114wASmq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The increase in morbidity and mortality due to end-stage liver disease has fueled recent guidelines that recommend consideration of treatment for hepatitis C in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Unfortunately, studies indicate that few patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are treated for their underlying hepatitis because of ongoing substance abuse, depression, chaotic lifestyles, homelessness, and perceived nonadherence. The structured environment of the prison system enables clinicians to provide complicated therapies for HCV to HIV-infected patients in combination with substance abuse programs. Furthermore, adherence to and adverse effects of therapy can be closely monitored. Offering treatment for HCV infection during incarceration to HIV-seropositive persons is highly efficient and targets underserved minority patients who have limited access to care in the community.

### Update in HIV-hepatitis C virus coinfection in the direct acting antiviral era [^112CuECm]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Availability of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) that demonstrate remarkable clinical efficacy and safety has revolutionized the ability to treat chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). An equal measure of clinical success has now been achieved in persons coinfected with HCV and the HIV, a historically harder to cure cohort with interferon-based therapy. Global goals include identifying all HIV-HCV-infected persons, gaining access to DAA therapy, preventing de novo and reinfection, and managing the sequelae of chronic infection. This review will discuss advances in the field of HIV-HCV coinfection reported during the last 18 months, and will suggest areas for future investigation.

Recent Findings

An expanding body of literature has enhanced our understanding of the clinical and epidemiologic issues surrounding HIV-HCV coinfection. DAA therapy for HCV is highly efficacious in HIV-HCV-coinfected persons if drug-drug interactions are appropriately considered.

Summary

Eradicating HCV infection in persons with HIV coinfection can be achieved safely and effectively with available DAAs. Economic and social approaches to enable access and delivery of curative HCV therapy to HIV-infected persons require continued research and resource allocation.

### Hepatitis C direct-acting antiviral agents: changing the paradigm of hepatitis C treatment in HIV-infected patients [^115dFRJ6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease is a major source of mortality in HIV-infected patients. Approximately one third of all patients with HIV are co-infected with HCV. Patients co-infected with HIV/HCV have shown lower rates of sustained virologic response with pegylated-interferon and weight-based ribavirin as well as more rapid progression of fibrosis than those with HCV mono-infection. Several direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), developed originally for HCV mono-infection, are being reevaluated for HIV/HCV co-infection. In addition, entirely new DAAs are being developed, including, interferon-free regimens with fewer side effects, allowing novel treatment opportunities for difficult-to-treat patients. In order for HCV DAAs to be successfully used in the HIV/HCV co-infected population several hurdles must be overcome, including adverse event management and drug-drug interactions. The aim of this review is to discuss the results of trials for new HCV therapies being developed for HIV/HCV co-infected patients and the impact of interferon-free regimens on treatment in the future.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116tb1Pm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and follow-up in persons with HIV — antibody, RNA, immunosuppression, pregnancy, and cirrhosis: Persons with HIV should be screened for HCV antibody upon initiation of care; if positive, HCV RNA should be ordered to assess for active infection. HCV RNA should be used in persons with a negative antibody if infection within the last 6 months is expected or after clearance of prior infection, and HCV RNA should be considered in advanced immunosuppression (CD4 count < 200 cells/μL) because approximately 2%–4% of persons with HIV–HCV coinfection have false-negative HCV antibody results. The rate of mother-to-infant transmission is up to 3-fold higher among women with HIV and pregnant people with HIV should be tested with each pregnancy, and infants can be tested for HCV RNA after 2 months or for HCV antibody after age 18 months. All persons diagnosed with chronic HCV should be offered curative treatment, eradication reduces but does not eliminate the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with cirrhosis, and screening for HCC is recommended in all patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis B or C or other nonviral etiologies.

### Integrating treatment for hepatitis C virus infection into an HIV clinic [^1174k7ft]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

In the United States, one-third of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are also coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Of 228 coinfected patients whose charts were reviewed in our 2000 study, only 2 had received therapy with interferon. To address low rates of treatment, in 2001 we implemented a program to shift the primary responsibility for oversight of care for HCV-infected patients from the liver clinic to HIV primary care clinicians and to provide education and support regarding adherence to patients. Critical elements of the program include education of HIV clinicians with regard to treatment for HCV infection, establishment of a coinfection clinic in the HIV clinic, assignment of a full-time Registered Nurse for monitoring and support of patients undergoing treatment for HCV infection, and development of a weekly peer group for the coinfected patients. Preliminary treatment results for patients in the program suggest that this approach has promise for improving outcomes of treatment among coinfected patients.

Laboratory monitoring and post-treatment follow-up for adults and adolescents with HIV and HCV coinfection — Laboratory monitoring while on treatment is not required for patients qualifying for the simplified treatment approach; however, documentation of HCV RNA levels at week 4 of therapy may be required by some payors prior to providing additional refills needed to complete therapy. Effort should be made to document SVR (HCV RNA less than lower limits of quantification) at least 12 weeks after completion of therapy (AI); patients without cirrhosis who achieve SVR do not require continued liver disease monitoring. Periodic assessment for HCV reinfection should be done via HCV RNA testing on an at least yearly basis for those with ongoing risk behaviors or more frequently as dictated by clinical circumstances (AII). In the setting of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma screening with liver ultrasound every 6 months should continue indefinitely (BII).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults and adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) include largely minimal or absent symptoms during acute and chronic phases, laboratory-only abnormalities, and risks for progressive liver disease. Both acute and chronic HCV infections are usually minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic, and fewer than 20% of patients with acute infection have characteristic symptoms such as low-grade fever, mild right-upper-quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dark urine, and jaundice; unexplained elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) may be the only laboratory finding. Recognition of acute HCV infection with new-onset liver enzyme elevations is clinically important since treatment during the early phases of infection is more efficacious than during the chronic phase; over time, cirrhosis develops in approximately 20% of patients with chronic HCV infection within 20 years after infection, with risk factors including older age at infection, male sex, obesity, and concomitant alcohol use, and HIV coinfection adversely affects the course of HCV infection.

### The new paradigm of hepatitis C therapy: integration of oral therapies into best practices [^117KSQjn]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with HCV–HIV coinfection

Persons with HIV infection have a high prevalence of chronic HCV infection with a tendency towards more rapid progression to cirrhosis and potentially less access to liver transplantation. Some reports suggest that relative to HCV mono-infected patients, HIV-HCV coinfected patients also have higher rates of comorbid conditions such as drug use, major depression and anaemia. With HIV therapies, drug interactions may occur and may be difficult to predict; therefore, novel direct antiviral therapies for HCV will need to be evaluated for their potential for interaction with at least some HIV antiretrovirals. Coinfected patients have reduced rates of response to therapy with PEG-IFN and RBV, but adding telaprevir or boceprevir increases efficacy of therapy–. Some of the newer regimens may have even greater efficacy–. Curing HCV in coinfected patients is linked to improved clinical outcomes and longer survival–. Conducting studies of the newer regimens in coinfected patients will be important for generating data needed to develop practice guidelines and justify third-party payment.

### When do co-infections matter? [^116ZEHRF]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses

Viral hepatitis is associated with increased morbidity in PLHIV. End-stage liver disease is most common in patients with hepatitis B virus hepatitis C virus (HCV) HIV co-infection, then in dual infections, and much less common in HIV monoinfection. Viral hepatitis is also associated with extrahepatic complications in PLHIV such as increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, kidney disease, osteoporosis and fractures, and more severe cognitive impairment. Hepatitis virus co-infection also slows immunological recovery in pregnant women and children with HIV, and HCV contributes to an ongoing immune activation and immune dysfunction even in controlled HIV infection.

Directly acting antivirals now allow more than 95% HCV cure rates, regardless of HIV co-infection, and HCV eradication reduces mortality, HIV progression, liver-related events, and diabetes mellitus. Well tolerated and effective regimes for PLHIV on ART are now achievable.

### HIV and viral hepatitis Coinfections: advances and challenges [^113fK5GQ]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

With a prevalence affecting over 30% of HIV infected patients, coinfection with hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) virus remains one of the most frequent comorbidities in this population, with a significant impact in terms of morbidity and mortality associated with liver disease. Recent findings in the physiopathology of HIV in the liver have confirmed that it may contribute, along with hepatotoxicity of antiretrovirals and the burden of metabolic diseases, to a more rapid progression of liver fibrosis, especially when there is underlying chronic hepatitis coinfection. Both fields of research and clinical appraisal of HBV and HCV coinfection are rapidly evolving and prompt a change in the former paradigms of clinical care and management of chronic hepatic coinfection in the context of HIV. The advent of anti-HCV direct antiviral agents has indeed completely shaken up the treatment guidelines for HCV, and the tricky management of these new agents with antiretrovirals means referring patients to specialised centres. In HBV coinfection, therapeutic options have not changed recently but new challenges have emerged regarding the management of low replicating HBV-DNA in optimally treated patients and long term exposure to antivirals. Finally, the global increase in life expectancy in HIV infected patients has been accompanied in coinfected patients by a higher risk of emergence of end stage liver diseases for which access to orthotopic liver transplantation and innovative procedures such as targeted hepatocellular carcinoma therapies should be facilitated.

### Optimizing treatment in HIV / HCV coinfection [^113qJPe3]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Sustained virological response (SVR) to anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment is an outcome that can improve life expectancy in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Results of anti-HCV treatment are poor, and less than 50% of treated patients show SVR to peginterferon plus ribavirin combination therapy; in infections from HCV genotype 1 this proportion is less than 40%. Pilot studies have demonstrated that Boceprevir or Telaprevir in combination with peginterferon plus ribavirin are able to increase the SVR rate from 45% to 74% with Telaprevir, and from 26% to 61% with Boceprevir in persons never treated for hepatitis C. Interim data seem to indicate a high rate of HCV RNA undetectability on treatment also in patients without sustained response to peginterferon plus ribavirin. Both Telaprevir and Boceprevir have drug-drug interactions with antiretrovirals, and options for concurrent antiretroviral therapy are restricted. There are also several new anti-HCV drugs under study with the potential for more tolerable effective future regimens. The indication for treatment in a patient with HCV/HIV coinfection should take into account the priority of treatment, the probability of sustained response, the potential toxicities, the concurrent antiretroviral therapy options, the patient's motivation, and the sustainability of current and future therapies.

### Human immunodeficiency virus and coinfection with hepatitis B and C [^114mbaby]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

In HIV-infected individuals, coinfection with HBV and/or HCV is common because of shared modes of transmission. It is known that HIV accelerates progression of liver disease and results in increased morbidity and mortality associated with viral hepatitis, but it is less clear if viral hepatitis has a direct effect on HIV. Treatment of viral hepatitis improves outcomes and should be considered in all HIV-infected patients. Treatment of HBV without concurrent treatment of HIV is risky because resistance can occur in both viruses if regimens are not carefully chosen.

The rate of progression increases with older age, alcoholism, male sex, and HIV infection.

The risk of progression is even greater in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection who have low CD4 T lymphocyte cell counts. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) appears to slow the rate of HCV disease progression in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, several studies have demonstrated that the rate of disease progression continues to exceed that observed in patients without HIV.

Alternative treatment of HBV in patients with HIV infection who are not receiving ART — permissible option and cautions: HBV and HIV co-treatment is essential and recommended, and directly acting HBV drugs must not be given in the absence of a fully suppressive ART regimen (AII). Only pegylated interferon-alpha-2a monotherapy may be considered for patients with HIV/HBV coinfection who are not receiving ART and who meet criteria for HBV therapy as described in the AASLD 2018 guidelines (CIII). If ART is administered, then anti-HBV therapy must be included as part of the regimen and anti-HCV therapy can be introduced as needed (CIII). As HBV reactivation can occur during treatment for HCV with directly active agents (DAAs) in the absence of HBV-active drugs, all patients with HIV/HBV coinfection who will be treated for HCV should be on HBV-active ART at the time of HCV treatment initiation (AIII).

### A survey of hepatitis C treatment clinical practice patterns using the newly approved protease inhibitors [^113TmdES]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Goals

To describe current hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment practices in the United States and identify physician characteristics associated with the use of first generation direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).

Background

HCV treatment practice patterns have not been assessed after the introduction of DAA, which are now considered standard of care for most HCV genotype 1 patients.

Study

We sampled nationally representative physicians treating HCV patients with DAAs through a web-based survey. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify physician characteristics associated with the use of DAAs in 4 clinical vignettes (early stage fibrosis, prior null response, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, and post-liver transplantation).

Results

Of 1658 deliverable emails, 337 (20.3%) clinicians responded. Fifty percent of providers recommended DAA therapy for treatment-naive patients with early stage fibrosis, whereas 49% of providers would await new therapies. For prior null responders with significant fibrosis, 74% would attempt retreatment using DAAs and 26% would await new therapies. Off-label use of DAAs was recommended by 69% of providers for patients with HIV infection and 48% of providers for post-liver transplant patients. Academic affiliation was significantly associated with higher rates of off-label use in both HIV and post-liver transplant patients.

Conclusions

Despite more potent and less toxic therapies on the horizon, many physicians recommended DAAs in treatment-naive patients with early stage fibrosis. Providers also frequently recommended DAAs for off-label uses, such as treating post-liver transplant patients and those coinfected with HIV.

### HIV / hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients and cirrhosis: how to diagnose it and what to do next? [^112LeP1U]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Liver disease, specifically cirrhosis, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The diagnosis of early cirrhosis in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients may be challenging. The development of noninvasive methods for fibrosis assessment empowers the infectious disease specialist to diagnose advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Early diagnosis is essential to enroll patients in screening programs for esophageal varices and hepatocellular carcinoma. Cirrhosis may also modify decisions about treatment of both HIV and HCV, including vaccination, medications chosen, and referral for liver transplant.

### The impact of hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus coinfection on survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [^111jibz6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

We read with great interest the article by Alkhalili et al, who concluded that, despite presenting with more advanced cirrhosis and being less likely to undergo surgery, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with viral hepatitis had similar survival to patients with HCC of non-hepatitis B, non-hepatitis C etiology. But do these results reflect the whole picture?

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) share a common route of transmission, so that about one third of HIV infected individuals show HCV co-infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy has offered a longer and better life to infected patients. While this has removed HIV-related diseases from the list of most common causes of death, their place has been taken by complications of HCV infection, such as cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and HCC. HIV-HCV co-infection requires complex management, especially when HCC is present. According to current guidelines, HCC treatment is the same for patients with and without HIV infection, although the outcome seems to be worse for HIV-positive patients than their HIV-negative counterparts.

The result of HCV infection is, in the majority of cases, the development of liver cirrhosis. Once cirrhosis is established, the annual risk of HCC, liver disease progression, and death in HCV-infected patients reaches approximately 1–7%, 5%, and 2%, respectively. HIV-HCV coinfected patients have a higher mean rate of fibrosis progression per year, translated into a shorter mean duration from HCV infection to cirrhosis, compared to HCV mono-infected patients. Therefore, as described above, coinfected patients have been shown to develop liver cirrhosis more quickly than HCV-mono-infected individuals and demonstrate a more aggressive course of HCC, something that should have been mentioned in this study.

### Pangenotypic direct acting antivirals for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^115VnFum]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent approval and adoption of pangenotypic direct acting antivirals (DAAs) necessitated a revision of the 2015 World Health Organization guidelines for the management of persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and relevant conference proceedings to identify randomized and non-randomized trials, as well as prospective observational studies of DAAs. The proportions of persons with events were pooled for sustained virological response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12), discontinuations due to adverse events (DAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and all-cause mortality. Analyses were stratified by HCV genotype and antiviral treatment experience, with subgroup analyses based on presence of cirrhosis and HIV-HCV coinfection.

Findings

The evidence base consisted of 238 publications describing 142 studies. In the overall analysis, which included all persons irrespective of treatment experience or comorbidities, the pooled proportion achieving SVR12 exceeded 0.94 for all pangenotypic regimens across genotypes 1, 2, and 4. Some heterogeneity may have led to lower SVR rates in persons with genotype 3 infection. High SVR12 (> 0.90) was observed in persons with genotype 1 infection with cirrhosis, though evidence varied and was limited for genotypes 2–4. Evidence was sparse for persons with HIV–HCV coinfection. All regimens were associated with small proportions of persons with DAEs, SAEs, or all-cause mortality.

Interpretation

Based on this and other supporting evidence, the WHO issued updated guidelines with a conditional recommendation, based on moderate quality evidence, for the use of pangenotypic DAA regimens for persons with chronic HCV infection aged 18 years and older (July 2018).

Funding

This study was funded by the.

### Management of acute and chronic HCV infection in persons with HIV coinfection [^116UMpqD]. Journal of Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Due to shared routes of transmission, acute and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus is common among persons living with HIV infection in many regions of the world. In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, acute HCV infection has been increasingly recognized in HIV-infected persons, particularly men who have sex with men, and liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma, has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in those with chronic HCV infection, particularly older adults with long-standing coinfection. Over the past decade, the foundation for the management of acute and chronic HCV infection has been interferon alfa. However, due the high burden of treatment-related side effects and low likelihood of sustained virologic response, the impact of treatment with peginterferon/ribavirin on the burden of HCV disease in has been limited. However, the anticipated availability of safe, tolerable and highly efficacious interferon-free, oral HCV direct-acting antiviral combination therapies promise to dramatically change the management of acute and chronic HCV infection in HIV-infected persons. Preliminary data from studies of such oral DAA regimens in HIV/HCV coinfected patients suggest that coinfection with HIV will not impair HCV cure with these regimens. Indeed, in the coming era of high effective oral HCV DAA treatments, the only special feature concerning treatment of acute and chronic HCV infection in HIV-infected patients may be drug interactions between the antiretroviral drugs for HIV infection and direct-acting antiviral drugs for HCV infection.

### Hepatitis C and progression of HIV disease… [^1162id1c]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context Conflicting reports exist regarding the effect of hepatitis C virus on the progression of human immunodeficiency virus disease. Objective To assess the effect of HCV infection on clinical and immunologic progression of HIV disease and immunologic response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Due to shared routes of transmission, an estimated 15% to 30% of human immunodeficiency virus -infected persons are coinfected with hepatitis C virus in the United States and Europe. 1, 2 Human immunodeficiency virus infection appears to increase the persistence. Similarly, no difference was detected in the risk of progression to an AIDS-defining illness among HCV-infected patients compared with HCV-uninfected patients in the subgroup of 1199 patients who ultimately received HAART and in the subgroup of 250 patients with well-controlled.

Nonetheless, among patients prescribed HAART, we found no evidence that HCV infection substantially alters the virological or immunologic response to potent antiretroviral therapy. These findings underscore the importance of the consideration of effective antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected persons at immediate risk of developing AIDS, including those coinfected with HCV. this subgroup of 1199 HAART recipients, we did not find evidence that HCV infection substantially alters the risk of progression to AIDS or death or the combined end point of AIDS or death. Similarly, among. In particular, since GB virus C infection has been associated with reduced progression of HIV disease, the presence of GB virus C infection could mask an adverse effect of HCV if it occurred more often in HCV-infected persons.

42, 43, 45 Thus, these and other unmeasured factors may confound the relationship of HCV and HIV progression. In conclusion, after adjustment for the administration of HAART and its effectiveness, we did not detect an increased risk of development of AIDS-defining illness, death, or CD4 cell.

### Clinical screening and diagnosis for hepatitis C… [^114jXRQq]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Nonreactive/negative HCV antibody results If an HCV antibody test is not reactive, the patient has likely not been exposed and you can rule out infection. However, RNA testing is recommended for the diagnosis of current HCV infection among people who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months, regardless of HCV antibody result. Suspected exposure may be inferred from the patient's history or the context and setting of the patient encounter. Reactive/positive HCV antibody results If an HCV antibody test is positive/reactive, this indicates a history of past or current HCV infection and clinicians should order HCV RNA testing automatically. When the HCV antibody test is reactive, laboratories should automatically perform NAT testing for HCV RNA detection.

This automatic testing streamlines the process because it occurs without any additional action on the part of the patient or the clinician. Negative HCV RNA results A non-detectable HCV RNA test result indicates no current HCV infection and no further action required in most cases. Positive HCV RNA results It usually takes 1–2 weeks after exposure to the virus for detectable HCV RNA levels to appear. A detectable HCV RNA test result indicates current infection, and you should counsel the patient, evaluate for treatment, and initiate an appropriate direct-acting antiviral regimen. HCV antibody reactive Presumptive HCV infection A repeatedly reactive result could be consistent with current HCV infection, past HCV infection that has resolved, or biologic false positivity for HCV antibody. Test for HCV RNA to identify current infection. HCV antibody reactive, HCV RNA detected.

* If HCV RNA testing is not feasible and person tested is not immunocompromised, do follow-up testing for HCV antibody to demonstrate seroconversion. If the patient tested is immunocompromised, consider testing for HCV RNA. † It is recommended before initiating antiviral therapy to retest for HCV RNA in a subsequent blood sample to confirm HCV RNA positivity. § If the patient is suspected of having HCV exposure within the past 6 months, or has clinical evidence of HCV disease, or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen, the clinician should follow up with the patient.
