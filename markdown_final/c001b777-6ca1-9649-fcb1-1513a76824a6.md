## Question

How can I document that I discussed with the patient that there was not enough physical exam findings to fill out a FMLA form for her

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to document that there were not enough physical exam findings to support completing an FMLA form for a patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the legal and regulatory context of FMLA and what constitutes sufficient medical evidence. Then, I should verify the objective documentation requirements for physical examination and functional assessment. Next, I will consider how to structure the conversation with the patient and what to record about that discussion. After that, I need to ensure the note is clinically precise, legally defensible, and compliant with privacy rules. Finally, I will review follow-up actions and provide a concise, templated example that incorporates these elements.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory framework so I don't overstate what I can or cannot certify. FMLA requires a health care provider to attest to a serious health condition using objective medical evidence, and physicians should be clear and thorough when completing required forms, focusing on medically determinable impairments rather than symptoms alone [^e7db5241] [^7d37018f]. Hold on, I should verify the standard for "objective" findings: disability adjudication frameworks emphasize that impairments must be supported by signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings, not by the patient's statement of symptoms alone, which reinforces the need for documented objective findings to justify leave [^7c465f3b].

> Next, I should review what constitutes adequate physical examination documentation for functional impairment. I need to ensure I document pertinent positive and negative findings, functional status, and how findings relate to work capacity, because adjudicators and reviewers look for objective evidence of limitations and functional impact, not just diagnoses or symptom reports [^2a2579f7] [^fc6e2cb9]. Wait, let me verify the principle: even when the exam is "normal", documenting what was assessed and that no impairments were found is itself clinically meaningful and supports the conclusion that there is insufficient objective basis for functional limitation at this time [^2a2579f7].

> I will now examine how to structure the patient discussion so it is transparent and ethically sound. I should confirm that I explained the purpose of the exam, the FMLA evidentiary requirements, and the specific findings (or lack thereof) that led to my conclusion, using plain language and allowing the patient to ask questions and express concerns, which aligns with best practices for patient-centered communication and shared decision-making [^e4c1effb] [^2a2579f7]. Hold on, I should verify that I also documented the patient's response and understanding, because that demonstrates the conversation occurred and supports informed consent to the plan, even when the outcome is not what the patient hoped for [^notfound].

> Now, I need to translate this into a precise, clinically grounded note. Let me think about the essential elements: date/time, participants, chief concern, history summary, detailed physical examination with functional assessment, explicit statement of objective findings (or absence), application to FMLA evidentiary standards, the discussion with the patient including her questions and my responses, and the plan including any follow-up or alternative steps. I should double-check that I avoid conclusory language like "malingering" and stick to observable facts and functional implications to maintain objectivity and professionalism [^e2d44f21] [^2a2579f7].

> But wait, what if the patient reports significant symptoms despite a normal exam? I need to ensure I acknowledge symptoms while explaining that FMLA certification requires objective evidence of functional limitation, and I should document that I offered reasonable next steps such as targeted testing, referral, or a short follow-up interval to reassess, which shows diligence and preserves the therapeutic relationship [^7c465f3b] [^e4c1effb]. I should confirm that I also recorded any prior diagnostic workups and why they do not currently meet the evidentiary threshold for FMLA, to avoid appearing dismissive and to maintain clinical coherence [^7c465f3b].

> Next, I should review legal and privacy considerations so documentation is compliant. I need to ensure the record is complete, timely, and legible, and that I protect confidential medical information consistent with HIPAA and occupational health regulations, especially when forms may be shared with employers or third parties [^bd493c4b]. Hold on, I should verify that I only include medically necessary information on FMLA forms and avoid speculative statements, keeping the focus on objective findings and functional impact rather than subjective impressions [^e7db5241].

> I will now consider follow-up and contingency planning. If new symptoms emerge or objective findings develop, I should document reassessment and, if appropriate, complete the FMLA form at that time, noting the change in clinical status that now meets evidentiary standards. I should also confirm that the patient knows how to request reconsideration if her condition worsens or new information becomes available, which supports continuity and fairness [^7d37018f]. Let me reconsider whether I offered a short-interval follow-up; if not, I should add that to the plan to ensure we are not prematurely closing the case.

> Here is a concise, templated example I can use, making sure I fill in specifics for this patient. I should double-check that each element maps to the principles above and that I retain the clinical reasoning in my own words rather than copying verbatim: "On [date], I evaluated Ms. X for FMLA certification for [condition]. History: [brief summary]. Physical examination: [system-by-system findings, including functional assessment such as gait, posture, ability to rise, use of assistive devices, and simulation of work tasks]. Objective findings: No objective evidence of impairment on examination; no reproducible pain with palpation or movement, full range of motion, normal strength, no focal neurologic deficits, and no functional limitations identified on observed tasks. Discussion: I explained that FMLA requires objective medical evidence of a serious health condition with functional limitations, and that today's examination does not demonstrate such impairment. Ms. X expressed concern about her symptoms and asked about next steps. I validated her symptoms and offered [follow-up plan, referrals, or further evaluation as indicated]. Plan: No FMLA certification at this time; return precautions and instructions provided; patient understands rationale and agreed to follow-up" [^2a2579f7] [^7c465f3b] [^e4c1effb].

> Finally, I should confirm that my documentation is consistent, coherent, and retrievable, and that I have communicated clearly with the patient about the reasoning and next steps. If the patient later provides new objective findings or if my assessment changes, I should document the updated evaluation and, if appropriate, complete the FMLA form, noting the new evidence that supports certification, which maintains integrity and aligns with regulatory expectations [^7d37018f] [^e7db5241]. Hold on, I should verify that I also recorded any handouts or educational materials provided, as that further supports patient understanding and shared decision-making in the chart [^notfound].

Document that you **performed a focused physical exam** and found no objective abnormalities to support FMLA certification. Record the **specific systems examined** (e.g. musculoskeletal, neurologic, cardiovascular) and note any negative findings (e.g. no tenderness, swelling, deformity, or functional limitation). Explain to the patient that FMLA requires objective medical evidence of a serious health condition, and document her understanding and response. Provide a brief, factual note such as: "Focused exam of [systems] reveals no objective findings to support a serious health condition or functional limitation; discussed with patient that FMLA certification requires objective evidence; patient understands and will follow up if symptoms change" [^7c465f3b] [^7d37018f].

---

## Clinical documentation requirements for FMLA

FMLA regulations require that certification be supported by **objective medical evidence** of a serious health condition that impairs the patient's ability to perform essential job functions [^e7db5241]. Objective evidence includes:

- **Physical examination findings**: Documented abnormalities such as tenderness, swelling, deformity, or functional limitations [^2a2579f7].

- **Diagnostic test results**: Laboratory tests, imaging studies, or other diagnostic evaluations that confirm a medical condition [^7c465f3b].

- **Clinical observations**: Physician's observations of the patient's physical condition and functional status [^2a2579f7].

If the physical examination reveals no objective abnormalities, the clinician must **document this clearly**, as it directly impacts the ability to certify the condition under FMLA [^7c465f3b].

---

## Recommended documentation approach

When documenting that insufficient physical examination findings were found to support FMLA certification, the following approach is recommended:

---

### 1. Detailed documentation of the physical examination

Perform a **focused physical examination** relevant to the patient's reported symptoms and document specific findings, including:

- **Systems examined**: Clearly state which body systems were examined (e.g. musculoskeletal, neurologic, cardiovascular, respiratory).

- **Negative findings**: Document the absence of objective abnormalities such as tenderness, swelling, deformity, or functional limitations [^2a2579f7].

- **Functional assessment**: Assess and document the patient's functional status, including range of motion, strength, gait, and ability to perform activities of daily living [^2a2579f7].

Example documentation: "Focused musculoskeletal examination reveals no tenderness, swelling, deformity, or limited range of motion. Neurologic examination is within normal limits, with no sensory deficits or motor weakness. Functional assessment demonstrates the patient can perform full range of motion, ambulate independently, and perform activities of daily living without limitation".

---

### 2. Clear explanation to the patient

Engage in a **transparent discussion** with the patient, explaining:

- **FMLA requirements**: Explain that FMLA certification requires objective medical evidence of a serious health condition that impairs the ability to perform essential job functions [^e7db5241].

- **Findings and implications**: Clearly communicate that the physical examination did not reveal objective findings to support such certification [^7c465f3b].

- **Next steps**: Discuss alternative options, such as short-term disability, accommodation, or follow-up evaluation if symptoms persist or worsen [^notfound].

Document the patient's **understanding and response** to this discussion [^notfound].

---

### 3. Written documentation in the medical record

Include a **concise, factual note** in the medical record that includes:

- **Date and time**: Document when the discussion occurred.

- **Participants**: Note who was present during the discussion (e.g. patient, clinician, nurse).

- **Summary of discussion**: Summarize the key points discussed, including the rationale for not certifying the condition under FMLA and the patient's response [^notfound].

- **Plan**: Outline any follow-up plans, referrals, or alternative options discussed with the patient [^7d37018f].

Example documentation: "Discussed with the patient that the physical examination did not reveal objective findings to support FMLA certification. Explained that FMLA requires objective medical evidence of a serious health condition. Patient understands and agrees to follow up if symptoms persist or worsen. Alternative options, including short-term disability and workplace accommodations, were discussed".

---

## Legal and ethical considerations

When documenting insufficient physical examination findings for FMLA certification, clinicians should consider the following **legal and ethical principles**:

- **Accuracy and objectivity**: Ensure that all documentation is accurate, objective, and based on clinical findings [^e2d44f21].

- **Patient confidentiality**: Maintain patient confidentiality and adhere to HIPAA regulations when discussing and documenting sensitive information [^bd493c4b].

- **Professional communication**: Communicate clearly and professionally with the patient, avoiding judgmental or dismissive language [^f30b0526].

- **Alternative support**: Provide information about alternative resources or accommodations that may be available to the patient [^e7db5241].

---

## Conclusion

When a patient's physical examination does not reveal objective findings to support FMLA certification, it is essential to **document the examination thoroughly**, explain the rationale clearly to the patient, and record the discussion and plan in the medical record. This approach ensures compliance with FMLA regulations, maintains transparency, and supports the clinician's professional judgment.

History and physical examination in tinnitus — core elements to document — are specified as follows. "The history should include the details of onset of tinnitus, the duration of symptoms, and the effects of the tinnitus on patient QOL." "The characteristics of the tinnitus should be detailed, including laterality and pulsatile nature." "Auditory phenomena such as hallucinations should be excluded." "Symptoms of hearing loss,44 disequilibrium, or other neurologic deficits should be documented." "Ototoxic agents, including common over-the-counter medications such as aspirin (in high doses), can cause tinnitus." "Potential exposure to such ototoxic agents or suspect medications should be discussed." "A history of excessive alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco use should be elicited." Clinicians are advised that "Clinicians who evaluate patients with tinnitus should document the presence or absence of symptoms and conditions that dictate the need for referral to otolaryngology, audiology, and related specialties." Finally, "Although most tinnitus patients will have few relevant positive physical findings, the examination should be directed to identifying secondary tinnitus, with potentially treatable or explainable causes, as well as to find signs of serious disease."

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: under-, over-and misdiagnosis [^383ad52c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is an enigma. During the past three decades, with the gradual acceptance of the validity of FM, it is variously under-, over and misdiagnosed. Evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines have suggested a comprehensive clinical assessment to avoid this diagnostic conundrum. Every patient with chronic pain should be screened for chronic widespread pain (pain in four of five body regions) (CWP). Those with CWP should be screened for presence of additional major symptoms of FM: unrefreshed sleep and fatigue. A complete medical (including drug) history and complete physical examination is mandatory in the evaluation of a patient with CWP in order to consolidate the diagnosis of FM or identify features that may point to some other condition that may have a presentation similar to FM. Limited simple laboratory testing is recommended to screen for possible other diseases. The 2016 criteria may be used to further confirm the clinical diagnosis of FM. In consideration of the differential diagnosis of FM, attention should be paid to the presence of other chronic overlapping pain conditions and of mental disorders. FM as a stand alone diagnosis is however rare, as most patients with FM meet criteria for other chronic overlapping pain conditions or mental disorders. The severity of FM should be assessed in order to direct treatment approaches and help inform the likely outcome for an individual patient.

### Disability revisited… [^7c465f3b]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

I explained to him that as a physician, I could only report on his medical condition. I filled out the disability form as well as I could, summarizing his surgery, stating that the patient complained of ongoing pain, and indicating that I was unable to determine whether this was a condition that could result in permanent disability. At his next visit, the patient presented me with another blank disability form. He also showed me a letter from the agency, which stated that the claim was not denied, but that more evidence was needed to prove he was disabled. He gave me the blank form to complete. Having already provided the facts to the best of my ability, what additional information was being requested. Was I being expected to steer the interpretation of the medical condition in a particular direction. As it happened, subsequent labwork showed abnormalities that allowed me to offer a diagnosis, even if it was an unlikely cause of the actual pain.

I have been told that physicians should just state the facts about our patients, and that someone else will make the disability decisions. Is that correct. Commentary In response to a patient's expression of pain, the physician should remember that symptoms must be related to specific findings. Social Security specifically defines an impairment as one that is objective by some measure and "not only by the individual's statement of symptoms. " If the patient has no hernia, no adhesions, and no wound or bowel complications, and objectively has no reasonable, diagnosable cause for pain, there is really no objective basis for finding a functional limitation, and this fact should be made known to the adjudicator. On the form from the disability determination agency, the physician can document diagnoses and the objective findings he has observed, and he also may offer an opinion regarding the effect of these impairments on functioning.

For example, he might state: "Mr. Jones has a 3 × 4 cm reducible, moderately tender, incisional hernia superior to the umbilicus. 2 The Social Security Administration defines a medically determinable impairment this way: "An impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. A physical or mental impairment must be established by medical evidence consisting of signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings — not only by the individual's statement of symptoms". A physician can freely state the objective findings and degree to which they have limited the patient's functional capacity, but he does not need to, and is not expected to, make a disability determination.

### Evaluating the patient with fibromyalgia [^472c08e2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Once the physician has identified fibromyalgia as a potential diagnosis, further evaluation is warranted, both to understand the full dimensions of fibromyalgia and to evaluate other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. For example, mood disorders, sleep disorders, and daytime fatigue are often present in patients with fibromyalgia and often are closely related to pain. In addition, a number of physical conditions can mimic fibromyalgia and must be considered in the patient's evaluation. These include endocrine conditions, neurologic disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, and medication-related side effects. Taking a complete medical history and performing a thorough physical examination, including a complete laboratory assessment, can be very helpful in confirming the diagnosis or establishing an alternate diagnosis.

### Best practices in documenting and coding high-value care in workers' compensation encounters-ACOEM guidance statement [^2a2579f7]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Physical examination documentation in WC — exams support trust, function assessment, and risk recognition. The guidance states, "Physical examination appropriate to the work-related condition is integral to establishing patient trust while assessing function in a WC encounter." Although "research has shown low reliability of physical examination conducted for low back pain," it also notes, "Other research, though not specific to WC, has shown that patients expect physical examination and that it relates to their satisfaction with care," and advises, "The physician should explain the purpose of the examination procedures and seek the patient's agreement before proceeding." General principles "include documenting:" "Pertinent findings (positive or negative) on both the affected and unaffected side," "Patient level of distress," and "Evaluation, and documentation, of functional status, for example" including "Gait, posture, and balance," "Ability to rise from chair or climb to/from table, with or without assistance of arms," "Use of assistive devices," "Demonstrations or tests of ability to use the affected body part," and "Simulation of work activities."

ACR practice parameter — Informal communications explains that occasionally an interpreting physician may provide an interpretation that does not result in a "formal" report but is used to make treatment decisions, which may take the form of a "curbside consult," a "wet reading," or an "informal opinion," and these circumstances may preclude immediate documentation and may occur in suboptimal viewing conditions without comparison studies or adequate patient history; it adds that informal communications carry inherent risk, the referring physician's/health care provider's documentation may be the only written record, interpreting physicians are encouraged to document those interpretations, and a system for reporting outside studies is encouraged.

### The CARE guidelines: consensus-based clinical case reporting guideline development [^deaa68bc]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A case report is a narrative that describes, for medical, scientific or educational purposes, a medical problem experienced by one or more patients. Case reports written without guidance from reporting standards are insufficiently rigorous to guide clinical practice or to inform clinical study design. Develop, disseminate and implement systematic reporting guidelines for case reports. We used a three-phase consensus process consisting of (1) premeeting literature review and interviews to generate items for the reporting guidelines, (2) a face-to-face consensus meeting to draft the reporting guidelines and (3) postmeeting feedback, review and pilot testing, followed by finalisation of the case report guidelines. This consensus process involved 27 participants and resulted in a 13-item checklist-a reporting guideline for case reports. The primary items of the checklist are title, key words, abstract, introduction, patient information, clinical findings, timeline, diagnostic assessment, therapeutic interventions, follow-up and outcomes, discussion, patient perspective and informed consent. We believe the implementation of the CARE (CAse REport) guidelines by medical journals will improve the completeness and transparency of published case reports and that the systematic aggregation of information from case reports will inform clinical study design, provide early signals of effectiveness and harms, and improve healthcare delivery.

### Spine injury [^d92c41fd]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Secondary survey and documentation — the secondary survey aims to obtain a full and detailed history and physical examination after completion of the primary survey, and the patient is deemed to be stable and have no life-threatening injuries. The clinical decision tools to identify patients at risk for a spinal injury require further imaging investigative studies. For patients with suspected SCI, clearly detail the complete neurologic evaluation. Serial documentation of abnormal physical findings during subsequent evaluations allows for early identification of secondary injuries which may have implications in management decisions. Ensure this documentation includes the date and time performed and name of the examiner.

### ACR practice parameter for communication of diagnostic imaging findings [^3af62e0f]. ACR (2025). High credibility.

ACR practice parameter — communication of diagnostic imaging findings emphasizes that Practice Parameters and Technical Standards are not inflexible rules or requirements of practice and are not intended, nor should they be used, to establish a legal standard of care. It permits professional judgment, noting that a conscientious practitioner may responsibly adopt a course of action different from that set forth in this document and that a practitioner who employs an approach substantially different from the guidance in this document may consider documenting in the patient record information sufficient to explain the approach taken. Therefore, it should be recognized that adherence to the guidance in this document will not assure an accurate diagnosis or a successful outcome. The introduction underscores core principles: Effective communication is a critical component of diagnostic imaging, and Quality patient care can only be achieved when study results are conveyed in a timely fashion to the patient and to those responsible for treatment decisions. An effective method of communication should 1) promote optimal patient care and support the referring physician/ health care provider in this endeavor, 2) be tailored to satisfy the need for timeliness, and 3) minimize the risk of communication errors, while recognizing that various factors and circumstances unique to a clinical scenario may influence the methods of communication between interpreting physicians and referring physicians/health care providers.

### A comprehensive medical evaluation of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome [^b7fd9637]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a common and distressful condition. It is imperative that all physicians do their best to help these suffering patients with understanding and respect, since the primary responsibility of a physician is to ameliorate suffering of a patient, irrespective of the type of the disease or the illness. (The authors use the terms "disease" and "illness" synonymously, since any distinction between these two terms are really pointless because the word "disease" means lack of ease or presence of suffering.) It is clear that a physician cannot optimize management of a patient with FMS without a thorough medical and psychologic evaluation. A good evaluation helps to make a proper diagnosis, assess severity, recognize aggravating and relieving factors of symptoms, appraise psychologic factors, evaluate relevant associated or concomitant conditions, document individualized problems in a given patient, and subsequently formulate proper and individualized management. This article focuses on the major elements of a comprehensive medical evaluation, with some reference to psychologic aspects — are covered in detail in the article by Turk et al in this issue.

### Informed consent for spine procedures: best practice guideline from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^9b48dc6e]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Documentation of Informed Consent Discussion

An informed consent form often serves as a system-level check to ensure that the consent process has occurred and is integrated into the safety check process at most healthcare institutions. In order to ensure an efficient process, the form should be brief, and language should be easily understood. In addition to improved documentation, patients are more open to consent and experience reduced anxiety when the consent forms are simplified. The form often requires a signature from the patient, provider, and a witness who is often another team member, such as a nurse or medical assistant.

Since the informed consent form does not include the content of the consent discussion, it is imperative that providers document in the patient's chart that informed consent was obtained, and that it describes the pertinent components of the associated discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives prior to signing the form. If there were follow-up questions or discussions, it is also important to document the content of those.

Best Practice Recommendation #8: It is strongly recommended to document the content of informed consent discussion in the patient's medical records, including questions the patient asked and the patient's understanding of the procedure risks, benefits, and alternatives.

### Reproductive and developmental hazard management [^e7db5241]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Reproductive and developmental hazard management — legal protections and employer duties outline Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) eligibility and leave, clinician documentation expectations, and Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act obligations, alongside state law overlays and civil remedies. FMLA covers private sector employers with at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius, and employees must have worked for the employer for at least 12 months or 1250 hours; covered employers are required to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave during a 12-month period, and a health care provider must attest to the presence of a health condition, with physicians advised to be clear and thorough when completing required forms. The OSH Act imposes an affirmative duty to assure workplace safety, and its General Duty Clause states that the employer should provide "a place of employment… free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm… [and should] assure so far as possible… safe and healthful working conditions." The page notes that nearly every state jurisdiction has state-specific protections and that, in conflicts, the employer is generally held to the higher or more stringent standard. Currently there are few, if any general protections or rights for monetary recovery under US federal law for those planning pregnancy or alleging workplace-related infertility, pregnancy loss, or adverse birth outcomes; however, a duty remains on the part of the employer to reduce workplace exposure to toxic substances, and the civil tort system would typically provide the venue to pursue damages. Additionally, physicians should be aware that "disability" definitions by insurers may not cover removal from work to prevent potential harm from occupational exposures.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^a3d98f47]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Physical examination in rhinitis — For a patient with rhinitis symptoms, a physical exam should be completed that encompasses the upper and lower airway, eyes, ears, and skin to identify comorbid allergic or nonallergic conditions; these may include allergic conjunctivitis, otitis, eustachian tube dysfunction, CRS with and without nasal polyps, asthma, and/or atopic dermatitis. Documentation of normal findings is important prior to prescribing medications that might lead to adverse events. Although specific nasal and oropharyngeal findings may support allergic rhinitis (AR), there are no pathognomonic findings that distinguish allergic versus nonallergic versus infectious rhinitis, and patients who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic at the time of exam may have minimal or no abnormal findings. While conducting a physical exam is recommended by all major rhinitis guidelines to make the diagnosis of AR, the available research evidence is very limited and low quality, with much lower sensitivity and specificity and high interrater variability.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^c08bff96]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion: FMF patients have a shorter diagnostic delay compared to other SAIDs, which could be explained by the familiarity of the disease. Patients with concomitant disease and complications have longer diagnostic delay compared to others. One possible explanation could be that having concomitant diseases may confound physician's decision process. The next step of the project is to create a subset of patients fulfilling the Eurofever classification criteria and further identify and evaluate possible individual-, disease-, and country-level factors associated with diagnostic delay.

### Utilization review in worker's compensation: current status and opportunities for improvement [^fc6e2cb9]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Utilization review in workers' compensation — documentation standards, guideline use, and provider–reviewer communication emphasize that the provider's request is supported by legible, accurate, objective, complete, and concise documentation and demonstrates that the proposed care is reasonable, necessary, and appropriate; requests for concurrent or subsequent treatment must document sufficient evidence of treatment compliance and continued medical necessity including significant objective evidence of functional gains; and appropriateness is determined by comparing the request and the injured worker's supporting documentation to relevant, high-quality, evidence-based guidelines. Any communication between provider and reviewer is conducted in a timely, respectful professional manner with reasonable effort to schedule or accommodate discussion at the provider's convenience, the reviewer should submit a clear specific determination including frequency and duration of care with sufficient medical documentation and explanation of the rationale and must be familiar with required forms, state regulations, and regulatory time frame for UR decisions and applicable guidelines, and telephone skills have a substantial impact on the success of the interaction; while communication is geared to resolving a specific request, it also offers an educational opportunity that can help providers understand what is necessary to obtain a "yes" response and may reduce the need for future provider/reviewer discussions.

### Writing directly to patients, the time is now-but how? [^af7e12e0]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

How would you feel if your hospital specialist and primary care clinician discussed your health in front of you without including you in that conversation, using words you couldn't understand? Historically, secondary care healthcare professionals (HCPs) have written a summary of the outpatient clinic visit to primary care HCPs, describing patients in the third person. In the early 2000s, the National Health Service (NHS) stated that it was the patient's right to be copied into outpatient clinical letters regarding their healthcare, which is now standard practice. Letters copied to patients are often written in medical language; typically containing technical detail, jargon and Latin abbreviations, which may be difficult for patients to understand. For example, 'chronic' is often interpreted by lay people as being particularly severe rather than 'long-lasting', which is the traditional medical interpretation of the word.

The aim of writing directly to patients is to inform, engage and remind patients of the agreed upon care plan. Potential additional benefits of this more inclusive communication approach include improved patient understanding and experience, supported shared decision making, more patient-centred care, better patient–clinician relationships, the potential to reduce complaints due to improved patient understanding and a reduced burden on general practitioners to 'translate' clinic letters for patients. The EULAR and ACR have endorsed a common-language description of the term 'rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs)'; we are not aware of international agreements on how summaries of rheumatology clinic consultations should be communicated with patients. Last year in the UK, existing guidance from 2018 was endorsed by NHS England, advising HCPs to write clinic letters directly to patients and copied to primary care.

### Summary: appropriate use criteria for the use of nuclear medicine in fever of unknown origin [^2bd02d9c]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic work-up of patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO) begins with a thorough history and physical examination, complete blood count with differential, chest x-ray, urinalysis and culture, electrolyte panel, liver enzymes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level. Additional imaging procedures, including nuclear medicine tests, are generally used as second-line procedures, with 18 F-FDG PET and PET/CT assuming increasingly important roles in the diagnostic work-up. The Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American College of Nuclear Medicine convened an autonomous expert work group to comprehensively review the published literature for nuclear imaging in adults and children with FUO and establish appropriate use criteria (AUC). This process was performed in accordance with the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which requires that all referring physicians consult AUC by using a clinical decision support mechanism before ordering advanced diagnostic imaging services. The complete findings and discussions of the work group were published on January 8, 2023, and are available at https://www.snmmi.org/ClinicalPractice/content.aspx?ItemNumber = 15666 The AUC in the final document are intended to assist referring health care providers in appropriate use of nuclear medicine imaging procedures in patients with FUO. The work group noted limitations in the current literature on nuclear medicine imaging for FUO, with the need for well-designed prospective multicenter investigations. Consensus findings from published data and expert opinions were used to create recommendations in common clinical scenarios for adults and children. Included in the complete document is a discussion of inflammation of unknown origin (IUO), a recently described entity. In view of the fact that the criteria for FUO and IUO are similar (except for fever > 38.3°C [100.9°F]) and that the most common etiologies of these 2 entities are similar, it is the expert opinion of the work group that the recommendations for nuclear medicine imaging of FUO are also applicable to IUO. These recommendations are included in the full guidance document. This summary reviews rationale, methodology, and main findings and refers the reader to the complete AUC document.

### The initial reproductive health visit: ACOG committee opinion, number 811 [^fca4cd2a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Management and follow-up in the initial reproductive health visit — health care professionals should address physical findings, diagnosis, and potential treatment options at the completion of the physical examination. Once a treatment plan has been mutually decided upon, the adolescent is encouraged to include the parent or guardian in the management plan, and it is critical to assess what information can and cannot be shared with the parent or guardian. At the conclusion of the visit, the patient, parent or guardian, and obstetrician–gynecologist should discuss the findings and recommendations, any remaining concerns can be addressed, and the parent or guardian can be offered guidance on adolescent development. Follow-up should be individualized and determined by the patient's needs, and adolescents may benefit from close follow-up for questions and support regarding adherence to contraception. Some adolescents will be seen on an annual basis because their needs will change with age; others who need problem-solving care may require closer follow-up; discussing future visit expectations is appropriate. Obstetrician–gynecologists have the opportunity to serve as educators of parents and guardians about reproductive health issues, and resources should be provided for both the adolescent patient and the parent or guardian, if possible, at the conclusion of the visit.

### ACR practice parameter for communication of diagnostic imaging findings [^2e0d2908]. ACR (2025). High credibility.

ACR Practice Parameter — Preliminary reports in diagnostic imaging — When needed, a preliminary report precedes the final report and may be rendered for the purpose of directing immediate patient management or to meet the needs of a particular practice environment, and it very likely will contain limited or incomplete information and should not be expected to contain all the information subsequently found in the final report. Preliminary reports may be communicated in writing, electronically, or verbally, and the method of communication should be documented, and these preliminary communications should be reproduced into a permanent format as soon as practical and appropriately labeled as a preliminary report, distinct from the final report, and archived because clinical decisions may have been based on the preliminary report; the archived preliminary report should contain the name of the person or office that received the report, if applicable, and the date and time that the report was provided. As soon as possible, a significant variation in findings and/or conclusions between the preliminary and final interpretations should be reported in a manner that reasonably ensures receipt by the referring or treating physician/health care provider, particularly when such changes may impact patient care, and documentation of communication of any discrepancy should be incorporated into the final report.

It is important to explain physical findings to the patient and use diagrams, and she will need to be supported in understanding why she was cut, and it is recommended that the care provider explore how and if she would like to discuss her FGM/C with her mother, either with the medical provider present or not. Questions about sexual function may be addressed either at this visit or at follow-up visits over time, and referral for culturally appropriate mental health supports may also be warranted. If there are female siblings, it is recommended that they also have head-to-toe physical examinations, including external genitalia, and physical findings should be documented. It is recommended that a culturally sensitive discussion occur with the mother and father regarding the medical issues associated with FGM/C and that FGM/C performed in the United States or as vacation cutting is illegal, and these discussions should be documented in the patient's chart with the diagnosis of FGM/C included in the patient's past medical history as having occurred before arrival in the United States.

### Canadian Pain Society and Canadian Rheumatology Association recommendations for rational care of persons with fibromyalgia: a summary report [^8f162cf1]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize the development of evidence-based guidelines for the clinical care of persons with fibromyalgia (FM), taking into account advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of FM, new diagnostic criteria, and new treatment options.

Methods

Recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and patient followup were drafted according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, and following review were endorsed by the Canadian Rheumatology Association and the Canadian Pain Society.

Results

FM is a polysymptomatic syndrome presenting a spectrum of severity, with a pivotal symptom of body pain. FM is a positive clinical diagnosis, not a diagnosis of exclusion, and not requiring specialist confirmation. There are no confirmatory laboratory tests, although some investigation may be indicated to exclude other conditions. Ideal care is in the primary care setting, incorporating nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies in a multimodal approach with active patient participation. The treatment objective should be reduction of symptoms, but also improved function using a patient-tailored treatment approach that is symptom-based. Self-management strategies combining good lifestyle habits and fostering a strong locus of control are imperative. Medications afford only modest relief, with doses often lower than suggested, and drug combinations used according to clinical judgment. There is a need for continued reassessment of the risk-benefit ratio for any drug treatment. Outcome should be aimed toward functioning within a normal life pattern and any culture of disablement should be discouraged.

Conclusion

These guidelines should provide the health community with reassurance for the global care of patients with FM with the aim of improving patient outcome by reducing symptoms and maintaining function.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^3597d34e]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Palliative care best practices — advance care planning and documentation emphasize to "Document the discussion and preferences in the chart, and communicate them to all members of the health care team as well as the surrogate," and that "DNR orders that will go with the patient after hospital discharge can be documented on a POLST form." Not all patients or surrogates are ready to entertain advance care planning, even after a potentially life-threatening traumatic event, so "It is wise to assess the patient's readiness to engage in advance care planning and to learn about possible barriers to the conversation." "These conversations are an iterative process, and they may need to be re-addressed later in the course of hospitalization or when the patient's condition changes." "Current procedural terminology (CPT) codes exist for advance care planning." "Become familiar with these codes and the documentation required to support their use."

### Chronic pelvic pain: ACOG practice bulletin, number 218 [^4e081789]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain initial evaluation — A detailed medical history and physical examination, with particular attention to the abdominal and pelvic neuromusculoskeletal examination, are recommended; physical findings that increase the likelihood of neuromusculoskeletal contributors include pelvic floor muscle tenderness and abdominal wall tenderness that reproduce the patient's pain. The most critical portions are a detailed medical, surgical, and gynecologic history and a thorough physical examination, and self-administered screening forms completed before the visit can optimize care; a systematic history should include a detailed chronology of symptoms, a review of previous treatments, and information on pain aggravators and alleviators related to sexual activity, menstruation, physical activity, and urinary and gastrointestinal function. The medical history should include specific chronology, triggers, and treatments of pain; a review of all medical diagnoses, surgical procedures and findings, obstetric details, medications, and allergies; and psychosocial factors, with the success or failure of previous treatment attempts noted. Focusing the physical examination on the abdominal and pelvic neuromusculoskeletal system with inclusion of a visceral examination is stated to address most etiologies and is highly likely to yield an accurate diagnosis; evaluation should include palpation of the lower back, sacroiliac joints, pubic symphysis, as well as the abdomen and genitalia.

Informed consent for interventional pain treatment during COVID-19 is emphasized; "As interventional pain practices re-open, there is an ethical imperative to inform patients of the risks and benefits of pain treatment in the era of COVID-19." The guideline states that "An informed consent form may be helpful which sets forth the risks and benefits of treatment in the context of COVID-19 in plain, patient-friendly language," and that "An informed consent form (Appendix Table 1) improves documentation, educates, outlines the key talking points that should be discussed and understood by the patient, and reduces the risk."

### AIUM practice parameter for documentation of an ultrasound examination [^95c4fd53]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2020). High credibility.

AIUM ultrasound documentation — general requirements state that accurate and complete documentation and communication by all members of the diagnostic ultrasound health care team are essential for high-quality patient care, and there must be a permanent record of the ultrasound examination and its interpretation. Images of all relevant areas should be recorded and stored in a retrievable format (electronic preferred), retention of the ultrasound images and report should be consistent both with clinical needs and with relevant legal and local health care facility requirements, and communication between the interpreting provider and the referring provider should be clear, timely, and in a manner that minimizes potential errors. In cases where the referring/ordering, performing, and interpreting physician are the same person this should be documented, and all communication should be performed in a manner that respects patient confidentiality and complies with relevant regulations. Readers are urged to refer to applicable practice parameters for examination-specific documentation requirements, and use of ultrasound without generating a separate report is not addressed in this document.

### Guidelines for monitoring and management of pediatric patients before, during, and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures [^2b5bf43a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric sedation — presedation documentation and prescriptions — presedation records include vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, room air oxygen saturation, temperature), a physical examination with focused airway evaluation and physical status evaluation (ASA classification), and contact information for the child/parent/caregiver. For hospitalized patients, the current hospital record may suffice, but a note shall be written documenting review, positive findings, and a management plan; if clinical or emergency conditions preclude complete information before sedation, this health evaluation should be obtained as soon as feasible. When prescriptions are used for sedation, a copy or note describing the content should be in the patient's chart with the given instructions; prescription medications intended to accomplish procedural sedation must not be administered without the safety net of direct supervision by trained medical/dental personnel, and administering sedating medications at home poses an unacceptable risk, particularly for infants and preschool-aged children, because deaths as a result of this practice have been reported.

### Do surgeons and patients discuss what they document on consent forms? [^f8a519f2]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies of surgeon behavior report that surgeons rarely meet basic standards of informed consent, raising concerns that current practice requires urgent remediation. We wondered if the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System's recent implementation of standardized, procedure-specific consent forms might produce a better practice of informed consent than has been reported previously. Our goal was to determine how the discussions shared between surgeons and patients correspond to the VA's standardized consent forms.

Methods

We enrolled a prospective cohort of patients presenting for possible cholecystectomy or inguinal herniorrhaphy and the surgical providers for those patients. Audio recordings captured the clinical encounter(s) culminating in a decision to have surgery. Each patient's informed consent was documented using a standardized, computer-generated form. We abstracted and compared the information documented with the information discussed.

Results

Of 75 consecutively enrolled patients, 37 eventually decided to have surgery and signed the standardized consent form. Patients and providers discussed 37% (95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.67) and 33% (95% confidence interval, 0.21–0.43) of the information found on the cholecystectomy and herniorrhaphy consent forms, respectively. However, the patient-provider discussions frequently included relevant details nowhere documented on the standardized forms, culminating in discussions that included a median 27.5 information items for cholecystectomy and 20 items for herniorrhaphy. Fully, 80% of cholecystectomy discussions and 76% of herniorrhaphy discussions mentioned at least one risk, benefit or alternative, indication for, and description of the procedure.

Conclusions

The patients and providers observed here collaborated in a detailed process of informed consent that challenges the initial reports suggesting the need to remediate surgeon's practice of informed consent. However, because the discrepancy between the information documented and discussed exposes legal and ethical liability, there is an opportunity to improve the iMed system so that it better reflects what surgeons discuss and more frequently includes all the information patients need.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^e2d44f21]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Best Practices Guidelines for Trauma Center Recognition: Documentation — complete, accurate, and unbiased documentation by all health professionals is critical for optimal care and legal proceedings, and thorough, accurate and unbiased documentation of history elements, source, context, language, physical exam findings, and medical decision making is essential; because depositions and courtroom trials occur months to years after the encounter and the health professional's memory is not a valid source of evidence, a detailed and complete record is essential to adjudicate abuse in court. Document the source of the history obtained, including child abuse (parents, babysitter, EMS, health professional), elder abuse (patient, caregiver, EMS, health professional), and intimate partner violence (patient, companion). Document in detail the patient's history in the patient's own words, avoid biased words such as "claims" or "alleged," use words such as "patient states" or "patient reports," and document in detail all physical findings including the size, color, or odor of any injuries/lesions and include, if possible, body diagram, and photographs. Do NOT "cut and paste" medical history from prior records during documentation because errors in this information create questionable credibility of your own history, and use a hospital credentialed interpreter to obtain the history when not fluent in the language of the patient or historian to ensure that the history will be valid in a court of law. Details related to the mechanism of injury and circumstances around the injury are essential to understand if the injury sustained is consistent with the stated mechanism, and when intimate partner violence (IPV) or elder mistreatment is discovered through routine screening or is suspected based on the initial presentation, ask the patient very specific questions to help guide the ED head-to-toe examination.

### The initial reproductive health visit: ACOG committee opinion, number 811 [^d089e711]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Initial reproductive health visit — adolescent counseling, examination, and parental involvement emphasize that during the initial consultation with the patient and parent or guardian, the obstetrician–gynecologist should inform them that the visit usually does not require an internal pelvic examination unless indicated by symptoms and that cervical cancer screening begins at postadolescence; all adolescents should have the opportunity to discuss health issues one-on-one; before completing an examination, the obstetrician–gynecologist should counsel about what to expect, identify concerns, and ask about comfort, and in some cases a physical examination might be performed at a separate visit; at completion, the health care professional should address physical findings, diagnosis, and potential treatment options, and once a treatment plan has been mutually decided upon, the adolescent is encouraged to include the parent or guardian; if a gynecologist is uncomfortable providing reproductive health care and contraception to adolescents, the professional should refer the patient and obstetrician–gynecologists have the duty to refer patients in a timely manner to other health care professionals if they do not feel that they can provide the standard reproductive services that their patients request.

### AAN position statement: the COVID-19 pandemic and the ethical duties of the neurologist [^e4f209fa]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Telehealth, chronic neurologic disease, and goals of care — appointments should ordinarily be held via telehealth, an evidence-based practice that has already become part of regular ongoing patient care. Telehealth can be particularly problematic for neurologists, as it limits the physical examination, and behavioral health evaluations and family dynamics can be more difficult to discuss with such technology. The document states that routine diagnostic EEGs, EMGs, and sleep studies will likely need to be delayed, and some brain imaging might be safely postponed. Clinicians should discuss with their patients the risks of delaying diagnostic studies and the limitations of telehealth, and each clinician should decide, in concert with his or her patient, if an in-person evaluation warrants the risk of an encounter. The text notes that some patients may still gravitate toward in-person visits while others may find telehealth interactions expeditious and prefer them, and that the risk–benefit analysis will change as the stage of the pandemic evolves.

### ACOEM OEM core competencies: 2021 [^bd493c4b]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

OEM related law and regulations — OEM physicians should have the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and apply the regulations applicable to occupational and environmental health, and core knowledge includes to understand and apply applicable regulations to employers, employees, and patients, including OSHA standards and regulations, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), DOT and other federal regulations regarding fitness for duty in safety-sensitive positions, federal and state drug testing regulations, and drug-free workplace programs. They should understand and protect patients' legal rights to confidentiality of medical records information, maintain complete, timely, and legible records, report cases of occupational injury, illness, and/or death according to existing regulations, balance ethical principles that apply to population health against the wishes of an affected patient, respond appropriately to impairment in self and other health care professionals, and appropriately implement and explain consensus standards applicable to specific groups of employees. Additional knowledge and skills include to comply with and explain applicable regulations such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), ADA Amendment Act (ADAAA), Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), environmental health and safety regulations, and rules related to jurisdictions in which OEM work is done; to respond in compliance with employee/community right-to-know regulations and advise on rights to access information; to provide medical-legal reports and expert opinions and testimony on OEM issues; and to participate in the rule-making process by sharing OEM expertise with decision makers.

### Quality of consent form completion in orthopaedics: are we just going through the motions? [^56e8c308]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

Consent plays a vital role in every aspect of medicine and surgery, facilitating the patient in making informed decisions about their treatment. The recently published Reference Guide to Consent, by the Department of Health (DH), notes that, although not a legal requirement, the completion of consent forms is good practice, particularly in interventions such as surgery. In addition, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman noted that a significant number of complaints about consent involved the complainant feeling that they did not fully understand what was going to happen. It was often found that there was no documentation to clarify what the patient was told, when and by whom. We have performed an audit of 71 randomly selected consent forms, elective and trauma cases within our district general hospital orthopaedics department. Our data demonstrate that a significant number of consent forms were incorrectly or insufficiently completed. This could not only leave the patient confused about their procedure but also leaves the doctor open to litigation, with little in the way of documentation support. Minor changes in consenting methods and more precise documentation could significantly improve patient experience and satisfaction.

### How China anesthesiologists document and communicate difficult airway management [^de6674c6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The literature and guidelines indicate that healthcare professionals involved in airway management can use information regarding patients' previous difficult airway management as a direct reference. Furthermore, documenting and informing patients about difficult airway information is a relatively inexpensive initiative with the greatest potential benefit for patients' safety. An unexpected difficult airway with management recommendations was published by the Canadian Airway Focus Group (CAFG) in 1998. In accordance with the recommendations of this taskforce, a note detailing the difficulties encountered and how they were addressed should be written, and the anesthesiologist should provide this information to the patient in a letter. Also, a report detailing the difficult airway should be sent to the primary care/family physician. As part of the taskforce, corresponding sample letters for patients and physicians were published. It may also be considered to register the patient's information with a reliable database such as Medic-Alert. According to updated guidelines published in 2003 by the ASA Difficult Airway Taskforce, information about difficult airways is an important predictor of recurrence and can provide useful information for managing difficult airways in the future. It is important to document the type of difficulty airway (difficult mask ventilation/laryngeal mask placement/intubation) and how it was handled, while communicating this to the patient should describe the occurrence, cause, and possible complications. As noted in the guideline, the notification systems should include a written report or letter to the patient, a written report in the medical chart, communication with the patient's surgeon or primary caregiver, as well as a notification bracelet, or equivalent identifying device. In the same year, Barron proposed an Airway Alert template that included a checklist for anesthesiologists to follow in completing the written notification. The alert template was checked to ensure that it was given to the patient, the surgeon, and stored in the medical record and database of the anesthesiology department. The checklist makes the notification more procedural and rigorous. The Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) published a study in 2010 proposing a standardized written notification template that was electronically available in local hospitals. It was noted that postoperative verbal information was insufficient, and timing of postoperative information should be considered. In 2013, the CAFG advocated a multi-layered strategy adapted to the local system when a difficult airway had been encountered, including, at the very least, (1) clear and unambiguous documentation in the patient's medical record, (2) informing the patient and the surgeon personally, and (3) writing a difficult airway letter and giving it to the patient, along with copies to the chart and primary care provider. Aside from this, it advocates the inclusion of cases in local or national databases, as well as providing a sample template for difficult airway alert letter. The letter combines the sample letter for patients and the sample letter for physicians issued in 1998 into one, thereby ensuring that the notification is the same for the patient as well as for the primary care or family physician, resulting in more efficient documentation and notification. Similarly, the DAS issued guidelines in 2015 emphasizing the importance of informing and documenting, noting that communication of difficult airway information is inadequate and recommending completion of the airway alert form(developed by F. A. Barron in 2003). The All India Difficult Airway Association(AIDAA) proposed in 2016 a standard locally difficult airway alert form, and emphasizes that anesthesiologists should inform patients and their surrogates that the form contains information concerning the difficulties encountered during the patient's recent anesthesia and that this information may be helpful in the future to the doctor treating the patient. It is important to provide the patient with instructions to maintain the form carefully and to show it to any future doctors treating them as well as the anesthesiologists if surgical procedures are required. Based on previous efforts, the ASA released guidelines in 2022 recommending that the anesthesiologist instruct the patient to register with an emergency notification service.

### ACR-SIR-SPR practice parameter on informed consent for image-guided procedures [^f6374115]. SIR (2021). High credibility.

ACR–SIR–SPR practice parameter — Legal standards and documentation for informed consent describes that the degree of disclosure for valid consent varies, with "2 generally recognized legal standards," the first based on what "a reasonable physician or nonphysician provider in their professional judgment believes is appropriate to disclose to the patient" and the second "based on what a reasonable patient would want to know in the same or similar circumstances." It states that "Informed consent is a process of ongoing dialogue/discussion and is not the simple act of signing a formal document," that written consent "may reasonably be withdrawn at any time," and that "Consent must be documented in the medical record," typically by signed consent forms; a provider note is "another acceptable method of documentation" but "is less defensible from a legal standpoint," and documentation "must follow institutional policies and procedures and comply with applicable state law."

### ACR practice parameter for performing and interpreting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [^4f2584e7]. ACR (2022). High credibility.

Specifications of the examination — order content and image labeling indicate that the examination should be performed within parameters currently approved by the FDA, and examinations that use techniques not approved by the FDA may be considered when they are judged to be medically appropriate. The written or electronic request for a MRI examination should provide sufficient information to demonstrate the medical necessity of the examination and allow for its proper performance and interpretation, and documentation that satisfies medical necessity includes 1) signs and symptoms and/or 2) relevant history (including known diagnoses), with additional information regarding the specific reason for the examination or a provisional diagnosis noted as potentially helpful. The request for the examination must be originated by a physician or other appropriately licensed health care provider, and the accompanying clinical information should be provided by a physician or other appropriately licensed health care provider familiar with the patient's clinical problem or question and consistent with the state scope of practice requirements. Images should be labeled with patient and facility identifiers, examination date, and image orientation using unambiguous polarity symbols (eg, R, L, A, P, H, F); study description, sequence name, parameters, image number, field-of-view (FOV) and slice thickness are recommended.

### AAGBI: consent for anaesthesia 2017: Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland [^7e9c25d3]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Documentation

As in previous versions of this guidance, the Working Party's view continues to be that a signed consent form is not necessary for anaesthetic procedures that are done to facilitate another treatment, since it is the process of consent itself that is important; a signed form is evidence that a consent process has been undertaken but does nothing to validate or invalidate the consent. Furthermore, the anaesthetic can be considered a component of another treatment (e.g. anaesthesia for surgery) or as part of a larger and inter‐related process (e.g. epidural pain relief for childbirth), rather than a treatment in itself (see FAQs, Appendix 2, Supporting Information).

Whether consent is oral or written, it is essential for anaesthetists to document clearly both a patient's agreement to the intervention and the discussions that led up to that agreement, including the patient's questions and the responses given. This can be done on a standard consent form, on the anaesthetic record or separately in the patient's notes. Anaesthetic departments may wish to design anaesthetic records to document the discussions and agreement to specific modes of anaesthesia and interventions. A proforma may be useful – but as a guide to the conversation, not as a checklist to be ticked off without recording further detail. Documentation is particularly important where a patient wishes to reverse a previously documented decision, or circumstances when the patient's decision goes against the anaesthetist's advice, for example if a patient wishes to convert to general anaesthesia during apparently effective regional anaesthesia, or alternatively to continue with regional anaesthesia despite suboptimal anaesthesia in the view of the anaesthetist.

Sometimes, the anaesthetic procedure is the primary therapeutic intervention. Examples include invasive procedures for the treatment of chronic pain, epidural blood patch for the treatment of post‐dural puncture headache or placement of a central line for chemotherapy or parenteral nutrition. In these circumstances, and especially when the procedure is carried out in the operating theatre complex, many Trusts insist that a DoH consent form be completed and signed by the patient as evidence that consent has been given, and the Working Party's advice is that local procedures should be followed. For a course of treatment (e.g. repeated nerve blocks), consent to continue should be confirmed before each individual component, with any changes to the risks, benefits or alternatives discussed fully 28.

### Patient assessment form for septorhinoplasty [^01730af4]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Septorhinoplasty is one of the most sophisticated operations in aesthetic surgery. Surgical evolution and skill are mainly gained by close follow-up of patients, which can be achieved by physical examination, photographing, and meticulous recording obtained before and after operation. On the contrary to some previous forms reported for this aim, we hereby developed a novel form of only 1 document that is simple in design and practical to apply. We think that preoperative and post records of patients can more safely be obtained by means of our personal form. More optimal and scientific studies based on these filled forms can be performed prospectively and retrospectively. We also believe that this form can present a standard for the assessment of septorhinoplasty patients in researches, publications, and presentations, if it would generally be approved by aesthetic surgeons.

### Defining documentation requirements for coding quality care in workers' compensation [^faa23213]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

An improved system for better outcomes and lower costs — workers' compensation documentation needs include knowledge of workplace factors, focus on minimizing avoidable work disability, analysis of activity tolerance and functionality, evidence-based medicine considerations in diagnosis, treatment, and disability determinations with some jurisdictions requiring such reference, reports completed for regulatory reporting requirements, and specialized OEM knowledge for specific cases (for example, causation analysis, analysis of activities and functionality, ergonomics, as well as more arena areas such as toxicology and epidemiology). Other factors counted in current payment systems are not relevant and could be eliminated; in particular, history and physical examination of irrelevant body parts and systems should not be encouraged, health status of near relatives is often not relevant, and inquiries about hereditary diseases may be prohibited by law. Injured workers themselves are likely to benefit from a coding system that encourages functional assessments and attention to other indicators of delayed recovery.

### Guidance for pediatric end-of-life care [^7d1ccb7e]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Code status documentation and POLST/MOLST — code status documentation includes a written medical order that delineates whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or intubation should be initiated in the event of pulselessness or absence of spontaneous respirations, with medical record documentation of the discussion; nomenclature includes Do Not Resuscitate, Do Not Attempt Resuscitation, Allow Natural Death, and Do Not Intubate. Most states have adopted physician or medical order for life-sustaining treatment (POLST or MOLST) forms, which were created to provide a more encompassing medical order and portability across settings; the form remains with the patient and alters the need to reexecute orders across multiple health care settings, though wishes should be reaffirmed when the patient presents in a new medical setting. Forms vary by state in content and application, especially to patients younger than 18 years, and may be revised or revoked by the medical decision maker.

### The psychiatric inpatient physical health assessment sheet (PIPHAS): a useful tool to improve the speed, efficiency, and documentation of physical examination in new psychiatric inpatients [^e0c55c82]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Strategy

PDSA cycle 1 (pre-intervention): Involved obtaining qualitative data from colleagues to identify if further information needed to be added to the PIPHAS form, whether or not it used a logical structure, whether or not any information requested was not necessary, and also people's overall perceptions of the form. Poor feedback rates were obtained, but the feedback received suggested sensible amendments. The PIPHAS form was amended; a blood test and ECG section was added. The form was re-structured and aesthetics altered to make it a more easy to use structure.

PDSA cycle 2 (mid-intervention): Involved obtaining quantitative data to see if it was able to be used easily in clinical practice, testing out the PIPHAS form by using it for five of the next inpatient admission clerkings. This was done in an anonymous fashion, and it was not uploaded into the patients medical records. For patients with no significant abnormalities on examination, it was surprising how long it took to complete the PIPHAS form, so changes were implemented. The PIPHAS form was amended, adding in a series of "negative" examination findings (allowing a quicker and easier way of documenting a normal examination, but allowing it to be documented in a thorough way) rather than simply writing "N. A.D" (nothing abnormal detected). For example, in the respiratory examination domain "chest clear" or "equal air entry" were added as a series of tick-boxes. All five of these patients received an examination and phlebotomy on admission along with a thorough examination, and this was documented in its' entirety as per trust guidance. However, this initial data could be skewed due to the authors completing the PIPHAS form that they were already familiar with.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^ccd7145f]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Best Practices Guidelines for Trauma Center Recognition: Documentation — pediatric abuse evaluations emphasize complete, recorded examinations; "documentation of a genital exam is recorded in only 50–60% of suspected PCA patients," so clinicians are directed to "Ensure that every potentially abused patient has a comprehensive physical examination that is documented," with pediatric elements including "Complete neurologic examination ("sleeping calmly" is not acceptable)," "A complete disrobed skin examination (including the back, ears, and scalp) with a detailed description of bruising (location, pattern, size, colors, and distribution if multiple) or lack of bruising if it is not seen," "Description of cutaneous lesions (including location, size, and color)," "A detailed perineal examination detailing the presence of perianal lesions or injuries to the genitalia," "Growth parameters (height, weight, head circumference)," and "Fundoscopic examination (ideally by an ophthalmologist – see page 25 Eye Findings in Abusive Head Trauma)." The page further advises correct orientation when describing sidedness: "Pay particular attention when describing left- or right-sided injuries, ensuring that all references are oriented to the patient's left and right," noting that "Discrepancies in documentation of injury sidedness raise questions about the reliability of the health professional's documentation."

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^11f7e538]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The Expert Panel offers the following suggestions on how to use Ftesting to monitor asthma:
Individuals for whom Ftesting may be useful to monitor asthma include the following: Individuals aged 5 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma who are currently taking an ICS or an ICS with a LABA, montelukast, or omalizumab Individuals whose symptoms indicate that they might require additional anti-inflammatory therapy Individuals with atopy, especially children Individuals with asthma being treated by providers who agree that frequent (every 2–3 months) assessments of asthma control over the course of a year are warranted
Flevels must be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical data. Current evidence suggests that Fcan prevent exacerbations only when testing is used frequently (eg, every 2–3 months). Cutoff points for adjusting therapy to reduce the risk of exacerbation have not been established.
The Expert Panel does not recommend using Ftesting to assess adherence to treatment (mostly for ICSs) because the strength of this evidence is low. Moreover, although Flevels were associated with adherence to ICSs as measured by electronic or dose counters in two observational studies, and one RCTin 1035 children and adolescents, no studies have evaluated Fmonitoring to assess adherence in adults.
Flevels are not well correlated with other asthma outcomes (eg, symptoms or control measured by such tools as the Asthma Control Test [ACT] or the Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ], prior or subsequent exacerbations, or exacerbation severity; see Recommendation 3). Therefore, clinicians should not use Fmeasurement as a substitute for these measures or in isolation. Rather, Ftesting is best used as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessments.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: The Expert Panel suggests that clinicians consider conveying the following information to their patients with asthma as part of shared decision making: Fmeasurement is safe for almost everyone. F-based asthma monitoring and management strategies are associated with significant reductions in exacerbation frequency, but not with improvements in control (based on ACT or ACQ results) or on quality-of-life measures. To undergo Ftesting, individuals with asthma might need to be referred to a specialty clinic. Fmeasurements are used in addition to other evaluations of asthma control, such as lung function testing, symptom assessments, and questions about medication adherence. Flevels may be affected by multiple conditions in addition to asthma.

The first two sections of the FMLA form are generally for the employer and employee to complete. The third section is for the physician or other health care provider to complete, and it is usually divided into two parts. "Was medication other than over-the-counter medication prescribed. " Simply answer "yes" or "no. " You do not need to list medication names. "Was the patient referred to other health care providers for evaluation and treatment. If so, state the nature of such treatments and expected duration of treatment. " If "yes, " simply state "Cardiologist for ongoing care, " "Physical therapist for 6–8 weeks of physical therapy, "Psychologist for weekly counseling, " etc. "Describe the relevant facts, if any, related to the condition for which the employee seeks leave. " The FMLA form usually allows adequate space to explain the medical condition, including symptoms, diagnosis, ongoing treatment, or use of specialized equipment.

You can be concise in your explanation of the condition or, if needed, provide more detail as to how the medical condition affects the employee's ability to perform job duties. If the employer requires more information, additional language can be added, as in the following examples: Determine specific dates in consultation with the patient. You can make modifications or add extensions at a later time if the duration exceeds the predetermined amount of time. For example, if a patient asks for eight weeks of FMLA leave to get help for depression, that may very well be the appropriate amount of time to start a medication and find a mental health provider or participate in an intensive out-patient program. Can I complete the form during an office visit. Yes.

Requiring an office visit for first-time completion of an FMLA form allows you to review each question with the patient and make decisions together regarding the amount of leave needed. Otherwise, you may spend several minutes to several hours messaging back and forth with a patient to determine answers to multiple questions. Form completion may occur during part of a regularly scheduled visit, if time allows, or during a separate visit for the paperwork. You can bill for the visit with the reason for the visit being the diagnosis for which FMLA leave is being requested. The billing code can be based on either time or complexity of the medical decision making.
