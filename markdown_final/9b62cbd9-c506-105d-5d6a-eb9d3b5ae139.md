## Question

What is the ICD-10 code for xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10 code for xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the request is for the etiologic code for vitamin A deficiency versus the ocular manifestation code for xerophthalmia. Then, I should verify the exact ICD-10-CM code ranges for vitamin A deficiency and confirm which subcategory specifically denotes xerophthalmia. Next, I will check whether laterality or a seventh character is required and, if so, how to apply it. Finally, I will consider whether to code the underlying cause first and whether any additional ophthalmic codes are needed, and I will double-check that the code I select aligns with authoritative sources and coding conventions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities. Xerophthalmia is the ocular surface disease caused by vitamin A deficiency, so the etiologic diagnosis is vitamin A deficiency and the manifestation is xerophthalmia; in ICD-10-CM, we typically code the underlying cause first when it is known, which means vitamin A deficiency should be listed before the ocular manifestation, even though the user is specifically asking for the xerophthalmia code itself [^ccf9d77a].

> Now, I need to verify the exact ICD-10-CM code for vitamin A deficiency. Wait, let me verify the range. Multiple authoritative sources consistently map vitamin A deficiency to codes E50 through E50.9, with E50.9 being the unspecified subcategory; importantly, within the E50 block, there is a specific subcategory for xerophthalmia, which is E50.7, so the most precise code for xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency is E50.7 [^cd799048].

> Hold on, I should verify whether laterality or a seventh character is required for E50.7. Let me check the coding conventions for nutritional deficiencies. Unlike many ophthalmic diagnoses, the E50 series does not require a seventh character or laterality specification, so E50.7 stands as is without additional digits, which simplifies coding in this case [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the clinical note also documents specific ocular findings such as corneal xerosis, Bitot spots, or keratomalacia? Should I add an ophthalmic code too? I should confirm that ICD-10-CM allows coding of the manifestation in addition to the etiology. Yes, when clinically relevant, it is appropriate to add the ocular diagnosis code alongside E50.7 to capture the anatomic site and severity; for example, corneal xerosis could be coded with H16.22- (keratoconjunctivitis sicca, not specified as Sjögren) with the appropriate laterality and seventh character, while remembering that the etiologic code E50.7 should be sequenced first when the deficiency is the underlying cause [^cd799048] [^ccf9d77a].

> I should double-check that I'm not conflating dry eye disease coding with vitamin A deficiency. Initially, I wondered if H04.12- (dry eye, lacrimal gland) might apply, but wait, that's not correct for xerophthalmia from vitamin A deficiency; H04.12- pertains to lacrimal gland dysfunction and does not capture the corneal-conjunctival surface disease of xerophthalmia, so using E50.7 for the etiology and, if needed, an ocular surface code like H16.22- for the manifestation is the right approach rather than H04.12- [^cd799048].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency is E50.7, and it does not require a seventh character or laterality extension [^notfound].

The ICD-10 code for xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency is **E50.7** (xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency). This code should be used when xerophthalmia is directly attributable to vitamin A deficiency, and it is the most specific ICD-10 code for this condition. If additional detail is needed, you can specify the ocular manifestation (e.g. night blindness, Bitot's spots, corneal xerosis) using the appropriate subcodes within E50, but E50.7 is the primary code for xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency.

## ICD-10 code for xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency

The ICD-10 code for xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency is **E50.7**. This code specifically denotes xerophthalmia resulting from vitamin A deficiency and is part of the E50 category, which covers vitamin A deficiency and its ocular manifestations.

---

## Clinical manifestations of xerophthalmia

Xerophthalmia presents with a range of ocular findings that reflect progressive vitamin A deficiency. The **WHO classification** includes:

- **Night blindness (XN)**: Earliest symptom, impaired dark adaptation.
- **Conjunctival xerosis (X1A)**: Dryness of the conjunctiva.
- **Bitot's spots (X1B)**: Foamy, triangular lesions on the conjunctiva.
- **Corneal xerosis (X2)**: Dryness and clouding of the cornea.
- **Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia (X3A/X3B)**: Severe corneal damage, potentially leading to blindness.
- **Corneal scars (XS)**: Sequelae of advanced disease.

These manifestations are directly linked to vitamin A deficiency and are captured under the E50.7 code when clinically documented.

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical documentation

Accurate coding relies on clear clinical documentation. Diagnosis is based on:

- **Clinical signs**: Night blindness, conjunctival xerosis, Bitot's spots, corneal xerosis, or keratomalacia.
- **Serum retinol levels**: Low serum retinol (< 0.70 µmol/L) supports the diagnosis.
- **Dietary history**: Restricted intake or malabsorption increases suspicion.

Documentation should explicitly state "xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency" to support **E50.7** coding.

---

## Treatment and management

Management focuses on correcting vitamin A deficiency and preventing complications:

- **Vitamin A supplementation**: High-dose oral or intramuscular vitamin A per WHO protocols.
- **Dietary modification**: Increase intake of vitamin A-rich foods or fortified products.
- **Ocular care**: Lubrication, antibiotics for secondary infection, and surgical intervention for advanced corneal disease.

Prompt treatment can reverse early disease and prevent blindness [^1170474a].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Xerophthalmia is most prevalent in **developing countries** with limited access to vitamin A–rich foods and healthcare. Risk factors include:

- **Dietary deficiency**: Low intake of animal products, fruits, and vegetables.
- **Malabsorption**: Conditions like celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, or bariatric surgery.
- **Chronic illness**: Liver disease, renal failure, or malignancy.
- **Socioeconomic factors**: Poverty, food insecurity, and limited healthcare access.

---

## ICD-10 coding guidelines and documentation requirements

When coding xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency, clinicians should:

- **Use E50.7**: Primary diagnosis code for xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency.
- **Document specificity**: Record clinical signs (e.g. night blindness, Bitot's spots, corneal xerosis) to support the diagnosis.
- **Code additional manifestations**: Use subcodes within E50 for specific ocular findings (e.g. E50.0 for night blindness, E50.1 for conjunctival xerosis, E50.2 for Bitot's spots, E50.3 for corneal xerosis, E50.4 for corneal ulceration/keratomalacia).

---

## Potential complications of untreated xerophthalmia

Untreated xerophthalmia can lead to **severe complications**, including:

- **Corneal scarring and blindness**: Permanent vision loss from advanced corneal disease.
- **Secondary infections**: Bacterial keratitis and conjunctivitis.
- **Impaired growth and development**: Particularly in children.
- **Increased mortality**: Especially in pediatric populations with severe deficiency.

---

## Preventive strategies

Prevention centers on **public health initiatives** and individual measures:

- **Vitamin A supplementation programs**: Targeted to high-risk populations.
- **Dietary diversification**: Promoting consumption of vitamin A–rich foods.
- **Fortification**: Adding vitamin A to staple foods.
- **Education**: Raising awareness about nutrition and early signs of deficiency.

---

The ICD-10 code for xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency is **E50.7**. Accurate coding and documentation are essential for appropriate management, surveillance, and public health planning.

### Four unique cases of keratopathy from vitamin A deficiency in a tertiary care center in the United States: a case series [^1170474a]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To identify ocular manifestations of vitamin A deficiency in a case series of patients presenting with keratopathy at a tertiary care center of a high-income country, and to highlight clinical features and treatment outcomes.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients diagnosed with xerophthalmia at as single institution between January 1, 2025, and May 31, 2025. Patients were identified using diagnostic codes for xerophthalmia and related ocular surface disease. Inclusion criteria were a clinical diagnosis of xerophthalmia during the study period with documented ocular findings. Data collected included ocular findings, serum vitamin A levels, nutritional history, medical history, treatment, and outcomes. Data were deidentified and analyzed descriptively.

Results

Four patients were found to fit the inclusion criteria. Cases were complicated by malignancy, alcoholism, severe autism, and end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Most cases were late presentations and severe being complicated by corneal perforations caused by sterile stromalysis or superimposed infections. One case was more minor in nature and involved a Bitot spot.

Conclusions

Vitamin A deficiency remains a notable cause of preventable vision loss and keratopathy in high-income countries, especially in certain at-risk populations. Prompt recognition of ocular signs and timely vitamin A repletion can lead to reversal or stabilization of keratopathy; however, at the institution in this study, patients more frequently presented after significant corneal damage had occurred.

### Trachoma and vitamin A deficiency [^b98396de]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Both vitamin A deficiency and trachoma are important causes of preventable ocular diseases. We examined 10 559 children in Mali for clinical signs of trachoma and of xerophthalmia. In five regions, the mean prevalence of trachoma was 39.3% (95% CI: 37.4–41.2). Clinical xerophthalmia was present among 1.89% of children (1.59–2.25). The diagnosis of xerophthalmia appeared to be associated with active trachoma (OR = 2.04 [1.52–2.74]). This association remained after controlling for socio-economic status.

### Xerophthalmia because of dietary-induced vitamin a deficiency in a young Scottish man [^25782000]. Cornea (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin A deficiency causing xerophthalmia, although a major public health issue in sub-Saharan Africa, is rarely seen in people living in developed countries. In such cases, it is usually associated with severe malnutrition caused by intestinal disorders, such as celiac disease, pancreatitis, or extensive bowel surgery. Dietary-induced vitamin A deficiency leading to xerophthalmia has rarely been reported in the United Kingdom. In this case, we report on a young man who presented with corneal xerosis and whose history of corneal ulceration had not been linked to his restricted diet, which resulted in vitamin A deficiency. Unlike other cases, this young man had no history of psychiatric illness and led a normal active lifestyle.

### Association between vitamin deficiencies and ophthalmological conditions [^cfc7b394]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This review summarizes the literature on the main vitamin deficiencies that can cause or exacerbate ophthalmological conditions. Vitamin deficiencies can have many ocular manifestations, including xerosis, encephalopathy, nyctalopia, optic neuropathy, nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia and hemorrhage. Vitamin deficiencies can also exacerbate common eye conditions such as dry eye disease, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. By describing the function, epidemiology, manifestations, workup and management of each vitamin deficiency, the aim of this review is to give clinicians a practical guide to recognizing, assessing and treating the ophthalmological conditions associated with vitamin deficiencies.

### Refocusing vitamin A supplementation programmes to reach the most vulnerable [^77d567d1]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

How can limited resources for VAS programmes be further focused for the biggest impact?

As this and previous analyses have demonstrated, data are often lacking to inform evidence-based programming. High-quality, population-based vitamin A status surveys are needed in many high priority countries. This is important not just to identify populations with VAD to justify VAS programmes, but also to inform and accelerate strategies needed to sustainably increase vitamin A intake so that VAS programmes are no longer needed. This is critical for many countries.

We cannot let coverage remain low or drop further for the countries in need of VAS programmes, especially given the SDG focus on eliminating preventable child mortality. Given the global shift in strategies, there is a need to identify how best to deliver VAS to all children in need two times per year. Furthermore, documentation of new approaches is critical to share knowledge and inform other countries.

This paper focused on identifying where national VAS programmes are needed and are likely to have the biggest impact, given our current knowledge. However, there are additional analyses that need to be undertaken to ensure resources are optimised and that those who will benefit most from VAS programmes are reached. First, an analysis is needed to determine if some parts of the target population should be prioritised, due to vulnerability related to mortality rates or vitamin A intake. It is not possible to target based on clinical signs of xerophthalmia because these are now rare, but we know that there are serious health risks, including elevated mortality associated with subclinical VAD. With the changing global context, there may be value in focusing VAS to a narrow and younger age range than the current 6–59 months, as the mortality data suggest. Second, an assessment of the possible delivery approaches and their costs to reach children, including the most vulnerable, is needed to inform decisions. As was mentioned in the beginning of this paper, a shift in global financing and other factors have resulted in the loss of some delivery platforms. An assessment is needed to determine the most cost-effective ways to reach the target population to ensure efficient use of limited resources.

With the completion of this initial analysis, GAVA partners have committed to looking deeper at how best to support countries in prioritising limited resources in the years ahead. The additional analyses, including age-specific assessments of vitamin A intake and mortality, will require convening additional stakeholders and expertise. Reducing the list of countries prioritised for national VAS programmes is a first step to targeting limited resources and ensuring VAS coverage is maintained where it has the potential to achieve the greatest impact.

### Vitamin A deficiency and xerophthalmia among school-aged children in southeastern Asia [^92b672bf]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine provisional estimates of the extent of vitamin A (VA) deficiency and xerophthalmia among school-aged children.

Design

Literature search of published, unpublished and website-based population survey and study reports, with country-specific imputation of prevalence rates and numbers of children affected by: (1) VA deficiency based on measured or imputed distributions of serum retinol concentration < 0.70 micromol/l (equivalent to < 20 microg/dl) and (2) xerophthalmia, by country.

Setting

Countries within the WHO South-East Asian Region.

Subjects

The target group for estimation was children 5–15 y of age.

Interventions

None.

Results

The estimated prevalence of VA deficiency is 23.4%, suggesting that there are approximately 83 million VA-deficient school-aged children in the region, of whom 10.9% (9 million, at an overall prevalence of 2.6%) have mild xerophthalmia (night blindness or Bitot's spot). Potentially blinding corneal xerophthalmia appears to be negligible at this age.

Conclusions

VA deficiency, including mild xerophthalmia, appears to affect large numbers of school-aged children in South-East Asia. However, nationally representative data on the prevalence, risk factors and health consequences of VA deficiency among school-aged children are lacking within the region and globally, representing a future public health research priority.

### Epidemiology of vitamin A deficiency and xerophthalmia in at-risk populations [^f1e0337f]. Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, xerophthalmia can be caused by blepharitis, allergic conjunctivitis, immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis, systemic sclerosis, hypothyroidism, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus, Graves' disease, lagophthalmos, rosacea, vitamin A deficiency, Sjögren's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, xerophthalmia can be caused by medications such as atenolol, clonazepam, voriconazole, levofloxacin, clonidine, hydromorphone, ketorolac, bupropion, hydromorphone ER, nadolol / bendroflumethiazide, propranolol, ibrutinib, didanosine DR, ixazomib, ketotifen, levomilnacipran ER, methotrexate, lansoprazole DR, eprosartan, dasatinib, ciprofloxacin ER, succinylcholine, arsenic trioxide, propranolol ER, topiramate XR, leuprolide, topiramate, darifenacin ER, bupropion SR, flurbiprofen, divalproex ER, bexarotene, gefitinib, diclofenac sodium, fentanyl ER, enalapril, ciprofloxacin, divalproex DR, cidofovir, ziprasidone, goserelin, imatinib, glatiramer, ibuprofen, triamcinolone acetonide, vecuronium, betaxolol, oxybutynin XL, duloxetine DR, bupropion XL, fentanyl, metoprolol and azithromycin.

### Association between vitamin deficiencies and ophthalmological conditions [^46eaf8c2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Vitamin deficiencies can have adverse effects on health, including on the visual system. The ocular manifestations of a vitamin deficiency are related to the underlying biochemical function of the particular nutrient. While vitamin deficiencies are not common in developed counties, they are still prevalent in parts of the developing world and in specific, vulnerable populations. Vitamin deficiencies can cause or contribute to many ophthalmological conditions and eye diseases may even be the first presenting finding of a vitamin deficiency. As such, it is important for ophthalmologists to be aware of the ocular manifestations of vitamin deficiencies, especially given that the complications can be severe and effectively treated if identified early. This review summarizes the literature on the main vitamins known to have characteristic ocular manifestations: vitamins A, B1, B2, B9, B12, C, D, E and K. The function, epidemiology, manifestations, workup, and management of each vitamin is discussed in detail.

### Revision of visual impairment definitions in the international statistical classification of diseases [^f06aa830]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Implications of the suggested ICD revision

We suggest revision of the ICD classification for visual impairment to reflect the modifications in the definitions suggested above and to indicate combinations of visual impairment in the two eyes of a person that are most commonly used in practical assessments of visual impairment (Table 4). The existing ICD classification includes two combinations of binocular visual impairment that are rarely if ever used (Table 2). First, blindness in one eye and low vision in the other eye (ICD code H54.1) is not needed, as this level and low vision in both eyes (ICD code H54.2) denote the same visual impairment level in the better eye of the person, and are not used separately in practical assessments of visual impairment. Second, unspecified visual loss (H54.7) is also not needed, as unqualified visual loss in both eyes (H54.3) and unqualified visual loss in one eye (H54.6) are already covered.

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^f9695374]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Whilst renaming PA as AIG can add confusion and uncertainty, the name PA has its own shortcomings, which is perhaps why NICE proposed to change it. The term 'pernicious anaemia' suggests that anaemia is a defining characteristic of the disease. However, anaemia is present in only 15–20% of PA diagnoses. Practitioners unfamiliar with PA are commonly misled by the term 'anaemia', as all ICD-10 (D51.0–9) codes for B deficiency incorrectly include the term anaemia. The term 'pernicious' is also an anachronism, predating the 1948 discovery of B as an effective treatment. It was first coined by Anton Biermer in 1871 to describe the fatal anaemia cases seen prior to the discovery of effective treatments. It is important to note that even though anaemia occurs in a minority of PA patients, this represents an important subgroup of patients that requires a different management approach. The current guidelines do not address how to specifically diagnose and manage this subgroup of patients, representing a significant gap in knowledge and warranting further research.

The definition and our understanding of the condition has evolved significantly since Biermer's original description. We now know that PA often presents with predominantly neurological symptoms. Therefore, if a name change is warranted, it should be one that better reflects the current clinical presentation of the disease.

The persistent use of the term 'pernicious anaemia' in both clinical practice (primary, secondary and tertiary care) and state-of-the-art research highlights a disconnect between these guidelines and current clinical practice. It is important to highlight that the adoption of new and more appropriate terminology would require universal acceptance by clinicians, carers and patients who would have lived with the name PA for most of their lives. While changing established medical terminology may take decades — potentially one to two generations of doctors — before it is fully adopted in clinical language, emphasising that such a change, if it were to happen, would be gradual and require effective dissemination.

However, a name change could offer significant advantages by reflecting the current understanding of PA and encouraging clinicians to investigate neurological symptoms associated with PA. This would be achieved through a concerted effort to educate doctors by incorporating this knowledge into the curriculum, which will dispel misconceptions commonly ascribed to PA patients by doctors and promote a deeper understanding of PA's complexity.

### Eplontersen (Wainua) [^0700c488]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Reduced Serum Vitamin A Levels and Recommended Supplementation: Supplement with the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. Refer to an ophthalmologist if ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency occur. (5.1)

5.1 Reduced Serum Vitamin A Levels and Recommended Supplementation

WAINUA treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Supplementation at the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A is advised for patients taking WAINUA. Higher doses than the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A should not be given to try to achieve normal serum vitamin A levels during treatment with WAINUA, as serum vitamin A levels do not reflect the total vitamin A in the body.

Patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist if they develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency (e.g., night blindness, dry eyes).

### Global burden and cross-country inequalities of nutritional deficiencies in adults aged 65 years and older, 1990–2021: population-based study using the GBD 2021 [^d2d51381]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Disease definitions

Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) includes moderate and severe acute malnutrition, commonly referred to as "wasting", and was defined in terms of weight-for-height Z-scores (WHZ) on the World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 growth standard for children. PEM was quantified in four categories: moderate wasting without oedema (WHZ < -2SD to < -3 SD), moderate wasting with oedema (WHZ < -2SD to < -3 SD), severe wasting without oedema (WHZ < -3SD), and severe wasting with oedema (WHZ < -3SD). The GBD team further uses the DisMod-MR 2.1 model to ensure consistent applicability of the assessment across all age groups. For PEM, ICD 10 codes are E40-E46.9, E64.0, and ICD 9 codes are 260–263.9. In the GBD 2021, the non-fatal burden of iodine deficiency includes estimates of only the subset of iodine deficiency associated with visible goitre (grade 2) and its associated sequelae, including thyroid dysfunction, heart failure, and intellectual disability, excluding sub-clinical iodine deficiency or non-visible goitre (grade 1) induced by iodine deficiency. For iodine deficiency, ICD-10 codes are E00-E02 and ICD-9 codes are 244.2. Vitamin A deficiency was defined as the prevalence of serum retinol concentration < 0.7 µmol/L, according to ICD 10 codes E50-E50.9, E64.1, and ICD 9 codes 264–264.9. Dietary iron deficiency is defined as mild, moderate, or severe anaemia that is the result of inadequate dietary intake of iron, but not due to other causes of inadequate absolute or functional iron availability to meet the body's needs. For dietary iron deficiency, ICD 10 codes are D50-D50.9, and ICD 9 codes are 280–280.9.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^a400e9f3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

There was no overall difference in coder efficiency in the 1-year periods before and after ICD-10 implementation (P = 0.76). However, we noted a reduction in coder efficiency during the first 4 months (October 2015 to January 2016) after ICD-10 conversion, which returned to baseline for the remaining 8 months (Figure 2).

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^cd799048]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

Statistical analysis

We stored and analyzed the data using Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011 with the Real Statistics Resource Pack and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Normality of all data distributions were confirmed with the Shapiro–Wilk test. If normality held, we utilized two-tailed Student's t -tests, and we used a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test for variables that did not follow a normal distribution. Data were reported as mean ± standard deviation. We performed the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure on each group of tests, separated by department, to control false discovery rate with a q value of 0.05.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^374ded0d]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye syndrome — classification and symptom severity indicate that more-effective relief of patient symptoms can be achieved if the ophthalmologist can differentiate conditions related to dry eye from other causes, that patients with moderate dry eye syndrome have increased discomfort and frequency of symptoms with a more consistent negative effect on visual function while severe disease may become constant and potentially disabling, and that dry eye syndrome is categorized into aqueous tear deficiency and evaporative or a mixture of the two, which coexist in the majority of patients with the disease.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^953a5a45]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conversion from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM was the largest change to health care coding in America in the last 30 years. While ICD-10 was approved in 1990 and had been utilized in several countries since as early as 1994, its use only became required in the United States on October 1, 2015. The version used in the United States has several significant modifications suggested during an open comment period and via a field test performed by The American Hospital Association and the American Health Information Management Association. ICD-10-CM, as the version is known, added many more codes than the original World Health Organization version used prior to adoption in the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services originally planned to instate ICD-10 on October 1, 2011, but its implementation met resistance. The American Medical Association feared that the costs of implementing ICD-10 would be extreme and could even put smaller practices out of business. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the date to October 1, 2013. Two additional delays led to the final implementation date of October 1, 2015.

Each ICD-10 code has space for seven characters, an increase from the five available in ICD-9. The nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes available in ICD-10 provide a much greater level of detail than the 14,500 codes available in ICD-9, and mapping diagnoses from one to the other is often convoluted and rarely straightforward. Included in the increased details are codes that specify laterality and severity of disease, features that have a substantial effect on coding in ophthalmology. The increased level of detail is projected to lead to an eventual decrease in denied claims. Unfortunately, this decrease in rejected claims is expected to occur after a period of increased rejected claims lasting from 6 months to 3 years as coders adapt to the new system.–The more detailed information available from ICD-10 codes is also predicted to more easily identify fraud and abuse, give insurance companies more accurate information in order to make coverage decisions, and improve public health monitoring and research. Notably a dually coded database in Canada showed no improvement in the validity of coding with ICD-10 compared to ICD-9. However, a Swedish study did show continual improvement in the accuracy of recording conditions using ICD-10 over a 5-year period related to a coding learning curve.

### Impact of seasonal variation in meteorological conditions on dry eye severity [^47b5a9c6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This research relied on two different data sets: 1) national retrospective data from all US veteran affairs (VA) facilities and 2) Miami VA cohort.

US VA retrospective data

We used the national VA database to extract all visits to any VA facility within the continental US between 2010 and 2013. ICD-9 diagnosis codes were then examined, and individuals with a code for DE (375.15) were identified. This DE code encompasses various DE subtypes (evaporative, aqueous deficiency, symptoms only). As the total population at risk, ie, all veterans covered by a VA facility, was unknown, we used routine medical visit code (V70.0) to compute a standardized rate of DE prevalence, ie, the ratio of DE diagnosis to DE diagnosis plus routine medical visits (V70.0).

Miami DE cohort

South Florida residents with normal eyelid and corneal anatomy were recruited from the Miami VA Healthcare eye clinic between January 2014 and December 2016. Inclusion was limited to patients who did not plan to spend significant time away from home before or during the data collection period. Patients were excluded from participation if they had ocular or systemic conditions that could confound DE, including contact lens wear, a history of refractive surgery, use of ocular medications with the exception of artificial tears, an active external ocular process, cataract surgery in the last 6 months, or a history of glaucoma or retinal surgery. Furthermore, individuals with a diagnosis of HIV, sarcoidosis, Sjögren's syndrome, graft-versus-host disease, or collagen vascular disease were excluded. All patients examined in the eye clinic who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were offered participation in the study. Interested patients were scheduled for a study visit in which written informed consent was obtained and DE parameters were measured. The study was approved by the Miami VA Institution Review Board (IRB approval #3011.02). The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and complied with the requirements of the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

### Estimated prevalence and incidence of dry eye disease based on coding analysis of a large, all-age United States health care system [^bd43051e]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess overall prevalence, annual prevalence, and incidence of dry eye disease (DED) in a large, representative population in the United States.

Design

Prevalence and incidence study.

Methods

Retrospective analysis using the Department of Defense (DOD) Military Health System (MHS) data on beneficiary medical claims from United States DOD military and civilian facilities, January 1, 2003 through March 31, 2015.

Patient Population

Using an algorithm, medical diagnostic codes indicative of DED and prescriptions for cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion identified a DED population from 9.7 million MHS beneficiaries (DOD service members, retirees, and dependents, aged 2–80+ years).

Main Outcome Measures

DED overall prevalence (2003–2015), annual prevalence (2005–2012), and annual incidence (2008–2012) stratified by sex, age group, and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Ninth Revision diagnosis code grouping.

Results

DED prevalence was 5.28% overall, 7.78% among female beneficiaries, 2.96% among male beneficiaries and increased with age from 0.20% for ages 2–17 years, to 11.66% for individuals aged 50+ years. Annual prevalence increased from 0.8% to 3.0% overall, from 1.4% to 4.5% in female beneficiaries, and from 0.3% to 1.6% in male beneficiaries. Annual prevalence increased across age groups starting at age 18–39, 0.1%-0.6%, to age 50+, 1.8%-6.0%. Annual incidence increased from 0.6% to 0.9% overall, from 0.8% to 1.2% in female beneficiaries, and from 0.3% to 0.6% in male beneficiaries. Across age groups, annual incidence increased starting at age 18–39 (0.2%-0.3%), to age 50+ (1.0%-1.6%).

Conclusions

DED overall prevalence, annual prevalence, and incidence were found to increase over time for all demographics. These findings highlight the continued importance of research and therapeutic development for this common condition.

### Validation of night blindness reports among children and women in a vitamin A deficient population in rural tanzania [^5fb9686e]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This study validates different definitions of reported night blindness (XN) in a vitamin A deficient African population with no local term for XN.

Design

Case-control study with follow-up after treatment.

Setting

Eight primary schools and health centres in rural Tanzania.

Subjects

A total of 1214 participants were screened for reported XN and other eye signs of xerophthalmia: 461 children aged 24–71 months, 562 primary school-age children and 191 pregnant or breast-feeding women. All 152 cases of reported XN were selected for the validation study and group matched with 321 controls who did not complain of XN. XN reports were validated against serum retinol concentrations and pupillary dark adaptation measurements in cases and controls.

Intervention

All children and women who reported XN or had other signs of active xerophthalmia were treated with vitamin A and followed up 3–4 weeks later. Half of the untreated control group who had their serum retinol examined in the baseline examination were also followed up.

Results

The overall prevalence of reported XN was 12.5%. At baseline, mean pupillary threshold (-1.52 vs -1.55 log cd/m(2), P = 0.501) and median serum retinol concentrations (0.95 vs 0.93 micromol/l, P = 0.734) were not significantly different in cases and controls either overall or in each population group. More restricted case definitions reduced the prevalence of reported XN to 5.5% (P < 0.001), but there was still no significant difference between cases and controls although the results were in the expected direction. After treatment, the median serum retinol concentration improved significantly only in the most deficient group, the young children. Dark adaptation improved in all the subgroups but the difference was only significant for young children and primary school-age children when the restricted case definitions were used.

Conclusions

XN reports are a poor indicator of vitamin A deficiency in this population.

### Vision rehabilitation preferred practice pattern ® [^ebc4f660]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Vision rehabilitation — ICD-10 visual acuity and field impairment categorization is based on a 6-level World Health Organization (WHO) classification from normal to no light perception, and relevant ICD codes take into account both the right and left eye. The six visual acuity thresholds presented are 20/60 or better, 20/61 to 20/200, 20/201 to 20/400, 20/401 to 20/1200, 20/1201 to LP, and NLP; LP is light perception and NLP is no light perception. Visual field impairment can also be used to determine ICD codes, with Category 3 defined as a field no greater than 10 degrees but greater than 5 around central fixation and Category 4 defined as a field no greater than 5 degrees around central fixation. Visual field impairment is assessed based on a Goldmann III size target for Goldman fields, and for Humphrey field testing a point seen with a 10db or higher stimulus is a point that would be seen with a 4e stimulus.

### Dry eye disease ranking among common reasons for seeking eye care in a large US claims database [^98f07cdd]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

Data from the US DOD MHS between January 1, 2003, and March 31, 2015, were used. The MHS database contains comprehensive health-related data, including inpatient and outpatient health care service records, prescription records, and demographic data for > 9.7 million beneficiaries (eg, active and reserve DOD service members, retirees, and their dependents) who obtain medical service through the DOD facilities (direct care) or in selected civilian facilities. This large US database includes > 30 billion archived records, 5 billion online records, and decades of prescription, inpatient, and outpatient data.

Statistical analyses

We estimated the overall prevalence (2003–2015) and annual incidence (2008–2012) of DED and other ocular conditions among MHS beneficiaries. The full methodology of the primary prevalence and incidence evaluation is reported elsewhere. Beneficiaries with DED were identified using an algorithm constructed from selected International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Current Procedural Terminology codes, as well as prescriptions for cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis ®; Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA) (Table 1). Since there is a lack of specific coding for DED, this study used a combination of diagnoses, procedures, and prescription fills to identify patients with DED. This requirement helped to minimize any misclassifications and avoid patients being excluded from the study. Driving indicators for DED (eg, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and conjunctival xerosis) were defined as those where two independent records of the same diagnosis, procedure, or prescription fill were sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of DED. Non-driving indicators for DED (eg, superficial keratoconjunctivitis and punctate keratitis) were defined as those that had to be combined with a driving indicator to confirm the diagnosis of DED. A diagnosis of DED was defined as two medical claims, based on driving indicators alone or as a combination of driving and non-driving indicators.

### Prevalence of pediatric and adult optic neuritis in the United States from 2016 to 2023 [^898932d2]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data used in this study was collected in March 2024 from the TriNetX US Collaborative Network, which provided access to electronic medical records (EMR) (diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory values, genomic information) from approximately 113 million patients, making up about 34% of the US population, from 61 healthcare organizations. TriNetX partners with sites including hospitals, primary care centres, and specialty treatment providers to create an updated and linked research network, with data refreshed every two to four weeks. Patient data in this platform comes from electronic health records and then is aggregated, deidentified and searchable by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD9-10) code. Due to the de-identified nature of the data (per the de-identification standard defined in Section §164.514(a) of the HIPAA Privacy Rule), this study is exempt from ethical approval by the Western Institutional Review Board. The de-identification process is attested by a qualified expert as defined in of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

Patient populations were identified by ICD-10 encounter diagnosis codes. To identify cases of optic neuritis, ICD-10 H46 code was utilized, including the subcodes for retrobulbar neuritis (H46.1), other optic neuritis (H46.8), and unspecified optic neuritis (H46.9). These codes were chosen to most accurately reflect primary optic neuritis not secondary to another cause. The remaining codes under H46 were utilized as exclusion criteria, namely optic papillitis (H 46.0), nutritional optic neuropathy (H46.2), and toxic optic neuropathy (H46.3). The total number of patients with each of the ICD-10 codes utilized in study are reported in Supplementary Table 1. Sub-populations were identified by age, sex, race and ethnicity.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^e325508b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Comorbidities and prescribed medications in patients with or without dry eye disease: a population-based study [^99063675]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the proportion of comorbidities in patients with dry eye disease (DED) compared with matched patients without DED in a comprehensive US population.

Design

Retrospective case-control study.

Methods

Healthcare records for insurance claims data, detailing medical services incurred by military personnel and their families and dependents in military and civilian facilities across the United States from January 1, 2003, to March 31, 2015, were obtained from the Department of Defense (DOD) Military Health System (MHS). Diagnostic and procedural codes related to DED from selected International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) Current Procedural Terminology codes and prescriptions for cyclosporine A ophthalmic emulsion were used to identify patients with newly diagnosed and prevalent DED in the MHS database. Age, sex, and geographically matched patients without DED were also identified from healthcare claims records. Medication use and comorbidities in these patient populations were assessed and compared.

Results

In both the newly diagnosed and prevalent DED samples, the most common comorbidities were hypertension, cataracts, thyroid disease, type 2 diabetes, and glaucoma. All comorbidities were significantly higher in the DED vs non-DED groups (P < .001). Medication use (including, but not limited to, ophthalmic agents and drugs to treat comorbidities) was also significantly higher in the DED than in the non-DED groups (P < .001).

Conclusions

The high proportions of patients with DED with a range of comorbidities and prescribed medications highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of these patients.

### Revision of visual impairment definitions in the international statistical classification of diseases [^440697c5]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Although the revision we suggest for the ICD definitions seems more consistent with current understanding of visual impairment, it is important to recognise how the new estimates of visual impairment with these revised estimates could be compared with past estimates that have used the existing definitions. For this, the following issues would have to be taken into account:

1. Defining visual impairment as presenting visual acuity less than 6/18 in the better eye would increase the number of visually impaired persons in the world to about 259 million, compared with the WHO estimate of 161 million based on the best-corrected acuity definition, an increase of 61%. This increase, indicating the true burden of visual impairment less than 6/18, would vary in magnitude in different regions of the world.

2. Changing the definition of blindness to presenting visual acuity less than 6/60 from best-corrected visual acuity 3/60 would increase the number of blind persons. We have estimated that the number of persons worldwide with presenting visual acuity less than 3/60 in the better eye would be about 42 million, which is 14% more than the 37 million estimated by WHO with best-corrected visual acuity less than 3/60 in the better eye. Data from a few recent population-based studies that reported presenting visual acuity for both the less than 6/60 and less than 3/60 levels, and which enabled these two levels to be compared clearly, suggest that there could be an increase of 34–37% for less developed countries and even higher for more developed countries, in the number of persons with presenting visual acuity less than 6/60 as compared with presenting visual acuity less than 3/60. Based on this, the number of blind persons in the world as defined by presenting visual acuity less than 6/60 in the better eye can be roughly estimated at about 57 million (Table 5).

In addition to the effects on a patient's QoL, there is an economic burden associated with DED. Studies have shown increases in direct costs (eg, health care professional visits, pharmacologic therapies, and surgical procedures),–and indirect costs (eg, loss of work days and loss of work productivity), associated with DED that can impact a patient and the health care system. From a payer's perspective, DED in the United States was associated with an average annual direct cost of management of ≥ 783/patient with DED and an average overall direct cost of ≥ 3.84 billion/year. Annual loss of productivity was estimated to be ≥ 6,160/patient with a definite diagnosis of DED in Japan, and the annual cost of managing DED from a societal perspective was ≥ 11,302/patient in the United States.

### Vision loss and blindness in the United States: an age-adjusted comparison by sex and associated disease category [^11fc1c2a]. Ophthalmology Science (2025). Medium credibility.

While we are confident in the accuracy and reliability of the data entered into the EHR, there are inherent limitations associated with the use of such data. The application of ICD-10 codes for associated disease etiology allowed for the inclusion of precise physician-reported information, reducing reliance on patient-reported data. However, the structure of many EHR systems constrained our ability to fully capture multifactorial vision loss resulting from multiple etiologies. To address this, we assigned vision loss to each etiology separately. Additionally, we had access to multiple objective visual acuity measurements for each patient over the course of 1 year, enabling us to utilize the best recorded visual acuity in the better-seeing eye for classification purposes. This approach facilitated stratification of vision loss according to the World Health Organization classification system. However, it is important to note that some patients may not have undergone refraction or pinhole testing during the year, which could potentially introduce bias into the data. When utilizing this convenience sample model and comparing to the US census after adjusting for age, we found that women have a significantly higher prevalence of carrying a diagnosis of vision loss or blindness in the US. This was true for mild, moderate, and severe vision loss and blindness and was also true across all associated conditions studied except retinal detachment.

### Making the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome in patients with dry eye [^6c6fa151]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Dry eye disease

Dry eye is one of two classic symptoms of SS, the other being dry mouth. While dry eye is a classic diagnostic feature of SS, it is a very common complaint with a wide range of underlying pathologies, thereby making it quite non-specific for SS by itself. The clinical consequences of dry eye include ocular discomfort, visual disturbance, tear film instability, and potential damage to the ocular surface. The symptoms of dry eye are usually accompanied by objective findings such as tear hyperosmolarity and ocular surface inflammation.

The differential diagnosis of ocular SS begins with a determination of the basic nature of the dry eye, namely aqueous-deficient dry eye (ADDE) or evaporative dry eye (EDE).SS falls under the classification of ADDE; therefore, cases of dry eye initially classified as ADDE need to be further investigated as SS dry eye or non-SS dry eye (Figure 1). Steps for this process are described in the following sections, beginning with strategies for establishing and characterizing a broad diagnosis of dry eye, followed by more detailed methods of distinguishing the various sub-types of dry eye, and specific testing to help confirm a diagnosis of SS.

As described earlier, dry eye has been categorized based on pathology into two major classes: ADDE and EDE. ADDE refers primarily to a failure of lacrimal secretion, although a deficit in conjunctival water secretion may also contribute through decreased production of aqueous fluid by accessory lacrimal glands along the conjunctival surface. ADDE, also called keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), occurs in approximately 4% of adults over 65 years of age.EDE is caused by excessive water loss from the ocular surface in patients with normal lacrimal secretion and may be a result of intrinsic (eg, meibomian oil deficiency) or extrinsic (eg, vitamin A deficiency, contact lens wear) factors.

Despite these classifications and definitions, it is not uncommon for an individual patient to have dry eye caused by more than one mechanism, with subsequent triggering of additional dry eye pathology. Thus, many patients with dry eye have a combination of ADDE and EDE.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^14409d67]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Association of hypovitaminosis D with increased risk of uveitis in a large health care claims database [^4e8b897f]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Understanding the role of vitamin D-which regulates inflammatory responses-in noninfectious uveitis (an inflammatory disease) may provide insight into treatment and prevention of this disease.

Objective

To investigate whether there is an association between hypovitaminosis D and incident noninfectious uveitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In a retrospective case-control study, data from a health care claims database containing deidentified medical claims from a large private insurer were used to identify 558 adults enrolled from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2016, who received a diagnosis of noninfectious uveitis from an eye care clinician (with receipt of a confirmatory diagnosis within 120 days of the initial diagnosis) and who had a vitamin D level measured within 1 year before the first diagnosis. Exclusion criteria included having systemic disease or receiving medication known to lower vitamin D levels, having undergone intraocular surgery, and having infectious uveitis. Each case patient was matched with 5 controls on the basis of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and index date (2790 controls). The controls had vitamin D level determined either within 1 year before or within 6 months after receiving an eye examination with normal findings. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between hypovitaminosis D and noninfectious uveitis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary, prespecified analysis assessed the association of noninfectious uveitis with hypovitaminosis D (vitamin D level ≤ 20 ng/mL).

Results

The 558 cases and 2790 controls were matched on age, and each group had a mean (SD) age of 58.9 (14.7) years. Among the cohort of 3348 patients, 2526 (75.4%) were female, and the racial/ethnic distribution in the matched samples was 2022 (60.4%) white, 552 (16.5%) black, 402 (12.0%) Hispanic, 162 (4.8%) Asian, and 210 (6.3%) unknown. Patients with normal vitamin D levels had 21% lower odds of having noninfectious uveitis than patients with low vitamin D levels (odds ratio [OR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62–0.99; P = 0.04). In a race-stratified analysis, an association between vitamin D and uveitis was found in black patients (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30–0.80; P = 0.004) and was qualitatively similar but nonsignificant in white patients (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.62–1.21; P = 0.40) and Hispanic patients (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.33–1.10; P = 0.10).

Conclusions and Relevance

This and other reports have found an association between hypovitaminosis D and noninfectious uveitis. However, these studies cannot establish a causal relationship. Prospective studies are warranted to evaluate whether hypovitaminosis D causes increased risk of uveitis and the role of vitamin D supplementation in prevention and treatment of uveitis.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^e0159918]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM coding — Macular degeneration, dry corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.51 and to ICD-10 CM Nonexudative AMD H35.31-; macular degeneration, wet corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.52 and to ICD-10 CM Exudative AMD H35.32-; macular drusen corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.57 and to ICD-10 CM Drusen (degenerative) of macula H35.36-. AMD does not require laterality indicators. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of ICD-10 CM codes indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available.

### Revision of visual impairment definitions in the international statistical classification of diseases [^c761e9c8]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current categories of visual impairment in ICD are shown in Table 1, and their use to classify different levels of visual impairment is shown in Table 2. We identified three major issues in this ICD classification that need to be addressed: use of best-corrected or presenting visual acuity, cut-off level to define blindness, and appropriateness of the term 'low vision'.

Best-corrected or presenting visual acuity

There is increasing consensus that the use of best-corrected visual acuity to assess the burden of visual impairment in a population is inappropriate as it misses visual impairment caused by uncorrected refractive error. The use of presenting visual acuity, that is acuity with whatever refractive correction the person is using, is more appropriate as it enables uncorrected refractive error to be included as a cause of visual impairment. Our review of the published data suggests that there may be about 98 million persons with visual impairment due to uncorrected refractive error worldwide, in addition to the 161 million persons estimated by WHO to have visual impairment with best-corrected visual acuity. This implies that of the estimated total 259 million persons worldwide with visual impairment, 38% would be erroneously excluded with the best-corrected acuity definition of visual impairment. This is particularly ironic as uncorrected refractive error is the most easily treatable cause of visual impairment, usually with a simple pair of spectacles. Perhaps because it is so easily treatable, it was not initially considered worthy of qualifying as a "cause" of visual impairment in the ICD definition based on recommendations made over 30 years ago. However, the assumption in the ICD definition – that persons with poor vision due to uncorrected refractive error are not visually impaired because they could have better vision if they had simple refractive correction with spectacles – seems misplaced, as they have poor vision as long as they do not get refractive correction. If extended to cataract, this anomalous assumption could imply that because most persons visually impaired due to cataract could potentially have their vision restored with cataract surgery, they are not visually impaired because best correction (in this case cataract surgery) would probably restore their vision. A recent estimate suggests that uncorrected refractive error is the most common cause of visual impairment in the world, emphasising the urgent need to replace best-corrected visual acuity with presenting visual acuity for defining visual impairment in the ICD classification. This will avoid the huge underestimation of the actual visual impairment burden that occurs with the existing ICD definition.

### Symptoms prior to diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in individuals younger than 18 years [^bb724870]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

A growing body of literature suggests the presence of a prodromal period with nonspecific signs and symptoms before onset of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Objective

To systematically assess diseases and symptoms diagnosed in the 5 years before a first MS- or central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease-related diagnostic code in pediatric patients compared with controls without MS and controls with another immune-mediated disorder, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based, matched case-control study included children and adolescents (aged < 18 years) in Germany with statutory health insurance from January 2010 to December 2020. The study population consisted of 3 groups: case individuals with MS, control individuals without MS, and control individuals with JIA. Data were analyzed from November 2023 to April 2024.

Exposures

Diagnoses coded according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, German Modification (ICD-10-GM).

Main Outcome and Measures

The main outcome was incident cases of MS, defined as the first confirmed diagnosis of MS (ICD-10-GM code G35) in 1 quarter between 2013 and 2020 and at least 1 additional diagnosis in the following quarters. In total, 163 ICD-10-GM codes before a first MS diagnosis were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses.

Results

The study population consisted of 1091 children and adolescents with MS, 10 910 without MS, and 1068 with JIA. Of the children and adolescents with MS, 788 (72.2%) were female. Mean (SD) age at disease diagnosis was 15.7 (1.7) years. Nine ICD-10-GM codes were present more frequently among children and adolescents with MS in the 5 years before their first MS diagnosis than among controls without MS: obesity (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.42–2.02), disorders of eye refraction and accommodation (AOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09–1.47), visual disturbances (AOR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10–1.55), gastritis and duodenitis (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.08–1.70), patella disorders (AOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13–1.90), heartbeat abnormalities (AOR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.27–2.96), flatulence (AOR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.01–2.01), skin sensation disturbances (AOR, 12.93; 95% CI, 8.98–18.62), as well as dizziness and giddiness (AOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.22–1.89). Four of these ICD-10-GM codes were significantly more prevalent in children and adolescents with MS than in controls with JIA: obesity (AOR, 3.19; 95% CI, 2.03–5.02), refraction and accommodation disorders (AOR, 3.08; 95% CI, 2.33–4.08), visual disturbances (AOR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.13–2.33), and skin sensation disturbances (AOR, 27.70; 95% CI, 6.52–117.64).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this population-based, matched case-control study, children and adolescents with MS had diverse metabolic, ocular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular symptoms, signs, or diagnoses within 5 years before their first MS diagnosis. Better characterization of early symptoms and/or risk factors, comorbid disorders, and possible prodromal features of MS may have considerable implications for early recognition and subsequent progression of the disease.

### Epidemiology and health-related quality of life in hypoparathyroidism in Norway [^a960bd25]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Patient identification and epidemiology

The initial search in two hospital registries using extended search criteria yielded more than 2000 hits, but only 132 were verified as HP. For subsequent searches, all ICD9 codes and three ICD10 codes (E83.5, R29, and P71.0–9), were omitted. According to the results from these two centers, using the narrower search criteria we might miss approximately 8% of the HP patients. Even the narrowed search criteria revealed a coding practice that could not alone be trusted to identify patients. The erroneous coding was mostly attributed to hypocalcaemia of other causes, such as critical illness, malignancy, renal failure, and transient HP after surgery.

Altogether 522 patients were identified, of whom 511 were alive at the end of the registration period, yielding an overall prevalence of 102 per million, of whom 94 and 8 per million were genuine and pseudo-HP, respectively. Postsurgical HP comprised 321 individuals (64 per million) and nonsurgical HP 151 individuals (30 per million, pseudo-HP excluded). There were large regional variations in postsurgical HP prevalence (Table 2), which accounts for most of the variation in overall HP prevalence. Among the nonsurgical HP patients, the largest subgroup was idiopathic (n = 67, 44%), whereas 85 had genetic or autoimmune HP, of which ADH (n = 31, 21%), APS-1 (n = 25, 17%), and DiGeorge syndrome (n = 23, 15%) were most common. Four patients had HDR, one had vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1, and one had Stormorken's syndrome (Table 3). The patient with vitamin D-dependent rickets is not included in the further analysis, but is included in tables for completeness. Eight percent of the identified patients with DiGeorge syndrome had permanent treatment for HP of more than 1 year duration. Ninety percent of the patients were identified through search of hospital registries, whereas 10% were identified from other sources, in particular the patient organization.

Table 1
The most significant changes in diagnostic codes by ophthalmic subspecialty

Fig. 3

In the neuro-ophthalmology division, optic disc edema, sixth nerve palsies, optic neuritis, and pseudotumor ICD-10 codes were used more frequently post-COVID-19; whereas, the code for nystagmus decreased significantly in frequency. Within the retina division, there was a significant increase in ICD-10 codes associated with the need for injections, such as vein occlusions with macular edema, active wet age-related macular degeneration, active choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM), and proliferative diabetes with cystoid macular edema (CME). Conversely, ICD-10 codes associated with chronic chorioretinal diseases and retinal screening exams significantly decreased, which included choroidal scars, retinal dystrophies, diabetic eye exams, and screening for hemoglobinopathies.

The uveitis division showed a decrease in ICD-10 codes associated with screening for ocular complications of HIV disease, but no other uveitis associated codes declined. Rather, ICD-10 codes for primary intraocular lymphoma, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and sympathetic ophthalmia, traumatic uveitis, non-corneal herpetic diseases, and intermediate uveitis were used signficantly more than in the pre-COVID-19 time period. Ocular oncology, as well, showed a significant decrease in the use of choroidal nevus screening codes and showed a signficant increase in the use of choroidal mass codes.

None of the codes associated with pediatric ophthalmology, low vision, and oculoplastics had a proportional increase after the change in in-person visits associatd with COVID-19 were implemented. The ICD-10 codes that declined the most were ocular screenings for chromosomal abnormalities, phorias, and strabismus. In oculoplastic surgery, ICD-10 codes for dermatochalasis, eyelid malpositions, benign tumors of the lids, and obstructive lacrimal duct disease also declined. Finally, ICD-10 codes associated with low vision decreased 27 fold in the 6 weeks post-COVID-19.

Ocular trauma showed a proportional increase in ruptured globes and intraocular foreign bodies in the 6 weeks after the COVID-19 changes. ICD-10 codes for screening for eye or systemic medical disorders, a family history of eye disease, and refractive error were used significantly less frequently than in the 6 weeks pre-COVID-19.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^ccf9d77a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis ICD-10 CM coding — Blepharitis, which includes entities with the following ICD-10 classifications, lists Ulcerative (H01.01-), Squamous (H01.02-), Stye (H00.01-), Meibomitis (H01.02-), Abscess of eyelid (H00.03-), and Parasitic infestation of eyelid (B89). CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)".

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^484845d9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Financial and clinical impacts

To analyze the changes in clinical revenue and productivity after ICD-10 conversion, we obtained billing summaries from the UC Davis Eye Center from October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2016, and examined the mean payments per visit, relative value units (RVUs) per visit, number of visits, and percentage of high-level visits for each month during the 12-month periods before and after ICD-10 implementation on October 1, 2015. High-level visits were defined by Current Procedural Terminology codes 99204, 99205, 92004, 99214, 99215, and 92014. Low-level visit codes were defined by Current Procedural Terminology codes 99201–99203, 99243, 92002, 99211–99213, and 92012. We also evaluated the number of coding-related denials and average denied charges per 100 visits, as well as denied charges as a percentage of total charges during the two periods. Coding-related denials were defined as insurance claims that were denied due to an error in coding. Finally, we assessed coder efficiency by comparing the percentage of charges coded within 10 days of a visit before and after ICD-10 implementation.

Coding behavior

To evaluate the increased complexity of ICD-10 coding as a potential cause of increased insurance claim denials, we identified the top 15 primary ICD-9 codes used between October 1, 2014, and September 30, 2015. We then assessed the corresponding section of ICD-10 to identify all of the possible corresponding codes. To determine if the increased complexity of ICD-10 resulted in more frequent use of unspecified diagnosis codes, we analyzed the total volume of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes used as primary diagnoses during the 12-month period before and after ICD-10 implementation and compared the proportion of specified and unspecified codes and their distribution among subspecialty categories. We also analyzed which categories of unspecified codes were used most frequently.

ICD-9 codes were categorized based on blocks in Chapter 6 of the 2016 edition of the ICD-9-CM manual. ICD-10 codes were categorized similarly based on blocks in Chapter 7 of the 2016 edition of the ICD-10-CM manual (Table 1). Unspecified codes were defined as codes with the term "unspecified" in the name where more specific codes exist that could have been used in their place.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^7ddc43dd]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the financial and clinical impact of conversion from International Classification of Disease, 9th revision (ICD-9) to ICD-10 coding.

Design

Retrospective, database study.

Materials and Methods

Monthly billing and coding data from 44,564 billable patient encounters at an academic ophthalmology practice were analyzed by subspecialty in the 1-year periods before (October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2015) and after (October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016) conversion from ICD-9 to ICD-10.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome measures were payments per visit, relative value units per visit, number of visits, and percentage of high-level visits; secondary measures were denials due to coding errors, charges denied due to coding errors, and percentage of unspecified codes used as a primary diagnosis code.

Results

Conversion to ICD-10 did not significantly impact payments per visit ($306.56 ± $56.50 vs $321.43 ± $38.12, P = 0.42), relative value units per visit (7.15 ± 0.56 vs 7.13 ± 0.84, P = 0.95), mean volume of visits (1,887.08 ± 375.02 vs 1,863.83 ± 189.81, P = 0.71), or percentage of high-level visits (29.7% ± 4.9%, 548 of 1,881 vs 30.0% ± 1.7%, 558 of 1,864, P = 0.81). For every 100 visits, the number of coding-related denials increased from 0.98 ± 0.60 to 1.84 ± 0.31 (P < 0.001), and denied charges increased from $307.42 ± $443.39 to $660.86 ± $239.47 (P = 0.002). The monthly percentage of unspecified codes used increased from 25.8% ± 1.1% (485 of 1,881) to 35.0% ± 2.3% (653 of 1,864, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

The conversion to ICD-10 did not impact overall revenue or clinical volume in this practice setting, but coding-related denials, denied charges, and the use of unspecified codes increased significantly. We expect these denials to increase in the next year in the absence of Medicare's 1-year grace period.

### Ocular manifestations in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^332d6c25]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

At the time of data collection, the total number of records with an EDS diagnosis was 76526 and the total data population in the US Collaborative Network was 99 836 639.

EDS patient demographics

Across each race stratification, females had a greater prevalence of EDS diagnosis compared to men (Table 2). Records of an EDS diagnosis were most prevalent in white females 30 years or younger with a prevalence of 259.6 per 100,000. In the 30-year age cohorts, the total prevalence of EDS records per 100,000 was respectively 110.8, 93.8, and then a steep drop in the 61+ cohort to 17.1. When stratifying by gender and age, the recorded EDS prevalence for females aged 0–30 and 31–60 were comparable at respectively 167.3 and 150.0. There was a drop in the prevalence of females 61+ years old diagnosed with EDS at 31.7 per 100,000. This trend of decreased prevalence of an EDS diagnosis at 61+ years old was seen in all races/ethnicities when female gender was isolated. Although male patients had a much smaller EDS diagnosis prevalence compared to females, an EDS diagnosis was also most prevalent in males aged 0–30 across all races investigated (Table 2).

Table 2
Stratification of EDS patients by 30-year age cohorts, gender, and race.

EDS and ocular conditions

Table 3 showcased the overall prevalence of patients with ICD-10 encounter diagnoses for EDS and ocular conditions, and the prevalence within the 30-year age cohorts. The mean age of patients diagnosed with EDS (22 ± 6 years of age) was older than the platform's general population (17 ± 8 years of age) only for the 0–30 age-cohort. Overall, 9/23 (40%) included ocular diagnoses were significantly more prevalent in EDS diagnosed patients compared to the total population. Specifically, patients with recorded diagnoses of myopia and dry eye syndrome had the highest prevalence per 100,000 at 5227.0 and 4211.6 respectively. Notably, diagnoses of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and glaucoma demonstrated marked prevalence per 100,000 at 1995.4 and 1532.8. ICD-10 encounter diagnoses for several ocular conditions were found to have significantly lower prevalences among patients diagnosed with EDS than the overall population including: diabetic retinopathy (DR) secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DR), non-neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and neovascular AMD (Table 3).

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades.

Micronutrient deficiency replacement after bariatric surgery — Vitamin A, folate (vitamin B9), and vitamin B12 dosing is outlined as follows: For vitamin A deficiency with ocular complications, the table specifies "50,000–100,000 IU po or IM for 3 days, followed by 50,000 IU per day IM for 2 weeks", and if no corneal changes, "10,000–25,000 IU orally per day until clinical improvement (may take at least 1–2 weeks)", with maintenance "5000–10,000 IU orally per day". For folate, if the multivitamin already has folic acid, replacement is "an additional 400 mcg/ day supplement (total of 1200 µg/day of folic acid until RBC folate is in normal range)", with maintenance "800 mcg of folic acid". For vitamin B12 deficiency, treatment includes "1000 mcg or 1 mg per day", and once normalized, maintenance "500 mcg or 1000 mcg orally… or 1000 mcg/ month IM".

### Novel aspects of Sjögren's syndrome in 2012 [^a308586b]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

SS is rather far from being considered a simple disease of 'dry mouth and dry eyes'. Research on SS is extremely active and aims at improving the classification of patients through more objective criteria (for example, the 2012 SICCA Criteria), probing deeper into the etiology and the complex pathogenesis of the disease and providing evidence for the use of new targeted treatments, such as anti-B cell drugs. The role of infections in the emergence of SS has been recently addressed, showing that some infectious agents may promote the disease, while others may have a protective action against the development of autoimmunity. Extraglandular manifestations are still a challenge in the management of SS, among which the most serious is B cell NH lymphoma. The recent finding that severe complications such as lymphoma and peripheral neuropathy are associated with low vitamin D levels opens new avenues in the understanding of the disease and in its treatment. The fact that CHB is also more frequent during winter and associates with hypovitaminosis D supports the idea that the role of vitamin D should be further investigated in SS and adequate supplementation should be given to these patients.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Revision of visual impairment definitions in the international statistical classification of diseases [^b274cb39]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

3. The proposed moderate visual impairment, defined as presenting visual acuity less than 6/18 to 6/60, would have estimates different from the existing low vision, defined in the ICD classification as best-corrected visual acuity less than 6/18 to 3/60. We have estimated an increase of about 75% worldwide for visual acuity level of less than 6/18 to 3/60 if presenting visual acuity were used instead of best-corrected acuity. On the other hand, there would be a decrease due to exclusion of the less than 6/60 to 3/60 slab from the less than 6/18 to 3/60 range, estimated to be about 6% for less developed countries and larger for more developed countries based on the limited data available from the few studies using presenting visual acuity and allowing this distinction. Overall, these two opposing effects would result in a rough estimate of about 202 million persons in the world with moderate visual impairment defined as presenting visual acuity less than 6/18 to 6/60 in the better eye, compared with the WHO estimate of 124 million persons with low vision defined as best-corrected acuity less than 6/18 to 3/60 in the better eye (Table 5).

4. Very few data are available for the proposed category of mild visual impairment defined as presenting visual acuity less than 6/12 to 6/18. In a national sample of adults aged 30 years or older in Bangladesh, the prevalence of mild visual impairment was 6.46%, which would add 65% to the 9.97% prevalence of all other levels of visual impairment (presenting visual acuity less than 6/18). In a sample of adults aged 40 years or older in Victoria, Australia, the prevalence of mild visual impairment was 2.51%, which would add 146% to the 1.72% prevalence of all other levels of visual impairment. In these studies, mild visual impairment in a large proportion of the persons could be improved with refractive correction.

The calculations presented above should be considered as only indicative, as they are based on limited available data. However, keeping the above issues in mind would enable informed comparisons to be made between past estimates of visual impairment and the new estimates using the proposed revised ICD classification, for assessing the changes in trends of visual impairment in countries and regions of the world.

### Ophthatome ™: an integrated knowledgebase of ophthalmic diseases for translating vision research into the clinic [^d4bbb41a]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Data curation

All demographic and clinical parameters for example, age, diagnosis, quantitative trait values were reviewed for validity and erroneous data was cleaned or flagged and removed. For each of the quantitative traits, the range of expected values were defined, and values falling outside the range were corrected after consultation with the clinician, or in case of ambiguity were deleted. Unstructured data, for example, disease diagnoses were reclassified using ICD10 code, personal history and family history of ophthalmic and systemic diseases were annotated with structured terminologies. Ophthatome ™ is populated with extensively annotated data that were checked for accuracy and uniformity (Fig. 1). A brief overview of data types captured in Ophthatome ™ are summarized below.
(i) Age The age was computed based on the date of birth and therefore reflects chronological age of subjects at multiple visits when longitudinal data is captured. Subjects with more than 110 years were marked as outliers, verified for accuracy of the data, and corrected. Paediatric age group included subjects ≤ 18 yrs and subjects > 18 years were considered adult in the cohort.
(ii) Disease diagnosis The disease diagnosis in the EMR is based on ICD10 codes. The ICD diagnosis was categorised into disease types and subtypes for comprehensive and informative querying of the data. For example, all types of cataract; cortical, nuclear, anterior subcapsular etc. were first grouped as cataract and then subclassified into their respective subtypes as shown in Table 1. Further, disease diagnoses entries that were not as per the ICD10 codes, or present in an unstructured format, or 'free text' in the EMR were assigned unique codes and grouped under appropriate disease types and subtypes. The unstructured disease diagnoses entries that specified two or more diseases, e.g. a) "primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) with cataract" or b) "early cataract with mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR)" were grouped under both the diseases, a) glaucoma and cataract, and b) cataract and diabetic retinopathy and appropriate endophenotypes, respectively (Table 2). Each of the disease diagnosis was also annotated with additional data for example, (i) affected ocular organ (cornea, conjunctiva, retina etc), (ii) age of onset of the disease (as congenital, age-related, unspecified etc) and (iii) possible causes of the disease such as a) infectious (viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic) b) genetic (complex, monogenic, somatic, mitochondrial, chromosomal) c) age-related d) developmental e) systemic causes f) secondary to other ocular diseases g) trauma i) related to eye surgery j) inflammation k) contact lens l) medications m) autoimmune disease n) environmental/allergy o) unknown. The categorization was done manually. These categorizations and labelling allow advanced search functions for identifying specific, well-defined cohorts and to raise specific queries and adding clinical richness to the database.
(iii) Quantitative traits Refractive error (RE) Myopia and hyperopia were classified based on the degree as low, medium and high. The types of myopia are; low myopia (< − 3.00D), medium myopia (− 3.00D to − 6.00D) and high myopia (> − 6.00D) and hyperopia; low hyperopia (+ 2.00D), medium hyperopia (+ 2.25D to + 5.00D) and high hyperopia (> + 5.00D) based on the spherical power in diopters (D). Entries other than the accepted integer in positive or negative values representing hyperopia and myopia respectively, were marked and removed. Intraocular pressure Intraocular pressure (IOP) was classified as low, normal and high for the measurement values, < 12 mmHg, 12–21 mmHg and > 21 mmHg, respectively. IOP values greater than 80 mmHg were considered erroneous and were excluded as maximum measurement that can be recorded on applanation and NCT (noncontact tonometer) are 80 and 60 mmHg, respectively. Central corneal thickness Central corneal thickness (CCT) was defined as very thin, thin, average, thick and very thick for the values < 510 μm, 510–540 μm, 541–560 μm, 561–600 μm and > 600 μm respectively. Values < 300 μm and > 700 μm were marked as outliers and corrected appropriately with reference to the longitudinal data if available or flagged and removed.
(iv) Systemic diseases The details of the systemic disease(s) were converted into standard terminology such as, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal stones, asthma etc. These labels improve search and selection functions in the web portal. The unique unstructured free text entries were exported to an excel file and for each entry (for the common diseases mentioned above), the corresponding standard terminology were assigned manually, which was later mapped in the database.
(v) Prescription drugs The EMR database contains a list of different prescribed ophthalmic and non-ophthalmic drugs as per their brand names. Generic names were appended for all the prescribed drugs along with their brand names. Further, the drugs were also grouped as per their therapeutic or pharmacological classification based on WHO/ATC classification. For combination drugs too, the generic, and the therapeutic or pharmacological classification were appropriately appended. This was done to identify cohorts which may not have been treated with the same generic or brand name drugs, but drugs with similar mechanism of action or pharmacological properties.
(vi) Family history Details of family history of disease(s) was available for 0.02% (12,465/561,466) of the cohort. The diseases were defined as either ophthalmic or systemic to choose subjects with family history of either or both type of disease(s). Here again the unique unstructured free text entries were exported to excel, the entries defined as 'ophthalmic' or 'systemic' disease manually and then mapped in the database.
(vii) Diagnostic procedural images The diagnostic procedural images that include, electroretinogram (ERG), fundus photograph, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), frequency doubling technology perimetry (FDT), Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT3), nerve fibre analysis (GDX), confocal microperimetry (MAIA), visual field analysis (HFA), Pentacam (anterior eye segment tomography), amplitude scan (ASCAN), specular microscopy, color vision, electrocardiograph (ECG), were all integrated into the Ophthatome ™. The images along with the visit dates are presented as deidentified data retaining the same resolution as that of the original image. Quantitative values within the procedural images The quantitative values like the visual field index (VFI) as percentage, median deviation (MD), pattern standard deviation (PSD) available in the visual field analysis image, average retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness in micrometer, cup/disc ratio, available in the OCT image were programmatically read, and the values mapped and integrated in the database.
(viii) Visual impairment The subjects were defined either as normal vision or visually impaired based on latest unaided or best corrected visual acuity. First, the values in the unaided and best corrected visual acuity were classified as normal, visual impairment, severe visual impairment or blind based on standard WHO definition. Subjects are defined normal if the unaided refraction is within normal limits. When the unaided refraction was classified either as visual impairment, severe visual impairment or blind, then the classification under the best corrected visual acuity of the better eye was considered to classify the visual impairment status of the individual.
(ix) Longitudinal data Approximately 50% of the overall cohort in the knowledgebase have longitudinal data, i.e. have some clinical data recorded for more than one visit. In the Ophthatome ™, for any visit > 1, an internal check of at least two datapoints for either refraction or glass prescription or slit-lamp examination was considered to short list cohort with longitudinal data.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^38fe75ba]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Quality of ophthalmic care core criteria — quality ophthalmic care is provided in a manner and with the skill that is consistent with the best interests of the patient, and the ophthalmologist is first and foremost a physician who demonstrates compassion and concern, utilizes the science and art of medicine to help alleviate patient fear and suffering, strives to develop and maintain clinical skills at the highest feasible level through training and continuing education, ensures that needy patients receive necessary care directly or through referral and supports activities that promote health and prevent disease and disability, and respects the dignity and integrity of patients without exploiting their vulnerability. The essence of quality care is a meaningful partnership relationship between patient and physician in which the ophthalmologist strives to communicate effectively, educates patients about the nature and progress of their condition and about proper and appropriate therapeutic modalities, and ensures meaningful participation in decisions to improve motivation and compliance with the agreed plan of treatment and to help alleviate fears and concerns. The ophthalmologist uses his or her best judgment in choosing and timing appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic modalities and the frequency of evaluation and follow-up with due regard to urgency, the nature of the condition, and unique needs and desires, carries out only those procedures for which he or she is adequately trained, experienced and competent or, when necessary, is assisted by someone who is depending on urgency and the availability and accessibility of alternative providers, provides appropriate alternate ophthalmic care with adequate mechanisms for informing patients when unavailable, and maintains complete and accurate medical records.

### Prevalence of malnutrition among hospital admissions to english NHS hospitals over two economically constrained decades: evidence from routine health data [^ba9e64ed]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Trends by age group

We provide a breakdown for protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin deficiency admissions by age group in figure 2. Admission rates were highest in the older age groups, but a similar proportional increase in admissions was seen in all age groups. There was a sharp rise in protein-energy deficiency diagnoses specifically in the older age group in 2012/2013. There was a dip for all in the year 2019/2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Figure 2
Admissions with protein-energy malnutrition or vitamin deficiency in any diagnosis position by age group.

Type of vitamin deficiency

Table 1 shows the most common ICD-10 codes for vitamin deficiency diagnoses in a primary or secondary position. 'Deficiency of other specified B group vitamins' included biotin, folate, folic acid, pantothenic acid but vitamin B 12 made much the largest contribution to the increase in this category.

Table 1
Most frequent ICD-10 codes for diagnoses of vitamin deficiency in any position

B vitamin testing

The plots in figure 3 show the annual rate of testing and the proportion with a deficient result for vitamin B 12 at QEHB. Vitamin B 12 made up a large majority of B vitamin test requests, so we focused on this for our analysis. The rate increased over time, but the proportion of these tests with a vitamin deficiency result did not show an increase over time.

### The role of facility-based surgical services in addressing the national burden of disease in new zealand: an index of surgical incidence based on country-specific disease prevalence [^1f2c29ac]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Surgery is a crucial component of health systems, yet its actual contribution has been difficult to define. We aimed to link use of national hospital service with national epidemiological surveillance data to describe the use of surgical procedures in the management of a broad spectrum of conditions.

Methods

We compiled Australian Modification-International Classification of Diseases-10 codes from the New Zealand National Minimum Dataset, 2008–11. Using primary cause of admission, we aggregated admissions to 91 hospitals into 119 disease states and 22 disease subcategories of the WHO Global Health Estimate (GHE). We queried each admission for any surgical procedure in a binary manner to determine the frequency of admitted patients whose care required surgery. Surgical procedures were defined as requiring general or neuroaxial anaesthesia. We then divided the volume of surgical cases by counts of disease prevalence from the GBD 2010 to determine surgical incidence. This study was approved by the University of Otago Human Ethics Committee (Health; Reference Number HD14/42). Raw data was only handled by coauthors with direct affiliation with the New Zealand Ministry of Health.

Findings

Between 2008 and 2011, there were 1108653 hospital admissions with 275570 associated surgical procedures per year. Surgical procedures were associated with admissions for all 22 GHE disease subcategories and 116 of 119 GHE disease states (excluding intestinal nematode infections, iodine deficiency, and vitamin A deficiency). The subcategories with the largest surgical case volumes were unintentional injuries (48073), musculoskeletal diseases (38030), and digestive diseases (27640), and the subcategories with the smallest surgical case volumes were nutritional deficiencies (13), neonatal conditions (204), and infectious and parasitic diseases (982). Surgical incidence ranged widely by individual disease states with the highest in other neurological conditions, abortion, appendicitis, obstructed labour, and maternal sepsis.

Interpretation

This study confirms previous research that surgical care is required across the entire spectrum of GHE disease subcategories, showing the crucial role of operative intervention in health systems. Surgical incidence might be useful as an index to estimate the need for surgical procedures in other populations.

### Evaluation of an algorithm for identifying ocular conditions in electronic health record data [^681cdce7]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

For research involving big data, researchers must accurately identify patients with ocular diseases or phenotypes of interest. Reliance on administrative billing codes alone for this purpose is limiting.

Objective

To develop a method to accurately identify the presence or absence of ocular conditions of interest using electronic health record (EHR) data.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study is a retrospective analysis of the EHR data of patients (n = 122 339) in the Sight Outcomes Research Collaborative Ophthalmology Data Repository who received eye care at participating academic medical centers between August 1, 2012, and August 31, 2017. An algorithm that searches structured and unstructured (free-text) EHR data for conditions of interest was developed and then tested to determine how well it could detect the presence or absence of exfoliation syndrome (XFS). The algorithm was trained to search for evidence of XFS among a sample of patients with and without XFS (n = 200) by reviewing International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-9 or ICD-10) billing codes, the patient's problem list, and text within the ocular examination section and unstructured (free-text) data in the EHR. The likelihood that each patient had XFS was estimated using logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The EHR data of all patients were run through the algorithm to generate an XFS probability score for each patient. The algorithm was validated with review of EHRs by glaucoma specialists.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the algorithm were computed as the proportion of patients correctly classified with XFS or without XFS.

Results

This study included 122 339 patients, with a mean (SD) age of 52.4(25.1) years. Of these patients, 69 002 (56.4%) were female and 99 579 (81.4%) were white. The algorithm assigned a less than 10% probability of XFS for 121 085 patients (99.0%) as well as an XFS probability score of more than 75% for 543 patients (0.4%), more than 90% for 353 patients (0.3%), and more than 99% for 83 patients (0.07%). Validated by glaucoma specialists, the algorithm had a PPV of 95.0% (95% CI, 89.5%-97.7%) and an NPV of 100% (95% CI, 91.2%-100%). When there was ICD-9 or ICD-10 billing code documentation of XFS, in 86% or 96% of the records, respectively, evidence of XFS was also recorded elsewhere in the EHR. Conversely, when there was clinical examination or free-text evidence of XFS, it was documented with ICD-9 codes only approximately 40% of the time and even less often with ICD-10 codes.

Conclusions and Relevance

The algorithm developed, tested, and validated in this study appears to be better at identifying the presence or absence of XFS in EHR data than the conventional approach of assessing only billing codes; such an algorithm may enhance the ability of investigators to use EHR data to study patients with ocular diseases.

### Proportion of navy recruits diagnosed with symptomatic stress fractures during training and monetary impact of these injuries [^184c0f31]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lower extremity stress fractures result in lost time from work and sport and incur costs in the military when they occur in service members. Hypovitaminosis D has been identified as key risk factor in these injuries. An estimated 33% to 90% of collegiate and professional athletes have deficient vitamin D levels. Other branches of the United States military have evaluated the risk factors for stress fractures during basic training, including vitamin D deficiency. To the best of our knowledge, a study evaluating the correlation between these injuries and vitamin D deficiency in US Navy recruits and a cost analysis of these injuries has not been performed. Cutbacks in military medical staffing mean more active-duty personnel are being deferred for care to civilian providers. Consequently, data that previously were only pertinent to military medical providers have now expanded to the nonmilitary medical community.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore asked: (1) What proportion of US Navy recruits experience symptomatic lower extremity stress fractures, and what proportion of those recruits had hypovitaminosis vitamin D on laboratory testing? (2) What are the rehabilitation costs involved in the treatment of lower extremity stress fractures, including the associated costs of lost training time? (3) Is there a cost difference in the treatment of stress fractures between recruits with lower extremity stress fractures who have vitamin D deficiency and those without vitamin D deficiency?

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated the electronic medical record at Naval Recruit Training Command in Great Lakes, IL, USA, of all active-duty males and females trained from 2009 until 2015. We used ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes to identify those diagnosed with symptomatic lower extremity stress fractures. Data collected included geographic region of birth, preexisting vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D level at the time of diagnosis, medical history, BMI, age, sex, self-reported race or ethnicity, hospitalization days, days lost from training, and the number of physical therapy, primary care, and specialty visits. To ascertain the proportion of recruits who developed symptomatic stress fractures, we divided the number of recruits who were diagnosed with a stress fracture by the total number who trained over that span of time, which was 204,774 individuals. During the span of this study, 45% (494 of 1098) of recruits diagnosed with a symptomatic stress fracture were female and 55% (604 of 1098) were male, with a mean ± SD age of 24 ± 4 years. We defined hypovitaminosis D as a vitamin D level lower than 40 ng/mL. Levels less than 40 ng/mL were defined as low normal and levels less than 30 ng/mL as deficient. Vitamin D levels were obtained at the discretion of the individual treating provider without standardization of protocol. Cost was defined as physical therapy visits, primary care visits, orthopaedic visits, diagnostic imaging costs, laboratory costs, hospitalizations, if applicable, and days lost from training. Diagnostic studies and laboratory tests were incorporated as indirect costs into initial and follow-up physical therapy visits. Evaluation and management code fee schedules for initial visits and follow-up visits were used as direct costs. We obtained these data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website. Per capita cost was calculated by taking the total cost and dividing it by the study population. Days lost from training is based on a standardized government military salary of recruits to include room and board.

Results

We found that 0.5% (1098 of 204,774) of recruits developed a symptomatic lower extremity stress fracture. Of the recruits who had vitamin D levels drawn at the time of stress fracture, 95% (416 of 437 [95% confidence interval (CI) 94% to 98%]; p > 0.99) had hypovitaminosis D (≤ 40 ng/mL) and 82% (360 of 437 [95% CI 79% to 86%]; p > 0.99) had deficient levels (≤ 30 ng/mL) on laboratory testing, when evaluated. The total treatment cost was USD 9506 per recruit. Days lost in training was a median of 56 days (4 to 108) for a per capita cost of USD 5447 per recruit. Recruits with deficient vitamin D levels (levels ≤ 30 ng/mL) incurred more physical therapy treatment costs than did those with low-normal vitamin D levels (levels 31 to 40 ng/mL) (mean difference USD 965 [95% CI 2 to 1928]; p = 0.049).

Conclusion

The cost of lost training and rehabilitation associated with symptomatic lower extremity stress fractures represents a major financial burden. Screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiencies before recruit training could offer a cost-effective solution to decreasing the stress fracture risk. Recognition and treatment of these deficiencies has a role beyond the military, as hypovitaminosis and stress fractures are common in collegiate or professional athletes.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^7cb0ab4c]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### Increased risk of laryngeal and pharyngeal cancer after gastrectomy for ulcer disease in a population-based cohort study [^3544d444]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

To evaluate confounding by tobacco smoking and overconsumption of alcohol, sensitivity analyses were conducted, excluding all individuals and person-years with a diagnosis representing alcohol overconsumption or tobacco smoking in the inpatient or outpatient care, as recorded in the Swedish Patient Register. Alcohol-related diagnoses included a history of excessive alcohol consumption (diagnosis code F10 in ICD-10, 291 or 303 in ICD-9 and ICD-8, or 307 or 322 in ICD-7) or vitamin B deficiency associated with alcohol (E51–52 or G62.1 in ICD-10, 265 in ICD-9, 261.00–262.00 in ICD-8, or 280–281 in ICD-7) or liver disease related to alcohol intake (K70 in ICD-10, 571. A or 571.C in ICD-9, 571.00 or 571.01 in ICD-8, 581.10 or 583.10 in ICD-7). Tobacco smoking was assessed by smoking-related diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchitis (J41–J44 in ICD-10, 490–492 in ICD-9 and ICD-8, 501.99, 502, 527.10, or 527.11 in ICD-7), or atherosclerosis or peripheral vascular disease (I70 or I73.9 in ICD-10, 440 or 443.x in ICD-9, 440, 443.90 or 445 in ICD-8, or 450.00, 450.10, or 453.33 in ICD-7).

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^ab59a3b4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes — precursors to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and related entities are mapped between ICD-9 CM and ICD-10 CM, including break, unspecified (361.00; H33.00-), break, giant (361.03; H33.03-), vitreous detachment/degeneration (379.21; H43.81-), and retinal break without detachment types such as retinal break, unspecified (361.30; H33.30-), horseshoe tear (361.32; H33.31-), and round hole (361.31; H33.32-), as well as retinal dialysis (361.04; H33.04-) and lattice degeneration of the retina (362.63; H35.41-). Additional information for ICD-10 CM states that certain categories have applicable 7th characters and that "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used", and that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; the table specifies " = 1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral", and that "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Dry eye symptoms and impact on vision-related function across international task force guidelines severity levels in the United States [^bb00f1e9]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Dry eye disease is frequently undertreated. Barriers to appropriate treatment include the time required to adequately diagnose and determine appropriate treatment based on the patient's severity level, the perception by clinicians that the condition has minor impact on patient well-being, the perception by patients that the disease is normal or less important than other conditions that require treatment, lack of understanding of the disease process, and a perceived paucity of therapeutic options. Supplemental artificial tears and eyelid hygiene are common treatment modalities for dry eye disease, yet many patients continue to experience significant disruption to their daily lives. Our findings suggest that dry eye symptoms are frequently troublesome to the patient at all levels of disease severity, and require attention and adequate treatment. A complete and comprehensive medical and ocular history conducted by clinicians should help correctly identify patients who may have ambiguous symptoms without clinical signs or vice versa, and allow proper treatment and management of dry eye disease.

### Trends in the diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency [^a19165ac]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D has attracted considerable interest in recent years, and health care providers have reported large increases in vitamin D test requests. However, rates of diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in clinical practice have not been investigated. We examined trends in diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in children in England over time, and by sociodemographic characteristics.

Methods

Cohort study using primary care records of 711788 children aged 0 to 17 years, from the Health Improvement Network database. Incidence rates for diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency were calculated per year between 2000 and 2014. Rate ratios exploring differences by age, sex, ethnicity, and social deprivation were estimated using multivariable Poisson regression.

Results

The crude rate of vitamin D deficiency diagnosis increased from 3.14 per 100000 person-years in 2000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31–7.54) to 261 per 100000 person-years in 2014 (95% CI, 241–281). After accounting for changes in demographic characteristics, a 15-fold (95% CI, 10–21) increase in diagnosis was seen between 2008 and 2014. Older age (≥ 10 years), nonwhite ethnicity, and social deprivation were independently associated with higher rates of diagnosis. In children aged < 5 years, diagnosis rates were higher in boys than girls, whereas in children aged ≥ 10 they were higher in girls.

Conclusions

There has been a marked increase in diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in children over the past decade. Future research should explore the drivers for this change in diagnostic behavior and the reasons prompting investigation of vitamin D status in clinical practice.

### Treatment of dry eye disease [^e57e0137]. The Consultant Pharmacist (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dry eye disease:

- **Definition**: DED, also known as dry eye syndrome or keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a chronic, multifactorial condition characterized by a deficiency in tear production or excessive evaporation, leading to ocular surface inflammation and discomfort.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of DED involves two main mechanisms: aqueous tear deficiency and evaporative dry eye. Aqueous tear deficiency is due to decreased tear production, often associated with age, autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren's syndrome, or certain medications. Evaporative dry eye is primarily due to meibomian gland dysfunction, which results in an unstable tear film and increased tear evaporation.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of DED varies widely globally, depending on the geographic region and the diagnostic criteria used, ranging from 5% to 50%. In the US, the prevalence of DED in adults is estimated at 5–7%, with rates 2–3 times higher in females.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for DED include older age, female sex, contact lens wear, screen time, environment factors such as pollution and low humidity, hormonal changes such as menopause, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome, and certain medications including antihistamines, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and some antihypertensives.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of DED is characterized by symptoms of ocular discomfort, irritation, pain, foreign body sensation, burning, and visual disturbances. Signs of DED include conjunctival injection, corneal staining, and meibomian gland dysfunction. DED can also impact daily activities such as reading, driving, and using digital screens.
