## Question

Serum potassium 6.7 treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage a serum potassium level of 6.7 mmol/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hyperkalemia and excluding pseudohyperkalemia. Then, I should assess severity and immediate risk using ECG and clinical context. Next, I will outline stabilization with intravenous calcium, followed by intracellular shifting with insulin/dextrose and adjuncts. After that, I need to plan potassium removal with binders and consider dialysis. I should also address medication review, monitoring cadence, and special populations, and finally close with documentation and follow-up priorities, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-backed recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the potassium result before I act, because pseudohyperkalemia from hemolysis, prolonged tourniquet time, delayed processing, or platelet/leukocyte lysis can falsely elevate potassium. I should repeat the sample, check for hemolysis, and ensure proper collection and transport, especially if the clinical picture doesn't fit, since measurement error is common and can mislead management decisions [^114dKtnY] [^1139Tryh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity; I need to classify hyperkalemia and integrate ECG findings with the clinical context. A potassium of 6.7 mmol/L meets criteria for severe hyperkalemia by UKKA and KDIGO-aligned definitions, and at this level the risk of malignant arrhythmias is high, so I should obtain an urgent 12-lead ECG and initiate continuous cardiac monitoring while I treat, even if the patient is asymptomatic, because ECG changes can lag or be absent despite life-threatening potassium levels [^111pfUau] [^1151R4sV] [^1124Vteu] [^114ypRXH].

> Wait, let me verify the ECG features I'm looking for: peaked T waves, PR prolongation, QRS widening, sine waves, and conduction blocks. If any are present, I should treat immediately with intravenous calcium to stabilize the cardiac membrane while I proceed with potassium-lowering therapies, because calcium's effect is rapid but does not lower potassium and wears off, necessitating definitive therapies afterward [^115Gqbhv] [^113hTA5U].

> I will now examine stabilization therapy. Intravenous calcium gluconate 10% 30 mL over 10 minutes or calcium chloride 10% 10 mL over 5 minutes are acceptable options, with calcium chloride preferred via central access in arrest settings. I should repeat the dose if ECG changes persist or recur, recognizing that calcium is temporizing and not a potassium-lowering therapy [^115Gqbhv] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review intracellular shifting. Insulin with dextrose is first-line here. Standard dosing is 10 units of regular insulin with 25 g dextrose IV, and I need to check blood glucose before and after to mitigate hypoglycemia; if the patient is already hyperglycemic, I should still give dextrose to avoid rebound hypoglycemia, and I should anticipate onset within 10–20 minutes with peak effect around 30–60 minutes, so I must recheck potassium and glucose frequently [^115bePMV] [^115onKP5] [^115h7Ejq].

> But wait, what if insulin is contraindicated or insufficient alone? I should consider adjunct beta-agonist therapy. Nebulized salbutamol 10–20 mg can lower potassium by about 0.5–1.3 mmol/L and is synergistic with insulin. I should confirm bronchospasm risk and monitor for tremor and tachycardia, and I can repeat dosing if needed while watching for diminishing returns with repeated doses [^1152AJgs] [^113p5yDq] [^114mdtLH].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of sodium bicarbonate. I initially thought to give bicarbonate routinely, but I need to ensure I'm not overusing it. Bicarbonate is reasonable if there is concurrent metabolic acidosis, particularly in CKD, but evidence for standalone potassium lowering is limited and mixed, so I should prioritize insulin/dextrose and salbutamol first and reserve bicarbonate for acidosis or as an adjunct when indicated [^111EprnF] [^114mdtLH].

> Next, I should review potassium removal from the gut. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are preferred modern binders. Patiromer 8.4–25.2 g orally reduces potassium by roughly 0.5–1.0 mmol/L over 24–48 hours and is reasonable in severe hyperkalemia, while sodium zirconium cyclosilicate 10 g TID can lower potassium within 1–2 hours and is particularly useful when a rapid effect is desired. I should avoid sodium polystyrene sulfonate given limited acute efficacy and higher GI risk, and I must remember binders are not substitutes for urgent stabilization when ECG changes are present [^115hJrrW] [^115vDnth] [^115QssEw] [^115QssEw] [^116BLNsA] [^1174LzTA] [^114mdtLH].

> I need to ensure I escalate to dialysis when indicated. Urgent hemodialysis is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia, severe renal failure, ongoing potassium release, or life-threatening ECG changes despite medical therapy, and in hemodialysis patients with potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L, guidelines recommend urgent dialysis if available. If dialysis is not immediately available, I should continue aggressive medical therapy while arranging emergent transfer [^117RNkBj] [^1156gGZL] [^115h7Ejq].

> Let me consider medication contributors next. I should hold or reduce RAAS inhibitors when potassium is ≥ 6.0 mmol/L, especially if binders are not in use, and I should also stop potassium supplements, NSAIDs, and other potassium-raising drugs where feasible, balancing the cardiovascular benefits of RAAS blockade against the immediate risk of hyperkalemia and planning reintroduction once potassium is controlled [^115cUUuf] [^1172e6Fe] [^113pqGhr].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence. Continuous ECG monitoring is mandatory for potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L or with ECG changes, and I should recheck serum potassium and glucose within 1–2 hours after insulin/dextrose, then every 2–4 hours until stable, because rebound hyperkalemia is common as intracellular shifts reverse. Documenting time stamps and response to each intervention is essential for safe handoffs [^1124Vteu] [^112RLHGt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked special populations. In CKD or heart failure, I should individualize targets and consider potassium binders to preserve RAAS therapy, in hemodialysis I must balance pre- and post-dialysis potassium swings and individualize dialysate potassium, and in diabetes on SGLT2 inhibitors or MRAs, I should anticipate hyperkalemia risk and monitor closely, adjusting therapy as needed [^116Czggs] [^111cZZL1] [^1125hA23] [^1172Fcb1].

> Let me reconsider the overall sequence to ensure nothing is missing: confirm true hyperkalemia, assess severity with ECG, stabilize with calcium if ECG changes, shift potassium intracellularly with insulin/dextrose and salbutamol, remove potassium with binders, escalate to dialysis when indicated, review and adjust medications, and monitor closely for rebound. This 5-step approach is consistent with UKKA guidance and should be adapted to the patient's comorbidities and response [^1148w6NC] [^117T8che].

> Finally, I should confirm documentation and follow-up. I need to record the exact potassium value, time of recognition, ECG findings, interventions with times and doses, response including serial potassium and glucose, and the disposition plan, and I should arrange close outpatient follow-up given high recurrence risk after severe hyperkalemia, with consideration of chronic binder therapy and structured potassium monitoring to prevent future episodes [^112RLHGt] [^115B7JKF].

For a potassium of 6.7 mmol/L, **urgent treatment is required** [^112KvyxG] because of the risk of cardiac arrhythmias [^1172XMC2]. Immediate steps include: **obtain a 12-lead ECG** [^1151R4sV] and start continuous cardiac monitoring [^1124Vteu]; administer **IV calcium gluconate** (10 mL of 10% over 2–3 minutes) if there are ECG changes or significant symptoms [^111gKdBN]; give **regular insulin 10 units with 50 mL of 50% dextrose IV** to shift potassium intracellularly [^115bePMV]; and use **nebulized salbutamol** (10–20 mg) as adjunct therapy [^113p5yDq] [^114mdtLH]. If potassium remains elevated or renal function is impaired, initiate **urgent hemodialysis** [^115h7Ejq] or use potassium binders (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) [^115hJrrW] [^116L8Ux5]. Discontinue potassium-sparing drugs, monitor potassium every 1–2 hours initially, and address underlying causes to prevent recurrence [^115h7Ejq] [^112RLHGt].

---

## Clinical significance of potassium 6.7 mmol/L

Hyperkalemia is defined as a serum potassium concentration **greater than 5.0 mmol/L** [^113hTA5U]. A level of 6.7 mmol/L is considered **severe** and carries a significant risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation and asystole [^1172XMC2]. The risk is further compounded by underlying conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and the use of medications that raise potassium levels (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics) [^111b1mZi].

---

## Immediate clinical assessment

Upon identification of severe hyperkalemia, the following **immediate steps** are essential:

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Obtain a 12-lead ECG urgently to assess for cardiac effects of hyperkalemia, such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, or sine wave pattern [^1151R4sV].

- **Continuous cardiac monitoring**: Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring in a high-dependency setting for all patients with serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L or with ECG changes suggestive of hyperkalemia [^1124Vteu].

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate for symptoms such as muscle weakness, paralysis, or cardiac arrhythmias [^113hTA5U].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

### Stabilize cardiac membranes

Intravenous calcium (calcium gluconate or calcium chloride) is administered to stabilize cardiac membranes and prevent arrhythmias. The recommended dose is **10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate IV over 2–3 minutes**, repeated if necessary based on ECG changes [^115Gqbhv].

---

### Shift potassium intracellularly

Insulin and dextrose are used to promote intracellular potassium shift. The recommended regimen is **10 units of regular insulin IV with 50 mL of 50% dextrose IV** (25 g dextrose) [^115bePMV]. Adjunctive **beta-agonists** such as nebulized salbutamol (albuterol) 10–20 mg may be administered to enhance intracellular potassium shift [^113p5yDq] [^114mdtLH].

---

### Remove potassium from the body

- **Potassium binders**: Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are effective in reducing serum potassium levels by increasing gastrointestinal potassium excretion [^113mw5TK].

- **Dialysis**: Urgent hemodialysis is indicated for patients with severe hyperkalemia (≥ 6.5 mmol/L), especially if there is impaired renal function or refractory hyperkalemia despite medical therapy [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological measures include **dietary restriction** — limiting potassium intake by avoiding high-potassium foods (e.g. bananas, oranges, tomatoes, potatoes) — and **discontinuation of potassium-raising medications**, such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, and NSAIDs.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Frequent **serum potassium monitoring** is essential, with checks every 1–2 hours initially until stable, then at regular intervals [^notfound]. Continuous **ECG monitoring** should continue until potassium normalizes and cardiac stability is achieved [^notfound]. Address **underlying causes** — such as renal impairment, medication review, and dietary counseling — to prevent recurrence [^115h7Ejq].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

If severe hyperkalemia is left untreated, **potential complications** include:

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and sudden cardiac death [^115B7JKF].

- **Neuromuscular impairment**: Muscle weakness, paralysis, and respiratory failure [^113hTA5U].

- **Mortality**: Significantly increased risk of death due to cardiac arrest [^115B7JKF].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

1. **ECG and continuous cardiac monitoring**: All patients with potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L
2. **Intravenous calcium gluconate**: ECG changes or significant symptoms
3. **Insulin and dextrose IV**: All patients with severe hyperkalemia
4. **Nebulized salbutamol**: Adjunct therapy
5. **Potassium binders (patiromer, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate)**: Persistent hyperkalemia or impaired renal function
6. **Urgent hemodialysis**: Refractory hyperkalemia or renal failure
7. **Dietary restriction and medication review**: All patients

A serum potassium level of 6.7 mmol/L is a **medical emergency** requiring immediate intervention. The treatment approach includes stabilizing cardiac membranes, shifting potassium intracellularly, removing potassium from the body, and addressing underlying causes. Prompt and aggressive management, along with continuous monitoring, is essential to prevent life-threatening complications [^notfound].

Evaluation of Treatment Outcomes

The mean (SD) baseline serum potassium concentration before administration of patiromer was 5.6 (0.35) mEq/L, and most patients had mild hyperkalemia (potassium level, 5.1–5.5 mEq/L) or moderate hyperkalemia (potassium level, 5.6–6.4 mEq/L). Patients had severe hyperkalemia (potassium level, ≥ 6.5 mEq/L) in only 19 encounters (2.2%). The lowest dose of patiromer (8.4 g) was administered in 721 encounters (81.8%). The mean (SD) time from the recording of baseline serum potassium levels in the electronic health record to patiromer administration was 6.7 (4.0) hours.

The results of the primary end point analysis are presented in Figure 1. The mean (SD) reduction in serum potassium levels was 0.50 (0.56) mEq/L at 0 to 6 hours, 0.46 (0.60) mEq/L at greater than 6 to 12 hours, and 0.52 (0.64) mEq/L at greater than 12 to 24 hours (P < .001 for all compared with baseline). This represents a mean (SD) relative reduction from baseline of 8.5% (9.5%), 7.9% (10.1%), and 9.0% (11.2%) for each respective time interval (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).

Figure 1.
Absolute Serum Potassium Level Reduction Across All Time Intervals

Reductions across all time intervals were significantly different from baseline (P < .001). The mean (SD) times of obtaining a blood sample after patiromer administration within each prespecified interval were 2.9 (1.8) hours at 0 to 6 hours, 8.9 (1.7) hours at greater than 6 to 12 hours, and 17.2 (3.1) hours at greater than 12 to 24 hours.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^111gLH3p]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

In a large, geographically diverse United States population receiving medical care, 27.6% had a potassium level < 4.0 mEq/L, while 5.7% had ≥ 5.0 mEq/L. A U‐shaped association was revealed between serum potassium and mortality, with the lowest all‐cause mortality seen in controls with potassium values between 4.0 and < 5.0 mEq/L. 28 However, the effect on mortality was more severe for hypokalemia than for hyperkalemia, since the investigators observed 45.5% mortality with moderate‐to‐severe hypokalemia and a 35.7% death rate associated with hyperkalemia in those with HF.

After publication of the RALES trial, 31 hospitalization for hyperkalemia in the Canadian health system rose significantly, and this was associated with an increased risk of death among those patients. A decline in eGFR exceeding 20% or 30% was independently associated with a more frequent occurrence of all clinical adverse events. In an EPHESUS post hoc analysis, 32 four independent baseline predictors of hyperkalemia (defined as ≥ 6.0 mEq/L) were identified: baseline potassium greater than the median (4.3 mEq/L), baseline eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, a history of diabetes mellitus, and previous use of antiarrhythmic agents. In the BIOSTAT‐CHF cohort, at baseline, hypokalemia (< 3.5 mEq/L) was present in 6.9% and hyperkalemia (> 5.0 mEq/L) in 8.0%. 33 On the other hand, discontinuation of RAASi therapy exhibited a J‐shaped trend in association with serum potassium. Basnet et al. in a study of 2 660 609 patients who were discharged with a diagnosis of HF, reported that patients with hypokalemia during hospitalization had a greater mortality risk than those with hyperkalemia. 34 Low serum potassium is known to increase the transmembrane resting potential of myocardial cells, resulting in increased excitability and leading to a higher risk of atrial fibrillation, Q‐T interval prolongation, torsade des pointes, ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death. This might explain the fact that hypokalemia in HF has been associated with an increased risk of mortality, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.2 to 2.3. 7, 8, 35

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of a patient with hypokalemia [^113NFDQ5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common and can be associated with serious adverse consequences, including paralysis, ileus, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. As a result, the body maintains serum potassium concentration within very narrow limits by tightly regulated feedback and feed-forward systems. Whereas the consequences of symptomatic hypokalemia and severe potassium depletion are well appreciated, chronic mild hypokalemia can accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease, exacerbate systemic hypertension, and increase mortality. Persistent hypokalemia may reflect total-body potassium depletion or increased renal potassium clearance. In a patient with simple potassium depletion, potassium replacement therapy should correct serum potassium concentration, but may have little effect when renal potassium clearance is abnormally increased from potassium wasting. In such cases, the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics might be helpful. Serum potassium concentration is an inaccurate marker of total-body potassium deficit. Mild hypokalemia may be associated with significant total-body potassium deficits and conversely, total-body potassium stores can be normal in patients with hypokalemia due to redistribution. The speed and extent of potassium replacement should be dictated by the clinical picture and guided by frequent reassessment of serum potassium concentration(.) The goals of therapy should be to correct a potassium deficit, if present, without provoking hyperkalemia. Oral replacement is preferred except when there is no functioning bowel or in the setting of electrocardiogram changes, neurologic symptoms, cardiac ischemia, or digitalis therapy.

### Finerenone (Kerendia) [^1172Fcb1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hyperkalemia. Patients with decreased kidney function and higher baseline potassium levels are at increased risk. Monitor serum potassium levels and adjust dose as needed. (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1)
Worsening of Renal Function in Patients with Heart Failure. Measure eGFR and adjust dose as needed. (2.1, 2.3, 6.1)

5.1 Hyperkalemia

Kerendia can cause hyperkalemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The risk for developing hyperkalemia increases with decreasing kidney function and is greater in patients with higher baseline potassium levels or other risk factors for hyperkalemia. Measure serum potassium and eGFR in all patients before initiation of treatment with Kerendia and dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Do not initiate Kerendia if serum potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L.

Measure serum potassium periodically during treatment with Kerendia and adjust dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. More frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients at risk for hyperkalemia, including those on concomitant medications that impair potassium excretion or increase serum potassium [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

5.2 Worsening of Renal Function in Patients with Heart Failure

Kerendia can cause worsening of renal function in patients with heart failure. Rarely, severe events associated with worsening renal function, including events requiring hospitalization, have been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Measure eGFR in all patients before initiation of treatment or with dose titration of Kerendia and dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)]. Initiation of Kerendia in patients with heart failure and an eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73m is not recommended.

Measure eGFR periodically during maintenance treatment with Kerendia in patients with heart failure. Consider delaying up-titration or interrupting treatment with Kerendia in patients who develop clinically significant worsening of renal function.

### Long-term mortality and trajectory of potassium measurements following an episode of acute severe hyperkalaemia [^115B7JKF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

severe hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with a higher risk of short-term adverse clinical events such as ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Information about the long-term clinical consequences after an episode of severe hyperkalaemia remains scarce; and
we conducted a retrospective observational study that evaluated the long-term the trajectory of potassium and risk of mortality in patients with acute severe hyperkalaemia (K > 6 mEq/L).

What this study adds?

severe hyperkalaemia may occur in patients who did not have chronic kidney disease (25% of our patients);
after developing severe hyperkalaemia, recurrent hyperkalaemia is a frequent finding, especially during the first 6 months after the discharge;
following an acute severe hyperkalaemia episode, potassium trajectories predict the risk of death; and
during the post-discharge follow-up, transitioning from normal to higher potassium levels or persisting high values was associated with higher risk of death.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

this study strengthens the importance of close clinical and potassium monitoring after an episode of acute hyperkalaemia; and
it reinforces the fact that new and well-tolerated treatments after discharge from a hyperkalaemia-related hospitalization should be strongly considered.

### Management of hyperkalaemia in chronic kidney disease [^114C8jgq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in part because of the effects of kidney dysfunction on potassium homeostasis and in part because of the cluster of comorbidities (and their associated treatments) that occur in patients with CKD. Owing to its electrophysiological effects, severe hyperkalaemia represents a medical emergency that usually requires prompt intervention, whereas the prevention of hazardous hyperkalaemic episodes in at-risk patients requires measures aimed at the long-term normalization of potassium homeostasis. The options for effective and safe medical interventions to restore chronic potassium balance are few, and long-term management of hyperkalaemia is primarily limited to the correction of modifiable exacerbating factors. This situation can result in a difficult trade-off in patients with CKD, because drugs that are beneficial to these patients (for example, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system antagonists) are often the most prominent cause of their hyperkalaemia. Maintaining the use of these beneficial medications while implementing various strategies to control potassium balance is desirable; however, discontinuation rates remain high. The emergence of new medications that specifically target hyperkalaemia could lead to a therapeutic paradigm shift, emphasizing preventive management over ad hoc treatment of incidentally discovered elevations in serum potassium levels.

### Tolvaptan [^111o5g72]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6	Hyperkalemia or Drugs that Increase Serum Potassium

Treatment with tolvaptan is associated with an acute reduction of the extracellular fluid volume which could result in increased serum potassium. Serum potassium levels should be monitored after initiation of tolvaptan treatment in patients with a serum potassium > 5 mEq/L as well as those who are receiving drugs known to increase serum potassium levels.

5.7 Acute Urinary Retention with Outflow Obstruction

Patients with partial obstruction of urinary outflow, for example, patients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition, have an increased risk of developing acute retention. Do not administer tolvaptan in patients with uncorrected urinary outflow obstruction.

### Efficacy of potassium supplementation in hypokalemic patients receiving peritoneal dialysis: a randomized controlled trial [^111SbW8q]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has been associated with increased risks of peritonitis and death. Whether correction of hypokalemia improves these outcomes is unknown.

Study Design

Multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

Adult (aged ≥ 18 years) PD patients with hypokalemia (defined as at least 3 values or an average value < 3.5 mEq/L in the past 6 months). Randomization was stratified according to center and residual urine output (≤ 100 or > 100 mL/day).

Interventions

Random assignment to either protocol-based potassium supplementation (titratable dose of oral potassium chloride to maintain serum potassium of 4–5 mEq/L) or conventional potassium supplementation (reactive supplementation when serum potassium is < 3.5 mEq/L) over 52 weeks. Treatment groups were compared using intention-to-treat analyses implemented using Cox proportional hazards regression.

Outcome

The primary outcome was time from randomization to first peritonitis episode (any organism). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization, and conversion to hemodialysis.

Results

A total of 167 patients with time-averaged serum potassium concentrations of 3.33 ± 0.28 mEq/L were enrolled from 6 PD centers: 85 were assigned to receive protocol-based treatment, and 82 were assigned to conventional treatment. The median follow-up time was 401 (IQR, 315–417) days. During the study period, serum potassium levels in the protocol-based treatment group increased to 4.36 ± 0.70 mEq/L compared with 3.57 ± 0.65 mEq/L in the group treated conventionally (mean difference, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53–0.79] mEq/L; P < 0.001). The median time to first peritonitis episode was significantly longer in the protocol-based group (223 [IQR, 147–247] vs 133 [IQR, 41–197] days, P = 0.03). Compared with conventional treatment, the protocol-based group had a significantly lower hazard of peritonitis (HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.24–0.93]) but did not differ significantly with respect to any of the secondary outcomes. Asymptomatic hyperkalemia (> 6 mEq/L) without characteristic electrocardiographic changes occurred in 3 patients (4%) in the protocol-based treatment group.

Limitations

Not double-masked.

Conclusions

Compared with reactive potassium supplementation when the serum potassium level falls below 3.5 mEq/L, protocol-based oral potassium treatment to maintain a serum potassium concentration in the range of 4–5 mEq/L may reduce the risk of peritonitis in patients receiving PD who have hypokalemia.

### Novel bloodless potassium determination using a signal-processed single-lead ECG [^115QGZSX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blood potassium levels are tightly regulated homeostatically and are critical for normal physiological cellular function. 1, 2 Fluctuations in potassium values are found in many disease states and can expose patients to life‐threatening arrhythmias. 3, 4, 5 Compelling evidence shows that in patients with renal or cardiac disease, even modest potassium changes may lead to morbidity, hospitalization, and death. 6 Moreover, evidence‐based therapies used to treat these conditions, including adrenergic blockade, potassium‐sparing diuretics, and renin–angiotensin antagonism, result in hyper‐ or hypokalemia. After the potassium‐sparing diuretic spironolactone was shown to lower heart failure mortality in a randomized prospective trial, hospitalization for hyperkalemia tripled and mortality doubled. 7 As the prevalence of these diseases and their risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) rise, and as the population continues to age, increasing numbers of patients will be at risk of hyper‐ and hypokalemia. 8, 9

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^115GDr43]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study End Points

The primary end point was the mean absolute reduction in serum potassium level from baseline at 3 distinct time intervals after patiromer administration: 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. These time intervals were prespecified to facilitate analysis in the absence of a standardized, institutional hyperkalemia protocol. Reduction of serum potassium levels was also assessed using relative (percentage) reduction owing to the hypothesized mechanism of more prominent lowering with higher baseline elevation. Outcomes were compared across prespecified subgroups based on care setting, patiromer dose, and baseline hyperkalemia severity stratified as mild (potassium level, 5.1–5.5 mEq/L), moderate (potassium level, 5.6–6.4 mEq/L), or severe (potassium level, ≥ 6.5 mEq/L). Subsequent use of any potassium binder was captured as well as standard-of-care hyperkalemia control measures (eg, calcium, albuterol, regular insulin coadministered with dextrose, and dialysis). Time to a second potassium binder dose and time to insulin dose were assessed. Incidence of hypokalemia, defined as a serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L, and incidence of hypomagnesemia, defined as a serum magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL or less (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.4114), at 24 hours were recorded. Potassium laboratory test orders and their performance times after the initial patiromer administration were evaluated at intervals of 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. The time to the earliest recheck and the presence of repeated laboratory tests in each time interval were evaluated to provide insight on potassium monitoring patterns in real-world clinical practice without a treatment protocol.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^116aq76K]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Although hyperkalemia was increased in both trials, the incidence of hyperkalemia‐related adverse events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalemia‐related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving finerenone versus 0.6% with placebo. Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L were detected until potassium concentrations fell to < 5.0 mmol/L. With a robust potassium management strategy guided by regular monitoring of serum potassium, there were no hyperkalemia‐related deaths in more than 13,000 patients over a median follow‐up of 3 years.

### Serum potassium in the PARADIGM-HF trial [^111Sp68S]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

PARADIGM‐HF

The design, methods and principal results of the PARADIGM‐HF trial have been previously reported. 13 In brief, the trial was a randomized, double‐blind, prospective comparison of the effect of sacubitril (97 mg) and valsartan (103 mg) administered twice daily (LCZ696, 200 mg twice daily) and that of enalapril (10 mg twice daily) in 8399 patients with chronic HF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II–IV] and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 40%. Prior to randomization, all participants underwent single‐blind, sequential run‐in periods to ensure the tolerability of both study drugs at target doses. Eligible patients were those treated with an appropriate regimen of background HF medications at stable doses for at least 4 weeks, including an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (at a dose equivalent to enalapril 10 mg/day or greater) and a beta‐blocker (unless not tolerated). The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) was left to the discretion of the investigators but was encouraged if tolerated. Key exclusion criteria included symptomatic hypotension, a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of < 100 mmHg at screening or 95 mmHg at randomization, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 at screening/randomization or a decrease in the eGFR of > 25% (amended to 35%) between screening and randomization, and a serum K + level of > 5.2 mmol/L at screening or > 5.4 mmol/L at randomization. Serum K + was measured at every study visit (Supplementary material online, Table S1). The protocol recommended that any patient with serum potassium of > 5.3 mmol/L after randomization required regular, repeated checks of potassium concentration (beyond that prescribed in the protocol) until it was clear that the potassium concentration was stable and not rising to levels of concern (≥ 5.5 mmol/L and < 6.0 mmol/L) or potential danger (≥ 6.0 mmol/L). 13 No recommendation for dose adjustment in the setting of hypokalaemia was given. The primary composite endpoint was death from cardiovascular (CV) causes or first hospitalization for HF (CV death/HF hospitalization). The present analysis also examines CV, all‐cause and sudden cardiac death (or resuscitated cardiac arrest). The median follow‐up time was 810 (range: 564–1069) days or 116 (range: 81–153) weeks. The trial was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each participating site, and all participants provided written informed consent prior to participation.

### Pharmacological interventions for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults [^114mdtLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbance which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death. Renal replacement therapy is known to be effective in treating hyperkalaemia, but safe and effective pharmacological interventions are needed to prevent dialysis or avoid the complications of hyperkalaemia until dialysis is performed.

Objectives

This review looked at the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used in the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults. This review evaluated the therapies that reduce serum potassium as well as those that prevent complications of hyperkalaemia.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 18 August 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at any pharmacological intervention for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults were included in this review. Non-standard study designs such as cross-over studies were also included. Eligible studies enrolled adults (aged 18 years and over) with hyperkalaemia, defined as serum potassium concentration ≥ 4.9 mmol/L, to receive pharmacological therapy to reduce serum potassium or to prevent arrhythmias. Patients with artificially induced hyperkalaemia were excluded from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

All three authors screened titles and abstracts, and data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed independently by at least two authors. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Authors were contacted when information about results or study methodology was missing from the original publication. Although we planned to group all studies of a particular pharmacological therapy regardless of administration route or dose for analysis, we were unable to conduct meta-analyses because of the small numbers of studies evaluating any given treatment. For continuous data we reported mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included seven studies (241 participants) in this review. Meta-analysis of these seven included studies was not possible due to heterogeneity of the treatments and because many of the studies did not provide sufficient statistical information with their results. Allocation and blinding methodology was poorly described in most studies. No study evaluated the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for preventing clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality and cardiac arrhythmias; however there is evidence that several commonly used therapies effectively reduce serum potassium levels. Salbutamol administered via either nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) significantly reduced serum potassium compared with placebo. The peak effect of 10 mg nebulised salbutamol was seen at 120 minutes (MD -1.29 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.94) and at 90 minutes for 20 mg nebulised salbutamol (1 study: MD -1.18 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.54 to -0.82). One study reported 1.2 mg salbutamol via MDI 1.2 mg produced a significant decrease in serum potassium beginning at 10 minutes (MD -0.20 mmol/L, P < 0.05) and a maximal decrease at 60 minutes (MD -0.34 mmol/L, P < 0.0001). Intravenous (IV) and nebulised salbutamol produced comparable effects (2 studies). When compared to other interventions, salbutamol had similar effect to insulin-dextrose (2 studies) but was more effective than bicarbonate at 60 minutes (MD -0.46 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.10; 1 study). Insulin-dextrose was more effective than IV bicarbonate (1 study) and aminophylline (1 study). Insulin-dextrose, bicarbonate and aminophylline were not studied in any placebo-controlled studies. None of the included studies evaluated the effect of IV calcium or potassium binding resins in the treatment of hyperkalaemia.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the acute pharmacological management of hyperkalaemia is limited, with no clinical studies demonstrating a reduction in adverse patient outcomes. Of the studied agents, salbutamol via any route and IV insulin-dextrose appear to be most effective at reducing serum potassium. There is limited evidence to support the use of other interventions, such as IV sodium bicarbonate or aminophylline. The effectiveness of potassium binding resins and IV calcium salts has not been tested in RCTs and requires further study before firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the out-of-hospital evaluation and treatment of accidental hypothermia: 2019 update [^114TUaY4]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Accidental hypothermia — biochemical marker guidance for ongoing resuscitation reports that increased serum potassium usually indicates hypoxia, serving as a marker of cell lysis and death, and that the highest potassium in a patient resuscitated from hypothermia was 11.8 mmol·L-1 in a 31-mo-old child, with a repeat 25 min later of 4.8 mmol·L-1; the highest levels recorded in patients who were resuscitated were 9.5 mmol·L-1 in a 13-y-old and 7.9 mmol·L-1 in a 34-y-old. The recommendation states that if an adult hypothermic patient has a potassium > 12 mmol·L-1, CPR should be terminated (Evidence grade: 1B).

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting [^112Ruzdf]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (serum K + > 5.0 mmol/L) is commonly observed among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Current international guidelines may not reflect the latest evidence on managing hyperkalemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and there is a lack of high-quality published studies in this area. This consensus guideline aims to provide recommendations in relation to clinical practice. Available published evidence was evaluated through a systematic literature review, and the nominal group technique was used to develop consensus recommendations from a panel of experienced nephrologists, covering monitoring, dietary restrictions, prescription of K + binders, and concomitant prescription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Recent studies have shown that K + binders reduce the incidence of hyperkalemia, but further evidence is needed in areas including whether reduced-K + diets or treatment with K + binders improve patient-centered outcomes. Treatment of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting is complex, and decisions need to be tailored for individual patients.

### High and low serum potassium associated with cardiovascular events in diuretic-treated patients [^116MG99P]. Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relationship of moderately high and low concentrations of serum potassium with cardiovascular disease events among treated hypertensive patients.

Design

An observational cohort study with prospectively collected data.

Setting

A worksite treatment program for mild hypertension.

Patients

All program participants with baseline and at least one annual follow-up measure of serum potassium; 7,653 individuals with 6.7 years mean follow-up met these criteria.

Main Outcome Measures

Outcome events were admissions to hospital because of cardiovascular disease, and deaths. The research question regarding serum potassium categories was formulated after data collection. The serum potassium concentration (mean ± 2SD) of the study population was used to define low (3.0–3.5 mmol/l), high (5.1–5.9 mmol/l) and middle (3.6–5.0 mmol/l) categories.

Results

Individuals with low (n = 146) and high (n = 226) serum potassium had significantly greater risk for cardiovascular disease events than those in the middle category (n = 7,281). Multivariate adjusted hazard ratios from Cox models were 2.6 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.5–4.4] for the low potassium group and 1.7 (95% CI 1.0–2.7) for the high potassium group, with the middle group as reference. Among 1,679 individuals who regularly took diuretics, hazard ratios were 4.3 (95% CI 2.4–7.9) for the low potassium group and 6.7 (95% CI 2.8–15.9) for the high group. Neither low nor high potassium was significantly associated with outcome events for those not regularly using diuretics.

Conclusions

These data confirm an association of mild hypokalemia with increased cardiovascular events among diuretic-treated hypertensive patients. In addition, we have found a similar increased cardiovascular risk associated with modest hyperkalemia among these patients. Whether modification of these serum potassium concentrations would alter that risk remains to be determined.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^115Lhcuz]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Management of hyperkalemia — triage and EKG-based severity classification states that aggressiveness of treatment depends on the degree of elevation and the presence or absence of electrocardiogram (EKG) findings; outpatients with acute hyperkalemia who have a potassium concentration of > 6.0 mmol/L or any new EKG changes should be referred to a facility with cardiac monitoring, usually an emergency department; a KDIGO Controversies Conference suggests classifying acute hyperkalemia as Mild: 5.0*-5.9 mmol/L without EKG changes, Moderate: 5.0*-5.9 mmol/L with EKG changes or 6.0–6.4 mmol/L without EKG changes, and Severe: 6.0–6.4 mmol/L with EKG changes or > 6.5 mmol/L regardless of EKG findings; the asterisk denotes "or upper limit of normal range", and they acknowledge it is not known whether EKG changes are sensitive in predicting potentially lethal arrhythmia.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: probably not O"K" [^111b1mZi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is routinely defined as a serum potassium level > 5 mmol/L and is a common occurrence in patients with acute and chronic heart failure (HF). For example, prior work has demonstrated that hyperkalemia is present in ≈9% of patients admitted for acute HF, 1 and the total annual charges for Medicare admissions related to a primary diagnosis of hyperkalemia are substantial, with estimates as high as $697 million in 2011. 2 Elevated potassium levels may affect the activity of myocardial potassium channels, leading to more rapid membrane depolarization. The downstream effects of this may translate into slower myocardial electrical conduction, resulting in malignant tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Hyperkalemia, especially with potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/L, has been consistently linked to poor clinical outcomes in patients with HF. 3, 4 Recent estimates from the PARADIGM‐HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial suggest the incidence of hyperkalemia in a trial population receiving treatment with renin‐angiotensin system inhibition (RASi) was ≈16% over a median follow‐up time of 27 months, despite a highly selected and carefully monitored clinical trial population. 5 Similarly, in a large cohort from the United Kingdom of 19 194 patients with new‐onset HF, 11% developed hyperkalemia during a 4‐year follow‐up. 6 Multiple prior analyses of clinical trials and population‐based studies identify renal dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the use of mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) and RASi as major risk factors for hyperkalemia. Given that 5.7 million people in the United States alone have HF and this number is increasing, there is an overwhelming number of patients at risk for hyperkalemia and associated adverse events. 7 Patients with HF are at a particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely reflective of their medical comorbidity, including renal dysfunction. In addition, several of the current medical therapies for the management of HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) add to this risk. These include cornerstone therapies, such as the following: (1) RASi, including angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor inhibitors with or without neprilysin inhibition; and (2) MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone. Whether a consequence of a real or perceived risk of hyperkalemia, evidence supports that these therapies are underused, and when used there is suboptimal dose titration. 8, 9 Although there are data to support that mild hyperkalemia (potassium level, 5–5.5 mmol/L) in the setting of RASi and MRA therapy might not be associated with poor clinical outcomes, hyperkalemia in HF remains a major clinical dilemma. 3, 10

### Association between potassium supplementation and the occurrence of acute kidney injury in patients with hypokalemia administered liposomal amphotericin B: a nationwide observational study [^115UbiuU]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

The occurrence of any stage of AKI was not associated with potassium supplementation in patients with hypokalemia administered L-AMB, which was confirmed after adjusting for potential confounding variables. As L-AMB treatment decreases serum potassium levels, in a portion of the study subjects supplemented with potassium, insufficient correction or maintenance failure of serum potassium levels might lead to renal dysfunction. Considering that potassium supplementation prior to deterioration of hypokalemia effectively corrected serum potassium levels in patients treated with L-AMB, early potassium supplementation might be effective for preventing AKI. For patients treated with L-AMB, appropriate timing for potassium supplementation after hypokalemia onset, proper dosing or duration of potassium supplementation, as well as the potential effects on renal dysfunction must be further elucidated.

Before applying the criteria of patient selection for AKI evaluation, we observed that 43% (122/282) of the patients developed hypokalemia (< 3.5 mEq/L serum potassium) after L-AMB initiation, which agreed with the value reported in another study. In patients who developed hypokalemia after L-AMB initiation, the time from hypokalemia onset to AKI onset tended to be longer in patients supplemented with potassium than in those who did not receive potassium supplementation (supplementation: 11.0 ± 10.6 days, non-supplementation: 6.3 ± 3.7 days, P = 0.073). The time from L-AMB initiation to hypokalemia onset was similar between both populations (supplementation: 4.1 ± 2.4 days, non-supplementation: 4.6 ± 4.2 days, P = 0.724). Potassium supplementation was promptly performed within 1.5 ± 1.3 days after hypokalemia onset. Thus, potassium supplementation might be effective at delaying AKI development in patients who develop hypokalemia after L-AMB initiation.

### Acute treatment of hyperkalemia… [^117LTsys]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best acute treatment of an elevated serum potassium level. Evidence-Based Answer According to disease-oriented evidence, insulin and intravenous glucose, inhaled albuterol, and dialysis are the best treatment options; the first two may be given in combination. Bicarbonate or resins are not recommended for routine use, particularly without one of the more effective agents listed above. Practice Pointers Acute treatment of hyperkalemia falls into the still considerable "widely used but little studied" category of medical interventions. No study has reported outcomes that matter to patients, such as the likelihood of death or cardiac arrhythmias. The available literature focuses largely on the ability of interventions to lower serum potassium levels acutely. The Cochrane review by Mahoney and colleagues applies to patients with a significantly elevated potassium level.

Each patient acts as his or her own control, so it is possible to have a much smaller sample size and still obtain statistically significant results. Only four studies used blinding, and only four concealed allocation to treatment groups adequately. Most of the patients studied had acute or chronic renal failure and were receiving hemodialysis. Nebulized or inhaled albuterol proved effective; a dose of 20 mg was more effective than 10 mg in lowering potassium levels, and both doses were better than placebo. Intravenous albuterol and levalbuterol were no more effective than inhaled albuterol. The combination of insulin with intravenous glucose was effective, as was dialysis. In one study, the combination of insulin, glucose, and inhaled albuterol was more effective than insulin and glucose alone. Although potassium-binding polystyrene resins such as Kayexalate are widely used, only one study evaluated their effectiveness in the acute setting, and they proved ineffective.

Adding bicarbonate to insulin and glucose was helpful in one study but not in another. A review of the National Guideline Clearinghouse Website did not identify any practice guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia. Recommendations from textbooks vary considerably. For example, Griffith's 5-Minute Clinical Consult 2005 1 recommends dextrose and insulin, sodium bicarbonate, and polystyrene resins but does not mention inhaled beta agonists.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^1158EG2z]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially lethal disorder. Given its variable presentation, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. The present case highlights key physiologic mechanisms in the development of hyperkalemia and provides an outline for emergent treatment. In this context, we discuss specific mechanisms of action of available treatments of hyperkalemia.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^116tDQbo]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Both absolute and relative potassium reduction from baseline varied across baseline potassium level categories (Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement) but not by care setting (eFigures 4 and 5 in the Supplement). In addition, there appeared to be a trend toward a greater relative reduction in potassium levels associated with patiromer doses of 16.8 g or more compared with 8.4 g at greater than 12 to 24 hours (eFigure 6 in the Supplement).

Figure 2.
Absolute Serum Potassium Level Reduction by Hyperkalemia Severity

Whiskers indicate SEs.

In the 24 hours after the initial administration of patiromer, in 725 encounters (82.3%), patients received no further doses of potassium binders, whereas in 137 encounters (15.5%), patients received 1 additional dose and in 19 encounters (2.2%), patients received 2 or more additional doses (Table 2). Of those receiving additional binder doses, the mean (SD) time to administration was 14.8 (5.7) hours. In addition, in 76 encounters (8.6%), patients received at least 1 dose of insulin in the 24 hours after patiromer administration, which was administered within a mean (SD) of 13.5 (6.7) hours from the initial patiromer dose. Other subsequent standard-of-care measures for hyperkalemia included furosemide treatment (77 encounters [8.7%]), hemodialysis (8 [0.9%]), and intravenous calcium treatment (91 [10.3%]). In the sensitivity analysis, which excluded any laboratory results obtained after adjunct potassium control measures, the overall trends in potassium levels after patiromer administration remained largely unchanged (eFigures 7–9 in the Supplement).

Table 2.
Evaluation of Outcomes Associated With Patiromer, Including Potassium Measurement Trends

In 2 encounters (0.2%), patients experienced a hypokalemia episode (serum potassium level, < 3.5 mEq/L), and in 68 encounters (10.0%), patients developed hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium level, < 1.7 mg/dL) after patiromer administration. Both episodes of hypokalemia were mild and asymptomatic, with a serum potassium concentration between 3.2 and 3.4 mEq/L.

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis [^112zz4it]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Marked Abnormalities of Serum Potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L Reported as Adverse Events

Very few marked abnormalities of increased potassium were reported by the individual study investigators as clinical AEs: 7 (0.3%) in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group versus 0 in the placebo group. One SAE of hyperkalemia (serum potassium of 6.4 mmol/L on day 169 of treatment) was reported in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group. This patient had a history of hyperkalemia and hypertension and was treated with perindopril, which was stopped on day 175. His re-test potassium measurement was 6.1 mmol/L on day 176 and on day 178 this had decreased further to 4.5 mmol/L, at which point the SAE was considered resolved. Dapagliflozin dosing was not interrupted during this time.

All other AEs of hyperkalemia reported for patients in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group were reported as mild or moderate and had resolved by the next laboratory measurement (7 to 25 days later). No other patients had an AE that required treatment and no patients discontinued due to an AE of hyperkalemia.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself, but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed.

The median time to a serum K + level of ≤ 5.5 mmol/L in the overall population was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.1–2.0) h (Table 2). The median time to normalization of serum K + levels to ≤ 5.0 mmol/L was 21.6 (95% CI, 4.1–22.4) h. Although patients with higher baseline serum K + levels experienced longer median times to normalization than patients with lower serum K + levels, all but one patient with baseline serum K + level of > 6.5 mmol/L achieved serum K + ≤ 5.5 mmol/L within 48 h (median time [95% CI], 20.6 [2.2–24.3] h). The median time to achievement of serum K + level ≤ 5.1 mmol/L is presented in Additional file 4: Table S1. When examining the time to achievement of i-STAT K + levels ≤ 5.5, ≤ 5.1, and ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, it was found that i-STAT K + goals were achieved in less time than serum K + goals (Additional file 5: Table S2).

2.2 Dosage for Administration in Intravenous Fluids to Correct Hypophosphatemia

POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION provides phosphorus 3 mmol/mL (potassium 4.7 mEq/mL).

The dosage is dependent upon the individual needs of the patient, and the contribution of phosphorus and potassium from other sources.

Initial or Single Dose

The phosphorus doses in Table 1 are general recommendations for an initial or single dose and are intended for most patients. Based upon clinical requirements, some patients may require a lower or higher dose. The maximum initial or single dose of phosphorus is 45 mmol (potassium 71 mEq) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), start at the low end of the dose range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium serum concentrations.

cup to a maximum of phosphorus 45 mmol (potassium 71 mEq) as a single dose.

Concentration and Intravenous Infusion Rate

The concentration of the diluted solution and the infusion rate is dependent upon whether administration will be through a peripheral or central venous catheter.

Peripheral administration:

The maximum recommended concentration is phosphorus 6.4 mmol/100 mL (potassium10 mEq/100 mL).
The maximum recommended infusion rate is approximately phosphorus 6.4 mmol/hour (potassium 10 mEq/hour).

Central administration:

The maximum recommended concentration is phosphorus 18 mmol/100 mL (potassium 28.2 mEq/100 mL).
The maximum recommended infusion rate is approximately phosphorus 15 mmol/hour (potassium 23.5 mEq/hour).

Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and infusion through a central venous catheter is recommended for infusion rates of potassium higher than 10 mEq/hour in adults and 0.5 mEq/kg/hour in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.

Repeated Dosing

Additional dose(s) following the initial dose may be needed in some patients. Prior to administration of
additional doses, assess the patient clinically and obtain serum phosphorous, calcium and potassium
concentrations and adjust the dose accordingly.

Monitoring

In the general patient population, potassium levels are often elevated. Approximately 6.8% of the Japanese population is estimated to have hyperkalemia (defined as at least two serum potassium readings ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) based on the results of a medical database analysis. Similarly, a Swedish study examining 364,955 patients who accessed healthcare over a 3-year period revealed a 7% incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as potassium > 5 mEq/L) with a 35.7% rate of recurrence.

Regular monitoring allows drug dosages to be adjusted based on serum potassium levels. A long-term potassium monitoring study in patients with heart failure suggested that maintenance of serum potassium levels within the normal range should be considered a therapeutic target, allowing clinicians to modify treatment and mitigate risks to improve clinical outcomes for patients. In patients with diabetes being treated with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or spironolactone, compared with no monitoring, regular monitoring of serum potassium has been shown to decrease the risk of hyperkalemia-related adverse events (adjusted relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.37–0.66). According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, the suggested frequency of serum potassium monitoring after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is as follows: every 4–12 weeks for serum potassium ≤ 4.5 mEq/L, every 2–4 weeks for 4.6–5 mEq/L, and more frequently than every 2 weeks for > 5 mEq/L. The American Heart Association states that potassium levels and renal function should typically be checked on days 3 and 7 after initiating therapy with aldosterone antagonists and then at least monthly for the first 3 months. However, the frequency of serum potassium measurement is not described in the guidelines published by the Japanese Society of Nephrology or Japanese societies related to CVD.

To avoid the risk of false positive findings, serum potassium levels need to be measured carefully. Causes of false positives include hemolysis, delay in sample processing, long-term cold storage, and contamination of blood samples with antiseptics or potassium salts from blood collection tubes. Careful collection techniques and proper sample handling and storage are therefore essential.

Additional suggestions for clinicians intending to prescribe RAASis include pretreatment GFR and baseline serum potassium determination (to identify or exclude high-risk patients), dosage titration, and discontinuation of potassium supplements or concomitant maintenance treatment with loop or thiazide diuretics.

### Response to: hyperkalaemia in heart failure: binding the patient to improved treatment? [^114KWHhL]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

We appreciate the insightful and balanced Editorial 1 by Dr Konstam regarding our study. 2 However, we wish to take issue with one of his statements and its implications. The Editorial states, "Over 4 weeks, in each trial, patients were allowed to have serum potassium levels as high as 6.2 mmol/L (HARMONIZE) or 6.5 mmol/L (OPAL‐HK) without intervention and, apparently, they tolerated these levels without difficulty", as well as the follow‐up statement, "These findings strongly suggest that down‐titration of RAASi in response to lower levels of hyperkalaemia may be unnecessarily conservative for most patients as long as potassium levels and kidney function are carefully monitored". 1 We would like to point out that in OPAL‐HK, 3 during the first 3 weeks of the study, patients were treated using a dosing algorithm that required increasing the patiromer dose or discontinuing the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) if serum potassium was observed to be 5.5 to < 6.5 mmol/L. Patients were only allowed to maintain a serum potassium in this range during a relatively short period (up to ∼9 days) of dose adjustment of either patiromer or their RAASi. 3 While there were no apparent deaths related to a serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L during the initial 4‐week treatment phase of this relatively small study, 2 this does not suggest that these levels of serum potassium or even levels as low as 5.1 mmol/L can be safely tolerated without intervention. There is increasing evidence that in patients with comorbidities — such as chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and/or diabetes mellitus — especially those over 65 years of age and those who have recently experienced a myocardial infarction, a serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L is associated with an increased risk of death. 4 Of particular importance is a study of VA patients in which increased mortality was found within 1 day of observing a serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L. 5 We would caution against allowing patients with even mild hyperkalaemia to remain without appropriate intervention. We would, however, agree with Dr Konstam's statement that, "With the availability of these newer, safer, more tolerable potassium‐binding agents and the demonstrated potential for retaining higher doses of RAASi, it is important to take the next step and explore a connection between the pharmacodynamics of these agents and reduced morbidity and mortality through well‐designed, prospective randomized clinical trials in patients with heart failure". 1

### Potassium chloride (potassium chloride for oral solution) [^112jCLAA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the contents of 1 pouch of potassium chloride for oral solution in at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that the addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic BP (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR ≥ 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2, with reductions greater than with doxazosin, bisoprolol, or clonidine. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects; eplerenone is a potential alternative, but RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily and effective treatment may require higher dosages, and nonsteroidal MRA for moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

Definitions of hyperkalemia

Definitions of hyperkalemia vary by geographic region. In Europe, mild hyperkalemia is defined as serum potassium 5.0–5.4 mEq/L, moderate as 5.5–5.9 mEq/L, and severe as ≥ 6.0 mEq/L. The American Heart Association uses cutoffs of 5–6 mEq/L (mild), 6–7 mEq/L (moderate), and > 7 mEq/L (severe). However, in this review, we refer to the standard potassium values specified in the guidelines published by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare entitled "Classification criteria for the seriousness of adverse drug reactions of medical agents", wherein serum potassium values of ≥ 5.5 mEq/L and < 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 2 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and values of ≥ 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 3 ADRs. For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), Japanese nephrology guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.5 mEq/L to avoid hypo- or hyperkalemia. Of note, mild to moderate hyperkalemia generally cannot be diagnosed from electrocardiogram (ECG) changes; a study in hospitalized patients indicated that the first ECG changes occurred at serum potassium levels above 7.2 mEq/L, a level that already indicates severe hyperkalemia.

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

At the end of the run-in, patients with serum potassium 5.5 to < 6.5 mEq/l entered the treatment phase and began patiromer 8.4 g twice daily with meals for 2 days, for a total of four doses (i.e. at baseline (time 0) and 10, 24, and 34 h after the first dose). All patients received the same amount of patiromer regardless of their serum potassium. Serum potassium was assessed 1 h before treatment, at baseline just before treatment (time 0), and 4, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 24, 28, 31, 34, 36, 38, 41, 44, 48, and 58 h after the first patiromer dose. Patients were discharged from the CRU at 58 h and were instructed to remain on a low-potassium diet (~50–75 mEq/day) during the post-discharge outpatient follow-up phase. Post-discharge follow-up assessments, including serum potassium, were performed on 5 and 8 days after the first dose (i.e. study days 9 and 12). Adverse events were collected throughout the inpatient phase and at each outpatient follow-up visit. Vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and blood samples for serum chemistry and hematology were measured at various intervals throughout the study. High potassium values that, in the opinion of the investigator, warranted immediate treatment could be managed according to the local standard of care.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^1139Tryh]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The understandably strong impulse to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia should therefore be tempered by consideration of the less visible risk of post-dialysis hypokalaemia. Pragmatically therefore one can conclude the following general principles:

Firstly, pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia should be controlled, though an overly tight range may be counterproductive, so the previously recommended target for pre-dialysis potassium still seems optimal (4.0–6.0mmol/L). Caveats to interpreting this range should be noted: firstly, achievement of pre-dialysis potassium within this range does not necessarily mean that dialysate potassium is optimal, and secondly, consistent adherence to treatment is most likely just as important as specifics of the potassium range or dialysis prescription.

Secondly, non-dialysate approaches to hyperkalaemia may sometimes be more favourable. Dietary reduction may be preferable if it can be achieved without an adverse effect on protein-calorie intake, and other dialysis changes may be appropriate, such as increasing blood flow, duration or frequency. Consideration could also be given to potassium binding resins.

Thirdly, lower dialysate potassium does increase the removal of potassium during each session, and based on the risk of arrhythmias due to hyperkalaemia, dialysate potassium should be reduced if other measures are not possible or successful. However, dialysate potassium should be no lower than is necessary to achieve this goal – individualization does therefore seem necessary, so that each patient uses the highest dialysate potassium which still controls pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. This pragmatic approach has probably driven the steady increase in the use of higher potassium dialysates, and reduction in the use of concentrations below 2.0mmol/L, over the 5 DOPPS phases between 1996 and 2015.

Finally, and particularly for measurements taken remote from the laboratory, the relatively high frequency of measurement errors (for example due to in vitro haemolysis) should be remembered when interpreting potassium levels.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the potassium chloride oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses; limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

### The management of hyperkalemia in patients with cardiovascular disease [^113km3w7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The development of hyperkalemia is common in patients with cardiac and kidney disease who are administered drugs that antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). As the results of large-scale clinical trials in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure demonstrate benefits of RAAS blockade alone or, in some cases, in combination therapies, the incidence of hyperkalemia has increased in clinical practice. Although there is potential for adverse events in the presence of hyperkalemia, there also are potential benefits of RAAS blockers that support their use in high-risk patient populations. Management of hyperkalemia may be improved by identifying the levels of potassium that may potentially induce harm and using appropriate strategies to avert the levels that may be dangerous or life threatening.

### Effects of presentation and electrocardiogram on time to treatment of hyperkalemia [^114y6bmm]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the time to treatment for emergency department (ED) patients with critical hyperkalemia and to determine whether the timing of treatment was associated with clinical characteristics or electrocardiographic abnormalities.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective chart review of ED patients with the laboratory diagnosis of hyperkalemia (potassium level > 6.0 mmol/L). Patients presenting in cardiac arrest or who were referred for hyperkalemia or dialysis were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed to find whether patients received specific treatment for hyperkalemia and, if so, what clinical attributes were associated with the time to initiation of treatment.

Results

Of 175 ED visits that occurred over a 1-year time period, 168 (96%) received specific treatment for hyperkalemia. The median time from triage to initiation of treatment was 117 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 59 to 196 minutes). The 7 cases in which hyperkalemia was not treated include 4 cases in which the patient was discharged home, with a missed diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Despite initiation of specific therapy for hyperkalemia in 168 cases, 2 patients died of cardiac arrhythmias. Among the patients who received treatment, 15% had a documented systolic blood pressure (sBP) < 90 mmHg, and 30% of treated patients were admitted to intensive care units. The median potassium value was 6.5 mmol/L (IQR = 6.3 to 7.1 mmol/L). The predominant complaints were dyspnea (20%) and weakness (19%). Thirty-six percent of patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Initial electrocardiograms (ECGs) were abnormal in 83% of patient visits, including 24% of ECGs with nonspecific ST abnormalities. Findings of peaked T-wave morphology (34%), first-degree atrioventricular block (17%), and interventricular conduction delay (12%) did not lead to early treatment. Vital sign abnormalities, including hypotension (sBP < 90 mmHg), were not associated with early treatment. The chief complaint of "unresponsive" was most likely to lead to early treatment; treatment delays occurred in patients not transported by ambulance, those with a chief complaint of syncope and those with a history of hypertension.

Conclusions

Recognition of patients with severe hyperkalemia is challenging, and the initiation of appropriate therapy for this disorder is frequently delayed.

Dialysate (Guidelines 5.1–5.4)

Guideline 5.1 -Selection of dialysate potassium

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum potassium in the range 4.0–6.0mmol/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to haemolysis) when interpreting levels. [1B]

We suggest choosing dialysate potassium between 1.0 and 3.0mmol/L for the majority of patients, using an individualised approach, in general using the highest dialysate potassium that is sufficient to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to managing hyperkalaemia, which may include decreasing dialysate potassium and/or other measures, including dietary advice, medication review and increased dialysis frequency. [2D]

Guideline 5.2 - Selection of dialysate buffer

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate in the range 18.0–26.0mmo/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to exposure to air) when interpreting levels. [1C]

We suggest the term 'dialysate buffer' rather than 'dialysate bicarbonate' to avoid confusion arising from differences in manufacturers' terminology. [2C]

We suggest choosing dialysate buffer below or equal to 37.0mEq/L for the majority of patients, using a standardised or individualised approach. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to abnormal pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate, which may include increasing dialysis dose, oral bicarbonate, nutritional support, or individualising dialysate buffer. [2D]

Guideline 5.3 - Supplementation of dialysate with phosphate

We suggest considering supplementation of the dialysate with phosphate in patients on augmented dialysis schedules. [2D]

Guideline 5.4 - Paediatric dialysate considerations

We recommend individualisation of dialysate electrolyte concentrations, including potassium, buffer and calcium. [1C]

We suggest an individualised dialysate temperature, between core temperature and 0.5°C below, with monitoring of intradialytic core temperature for neonates and smaller children. [2D]

Anticoagulation

We recommend that patients without increased bleeding risk should be given unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin during dialysis to reduce clotting of the extracorporeal system. [1A]

We recommend that systemic anticoagulation should be omitted or minimised in patients with increased bleeding risk. [1C]

We recommend that patients with heparin allergies should be prescribed a non-heparin form of anticoagulation. [1A]

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116AU5Ci]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

RAASi/MRA management in CKD with hyperkalemia includes a stepwise approach: Optimize serum bicarbonate levels; Consider potassium-exchange agents; Third-line (Last resort): Reduce or discontinue RAASi/MRA; restart in future if patient condition allows. Providers may consider reducing or stopping ACEI/ARB when eGFR drops below a given eGFR threshold or when hyperkalemia develops, but hyperkalemia associated with use of ACEI/ARB can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping ACEI/ARB. Protocols for RCTs of finerenone held the medication at potassium > 5.5 mmol/L; however, it may be appropriate to continue these medications in people with potassium of 5.5–6.0 mmol/L. We recommend involvement of nephrology when there is consideration of continuing ACEI/ARB/MRA when potassium > 5.5 mmol/L. The International Society of Nephrology provides an Optimization of RAASi Therapy Toolkit that includes guidance for managing hyperkalemia in patients on RAASi.

### Tailoring treatment of hyperkalemia [^112Sp5EZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol / L: pooled analysis from two phase 3 trials [^1174LzTA]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Efficacy outcomes

Treatment with SZC 10 g TID in the correction phase resulted in a reduction from baseline in mean serum K + levels in the overall population and in all serum K + subgroups (Fig. 1). In the overall population, serum K + levels decreased as early as 1 h after the first dose of SZC 10 g (mean [95% CI], −0.27 [−0.34 to −0.21]; p < 0.001 vs. baseline). Similar results were observed in the 5.5– < 6.0 and 6.0–6.5 mmol/L subgroups (p ≤ 0.001 for all comparisons vs. baseline). Patients in the > 6.5 mmol/L subgroup experienced a change from baseline in serum K + levels of −0.83 mmol/L by 2 h post dose (p < 0.05 vs. baseline). By 4 h post dose, changes from baseline in serum K + levels of −0.55, −0.70, and −0.82 mmol/L were observed in the 5.5– < 6.0, 6.0–6.5, and > 6.5 mmol/L subgroups, respectively (p ≤ 0.01 for all comparisons vs. baseline). Mean serum K + levels were decreased by 48 h after the initial dose in all baseline K + strata (Fig. 1). Patients with baseline serum K + level > 6.5 mmol/L experienced the largest reduction in serum K + levels by 48 h (−1.90 mmol/L; p < 0.01 vs. baseline). Similar results were observed when i-STAT K + levels were examined over time in the overall population and in all baseline serum K + strata (Additional file 1: Figure S1).

Hyperkalemia represents a widespread and potentially lethal condition that affects millions of people across their lives. Despite the prevalence and severity of the condition, there are no consensus guidelines on the treatment of hyperkalemia or even a standard definition. Herein, we provide a succinct review of what we believe to be the most significant misconceptions encountered in the emergency care of hyperkalemia, examine current available literature, and discuss practical points on several modalities of hyperkalemia treatment. Additionally, we review the pathophysiology of the electrocardiographic effects of hyperkalemia and how intravenous calcium preparations can antagonize these effects. We conclude each section with recommendations to aid emergency physicians in making safe and efficacious choices for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^111cZZL1]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5.1 - Selection of dialysate potassium

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum potassium in the range 4.0–6.0mmol/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to haemolysis) when interpreting levels. [1B]

We suggest choosing dialysate potassium between 1.0 and 3.0mmol/L for the majority of patients, using an individualised approach, in general using the highest dialysate potassium that is sufficient to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to managing hyperkalaemia, which may include decreasing dialysate potassium and/or other measures, including dietary advice, medication review and increased dialysis frequency. [2D]

Rationale

Historically, it was often difficult to remove the potassium accumulated between dialysis sessions, so dialysate potassium between zero and 2mmol/L was common. The requirement for dialysate with potassium levels that are close to, or within, the normal range reflects the increased efficiency of modern dialysis and the increased age of the modern patient. In most units dialysate potassium is determined by the choice of acid concentrate: zero potassium is no longer used, and suppliers offer concentrates with potassium between 1 and 4mmol/L.

Removal of accumulated potassium by intermittent haemodialysis inevitably leads to a fluctuating profile of serum potassium with a risk of cardiac arrhythmias at both high and low concentrations. This probably contributes to the clustering of sudden cardiac death around the peridialytic period, and at the end of the weekend gap.

8 HYPERKALEMIA MANAGEMENT: FOCUS ON NEW TREATMENTS

The treatment of chronic hyperkalemia can be difficult and may be life‐threatening if left untreated. Potassium binders such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate is mainly used in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia. This substance is only suitable for short‐term treatment since its use is associated with hypernatremia, volume overload and gastrointestinal complications. A suggested management of chronic hyperkalemia in HF patients is presented in Figure 1. However, their use is associated with adverse effects, their efficacy is ascertain and their effects are transient. In this regard, the introduction of patiromer, acting at the level of the gastrointestinal tract, in particular in the colon lumen, is relevant, 20, 21, 23, 24 may decrease serum potassium levels and enable treatment with RAASi and MRAs in significantly higher doses. Patiromer for oral suspension is a non‐absorbed, sodium‐free potassium binding polymer that exchanges calcium for potassium in the gastrointestinal tract. Patiromer beads are insoluble, have an average particle size of ≈100 μm and so are too large to be absorbed, excreted ≈24 to 48 h after intake and bind potassium predominantly in the lumen of the colon and this increases fecal potassium excretion, reducing levels of free potassium. 20, 21, 23, 24 The mean reduction of serum potassium levels by patiromer in large clinical trials was in the range 0.45 to 1 mmol/L. 52

FIGURE 1
Steps in the therapeutic management of hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure. RAASi, renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhbitors; MRAs, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Zirconium cyclosilicate (SCZ, former ZS‐9) — an inorganic cation that allows a thermodynamically favorable catching of potassium ions‐ represent another significant pharmacologic advancements in the treatment of hyperkalemia. More specifically SCZ is an oral, nonabsorbed, high‐capacity cation‐binding compound that selectively exchanges K + for hydrogen and sodium ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract and has rapid onset of action. A single treatment with SCZ may reduce serum K + levels at 1 h after the initial dose, results in a continued and sustained reduction in serum K + levels for up to 48 h after the initial dose and has a favorable safety profile. 53 The mean reduction of serum potassium levels by SCZ in large clinical trials was in the range 0.3 to 1.1 mmol/L. 52

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the potassium chloride solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Tolvaptan (Samsca) [^115cUmUC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Hyperkalemia or Drugs that Increase Serum Potassium

Treatment with tolvaptan is associated with an acute reduction of the extracellular fluid volume which could result in increased serum potassium. Serum potassium levels should be monitored after initiation of tolvaptan treatment in patients with a serum potassium > 5 mEq/L as well as those who are receiving drugs known to increase serum potassium levels.

5.7	Acute Urinary Retention with Outflow Obstruction

Patients with partial obstruction of urinary outflow, for example, patients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition, have an increased risk of developing acute retention. Do not administer tolvaptan in patients with uncorrected urinary outflow obstruction.

### Additional evidence for the treatment of potassium disorders… [^114pPBqW]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Deep tendon reflexes may be affected by extremes of potassium levels and are an important part of the physical examination. Calcium chloride must be administered through a central line, whereas 20 to 40 mEq per L of potassium per hour may be initially administered via two proximally placed, large-bore peripheral lines, if tolerated. However, the traditionally taught formula that 10 mEq per L of intravenous potassium replacement increases serum potassium by 0. 1 mEq per L is a great memory tool, it is not valid for extreme hypokalemia, as demonstrated by the Segal equation. 2–4 When hypokalemia is suspected, administer 1 to 2 g of magnesium sulfate in an intravenous bolus to decrease the risk of torsades de pointes because it is quicker than intravenous potassium and is analogous to administering calcium gluconate in the setting of hyperkalemia.

For hyperkalemia, use 5 units of intravenous insulin because this is equally effective as 10 units, with a lower hypoglycemia risk. 5 For hyperkalemia with hypovolemia and without metabolic acidosis, use lactated ringers instead of normal saline to avoid further transcellular shifts from hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. For hyperkalemia with hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis, consider the addition of isotonic bicarbonate solution. When contemplating between diuresis or dialysis for hyperkalemia, consider the "nephron bomb, " which includes: ○ Loop diuretic, ○ Thiazide diuretic. ○ As needed, acetazolamide, ○ As needed, fludrocortisone, particularly in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.
6.

4 The current evidence does not definitively favor one resuscitative fluid for each clinical scenario. In the most critically ill adults, balanced crystalloids such as lactated ringers have favorable outcomes. 5 The recommendation for dosing of isotonic bicarbonate in patients who have hyperkalemia with metabolic acidosis and other important considerations are provided in Table 6.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^111LZUAQ]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of hyperkalemia during antihypertensive treatment with esaxerenone

Clinical data from phase III studies showed that serum potassium levels returned to normal after withdrawal of esaxerenone, and no additional treatment was required. In the J301 and J302 studies, esaxerenone treatment was discontinued in five and four patients, respectively, with serum potassium measurements of ≥ 6.0 or ≥ 5.5 mEq/L on two consecutive occasions. In all patients, potassium levels normalized within 28 days.

Available clinical study data can be used to develop a profile of patients at higher risk of developing hyperkalemia, allowing appropriate selection of patients for esaxerenone therapy. Based on patient factors such as lower renal function (reduced eGFR, albuminuria) and older age, gradually increasing the esaxerenone dosage from 1.25 to 2.5–5 mg/day has been suggested as a good strategy to reduce the risk of developing hyperkalemia compared with starting treatment at a fixed dosage.
