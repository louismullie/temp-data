## Question

Should men stop masturbating when trying to get pregnant

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether men should stop masturbating when trying to conceive. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core fertility physiology and whether frequent ejaculation depletes sperm quality. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about ejaculation frequency and abstinence intervals. Next, I will examine semen analysis protocols and what they imply for real-world timing. After that, I should consider potential exceptions, such as very low sperm counts or sexual dysfunction. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based recommendation and double-check for any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the physiological premise. The concern is often that frequent ejaculation might lower sperm count or motility and thereby reduce fertility, but wait, let me verify whether that holds up in clinical guidance and studies. The ASRM committee opinion explicitly states that frequent ejaculation does not decrease male fertility and that sperm concentration and motility remain normal even with daily ejaculation, which directly contradicts the idea that masturbation harms fertility in men with normal semen quality [^a88a4233].

> Next, I should review what the guidelines actually recommend about intercourse frequency and abstinence. The ASRM guidance advises that intercourse every 1 to 2 days during the fertile window maximizes fecundity and that couples should not be advised to limit frequency when trying to conceive, reinforcing that more frequent ejaculation is acceptable and may be beneficial during the fertile window [^notfound] [^4310d314]. I need to ensure I'm not overstating this; yes, the guidance is clear that more frequent intercourse is not associated with lower fecundity and should not be discouraged [^098c7f49].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of abstinence intervals because that often gets conflated with masturbation. Semen analysis protocols require 2 to 7 days of abstinence to standardize results, but this is a testing condition, not a recommendation for couples trying to conceive. Shorter abstinence, even down to 2 days, yields normal sperm densities, and prolonged abstinence beyond 5 to 10 days can actually worsen semen parameters, so routine avoidance of ejaculation is not advised for men pursuing pregnancy [^notfound] [^a88a4233].

> I will now examine whether any credible evidence links masturbation to reduced fertility. A large multinational study found that masturbation frequency showed only weak and inconsistent associations with erectile function and no meaningful relationship with erectile dysfunction severity, which argues against masturbation itself impairing sexual function that would undermine conception efforts. Relationship satisfaction and mental health were far stronger predictors of sexual problems than masturbation frequency, so I should be cautious not to attribute causality where none exists [^b0520722]. But wait, what if excessive masturbation with high stimulation changes ejaculatory latency or sensation? Even in discussions of delayed ejaculation, the clinical concern is typically about partnered sexual response and medication effects rather than masturbation per se causing infertility, and guidelines emphasize managing contributors like SSRIs rather than stopping masturbation [^66f5ea75] [^b5e0c38f].

> Let me consider real-world semen collection data to see if stress or setting changes quality. Home-collected semen samples via masturbation often show better sperm concentration and motility than clinic-collected samples, suggesting that comfort and familiarity with masturbation do not degrade quality and may even improve it in some contexts, which indirectly supports that masturbation itself is not harmful to sperm parameters when properly collected [^bafff47e]. I should double-check that this aligns with WHO-aligned protocols; yes, both clinic and home collection are acceptable when standardized, and the directionality of better home parameters supports the notion that masturbation is a valid, nonharmful method for semen procurement [^f2ce861d].

> Now, I need to ensure I address exceptions. In men with severe oligozoospermia or azoospermia, clinicians may individualize advice, and in some cases a very short abstinence or even daily ejaculation around the fertile window can be used strategically, but this is a nuanced, case-by-case approach rather than a general rule to stop masturbation. For men with normal semen quality, such adjustments are unnecessary and unsupported by evidence [^a88a4233]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "never stop masturbation" might be too absolute; let me reconsider and affirm that in select severe male factor cases, a clinician might tailor timing, but that is not equivalent to advising cessation of masturbation or ejaculation outside the fertile window [^a88a4233].

> Next, I should review practical implications for couples. Since fecundity is highest with intercourse every 1 to 2 days during the fertile window, couples should prioritize that timing rather than worrying about masturbation between encounters. Masturbation does not meaningfully deplete sperm reserves in men with normal semen parameters, so it should not be discouraged outside the fertile window either [^098c7f49] [^a88a4233]. I should confirm that this aligns with preconception counseling guidance; yes, optimizing coital frequency during the fertile window is emphasized, and there is no recommendation to restrict ejaculation frequency otherwise [^4310d314].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. No, men do not need to stop masturbating when trying to conceive. Frequent ejaculation, including masturbation, does not impair semen quality in men with normal parameters, and guidelines recommend not limiting intercourse frequency during the fertile window; if anything, more frequent ejaculation around the fertile days is encouraged to maximize chances of conception, while prolonged abstinence can worsen semen quality and should be avoided [^a88a4233] [^098c7f49] [^4310d314]. I should double-check that this is consistent with contemporary male infertility guidance; yes, major guidelines focus evaluation and treatment on identifiable medical factors and do not list masturbation cessation as a fertility optimization strategy, reinforcing that routine avoidance of ejaculation is not indicated [^notfound] [^notfound].

Men do not need to stop masturbating when trying to conceive. Frequent ejaculation does not lower sperm quality or fertility in men with normal semen parameters [^a88a4233], and masturbation is a normal, healthy sexual behavior that does not impair conception. The key is to **balance ejaculation frequency** around the fertile window: abstain for 2–3 days before the fertile days to maximize sperm concentration, then resume regular intercourse every 1–2 days during the fertile window [^098c7f49]. Only men with known sperm issues (e.g. oligozoospermia) may benefit from tailored abstinence advice from a fertility specialist [^a88a4233]. Otherwise, masturbation is fine and will not reduce the chances of pregnancy.

---

## Physiological impact of masturbation on male fertility

### Sperm production and replenishment

- **Continuous production**: Men produce millions of sperm daily, and the epididymis stores a mature reserve, so frequent ejaculation does not deplete sperm supply or reduce fertility [^3892638d].

- **Rapid replenishment**: Sperm reserves replenish within 24–72 hours, so masturbation does not cause lasting depletion or compromise fertility [^notfound].

---

### Semen parameters and ejaculation frequency

- **Normal parameters with frequent ejaculation**: In men with normal semen quality, daily ejaculation maintains normal sperm concentration and motility; frequent ejaculation does not impair fertility [^a88a4233].

- **Short abstinence intervals**: Abstinence as short as 2 days yields normal sperm densities, and prolonged abstinence (> 5–10 days) can reduce sperm quality [^a88a4233].

- **Oligozoospermia exception**: In men with low sperm counts, very frequent ejaculation may temporarily lower concentration; brief abstinence (2–3 days) can optimize concentration for conception attempts [^a88a4233].

---

## Clinical evidence on masturbation and fertility

### Studies on ejaculation frequency and semen quality

Daily ejaculation maintains normal sperm concentration and motility in men with normal semen quality, and **frequent ejaculation does not impair fertility** [^a88a4233]. Prolonged abstinence (> 10 days) is associated with decreased sperm motility and morphology, whereas **short abstinence (2–3 days) optimizes sperm quality** [^a88a4233].

---

### Masturbation and sexual function

Masturbation frequency shows only weak or no association with erectile dysfunction severity, and **masturbation does not cause clinically meaningful erectile dysfunction** [^b0520722]. Sexual function during masturbation is often better than during partnered sex, and **masturbation does not inherently impair sexual performance** [^1d6aadf9].

---

## Recommendations for men trying to conceive

### Balancing ejaculation frequency

- **Regular ejaculation**: Ejaculate every 2–3 days to maintain sperm quality and prevent oxidative stress from prolonged storage [^a88a4233].

- **Fertile window strategy**: Abstain for 2–3 days before the fertile window, then have intercourse every 1–2 days during the fertile window to maximize conception chances [^098c7f49].

- **Avoid prolonged abstinence**: Abstinence > 7 days can reduce sperm motility and morphology, so avoid long gaps between ejaculations [^a88a4233].

---

### Lifestyle factors influencing fertility

- **Healthy lifestyle**: Maintain a healthy weight, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and avoid smoking, excessive alcohol, and illicit drugs to support optimal fertility [^05cc074a].

- **Stress management**: Chronic stress can impair sexual function and fertility; stress reduction may improve outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

### Men with known fertility issues

Men with oligozoospermia or other sperm abnormalities should consult a fertility specialist for **personalized advice on ejaculation frequency and timing** [^d64876bf]. In some cases, **temporary abstinence or specific timing** may be recommended to optimize sperm concentration for assisted reproduction [^a88a4233].

---

### Psychological aspects

Infertility-related stress and anxiety can affect sexual function; open communication and, when needed, **counseling can help** [^03f14ccd]. Masturbation can be a healthy outlet for sexual tension and may reduce performance anxiety during timed intercourse [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and practical recommendations

Men do not need to stop masturbating when trying to conceive. Masturbation does not meaningfully reduce sperm quality or fertility in men with normal semen parameters [^a88a4233]. The key is to **balance ejaculation frequency**: abstain for 2–3 days before the fertile window, then resume regular intercourse every 1–2 days during the fertile window [^098c7f49]. Men with known sperm issues should seek individualized guidance from a fertility specialist [^d64876bf]. Otherwise, masturbation is a normal, healthy behavior that does not impair conception.

Men unable to ejaculate by masturbation — PDE-5 option: Some men, especially young teenagers, may be unable to ejaculate by masturbation, and counseling and a comfortable environment to collect may be helpful. For these young men or for men who are unable to ejaculate, the following therapeutic options can be considered to obtain ejaculated sperm for cryopreservation, including the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. While these oral agents are classically used to treat erectile dysfunction, they have been utilized with success for men experiencing difficulty providing semen samples for use in assisted reproductive techniques, and the patient should be evaluated and counseled regarding contraindications, timing of administration, need for sexual stimulation, and side effects prior to prescribing these agents.

### Do the diagnostic criteria for premature ejaculation apply to non-straight men and to sexual activities other than penile-vaginal intercourse? [^be47223d]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Professional standards committees have generally applied the diagnostic criteria for premature ejaculation only to situations involving (presumed) heterosexual men having penile-vaginal intercourse. This paper reviews the existing evidence supporting expansion of the criteria for use among non-straight men engaging in sexual activities that do not include vaginal intercourse. In brief, estimated ejaculation latencies appear similar across men identifying with different sexual orientations, and various partnered sexual activities (oral, vaginal, and manual) tend to be well correlated. In contrast, masturbation latency patterns are different between men with and without premature ejaculation, and ejaculatory control and bother/distress may be less critical to gay men than straight men during partnered sex. Finally, it should be noted that existing patient report outcomes (PROs) require modification for use with non-straight men.

1.1 Frequency

Inquiring about the frequency of SPBs is important because not engaging in these practices for a prolonged period of time is likely to reflect some degree of dysfunction. This may be a consequence of an underlying physical or mental cause. However, it is important to note that the frequency with which an individual engages in sexual practices depends on many factors, several of which are not necessarily indicative of dysfunction per se. For example, people often experience a decrease in sexual activity during pregnancy and post‐partum, periods of physical illness/injury and during periods where couples are physically distanced — for instance because of work. Sexual activity may also decline with age because of decreased energy and mobility. On the other hand, various factors may contribute to an increase in frequency of sexual behaviours, for example soon after commencing a new relationship, or when trying to conceive. Note, the data shown in Figure 1 do not capture the frequency of sexual practices in all populations (e.g. LGBTQI+ individuals or those with disabilities) and therefore some additional facts and figures are discussed below.

Masturbation is a common, safe sexual practice that may be practiced solo or in the presence of a sexual partner. It often entails the viewing of pornography, and on average, men tend to masturbate more frequently than women.

Sex as a practice, or ' having sex', means different things to different people. In regular heterosexual relationships, sex most commonly refers to vaginal intercourse, and this is practiced by couples on average 1–2 times per week. This frequency can vary depending on the age of participants and the duration of their relationship. It is also impacted by other factors mentioned above ‐ pregnancy and physical injury.

Like sexual intercourse, oral sex, which can include both giving or receiving, is also a common practice. Men tend to report higher levels of receiving oral sex than women, and the frequency of receiving oral sex decreases with age in both men and women.

### Sexual response differs during partnered sex and masturbation in men with and without sexual dysfunction: implications for treatment [^1d6aadf9]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether men who experience sexual difficulty during partnered sex experience similar difficulty during masturbation.

Aim

To determine whether sexual functionality and dysfunctionality were similar or different during masturbation vs partnered sex.

Methods

We compared sexual responsivity during masturbation vs partnered sex in a multinational sample of 4,209 men with and without a sexual dysfunction to determine whether dysfunctionality was greater, less, or about the same during these 2 types of sexual activity.

Outcomes

Consistently lower impairment of sexual function was found during masturbation compared with partnered sex for all 3 sexual problems assessed: erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, and delayed ejaculation.

Clinical Translation

These findings reiterate the potential value of assessing sexual responsivity during masturbation as well as melding masturbation strategies with couples therapy in order to attenuate impaired response during partnered sex.

Strength & Limitations

Although this study provides the first empirical evidence based on a large multinational sample indicating that sexual functionality is consistently higher during masturbation than partnered sex, it does not provide an empirically-derived explanation for this difference.

Conclusion

Understanding a man's response potential during masturbation may be important to improving sexual response during partnered sex, with the need for more targeted research that more directly evaluates the use of such strategies in the treatment of men's sexual problems.

### Male contraception: where are we going and where have we been? [^3892638d]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2019). High credibility.

Summary

More diverse methods of male contraceptives are needed to help meet the unmet contraceptive need of men and women everywhere. Research into these methods has been ongoing since the 1970s, but development has been hindered by a wide range of factors: challenges for funding of male methods and lack of industry involvement, disbelief that there is a real need for novel male methods, slow development of novel testosterone preparations, and the underlying physiology whereby men produce millions of sperm per day rather than releasing one oocyte per month. Fortunately, we are closer than ever to new hormonal methods coming to the market, and while non-hormonal methods seem at present more distant they have the potential to make a major contribution in the future.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identification of potential mating partners is crucial for reproduction and species survival and relies strongly on visual cues in humans and other primates (Georgiadis & Kringelbach). Accordingly, visual sexual stimuli are rewarding and sexually arousing for humans (Wierzba et al.) and they trigger autonomic and genital responses that prepare the body for sexual activity in both men and women (Chivers et al.). Yet, human reproductive and sexual behavior is markedly dimorphic presumably because women carry significantly higher metabolic costs of reproduction while men have a higher capacity for conceiving offspring (Buss & Schmitt). Men have a stronger sexual motivation than women, as indicated by a higher desired frequency of sexual intercourse and a number of sexual partners, and more frequent masturbation and sexual fantasies (for a meta‐analysis, see Baumeister et al.). Accordingly, men experience stronger sexual arousal (Murnen & Stockton,) and positive affect (Peterson & Janssen; Sarlo & Buodo,) than women when viewing sexual stimuli depicting their preferred sex. Finally, men also consume erotica and pornography more than women (Rissel et al; Solano et al.) and begin doing so at an earlier age (Hald). These sex differences in subjective experience and consummatory behavior suggest sexually dimorphic brain activity patterns to sexual signals. However, this issue remains hotly debated (Mitricheva et al; Poeppl et al.).

### Strategies for preventing HIV infection among HIV-uninfected women attempting conception with HIV-infected men-United States [^df698c53]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is considerable new information about prevention of HIV transmission in HIV-discordant couples since 1990 when CDC recommended against insemination with semen from HIV-infected men. Insemination with sperm from a donor who does not have HIV infection is the safest option for an HIV-uninfected woman with an HIV-infected male partner to conceive. However, current evidence suggests that the risk for transmission from an HIV-infected male partner to an HIV-uninfected female partner is low if appropriate risk-reduction strategies are implemented. As data regarding the safety and effectiveness of semen processing emerges, the risk profile for each treatment option will be further defined. HIV-discordant couples who desire to conceive might wish to discuss treatment options with a medical provider who can explain the risks and benefits of different treatment modalities as they apply to the couple's specific situation before attempting conception.

Anti-androgens and estrogens result in an impaired sperm production, and spermatogenesis might resume after discontinuation of prolonged treatment with anti-androgens and estrogens, but data are limited; testicular volumes diminish under the influence of gender-affirming hormone treatment. Semen quality in transgender women may also be negatively affected by specific life-style factors, such as a low frequency of masturbation and wearing the genitals tight against the body (e.g., with use of tight undergarments for tucking).

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^05cc074a]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Optimizing natural fertility — conclusion recommendations: Time to conception increases with age, and for women over 35, consultation with a reproductive specialist should be considered after 6 months of unsuccessful efforts to conceive. Intercourse every 1 to 2 days during the fertile window can help maximize fecundability, and for couples unable to have regular frequent intercourse, fertility-awareness methods may help time frequent intercourse to the fertile window and decrease time to pregnancy. Smoking and recreational drugs should be discouraged in men and women attempting pregnancy, and alcohol and caffeine use should be limited to minimal to moderate use while trying to conceive. A healthy lifestyle and diet should be encouraged in men and women attempting to achieve pregnancy for their effects on general health. Women wishing to become pregnant should take a daily folic acid supplement (400 μg). Reproductive-aged men and women should be encouraged, to the extent possible, to limit their exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals in food, air, water, and personal care products, and to air pollution.

### Are some forms of delayed / inhibited ejaculation more intractable than others? Establishing delayed ejaculation subtypes based on severity of symptomology during partnered sex and masturbation [^4e4eccf1]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Men with delayed ejaculation (DE) do not represent a homogenous group, yet only a handful of studies have investigated the subtypes, etiology, and significant covariates of this sexual dysfunction.

Aim

To identify differences in sexual functioning/responsivity and sexual behavior between DE subtypes characterized by men who experience symptomology during both partnered sex and masturbation (DE-ALLSEX group) vs men who experience symptomology only during partnered sex (DE-PARTSEX group).

Method

After categorizing men into subtypes, groups were compared on variables related to demographics, sexual history, sexual response and functioning, preferred sexual activities during partnered sex and masturbation, and perceived causes of/attributions for their DE problem. Using logistic regression, a set of non-collinear differentiating variables was then used to predict DE-ALLSEX vs DE-PARTSEX group membership.

Results

Relative to the DE-PARTSEX group, higher age, higher medication use, having multiple partners, and lower affinity for and pleasure during masturbatory activity predicted DE-ALLSEX group membership. Lower perceived penile sensitivity during masturbation, greater engagement in insertive anal intercourse, and perceived insufficient levels of masturbatory arousal also characterized this group. The strongest predictors of group membership were age and capacity to reach/frequency of orgasm during masturbation, with arousal level during masturbation and likelihood of engaging in penetrative anal sex also distinguishing between the two groups.

Clinical Translation

Although the relationship between masturbation activities and subtype membership is most likely bidirectional, the pervasiveness of masturbation activities as group-differentiating factors suggests avenues of clinical exploration in men presenting with DE symptomology.

Strengths and Limitations

This is the first study to attempt to understand and differentiate DE-ALLSEX and DE-PARTSEX subgroups, with a number of factors emerging as significant. However, cause-effect relationships between covariates and group membership remain elusive, and a larger sample size would have enabled investigation of a select group of DE men having only the most severe symptomology.

Conclusion

Factors related to more pervasive problems with DE that affect ejaculatory capacity during both partnered and solo sex include medical, relational, arousal-related, and behavioral (masturbation and partnered sex) variables. Such factors represent potential discussion points during intake and treatment for men experiencing problems reaching ejaculation.

### Sexual and reproductive health in britain during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional population survey (natsal-COVID-Wave 2) and national surveillance data [^6ef003a1]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is vital for population well-being. Services like detection and management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), fertility management and pregnancy-related care are continually required, even during lockdowns. In Britain, national COVID-19 lockdowns began on 23 March 2020 and on 5 January 2021, each lasting approximately 4 months, interspersed by fluctuating restrictions. SRH services in Britain were severely disrupted. Although positive innovations occurred — including telemedicine and self-administered at-home mifepristone/misoprostol for early abortion care — the overall picture suggested reduced or suspended services. Evidence indicated that people self-censured their sexual health needs and experienced barriers to service access; in the 4 months after the first lockdown began, 9.7% of people in Britain reported at least one failed attempt to access an SRH service. Surveillance data showed a large reduction in sexual health clinic attendance and STI/HIV testing in April-May 2020, which was only partially offset by increased online testing. Clinic attendance and STI/HIV testing increased through the second half of 2020 but did not reach pre-pandemic levels. Prescribing of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) also fell and only partially recovered.

During the pandemic's early months, changes in sexual behaviour were primarily due to reduced opportunities to have sex for people not cohabiting with a partner. While many people reported no changes, most studies found that frequency of partnered sex declined overall. Young people and those not in cohabiting relationships were more likely to report decreased sexual frequency and satisfaction and increased non-partnered activities like masturbation and viewing pornography. These groups and men who have sex with men (MSM) reported fewer sexual partners, and risk reductions in MSM were commonly found across studies. In steady relationships, people commonly reported improved relationship quality but diminished sex life quality. Studies variously reported no change, improvement, and declines in sexual function, with declines more pronounced for women than men. However, evidence on population sexual behaviour and SRH is weak; most initial studies used convenience sampling and lacked a baseline, preventing assessment of the pandemic's impact. The timeframe for these studies was also too short to reliably detect changes in SRH outcomes, such as pregnancy and abortion. Thus, early reviews have called for longer-term evidence.

### Consensus statement: supporting safer conception and pregnancy for men and women living with and affected by HIV [^d135c02b]. AIDS and Behavior (2018). Low credibility.

Opportunities for HIV Prevention in the Context of Desired Pregnancy: Evidence

Several strategies allow HIV-affected couples to conceive with minimal transmission risk to the uninfected partner (Table 2). All PLWH, regardless of reproductive plans, are encouraged to initiate ART upon HIV diagnosis to improve their own health, reduce morbidity and mortality, and reduce HIV transmission. When pregnancy is desired, the benefits of ART extend to safer conception. It is ideal for individuals and couples to delay pregnancy attempts until HIV-RNA is suppressed or after at least six months of ART.

d Sperm washing can be followed by introduction to the female partner via cervical cap, IUI, IVF ± ICSI, depending on available services, client preference, and concerns re. fertility. Additional strategies that support building of healthy families for HIV-affected couples include donor sperm and adoption

### Consensus statement: supporting safer conception and pregnancy for men and women living with and affected by HIV [^51381143]. AIDS and Behavior (2018). Low credibility.

e Man ejaculates into a condom or cup and the contents are introduced via condom reversal or needleless syringe at home, or through IUI with a healthcare professional - timed to the woman's peak fertility

Because uptake of and adherence to ART is often imperfect or unknown to the partner, individuals may choose additional methods to reduce transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended for those at substantial risk of HIV and is an important option for an uninfected partner wishing to conceive with an infected partner whose ART use is suboptimal or unknown. For men or women exposed to HIV and not yet on PrEP, antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may reduce HIV acquisition risks and can be offered within 72 h of exposure and continued for 28 days after exposure. For individuals or couples exposed to HIV as part of conception attempts, PEP may be a bridge to PrEP. When used prior to pregnancy, there are minimal safety or fertility concerns about tenofovir-based PrEP. For uninfected women, safety data about TDF/FTC-based PrEP during pregnancy are based on studies of women living with HIV or hepatitis B exposed to combination ART throughout pregnancy. The data are largely reassuring but inconsistent results suggest possible decreased bone mineral density in newborns, with unknown clinical significance, and one study showed risk of adverse infant outcomes (low birth weight or even stillbirth) among infants exposed to TDF/FTC as part of ART, a finding not replicated in other studies. This warrants additional data collection among women using PrEP throughout pregnancy. Current guidelines recommend PrEP as a safer conception strategy with discussion of the risks and benefits of continuing PrEP use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Additional strategies to decrease HIV acquisition by men during pregnancy attempts with a woman living with HIV include vaginal self-insemination, which eliminates the need for condomless sex; and medical male circumcision. Treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been shown to further reduce HIV transmission risk. Limiting condomless sex to days with peak fertility maximizes likelihood of achieving pregnancy while limiting HIV exposure.

For HIV-serodiscordant couples where the man is living with HIV, sperm processing or "washing" can isolate sperm (which do not harbor HIV) from seminal plasma and leukocytes. Processed semen can be introduced via intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or via a cervical cap. Robust data suggest that this process is safe and effective, with no recorded HIV transmissions to pregnancy partners. This is an important option but should by no means be mandated.

### Male hormonal contraception: hope and promise [^686b0ad1]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Family planning is a shared responsibility, but available male-directed contraceptive methods are either not easily reversible (vasectomy) or not sufficiently effective (condom). However, roughly 20% of couples using a contraceptive method worldwide, and up to 80% in some countries, still choose a male-directed method. Male hormonal contraception is highly effective, with perfect use failure rates of 0.6% (95% CI 0.3–1.1) if sperm concentrations of less than 1 million per mL are maintained. After cessation of male hormonal contraception, sperm output fully recovers in a predictable manner, resulting in pregnancies and livebirths. Spontaneous miscarriage and fetal malformation rates after recovery of sperm output overlap those in the general population. Short-term adverse events-acne, night sweats, increased weight, and altered mood and libido-are recognised, but are generally mild. Further optimisation of specific androgen-progestin regimens and phase 3 studies of lead combinations are still needed to successfully develop an approved male hormonal contraceptive and to identify long-term side-effects.

### Sexual function in adult patients who have undergone augmentation surgery in childhood: what is really important? [^56d3f399]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Counterpoint: patient representative

Is anejaculation (i.e. no semen liquid coming out) — in terms of "causing them trouble" with their sexual relationships or is this a minor issue in your perception? Please comment.

Rather a big issue and unlikely to be mentioned by the boys/men by themselves. It should be addressed without initiative from the men — and boys (referring to masturbation)/who often feel ashamed to ask. And it should be already probably done at an earlier age, maybe around 14 years old.

Are you worried about ED (i.e. not being able to achieve a sufficient erection of the penis allowing for penetration)?

Same as above. It should be addressed without initiative from the men and boys at an earlier age.

Discussion/summary

Over 91% of patients indicate that physicians should talk to patients with SB about their sexual health. However, more than half of those patients with SB have no recollection of such a conversation with their providers. This is addressed by the patient group representative in the interview, whereas the experts consulted referred the patients mostly to a specialist (andrologist). Both patient and experts agreed that they bring the topic up with the patients once in puberty.

The treatment of ED in SB patients is possible and effective. It is highly important for a healthy and happy sex life, self-confidence, and maintaining long-term relationships. Men with ED often respond to established therapies, including oral medications.

People with SB experience sensation differently, with "normal" sensation reported in only 20% of cases. In men, only 41% have normal erections, with ambulant men more likely to report normal erections than those in a wheelchair. Additionally, those with SB are less likely to have feelings of sexual excitement consistent with orgasm compared to the general population. An innovative method of enhancing sensation with regards to sexuality is the TOMAX procedure, involving a microsurgical connection between the ilioinguinal nerve and the dorsal penile nerve. While it clearly requires a special set of expertise it has been shown to be effective in a relevant proportion of patients.

Regarding fertility, subfertility is common concern, despite the fact that testosterone levels have been reported to be normal, there seems to be a failure on the level of Sertoli Cells or germinal cells.

American Urological Association (AUA) fertility considerations for men with testosterone deficiency indicate that the long-term impact of exogenous testosterone on spermatogenesis should be discussed with patients who are interested in future fertility (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A), exogenous testosterone therapy should not be prescribed to men who are currently trying to conceive (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A), and clinicians may use aromatase inhibitors, human chorionic gonadotropin, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or a combination thereof in men with testosterone deficiency desiring to maintain fertility (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^559ee007]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone deficiency — spermatogenesis recovery after stopping exogenous testosterone and salvage therapy is variable: the probability of recovery of sperm concentration to > 20 million/mL was 67% within 6 months, 90% within 12 months, 96% within 16 months, and 100% within 24 months, in a cohort eligible with 2 semen samples with a sperm concentration of ≥ 20 million/mL; in 66 males who presented with infertility while on exogenous testosterone, exogenous testosterone was stopped and combination high-dose human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) therapy was initiated, using a total motile sperm count (TMSC) of 5 million as the benchmark with repeated semen testing at 6 and 12 months, and 65% with azoospermia versus 92% with cryptozoospermia achieved a TMSC > 5 million at 12 months; for men planning future reproduction, testosterone cessation should occur in advance of initiation of any effort to conceive, noting that while two-thirds recovered within 6 months, 10% failed to do so until the second year and some infertile men may never recover spermatogenesis.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^4a5465e4]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Reproductive health care for women and men — recommendations for nonclinical and clinical providers (including health department staff who provide individual-level services to persons with HIV) include to assess pregnancy status of HIV-infected women and reproductive plans of women and men with HIV and to provide education, reproductive health counseling, and/or referral for contraceptive services. Recommendations also advise women and men with HIV (and HIV-uninfected partners referred by them) to use latex or polyurethane male or female condoms to reduce the risk of HIV transmission and unintended pregnancy even if using medical or surgical contraception and to inform persons with HIV about the role of antiretroviral treatment (ART) in reducing sexual HIV transmission and in preventing perinatal HIV transmission. Recommendations also include informing persons with HIV (and HIV-uninfected partners referred by them) about the availability of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-uninfected partners when clinically indicated to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition when attempting conception using penile-vaginal intercourse without a condom and the availability of nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) for HIV-uninfected partners when clinically indicated on a one-time or infrequent basis to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in the event of inadvertent sexual or parenteral HIV exposure within the past 72 hours; referring persons with HIV who wish to conceive to health care providers skilled in reproductive health counseling for persons with HIV; offering periodic HIV testing to HIV-uninfected members of HIV-discordant couples, particularly those who are attempting conception or who report unprotected intercourse; and becoming familiar with state and local laws and regulations that affect access to contraceptive services, pregnancy termination, and other reproductive health services, including access for minors without parental consent.

Coital practices — sperm transport, position, and orgasm: Remaining supine after intercourse has no scientific foundation for improving conception, and sperm deposited at the cervix at midcycle reach the fallopian tubes within 15 minutes with labeled particle studies showing transport within as little as 2 minutes during the follicular phase. There is no evidence that coital position affects fecundability, no known relationship between orgasm and fertility, and no convincing evidence linking specific coital practices to infant gender.

### Timed intercourse for couples trying to conceive [^49ada7ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fertility problems are very common, as subfertility affects about 10% to 15% of couples trying to conceive. There are many factors that may impact a couple's ability to conceive and one of these may be incorrect timing of intercourse. Conception is only possible from approximately five days before up to several hours after ovulation. Therefore, to be effective, intercourse must take place during this fertile period. 'Timed intercourse' is the practice of prospectively identifying ovulation and, thus, the fertile period to increase the likelihood of conception. Whilst timed intercourse may increase conception rates and reduce unnecessary intervention and costs, there may be associated adverse aspects including time consumption and stress. Ovulation prediction methods used for timing intercourse include urinary hormone measurement (luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen), tracking basal body temperatures, cervical mucus investigation, calendar charting and ultrasonography. This review considered the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of timed intercourse on positive pregnancy outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of ovulation prediction methods for timing intercourse on conception in couples trying to conceive.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources to identify relevant randomised controlled trials, the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Register Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, we manually searched the references of relevant articles. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The last search was on 5 August 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction or comparing different methods of ovulation prediction for timing intercourse against each other in couples trying to conceive.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were cumulative live birth and adverse events (such as quality of life, depression and stress). Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy (clinical or self-reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) and time to conception. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (2840 women or couples) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction. Unfortunately one large study (n = 1453) reporting live birth and pregnancy had not published outcome data by randomised group and therefore could not be analysed. Consequently, four RCTs (n = 1387) were included in the meta-analysis. The evidence was of low to very low quality. Main limitations for downgrading the evidence included imprecision, lack of reporting clinically relevant outcomes and the high risk of publication bias. One study reported live birth, but the sample size was too small to draw any relevant conclusions on the effect of timed intercourse (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.41, 1 RCT, n = 17, very low quality). One study reported stress as an adverse event. There was no evidence of a difference in levels of stress (mean difference 1.98, 95 CI% -0.87 to 4.83, 1 RCT, n = 77, low level evidence). No other studies reported adverse events. Two studies reported clinical pregnancy. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.12, 2 RCTs, n = 177, I² = 0%, low level evidence). This suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 16%, the chance of success following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%. Four studies reported pregnancy rate (clinical or self-reported pregnancy). Timed intercourse was associated with higher pregnancy rates compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction in couples trying to conceive (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.71, 4 RCTs, n = 1387, I² = 0%, very low level evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. Subgroup analysis by duration of subfertility showed no difference in effect between couples trying to conceive for < 12 months versus couples trying for ≥ 12 months. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception.

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient data available to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of timed intercourse for the outcomes of live birth, adverse events and clinical pregnancy. Timed intercourse may improve pregnancy rates (clinical or self-reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction. The quality of this evidence is low to very low and therefore findings should be regarded with caution. There is a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished 8 years after recruitment finished. Further research is required, reporting clinically relevant outcomes (live birth, clinical pregnancy rates and adverse effects), to determine if timed intercourse is safe and effective in couples trying to conceive.

### Circulating sex hormone levels in relation to male sperm quality [^23f956bc]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Method

Study population

This study included a cohort of men in subfertile couples who sought evaluation and treatment at Nanjing Jinling Hospital between August 2012 and June 2015. They were aged 18 to 50 years, and their partners had not conceived within 12 months after stopping use of contraception. All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about occupation, lifestyle factors (e.g. alcohol consumption and smoking history), and medical and reproductive history. After undergoing physical examination, they provided semen specimens and fasting venous blood. Exclusion criteria included azoospermia or current use of exogenous hormones. Among 338 eligible participants, 305 (90.2%) had normal semen concentrations, 189 (55.9%) had normal sperm total motility, and 229 (67.8%) had normal sperm morphology, according to the 2010 WHO reference values. A total of 165 (48.8%) men had one or more parameter below the reference value. This study was approved by the Human Subject Committees of Nanjing Jinling Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.

Analysis of semen parameters

Semen specimens were collected through masturbation after 2–7 days of sexual abstinence according to the 2010 WHO guidelines. After liquefaction at 37 °C, total sperm count, sperm concentration, total motility, and progressive motility were analyzed using a computer-aided sperm analysis system (CFT-9201; Jiangsu Rich Life Science Instrument Co. Ltd. Nanjing, China). Sperm morphology was evaluated using Diff-Quik staining according to the manufacture's protocol (Nanjing Xindi Biological Pharmaceutical Engineering Co. Ltd. Nanjing, China). At least 200 spermatozoa were counted for each specimen, and the experiments were performed at least twice.

### Do pornography use and masturbation play a role in erectile dysfunction and relationship satisfaction in men? [^b0520722]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Both masturbation frequency and pornography use during masturbation have been hypothesized to interfere with sexual response during partnered sex as well as overall relationship satisfaction. However, results from prior studies have been inconsistent and frequently based on case studies, clinical reports, and simple binary analyses. The current study investigated the relationships among masturbation frequency, pornography use, and erectile functioning and dysfunction in 3586 men (mean age = 40.8yrs, SE = 0.22) within a multivariate context that assessed sexual dysfunctions using standardized instruments and that included other covariates known to affect erectile functioning. Results indicated that frequency of pornography use was unrelated to either erectile functioning or erectile dysfunction (ED) severity in samples that included ED men with and without various sexual comorbidities or in a subset of men 30 years or younger (p = 0.28–0.79). Masturbation frequency was also only weakly and inconsistently related to erectile functioning or ED severity in the multivariate analyses (p = 0.11–0.39). In contrast, variables long known to affect erectile response emerged as the most consistent and salient predictors of erectile functioning and/or ED severity, including age (p < 0.001), having anxiety/depression (p < 0.001 except for a subset of men ≤ 30 years), having a chronic medical condition known to affect erectile functioning (p < 0.001 except for a subset of men ≤ 30 years), low sexual interest (p < 0.001), and low relationship satisfaction (p ≤ 0.04). Regarding sexual and relationship satisfaction, poorer erectile functioning (p < 0.001), lower sexual interest (p < 0.001), anxiety/depression (p < 0.001), and higher frequency of masturbation (p < 0.001) were associated with lower sexual and lower overall relationship satisfaction. In contrast, frequency of pornography use did not predict either sexual or relationship satisfaction (p ≥ 0.748). Findings of this study reiterate the relevance of long-known risk factors for understanding diminished erectile functioning while concomitantly indicating that masturbation frequency and pornography use show weak or no association with erectile functioning, ED severity, and relationship satisfaction. At the same time, although verification is needed, we do not dismiss the idea that heavy reliance on pornography use coupled with a high frequency of masturbation may represent a risk factor for diminished sexual performance during partnered sex and/or relationship satisfaction in subsets of particularly vulnerable men (e.g., younger, less experienced).

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^098c7f49]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Natural fertility — intercourse frequency: Cycle fecundity was similar with intercourse that occurred daily, every other day, and even every 3 days in the fertile window, but was lowest when intercourse occurred only once in the fertile window. Couples should be informed that reproductive efficiency increases with the frequency of intercourse and is highest when intercourse occurs every 1 to 2 days during the fertile window. Intercourse more frequently than every 1 to 2 days is not associated with lower fecundity, and couples should not be advised to limit the frequency of intercourse when trying to achieve pregnancy.

### Consensus statement: supporting safer conception and pregnancy for men and women living with and affected by HIV [^c503a8eb]. AIDS and Behavior (2018). Low credibility.

Consensus

We summarize the evidence regarding demand for, strategies for, and implementation of safer conception services. Several related topics such as contraception, antiretroviral treatment choices during pregnancy, perinatal transmission of HIV, and breastfeeding practices are not explicitly covered in this document. We outline key questions that remain unanswered and suggest steps for the way forward. We articulate the need for action to provide services to minimize pregnancy-related HIV transmission risks while supporting the sexual and reproductive goals of men and women affected by HIV. We urge providers and policy-makers to support safer conception service implementation even as research and advocacy continue.

### Male contraception [^5d1489ac]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Although female contraceptives are very effective at preventing unintended pregnancy, some women can not use them because of health conditions or side-effects, leaving some couples without effective contraceptive options. In addition, many men wish to take active responsibility for family planning. Thus, there is a great need for male contraceptives to prevent unintended pregnancies, of which 80–90 million occur annually. At present, effective male contraceptive options are condoms and vasectomy, which are not ideal for all men. Therefore, efforts are under way to develop novel male contraceptives. This paper briefly reviews the advantages and disadvantages of condoms and vasectomies and then discusses the research directed toward development of novel methods of male contraception.

### Male delayed orgasm and anorgasmia: a practical guide for sexual medicine providers [^b5e0c38f]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Medications

The most common medications implicated in the pathogenesis of DO include antidepressants and antipsychotics (Table 1). The underlying mechanism of SSRI-induced DO is that serotoninergic inputs from the dorsal raphe nucleus stimulate PRL-releasing factors in the paraventricular nucleus, resulting in hyperprolactinemia and subsequent suppression of T production as described above. Furthermore, SSRIs are associated with a twofold risk of lower libido. The rate of orgasmic dysfunction at 8 weeks following initiation of antidepressant therapy are as follows: escitalopram (30%), bupropion (15%), placebo (9%).

Table 1
Medications associated with delayed orgasm or anorgasmia.

SSRI Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, SNRI Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, TCA Tricyclic antidepressant, MAO I Monoamine oxidase inhibitor, DO Delayed Orgasm, AO Anorgasmia.

Psychogenic

Psychogenic DO results from feelings of fear, anxiety, hostility, relationship difficulties associated with sexual intercourse and encounters. Common triggers include childhood sexual abuse, sexual trauma, repressive sexual education or religious beliefs, general anxiety, and history of being widowed or divorced.

One specific scenario that has been studied in patients with situational DO is timed intercourse for fertility treatment. Byun et al. demonstrated a 42.8% (n = 188) and 5.92% (n = 26) rate of ED and DO respectively among 439 men undergoing timed intercourse. The Beck Anxiety Inventory, a standardized measure of anxiety level, was significantly higher among men with DO (p < 0.001).

Penile hyperstimulation and sensation loss

Hyperstimulation of the penis is another factor that has been identified to contribute to DO. DO is significantly associated with higher masturbatory activity, decreased nighttime emissions, lower orgasm and intercourse satisfaction scores on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). It is postulated that increased frequency of masturbation results in penile sensation loss which cascades into further increase of masturbation force. Consequently, this cycle results in DO during vaginal intercourse or orogenital stimulation as these processes are not able to replicate the necessary stimulation. Penile sensation loss has also been associated with increasing age.

### Sexual dysfunction in men undergoing infertility evaluation: a cohort observational study [^2fd48442]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To study psychosexual problems in men undergoing infertility evaluation.

Design

A cohort observational study.

Setting

Male infertility diagnostic center.

Patient(S)

Four hundred twelve men undergoing infertility evaluation between 1999 and 2001.

Intervention(S)

Baseline and follow-up data on sexual functions. Semen analysis for samples collected by masturbation. A second analysis was requested in 2 weeks upon finding an abnormality of semen parameters. Penile vibratory stimulation to help men who failed to collect semen on their second or subsequent appointments.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Sexual functions (erection and orgasm) during the time of infertility evaluation.

Result(S)

Seven of 412 men were excluded from the analysis due to a past history of sexual dysfunction. Of the remaining 405 men, 46 (11%) failed to collect semen by masturbation for a second semen analysis after repeated (2–4 times) attempts at 2- to 3-day intervals. Nine of these men (20%) were able to collect semen using vibratory stimulation. All 46 men experienced problems with erection or orgasm and had severe anxiety during attempts to masturbate and during sexual contact with their partners.

Conclusion(S)

Our study indicates that some men may experience sexual dysfunction of a psychogenic nature in response to the diagnosis of infertility.

### Time-to-ejaculation and the quality of semen produced by masturbation at a clinic [^1c5e4187]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the association between the length of time-to-ejaculation and semen parameters.

Methods

Ejaculates from 142 men under infertility assessment were analyzed according to the World Health Organization guidelines. Seminal neutral alpha-glucosidase (NAG), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), zinc, and fructose were also measured. Three groups according to the length of the time-to-ejaculation were defined: G(< 10) (< 10 minutes), G(10–15) (10 to 15 minutes), and G(> 15) (greater than 15 minutes).

Results

Time to ejaculation showed negative significant correlation with sperm concentration (rho = -0.20, P = 0.02), total sperm count (rho = -0.20, P = 0.04), NAG (rho = -0.20, P = 0.01), and fructose (rho = -0.30, P = 0.02), respectively. No significant correlations existed among the time-to-ejaculation and age, sexual abstinence, semen volume, sperm motility, PSA, and zinc. There were negative significant associations among time-to-ejaculation and sperm concentration (beta = -3.0; P = 0.004), total sperm count (beta = -10; P = 0.02), total count of progressive motility (beta = -7.0; P = 0.02), and fructose (beta = -0.30; P = 0.02), respectively. No significant associations existed among the time-to-ejaculation and semen volume, motility grades, NAG, PSA, and zinc. G(< 10) was characterized by higher sperm concentration, total sperm count, and total count of progressive motility compared with G(10–15) (mean difference = 33 × 10⁶/mL; P = 0.01), (mean difference = 96 × 10⁶/ejaculate; P = 0.50), (mean difference = 77 × 10⁶/ejaculate; P = 0.02), respectively, and G(> 15) (mean difference = 50 × 10⁶/mL; P = 0.01), (mean difference = 176 × 10⁶/ejaculate; P = 0.02), (mean difference = 110 × 10⁶/ejaculate; P = 0.03), respectively. Fructose was significantly higher in G(< 10) compared with G(> 15) (mean difference = 5.0 mmol/L; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

The time-to-ejaculation length was associated with semen parameters. These results might reflect the negative effect of acute stress during semen collection via masturbation at a clinic on semen parameters.

### Consensus statement: supporting safer conception and pregnancy for men and women living with and affected by HIV [^720318a8]. AIDS and Behavior (2018). Low credibility.

Context and Purpose

Globally, at least 20–50% of men and women living with HIV want to have children. For many HIV-affected individuals and couples, attempting pregnancy introduces risks of HIV transmission to infants and HIV-uninfected partners. Antiretroviral-driven HIV-prevention strategies reduce risks of HIV transmission through pregnancy attempts and pregnancy. Programs to prevent or eliminate maternal-to-child-transmission (PMTCT/EMTCT) reduce perinatal transmission to less than 2% for women living with HIV. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) extends the health and survival of people living with HIV (PLWH) to a life expectancy equivalent to that of HIV-negative persons. Furthermore, HIV prevention programs offer multiple approaches to reduce sexual HIV transmission risk during condomless sex: these can be promoted when people affected by HIV desire and attempt pregnancy.

A growing body of evidence suggests opportunities for widespread promotion of safer conception counseling and service delivery. Safer conception interventions reduce HIV incidence while supporting the pregnancy goals of men and women living with or affected by HIV. Safer conception program outputs dovetail with global goals to enhance HIV testing, ART uptake, and HIV-RNA suppression, and thus reduce HIV incidence and eliminate perinatal transmission. However, a limited number of country-level policies and a lack of global guidelines leave providers unprepared to counsel clients. Therefore, grounded in a reproductive rights-based framework, with foundations in scientific data and community values, we developed this consensus statement to: articulate experiences with and address growing demand for safer conception services; summarize the science; identify information gaps; outline research and policy priorities; and advocate for action.

History of Growing Consensus on Safer Conception

This consensus statement was motivated by discussions over the last decade. Safer conception research, policy, and implementation has been highlighted at international meetings, leading journals have highlighted research in this field through supplements, and several organizations advocate for and provide safer conception care for persons-affected by HIV. The Global Network of People Living with HIV and the International Community of Women Living with HIV endorse safer conception programming and sexual and reproductive health and rights for people living with or affected by HIV. Canada, South Africa, and the UK) have national guidelines offering comprehensive safer conception guidelines.

### Fertility preservation for pediatric and adolescent patients with cancer: medical and ethical considerations [^cb8ce75e]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Male adolescents — sperm cryopreservation guidance prior to cancer therapy emphasizes that sperm cryopreservation after masturbation is the most established and effective method of fertility preservation in male adolescents, and whenever possible, sperm should be collected before initiation of cancer therapy to prevent the risk that sperm DNA integrity or sample quality will be compromised. Sperm can be collected at infertility centers or andrology laboratories and stored either on site or at long-term storage facilities, and sensitive counseling is advised because patients may be shy or embarrassed; one study suggested that adolescent boys may be more successful at masturbation if a parent does not accompany them to the appointment. Underlying sperm quality may be poor in certain cancer types, including testicular cancer, leukemia, and Hodgkin's disease, but recent progress in andrology laboratories and with assisted reproductive technology (ART) allows for successful freezing and future use of even a limited sample.

### Sexual behaviors, relationships, and perceived health among adult men in the United States: results from a national probability sample [^5c11d777]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

To provide a foundation for those who provide sexual health services and programs to men in the United States, the need for population-based data that describes men's sexual behaviors and their correlates remains.

Aims

The purpose of this study was to, in a national probability survey of men ages 18–94 years, assess the occurrence and frequency of sexual behaviors and their associations with relationship status and health status.

Methods

A national probability sample of 2,522 men aged 18 to 94 completed a cross-sectional survey about their sexual behaviors, relationship status, and health.

Main Outcome Measures

Relationship status; health status; experience of solo masturbation, partnered masturbation, giving oral sex, receiving oral sex, vaginal intercourse and anal intercourse, in the past 90 days; frequency of solo masturbation, vaginal intercourse and anal intercourse in the past year.

Results

Masturbation, oral intercourse, and vaginal intercourse are prevalent among men throughout most of their adult life, with both occurrence and frequency varying with age and as functions of relationship type and physical health status. Masturbation is prevalent and frequent across various stages of life and for both those with and without a relational partner, with fewer men with fair to poor health reporting recent masturbation. Patterns of giving oral sex to a female partner were similar to those for receiving oral sex. Vaginal intercourse in the past 90 days was more prevalent among men in their late 20s and 30s than in the other age groups, although being reported by approximately 50% of men in the sixth and seventh decades of life. Anal intercourse and sexual interactions with other men were less common than all other sexual behaviors.

Conclusion

Contemporary men in the United States engage in diverse solo and partnered sexual activities; however, sexual behavior is less common and more infrequent among older age cohorts.

### Male contraception: where are we going and where have we been? [^8e8c64c2]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2019). High credibility.

Social probabilities

Ample evidence exists to show that high proportions of men find the idea of a male contraceptive acceptable and that women would rely on their male partners to use a male contraceptive method.

It is important to remember that many women rely on their male partner for contraception already — approximately 54% of women in the UK use either male sterilisation, male condom or withdrawal method as their main method of contraception.

Thus, men want to engage in reproductive health, but their current options are limited compared with the range of contraceptive choices available to women. Male hormonal contraceptive methods do not currently exist on the market anywhere globally and so we cannot base our assumptions on future use of these methods on how current methods are used. Men may be attracted to male hormonal contraceptives for non-contraceptive benefits, similar to the familiar non-contraceptive benefits of female hormonal methods, and this is an aspect that can potentially be 'engineered' into methods based on novel steroids.

What to know
- CDC recommends everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated COVID-19 vaccine, including if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future. Learn which vaccines are available by age and how to stay up to date with your COVID-19 vaccination.
- There is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems in women or men. No Evidence That COVID-19 Vaccines Affect Fertility There is currently no evidence that vaccine ingredients or antibodies made following COVID-19 vaccination would cause any problems with becoming pregnant now or in the future.

Limited, Temporary Impact of COVID-19 Vaccines on Menstrual Cycles Results from recent research studies may not observe any changes or they may observe small and temporary changes in their periods after COVID-19 vaccination, including:

- Longer-lasting menstrual periods
- Shorter intervals between periods
- Heavier bleeding than usual Despite these temporary changes in menstruation, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause fertility problems. Research Studies of Fertility in Healthy Men
- Currently, there is no evidence that shows vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause male fertility problems. A recent small study of 45 healthy men who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine looked at sperm characteristics, like quantity and movement, before and after vaccination. Researchers found no significant changesin these sperm characteristics after vaccination.
- However, one study found that COVID-19 infection may be associated with a decline in fertility for men for up to 60 days after infection.
- However, one study found that COVID-19 infection may be associated with a decline in fertility for men for up to 60 days after infection
- Fever from any illness has been associated with a short-term decrease in sperm production in healthy men. Although fever can be a side effect of COVID-19 vaccination, there is no current evidence that fever after COVID-19 vaccination affects sperm production. Fever is also a common symptom of COVID-19 infection. Fever, for any reason, has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Fever in pregnancy may be treated with acetaminophen as needed, and in consultation with a healthcare provider. It is not recommended you take these medicines before vaccination to try to prevent side effects. Keep ReadingStaying Up to Date with COVID-19 Vaccines.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^eeda88e2]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Conception methods that reduce the risk of sexual and perinatal transmission in HIV-discordant couples — Current HHS guidelines recommend consideration of special conception options (preferably after expert consultation) that have been shown to reduce the risk of HIV transmission in HIV-discordant couples attempting conception. For couples preferring natural conception after counseling, options include timed, periovulatory unprotected intercourse after the partner with HIV has achieved maximal viral suppression through antiretroviral therapy (ART) with use of male or female condoms for all other acts of intercourse, and use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to further reduce acquisition risk for the HIV-uninfected partner during unprotected intercourse. For couples in which the man is HIV-infected and can access assisted methods, options include preconception semen analysis and intrauterine artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, or intracytoplasmic sperm injection using semen from an HIV-uninfected donor or sperm from the HIV-infected man that has undergone procedures that remove seminal fluid that may contain HIV ("sperm washing"). For couples using methods that involve exposure to potentially HIV-infected semen or other genital secretions, periodic HIV testing of HIV-uninfected partners to identify early infection and to hasten linkage to HIV medical care is warranted. The availability, insurance coverage, and affordability of these methods may vary by the individual's area of residence and health insurance status.

### Consensus statement: supporting safer conception and pregnancy for men and women living with and affected by HIV [^b4155156]. AIDS and Behavior (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions/Recommendations

It is time to implement safer conception services. This consensus is supported by science, consumer demand, and global goals to eliminate perinatal HIV transmission. We recommend that providers offer available safer conception services to HIV-affected men and women, and health program administrators integrate safer conception services into existing HIV and reproductive health programs. While the range of service choices may vary across settings, in all settings a minimal set of safer conception services is available. The most fundamental tenets of safer conception counseling are know your HIV-serostatus, know your partner's HIV-serostatus, and wait until the partner living with HIV is on effective ART before attempting pregnancy. These basic tenets should be widely shared with HIV-affected persons, families, communities, and providers. We maintain that this work no longer needs to be the purview of specialists. Answers to outstanding questions will refine care, implementation, and policy but do not need to be resolved prior to offering services.

HIV-related stigma is a key barrier to uptake and delivery of safer conception care. People living with and affected by HIV who consider pregnancy or become pregnant and have children express internalized stigma and describe experiences of stigma from providers and community. Stigma compromises the willingness of clients to seek care and provider willingness to address reproductive goals with clients. It is imperative to acknowledge and support the sexual and reproductive rights of persons living with and affected by HIV and focus efforts on reducing stigma at individual-, provider-, and community-levels, such that HIV-affected men and women can make informed decisions and build healthy families.

We must develop tools that support HIV-affected persons to identify potential risk, engage with safer conception services, and use methods that align with preferences and level of risk. The goal is to engage all populations who could benefit from services including mutually-disclosed HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual couples, men and women living with or exposed to HIV, same sex couples, and seroconcordant-positive couples. Safer conception care must be flexible and address a diversity of clients.

### Menotropins (menopur) [^99ad66b5]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

What are possible side effects of MENOPUR?

MENOPUR may cause serious side effects, including:

ovaries that are too large. MENOPUR may cause your ovaries to be abnormally large. Symptoms of large ovaries include bloating or pain in your lower stomach (pelvic) area. If your ovaries become too large your healthcare provider may tell you that you should not have intercourse (sex) so you do not rupture an ovarian cyst.
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Using MENOPUR may cause OHSS. OHSS is a serious medical condition that can happen when your ovaries produce too many eggs (overstimulated). OHSS can cause fluid to suddenly build up in the area of your stomach, chest, heart, and cause blood clots to form. OHSS may also happen after you stop using MENOPUR. Stop using MENOPUR and call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have any of the following symptoms of OHSS:
severe pelvic or stomach pain
nausea
vomiting
sudden weight gain
swollen stomach
diarrhea
trouble breathing
decreased or no urine
lung problems. MENOPUR may cause serious lung problems that can sometimes lead to death including fluid in the lungs, trouble breathing, and worsening of asthma.
blood clots. MENOPUR may increase your chance of having blood clots in your blood vessels. Blood clots can cause:
blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis)
stroke
loss of your arm or leg
blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolus)
twisting (torsion) of your ovary. MENOPUR may increase the chance of your ovary twisting, if you already have certain conditions such as OHSS, pregnancy, and previous abdominal surgery. Twisting of your ovary may lead to blood flow being cut off to your ovary.
pregnancy with and birth of multiple babies. MENOPUR may increase your chance of having a pregnancy with more than 1 baby. Having a pregnancy and giving birth to more than 1 baby at a time increases the health risk for you and your babies. Your healthcare provider should talk to you about your chances of multiple births before you start using MENOPUR.
birth defects. Babies born after ART may have an increased chance of birth defects. Your age, certain sperm problems, your genetic background, and that of your partner, and a pregnancy with more than 1 baby at a time may increase the chance that your baby may have birth defects.
ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside your womb). MENOPUR may increase your chance of having a pregnancy that is abnormally outside of your womb. Your chance of having a pregnancy outside of your womb is increased if you also have fallopian tube problems.
miscarriage. Your chance of loss of an early pregnancy may be increased if you had difficulty becoming pregnant.
tumors of the ovary. If you have used medicines like MENOPUR more than 1 time to get pregnant, you may have an increased chance of having tumors in your ovaries, including cancer.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^4310d314]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Optimizing natural fertility — intercourse timing, fertility-awareness methods, and lifestyle: The "fertile window" spans the 6-day interval ending on the day of ovulation, and frequent intercourse (every 1–2 days) during the fertile window yields the highest pregnancy rates, with results from less frequent intercourse (2–3 times per week) nearly equivalent; couples should not be advised to limit frequency when trying to conceive. Fertility-awareness methods, such as ovulation detection kits and cervical mucus monitoring, have been shown to increase the probability of conceiving in a given menstrual cycle. There is insufficient evidence that a specific diet or intake of particular macronutrients can improve natural fertility, although daily folic acid supplementation in women decreases the risk of neural tube defects in their children. Specific coital positions and postcoital routines have no impact on fertility. Alcohol abuse, recreational drugs, smoking, and high caffeine intake may all negatively impact fertility, and higher exposure to certain endocrine-disrupting chemicals and to air pollution may adversely impact fertility in women.

### Cisgender men and women report different patterns of sexual arousal and orgasm during masturbation and sexual relationships [^b11d35c5]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies comparing sexual function between the contexts of masturbation and sexual relationships are scarce. This investigation analyzed the effects of sex (male vs. female), sexual context (solitary masturbation vs. sexual relationships), and the interaction effect between both variables on sexual arousal and orgasm. From October 2023 to May 2024, the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) was used to evaluate the sexual arousal and orgasm of one thousand heterosexual cisgender Spanish adults (433 men and 567 women), aged 18–77 years, in both contexts. A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. Men reported better sexual function as measured by the ASEX questions than women did (p values between < 0.001 and 0.021). With respect to sexual context, men's arousal and ability to reach orgasm varied, with greater arousal in sexual relationships (p < 0.042) and a greater ability to reach orgasm during masturbation (p < 0.022). Finally, the sex x sexual context interaction was significant (p < 0.001), so men and women presented different patterns in arousal, penile erection/vaginal lubrication, ability to reach orgasm and satisfaction with orgasm (p values between < 0.001 and 0.034) when the contexts of solitary masturbation and sexual relationships were compared. This study highlights the importance of attending to sex and sexual context when assessing sexual function in both clinical and research settings.

### Diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunction in the male partner in the setting of infertility: a committee opinion [^03f14ccd]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

Male sexual dysfunction in infertility — conclusion statements include that psychological distress from infertility contributes to male sexual dysfunction. Studies show that significant, but treatable, medical co-morbidities may be identified during evaluation. Aspermia caused by retrograde ejaculation may be treated medically, or sperm can be collected from postejaculatory urine samples, and aspermia caused by failure of emission can be circumvented by a testicular sperm extraction attempt. Exogenous testosterone has the potential to suppress spermatogenesis and higher doses of testosterone are more likely to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-testis axis. Alternative therapies for testosterone optimization in men with symptomatic testosterone deficiency who are attempting to conceive include selective estrogen receptor modulators, aromatase inhibitors, and human chorionic gonadotropin. Erectile dysfunction is a common, correctable problem that may occur in infertile men, and evaluation and treatment of male sexual dysfunction serve as an opportunity to improve a man's somatic health. For men with symptomatic testosterone deficiency who are attempting to conceive, exogenous testosterone use should be avoided.

Fig 2
Ever sexual activity and sexual frequency in the past four weeks by Natsal survey

The proportion of participants expressing a preference for more frequent sex increased significantly between Natsal-2 (39.1% of women and 51.2% of men) and Natsal-3 (50.6% of women and 64.3% of men) and was higher among men than women. The increase was seen across all age groups and both marital status categories (table 1, table 2), with evidence of a steeper increase among those married or cohabiting (P values for interaction: 0.02 and < 0.001).

Table 3 shows age adjusted associations between odds of having sex four or more times in the past month and selected variables in Natsal-3. Occurrence of sex at least once a week (that is, four or more times in the past month) was most strongly associated with being married or cohabiting (P < 0.001); being in work or training (P < 0.001); working longer rather than shorter hours (P < 0.001); and with not having depression (P < 0.001). Age adjusted odds for sex at least once a week decreased significantly with poorer health status and with increasing disability and increased with earnings, more markedly among men (test for trend: men: P < 0.001; women P = 0.02). They were higher among those living in households of two people as opposed to one (men: P < 0.001; women: P = 0.003), were significantly higher among men intending pregnancy (P < 0.001), and almost twice as high among women intending pregnancy (P < 0.001). Associations approaching significance were seen among men whose work was other than manual or routine (P = 0.07) and who had children aged under five in the household (P = 0.08) and among women who lived in rented accommodation (P = 0.09). For men, an inverse association approaching significance was observed between recent masturbation and sexual activity; among women, the association was reversed and strongly significant, whereby recent masturbation was associated with higher odds of having sex at least once a week.

### Safer conception strategies for HIV-serodiscordant couples: how safe is safe enough? [^3c4cfcdf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

With access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected men and women are living longer and healthier lives and have childbearing desires similar to those of HIV-unaffected individuals. Many are in HIV-serodiscordant sexual partnerships (with an HIV-uninfected partner), and attempts at conception confer sexual HIV transmission risk. HIV risk reduction strategies are available for HIV-serodiscordant couples, in which the male is infected, who want to conceive (Table 1), but there are limited data to inform which or how many concurrent methods a couple should adopt. ART for the HIV-infected male partner is recommended regardless of conception plans, to reduce HIV transmission risk to partners and improve the man's own health. Because adherence to ART is imperfect and genital shedding of HIV may occur even in the presence of suppressed plasma viral load, couples may seek additional methods to reduce transmission risk. For an uninfected woman wishing to conceive with an infected male partner who is receiving ART, oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be a valuable option, particularly if use of ART or ART adherence by the male partner is limited. Combining PrEP for the female partner (oral tenofovir/emtricitabine, or TDF/FTC) – with ART administration to the male partner for safer conception has been acceptable in observational studies. Because PrEP trials were conducted without receipt of ART by the infected partner and ART trials were conducted without receipt of PrEP by the uninfected partner, there are no direct clinical data to estimate the benefit of using PrEP and ART together to decrease periconception HIV transmission risk, compared with either intervention alone.

### Should home-based ovulation predictor kits be offered as an additional approach for fertility management for women and couples desiring pregnancy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^eee66cda]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Global estimates show that approximately 15%–25% of couples are unable to become pregnant despite attempting for 5 years or more. Infertility is typically diagnosed if a woman is unable to become pregnant after 12 months of regular condom-less intercourse, although this timeframe may vary by age (eg, advanced maternity), anatomical abnormalities (eg, tubal occlusion, fibroids, physical disabilities) or disease (eg, HIV, endometriosis, oncofertility). Clinically, 20%–30% of infertility cases are attributable to the male partner, a similar percentage to the female partner and up to 50% to both partners. Couples diagnosed as infertile, or women who require assistance to become pregnant, may turn to medically assisted reproduction using various diagnostics and interventions, including ovulation induction, ovarian stimulation and ovulation triggering, as well as procedures using processed semen of a partner or donor such as intrauterine, intracervical and intravaginal insemination or egg collection with external in vitro fertilisation. However, many such options are unaffordable or inaccessible to women or couples in resource-constrained settings.

Better timing of condom-less intercourse or, if required or desired, the self-intravaginal insemination of semen, during the woman's fertile window can be supported using ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). OPKs are readily available in many settings worldwide without prescription, including at pharmacies, drugstores, convenience stores and supermarkets, as well as online websites which ship globally. These kits do not predict ovulation, per se, but rather the surge of luteinising hormone (LH) that precedes ovulation while also tracking corresponding oestrogen levels.OPKs do not directly pinpoint a peak fertility day and may need multiple pregnancy attempts within the appropriate timeframe during a woman's menstrual cycle. OPKs are fairly accurate at predicting ovulation and the fertile window. They increase fertility awareness about when ovulation should occur during the woman's cycle and may alert her to potential menstrual cycle abnormalities. Women with HIV sero-discordant partners could use OPKs to time intercourse and limit exposure to condom-less sex in order to reduce the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Single women, women who wish to observe specific religious or cultural traditions, migrant/irregular workers or couples in unconsummated marriages (for instance, due to male erectile dysfunction or physical disabilities) may wish to use OPKs to appropriately time condom-less intercourse or attempt self-intravaginal insemination.

### Consensus statement: supporting safer conception and pregnancy for men and women living with and affected by HIV [^ad085bca]. AIDS and Behavior (2018). Low credibility.

Safer conception interventions reduce HIV incidence while supporting the reproductive goals of people living with or affected by HIV. We developed a consensus statement to address demand, summarize science, identify information gaps, outline research and policy priorities, and advocate for safer conception services. This statement emerged from a process incorporating consultation from meetings, literature, and key stakeholders. Three co-authors developed an outline which was discussed and modified with co-authors, working group members, and additional clinical, policy, and community experts in safer conception, HIV, and fertility. Co-authors and working group members developed and approved the final manuscript. Consensus across themes of demand, safer conception strategies, and implementation were identified. There is demand for safer conception services. Access is limited by stigma towards PLWH having children and limits to provider knowledge. Efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and acceptability data support a range of safer conception strategies including ART, PrEP, limiting condomless sex to peak fertility, home insemination, male circumcision, STI treatment, couples-based HIV testing, semen processing, and fertility care. Lack of guidelines and training limit implementation. Key outstanding questions within each theme are identified. Consumer demand, scientific data, and global goals to reduce HIV incidence support safer conception service implementation. We recommend that providers offer services to HIV-affected men and women, and program administrators integrate safer conception care into HIV and reproductive health programs. Answers to outstanding questions will refine services but should not hinder steps to empower people to adopt safer conception strategies to meet reproductive goals.

### Strategies for preventing HIV infection among HIV-uninfected women attempting conception with HIV-infected men-United States [^22cc7898]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

By the end of 2014, a total of 955,081 persons in the United States (299.5 per 100,000 population) had received a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. The annual estimated number of HIV infections and incidence rate in the United States decreased from 2010 to 2014, and the survival rate has increased over time. Effective highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is helping persons with HIV to live longer, healthier lives. Many of these persons, including an unknown percentage in discordant relationships (i.e. one partner is HIV-infected, and the other is HIV-uninfected), might wish to have their own biologic children. When the female partner is HIV-infected and the male partner is not, a discordant couple can undergo autologous sperm intrauterine inseminations to achieve conception without placing the man at risk for infection. However, for HIV-discordant couples in which the man is HIV-infected and the woman is not, strategies to minimize the risk for sexual transmission are needed. In 1988, CDC recommended against insemination with semen from HIV-infected men. Since 1988, new information has emerged regarding prevention of HIV transmission in HIV-discordant couples. This report reviews laboratory and epidemiologic information regarding the prevention of HIV transmission for HIV-discordant couples, in which the male is HIV-infected and the female is HIV-uninfected, who would like to attempt conception.

Insemination with sperm from an HIV-negative donor is the safest option for an HIV-uninfected woman to conceive with an HIV-infected male partner. However, risk-reducing approaches using sperm from an HIV-infected male partner do exist. One strategy is the use of viral suppression with HAART for the male partner, with intercourse without condom protection limited to the time around ovulation, while the female partner is taking daily oral antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Another strategy that can be used in conjunction with HAART and PrEP is collection and washing of the male partner's sperm to remove cells infected with HIV, followed by testing to confirm the absence of HIV prior to intrauterine insemination (IUI) of the female partner or in vitro fertilization (IVF). Each method has a unique risk profile, might confer distinctive advantages and disadvantages, and requires varying degrees of assistance from the medical community. Before attempting conception, discordant couples might wish to discuss treatment options with an experienced medical provider who can relay the risks and benefits of each treatment modality as it applies to the couple's specific situation.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarize the proper counseling for men with severe male factor infertility.

Recent Findings

Men who are experiencing infertility should have a semen analysis, the results of which may imply additional investigations, including genetic and hormonal. Moreover, possible modifiable factors that may harm men's reproductive health should be carefully evaluated. Finally, different treatment options are available.

Summary

Approximately 15% of couples struggle with infertility. Complete evaluations of both men and women are required to determine the etiology of infertility and determine appropriate treatment.

### Consensus statement: supporting safer conception and pregnancy for men and women living with and affected by HIV [^0fd0d0ea]. AIDS and Behavior (2018). Low credibility.

Questions regarding implementation are abundant. While ideally a diverse array of providers in HIV-endemic settings should provide these services, the reality is that services will first be offered by a smaller cadre of interested, motivated, or externally-funded providers. How to expand beyond providers with a particular interest in these services remains unclear. Community health workers may play an important role. How to integrate safer conception methods into existing paradigms (e.g. HIV care, sexual and reproductive health care) to leverage resources and maximize efficiencies is unknown. Provider tools that support provision of safer conception counseling and address stigma towards PLWH having children are also needed. We also identified a need for systems to support providers offering care in settings where condomless sex without HIV disclosure among PLWH is criminalized.

On the client level of implementation, how best to support safer conception programming for HIV-concordant-positive couples, men, same-sex couples, single parents by choice, extended and co-parenting families are outstanding questions. Ensuring that pregnancy planning and reproductive agency and autonomy are promoted within safer conception services and that providers support clients who want to have children but are not yet able to safely disclose to their partner, are outstanding gaps. How to create consumer-friendly services and tools is an area for future research.

### Self-rated health and semen quality in men undergoing assisted reproductive technology [^36eda756]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Semen Collection and Analysis

Each participant provided 2 semen samples via masturbation into a sterile plastic specimen cup on different days. The first one was on the day of baseline recruitment, and the second one was on the day of ART treatment, with median (IQR) intervals of 90 (63–143) days between the 2 sample collections. Semen collection and analysis were accomplished in compliance with the guidelines set forth by the World Health Organizationas detailed in previous research. Briefly, the abstinence time was reported by the participants before semen collection. Next, analyses of sperm concentration and motility were conducted using a microcellular slide and computer-assisted semen test (CASA, WLJX 9000), and semen volume was calculated by weighing. Total sperm count equals sperm concentration multiplied by sperm volume, and total sperm motility equals progressive sperm motility plus nonprogressive sperm motility. All semen sample evaluations in this hospital were conducted by 2 professional technicians, and the measurable results revealed no statistically significant differences. External quality controls were also built by the semen laboratory and supervised by the Hubei Provincial Quality Control Center.

We conducted descriptive statistics for the basic characteristics, SRH levels, and semen quality parameters of the study population. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), defined as the intra-individual variability divided by the total variability, were calculated to assess the reproducibility of semen quality parameters using multilevel random-effects models. An ICC greater than 0.75 is defined as excellent; 0.40 to 0.75, fair to good; and less than 0.40, poor.

A linear mixed-effects model adjusting for within-participant correlations by carrying a participant-specific random intercept was applied to explore the association between SRH and semen quality. SRH as an independent variable was categorized as poor, good, and very good, where very good SRH served as the reference group. The P values for trends across decreasing SRH groups were tested when presuming equivalent distances between poor, good, and very good SRH. Sperm concentration and count were transformed using natural logarithm (ln) to improve normality and were then back-transformed to get the percentage changes for an explanation of the result by using the equation: 100% × (exp[β] − 1).

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^a88a4233]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Frequency of intercourse — effects of abstinence duration on semen parameters: Whereas abstinence intervals greater than 5 days may adversely affect sperm counts, abstinence intervals as short as 2 days are associated with normal sperm densities. A widely held misconception is that frequent ejaculations decrease male fertility. In men with normal semen quality, sperm concentrations and motility remained normal, even with daily ejaculation, and in men with oligozoospermia, sperm concentration and motility may be highest with daily ejaculation. After longer abstinence intervals of 10 days or more, semen parameters begin to deteriorate.

### Randomised control trial of a smoking cessation intervention directed at men whose partners are pregnant [^7b43ce7a]. Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although smoking cessation programs significantly reduce smoking rates in the general population, some sectors are poorly motivated by them, especially healthy men from lower socioeconomic classes.

Methods

By using a significant life event (approaching birth of a child) we exploited a time of increased receptiveness to smoking cessation influences. A multicomponent intervention was conducted and evaluated using a stratified, randomised control trial, with an intention to treat analysis.

Results

Five hundred and sixty-one men were enrolled and 505 (90%) followed to the end of their partners' pregnancy. At 6-month follow-up 16.5% of 291 smokers of the intervention group and 9.3% of 270 in the control group reported they had stopped smoking (P = 0.011, OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.31–0.86). The strongest predictors of smoking cessation were being in a skilled occupation, having a higher number of quit attempts in the previous year and having the first cigarette of the day relatively later.

Conclusions

The number of smoking men who had to be treated to achieve one stopping smoking (NNT) during their partner's pregnancy was 13 to 14. Innovative antismoking population health measures for the partners of antenatal patients are effective and perhaps should be more widely adopted.

Sperm preparation, in-vitro insemination and ICSI

According to World Health Organization standards, semen samples were collected from males after abstinence for 3–5 days on the day of partner oocyte retrieval. Following masturbation, semen was ejaculated into a sterile cup and allowed to liquefy for 30 min at room temperature. In accordance with the WHO guideline, embryologists prepared liquefied semen by routine discontinuous density gradient centrifugation and swim-up procedures. For subsequent fertilization, the processed sperm remained incubated. To allow fertilization to occur naturally, the IVF procedure was typically performed 39–40 h after HCG injection. We incubated each oocyte with about 20,000–30,000/ml motile sperm cells during routine and short-term IVF procedures. Prepared sperm were mixed with oocyte-cumulus complexes for overnight co-incubation for 16–18 h in routine IVF procedure. Conventional ICSI was directly performed 4–6 h after oocyte retrieval. When the patient had previous experienced fertilization failure in other centers before coming to our center for treatment or when his sperm density ≤ 5 × 10⁵/ml after the sperm preparation, the ICSI was directly conducted. The sperms with normal morphology were selected, and then injected into the cytoplasm of metaphase II (MII) oocytes.

Short-term IVF procedure, early second PB assessment, and early R-ICSI

The embryologist observed fertilization under an inverted microscope after co-incubation for 4–6 h. The release of the second polar body was used as an indicator for predicting fertilization. Specifically, after 4 h of insemination, oocytes were denuded from cumulus cells and the oocytes were immediately transferred to fresh cleavage medium for evaluation of fertilization by the presence of a second polar body. In cases where no more than 30% of oocytes released a second polar body, the observation will be extended to 6 h post-fertilization for a re-evaluation. If, at this stage, the percentage remains below 30%, the early R-ICSI will be carried out.

### Family planning and contraception use in transgender men [^e230b7ac]. Contraception (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Female-to-male (FTM) transgender men (affirmed males) can experience planned and unplanned pregnancy during and after testosterone therapy. We conducted an exploratory study to understand current contraceptive practices and fertility desires among transgender men during and after transitioning.

Study Design

Self-identified transgender and transmasculine individuals assigned female at birth, ages 18–45, completed an anonymous online survey derived from standardized family planning surveys. We recruited participants from LGBT health centers, online listservs, and online groups for transgender men and used a mixed-methods analysis to evaluate quantitative and qualitative data.

Results

Of the one hundred and ninety-seven participants included in the study, the median age was 30 years old, most respondents were white, and 86% were taking masculinizing hormones (testosterone). Of the 60 pregnancies reported, 10 (17%) pregnancies occurred after stopping testosterone, 1 (1.6%) while taking testosterone irregularly, and 5 of 7 abortions occurred in participants who had been using testosterone in the past. Over half of the respondents desired at least one child, and a quarter reported fears of not getting pregnant. The majority of participants reporting using contraception (n = 110, 60.1%), with condoms and pills used most commonly (n = 90, 49.2% and n = 62, 33.9% respectively). Methods of contraception used did not differ between testosterone users and non-users, except for hormonal IUDs (20% testosterone versus 7% non-testosterone). Thirty participants (16.4%) believed that testosterone was a form of contraception, and 10 (5.5%) participants reported that their healthcare providers advised testosterone as contraception.

Conclusion

Transgender men use contraception and can experience pregnancy and abortion, even after transitioning socially and hormonally. Transgender men need counseling and care regarding reproductive health, including contraceptive and conception counseling.

Implications

Providers should be aware that transgender men may desire pregnancy and use contraception; this study highlights the need for further research regarding fertility, fertility desires, and optimal contraception among transgender men.

### Poverty and social disadvantage in women and men and fertility outcomes [^7d027471]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Time to Pregnancy and Miscarriage

As previously noted, time to pregnancy and mode of conception were assessed through questionnaires in preconception and early pregnancy. Participants reported the date at which they started trying to conceive and stopped using contraceptives (start date pursuing pregnancy) and the assisted reproductive technology date, including intrauterine insemination, ovulation induction, in vitro fertilization, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Participants included during preconception informed the study when obtaining a self-performed positive pregnancy test and provided the date of the woman's last menstrual period (LMP). Participants included during the first trimester reported the LMP date at enrollment and in questionnaires, and this was reconfirmed during first-trimester visits to the obstetric caregiver using embryo size, which translated to estimates of LMP, term date, and pregnancy duration. In women who conceived, time to pregnancy was calculated from the start date to the LMP date. In women who did not conceive, the duration of pursuing pregnancy was calculated from the start date to the last day of study participation (ie, the date when voluntarily withdrawing) or the study end date. Inclusion of participants ended on December 31, 2020, and participants were followed up until July 1, 2021 (study end date). Ongoing pregnancies at that point were followed up until birth. Time to pregnancy was assessed continuously and categorized. Continuous time to pregnancy was used to assess fecundability, which is the per-month probability of conceiving, defined as 4 weeks (28 days), to represent a regular menstrual cycle length. Time to pregnancy was categorized as fertile (0–52 weeks [12 months]) or infertile (time to pregnancy or, in cases of not conceiving, duration of pursuing pregnancy of > 52 weeks [> 12 months] or use of assisted reproductive technology), according to the clinical definition. Spontaneous miscarriage was defined as a pregnancy loss before 22 weeks' gestation. Miscarriage date and gestational age of miscarriage were obtained from the obstetric caregiver using LMP dates and due date based on ultrasonography, the date of intrauterine insemination, or embryo implant day minus 14 days in cases of in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection.

### Preventing gaps when switching contraceptives [^2ae8ee89]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Unintended pregnancy can occur when women stop one birth control method before starting another. To prevent gaps in contraception, physicians should ask women regularly about adverse effects, cost, difficulty remembering the next dose, and other issues that affect adherence. Women who want to change contraceptive methods need accurate advice about how to do so. Some contraception transitions require an overlap between the old method and the new method. To switch safely from one contraceptive to another without overlap, women may go directly from the old method to the new method, abstaining from sexual intercourse or using a barrier method, such as condoms or spermicide, for the first seven days.

Materials/Subjects and methods

Study design and population

This nationwide survey was part of the Norm Study 2021. The Norm Study is carried out every few years using quota sampling to investigate QOL and factors that may be associated with it. The previous such survey was conducted in 2016. The participants were men aged 20 through 84 years at the time of the survey. Data from those who answered all the questions were included. Those who could not read or write Japanese were not included. An independent research company, the Nippon Research Center, distributed the questionnaire via the Internet from January 5 through March 4, 2021. The sample was drawn from a panel comprising about 1.4 million residents of all areas of Japan. The sample was designed to represent the general population of Japan at the time of the national census in 2015, and individuals were included until the goal of 5000 men was reached. Japan was divided into five areas, and quotas were set by area and by age. This study was done in accordance with the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review boards of Kagawa University's Faculty of Medicine and of the Institute for Health Outcomes and Process Evaluation Research. All participants provided written informed consent electronically.

Data collection

Demographic characteristics

The survey was used to collect information about demographic characteristics, QOL, and prostatitis-like symptoms experienced during the previous year. We collected data on age, body-mass index, comorbidities, depressive symptoms, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, history of sexually transmitted diseases, male infertility, high prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, sexual activity, living status (living alone or not), full-time employment, annual household income, and formal schooling. The presence of depressive symptoms was identified using a 5-item Mental Health Inventory (cut-off score: ≤ 52). Sexual activity was defined as the number of sexual acts per month, including masturbation. A high PSA level was assumed if there was a response of 'Yes' to the question, 'Have you ever been diagnosed with a high PSA level?'. Household income was defined as "high" if the annual income was 5 million yen or more (approximately US$48,000). The level of formal schooling was defined as "high" if the respondent reported having a university degree or higher.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^4cedcd7e]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Smoking and fertility — In women, smoking has substantial adverse effects on fertility, with a large meta-analysis showing smoking women were significantly more likely to be infertile than nonsmokers (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.34–1.91), and menopause occurs, on average, 1 to 4 years earlier in smokers; smoking is also associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, while in men, although semen parameter abnormalities have been observed, the available data do not demonstrate conclusively that smoking decreases male fertility.

### Consensus statement: supporting safer conception and pregnancy for men and women living with and affected by HIV [^aca5413a]. AIDS and Behavior (2018). Low credibility.

We support development and implementation of strategies that can be adopted in diverse settings to support HIV-affected persons to achieve reproductive goals including increased access to ART and PrEP, HIV-RNA testing, STI testing, sperm washing and assisted reproductive technologies, and fertility care. Programs must be nimble in incorporating discussions about reproductive goals at many points in a client's care without creating undue burden on providers or systems. Integrating safer conception messaging into public health targets for HIV prevention and treatment can maximize synergies.

Provider-initiated conversation is an important gateway to practicing safer conception. Providers across diverse disciplines and training-levels should be able to discuss reproductive options with HIV-affected couples and individuals. Tools to support providers to offer services are required, as are strategies and financing to support service integration.

Documenting the effect of safer conception is paramount for guidelines and for the confidence of providers and consumers. EMTCT and treatment as prevention initiatives dovetail with safer conception efforts. Data highlighting the advantages of these synergies may catalyze changes in policy and programs. Ensuring that the voices, values, preferences, and experiences of PLWH are at the forefront of safer conception messaging can normalize care-seeking and pregnancy in the context of HIV.

It is time to seize the opportunity to empower people affected by HIV to embrace their fertility goals and utilize safer conception strategies to satisfy goals for pregnancy with minimal HIV transmission risks. This group consensus is strongly supported by science, consumer demand, and global goals to reduce HIV incidence and eliminate perinatal transmission. We invite you to endorse this statement at.

### Ectogestation for men: why arent't we talking about it? [^3a4804af]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Andrea Bidoli argues that ectogestation could be seen as an emancipatory intervention for women. Specifically, she claims that ectogestation would create unique conditions to reevaluate one's reproductive preference, address certain specific negative social implications of gestation and childbirth, and that it is unfair to hold ectogestation to a higher standard than other innovations such as modern contraceptives and non-medical egg freezing. In this commentary, I claim that Bidoli-like so many others-unjustly bypasses men and their reproductive desires. For a long time, the discussion of the ethics of ectogenesis has focused on women and their reproductive liberation. However, since in many countries, an increasing number of men in reproductive age face difficulties in finding a partner and lack access to other forms of assisted reproduction, it is men who need ectogestation the most.

### Female subfertility [^16127186]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

With an average monthly fecundity rate of only 20%, human beings are not fertile mammals. 10–15% of couples have difficulties conceiving, or conceiving the number of children they want, and seek specialist fertility care at least once during their reproductive lifetime. Dependent on the two main factors that determine subfertility, duration of childlessness and age of the woman, three questions need to be addressed before treatment is offered. Is it time to start the routine fertility investigation? — ie, has sufficient exposure to the chance of conception taken place? Are cost-effective, safe, and reliable treatments available for the disorder diagnosed? And, should the couple be referred straightaway for assisted reproduction?

### Update: interim guidance for preconception counseling and prevention of sexual transmission of zika virus for men with possible zika virus exposure-United States, August 2018 [^a4df17c8]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Zika virus infection can occur as a result of mosquitoborne or sexual transmission of the virus. Infection during pregnancy is a cause of fetal brain abnormalities and other serious birth defects (1,2). CDC has updated the interim guidance for men with possible Zika virus exposure who 1) are planning to conceive with their partner, or 2) want to prevent sexual transmission of Zika virus at any time (3). CDC now recommends that men with possible Zika virus exposure who are planning to conceive with their partner wait for at least 3 months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or their last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) before engaging in unprotected sex. CDC now also recommends that for couples who are not trying to conceive, men can consider using condoms or abstaining from sex for at least 3 months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or their last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) to minimize their risk for sexual transmission of Zika virus. All other guidance for Zika virus remains unchanged. The definition of possible Zika virus exposure remains unchanged and includes travel to or residence in an area with risk for Zika virus transmission (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/world-map-areas-with-zika) or sex without a condom with a partner who traveled to or lives in an area with risk for Zika virus transmission. CDC will continue to update recommendations as new information becomes available.

### Update: interim guidance for preconception counseling and prevention of sexual transmission of zika virus for persons with possible zika virus exposure-United States, September 2016 [^9d941c62]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

CDC has updated its interim guidance for persons with possible Zika virus exposure who are planning to conceive (1) and interim guidance to prevent transmission of Zika virus through sexual contact (2), now combined into a single document. Guidance for care for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure was previously published (3). Possible Zika virus exposure is defined as travel to or residence in an area of active Zika virus transmission (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html), or sex* without a condom † with a partner who traveled to or lived in an area of active transmission. Based on new though limited data, CDC now recommends that all men with possible Zika virus exposure who are considering attempting conception with their partner, regardless of symptom status, § wait to conceive until at least 6 months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic). Recommendations for women planning to conceive remain unchanged: women with possible Zika virus exposure are recommended to wait to conceive until at least 8 weeks after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic). Couples with possible Zika virus exposure, who are not pregnant and do not plan to become pregnant, who want to minimize their risk for sexual transmission of Zika virus should use a condom or abstain from sex for the same periods for men and women described above. Women of reproductive age who have had or anticipate future Zika virus exposure who do not want to become pregnant should use the most effective contraceptive method that can be used correctly and consistently. These recommendations will be further updated when additional data become available.

### Comparison of semen parameters in samples collected by masturbation at a clinic and at home [^bafff47e]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate differences in semen quality between samples collected by masturbation at a clinic and at home.

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting

Fertility center.

Patient(S)

Three hundred seventy-nine men assessed for infertility.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Semen was analyzed according to World Health Organization guidelines. Seminal markers of epididymal (neutral alpha-glucosidase), prostatic (prostate-specific antigen and zinc), and seminal vesicle (fructose) function were measured. Two patient groups were defined according to sample collection location: at a clinic (n = 273) or at home (n = 106).

Result(S)

Compared with clinic-collected semen, home-collected samples had statistically significantly higher values for sperm concentration, total sperm count, rapid progressive motility, and total count of progressive motility. Semen volume, proportion of normal sperm morphology, neutral alpha-glucosidase, prostate-specific antigen, zinc, and fructose did not differ significantly between groups. An abnormal sperm concentration (< 20 × 10⁶/mL) was seen in statistically significantly fewer of the samples obtained at home (19/106, 18%) than at the clinic (81/273, 30%), and the same applied to proportions of samples with abnormal (< 25%) rapid progressive motility (68/106 [64%] and 205/273 [75%], respectively).

Conclusion(S)

The present results demonstrate superior semen quality in samples collected by masturbation at home compared with at a clinic. This should be taken into consideration in infertility investigations.
