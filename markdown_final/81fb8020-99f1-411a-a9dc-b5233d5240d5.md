Terciary siphilis diagnosis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose tertiary syphilis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to suspect tertiary syphilis based on risk factors and clinical phenotypes. Then, I should review the initial serologic screening strategy and its limitations in late disease. Next, I will examine how to resolve discrepant results with confirmatory testing pathways, including when to use molecular tests. After that, I need to check the indications for cerebrospinal fluid assessment and how to interpret CSF studies. Then, I will consider organ-specific workups to characterize involvement. I should confirm the need for HIV and other STI screening. I will review the key differentials and how to discriminate them. Finally, I will synthesize staging and outline treatment-linked follow-up, and then summarize the diagnostic algorithm concisely.

> Let me first confirm when to suspect tertiary syphilis: years after untreated or undertreated infection, patients may present with cardiovascular aortitis or aneurysm, gummatous lesions in skin/bone/viscera, or neurosyphilis with neurologic, ocular, or otic symptoms; risk is higher with HIV coinfection, multiple partners, homelessness, and older age, so I need to take a meticulous sexual and treatment history and perform a targeted systems review to surface late manifestations [^113freNP] [^111pwrxE].

> I should double-check the initial laboratory approach: screening must use both a non-treponemal test (RPR or VDRL) and a treponemal assay (EIA/CLIA, TPPA, FTA-ABS) because no single test suffices, but I must remember that in tertiary syphilis serum non-treponemal sensitivity can fall to roughly 47–64%, so a negative RPR/VDRL does not exclude late disease and I should still obtain a treponemal test and quantify any non-treponemal titer for baseline monitoring [^113yZW16] [^111DoAmU] [^115kRHaF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions with discrepant results; following traditional or reverse algorithms, if the screening test is treponemal-positive I should reflex a quantitative RPR/VDRL on the same serum, and if screening was RPR/VDRL-positive I should confirm with a different treponemal test on the same or second specimen per IUSTI and BASHH, repeating both tests in about one month if treponemal-positive and non-treponemal-negative with diagnostic uncertainty suggestive of late infection [^112Ba4FA] [^111mVdU3] [^114cM4bv] [^1175xqBw] [^113yZW16].

> I need to check what to do when tests are discrepant and gummatous disease is suspected; I should obtain lesion-directed molecular testing where organisms may be found, such as PCR for Treponema pallidum from tissue or exudate, and consider histopathology with plasma cell–rich granulomas and treponemal immunohistochemistry to support the diagnosis when serologies are inconclusive in late disease [^116WcRNP] [^111pwrxE].

> Now, regarding CSF testing, I initially thought CSF analysis is mandatory for all tertiary syphilis cases including cardiovascular and gummatous forms, and one European summary does state CSF assessment is recommended in tertiary syphilis, so my first inclination was to lumbar puncture every such patient immediately [^112KRZZB]. Wait, let me verify against the broader IUSTI guidance and related statements; more detailed IUSTI recommendations emphasize performing CSF assessment in patients with neurological, ocular, or auricular involvement, not in early syphilis without such features, and to consider CSF in certain asymptomatic contexts in HIV with late syphilis or high titers and in ocular syphilis to aid differential diagnosis and follow-up, so I should not reflexively perform CSF in every cardiovascular or gummatous case unless there are neuro-ocular-otic findings or specific high-risk features, recognizing that practices vary and expert consultation can reconcile these nuances for individual patients [^114UmpCR] [^116gKjft] [^11666zWP] [^114UmpCR].

> Let me think about how to interpret CSF if obtained; I should assess WBC count and protein for inflammation, recognize that CSF VDRL is highly specific but insensitive so a positive result confirms neurosyphilis whereas a negative does not exclude it, and consider a CSF treponemal test such as FTA-ABS for higher sensitivity in the right clinical context while integrating all CSF and serologic data with the phenotype to finalize staging and treatment [^114UmpCR] [^115kRHaF].

> Next, I should review organ-specific evaluation to characterize disease; for suspected cardiovascular syphilis I will obtain echocardiography and cross-sectional imaging of the thoracic aorta to evaluate for aortic root dilation, aneurysm, and regurgitation, for suspected gummas I will pursue biopsy when feasible with treponemal staining or PCR and imaging for deep lesions, for ocular symptoms I will involve ophthalmology for slit-lamp and fundus examination, and for otic symptoms I will obtain audiometry and consider vestibular testing, ensuring I correlate findings with serology and, if indicated, CSF results [^111pwrxE] [^116WcRNP] [^111TYkKY] [^114Lrg6d].

> I should confirm comprehensive STI screening and HIV evaluation, because syphilis and HIV frequently coexist and coinfection may alter thresholds for CSF evaluation and follow-up; I will test for HIV in all patients with syphilis, screen for gonorrhea and chlamydia at exposed sites, assess hepatitis B and C status and vaccination needs, and coordinate care according to CDC and DHHS guidance [^113G9qA9] [^1176Zib3].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis carefully; tertiary syphilis can mimic vasculitides, atherosclerotic aneurysm, granulomatous infections like tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, malignancies, demyelinating disorders, and autoimmune inner ear disease, so I need to ensure diagnostic certainty by integrating treponemal serology, lesion histology with treponemal detection when available, CSF analysis when indicated, and I should be ready to revise the working diagnosis if data point elsewhere despite positive serology, avoiding premature closure [^111pwrxE] [^116WcRNP] [^115kRHaF].

> Let me reconsider how to synthesize and stage the disease; staging requires history and examination rather than lab results alone, and confirmation of tertiary syphilis hinges on a positive treponemal test, compatible clinical manifestations, exclusion of reasonable alternatives, and, when appropriate, CSF evaluation to identify or rule out neurosyphilis, with a quantitative non-treponemal titer recorded to enable monitoring over time [^111msfK7] [^1127w5YA].

> Next, I should review treatment-linked diagnostic follow-up planning even though therapy itself is beyond diagnosis; for tertiary syphilis without neurosyphilis I will plan benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly weekly for three doses and for neurosyphilis, ocular, or otic involvement I will plan intravenous aqueous penicillin G for 10–14 days, anticipate Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions, consider short-course corticosteroids in neuro or cardiovascular disease per BASHH, and schedule quantitative RPR/VDRL at 6, 12, and 24 months expecting at least a fourfold decline by 12–24 months, with CSF re-evaluation if initially abnormal until normalization or stabilization is achieved [^113G9qA9] [^1146r2CA] [^114PJWe8] [^112dRLSz].

> To summarize the diagnostic algorithm, I should ensure that in a high-probability scenario I obtain both treponemal and quantitative non-treponemal serology up front, resolve discrepancies with reflex testing and repeat serology as needed, avoid excluding tertiary disease based on a negative RPR/VDRL, proceed to CSF when there are neurological, ocular, or otic features or high-risk contexts, perform organ-specific assessments and targeted lesion testing, screen for HIV and other STIs, rule out mimics, and then finalize staging with a documented non-treponemal baseline for follow-up, recognizing that careful self-checks at each step help prevent missed neurosyphilis and ensure appropriate therapy initiation without delay [^113yZW16] [^111msfK7] [^111DoAmU] [^113G9qA9].

Tertiary syphilis diagnosis requires a **combination of clinical assessment and serologic testing** [^111pwrxE], with **CSF analysis when neurologic, ocular, or otic involvement is suspected** [^114UmpCR]. Serologic diagnosis uses a treponemal test (EIA/CIA/TPPA/TPHA) for screening, confirmed by a different treponemal test [^114cM4bv], and a **quantitative non-treponemal test** (RPR/VDRL) for activity and monitoring [^113yZW16]. CSF analysis is indicated for neurologic, ocular, or otic symptoms [^114UmpCR], or for cardiovascular/gummatous disease [^112KRZZB], and includes CSF VDRL, cell count, protein, and glucose [^114UmpCR]. Imaging (MRI, CT, echocardiography) [^111pwrxE] and histopathology may be needed for atypical or organ-specific disease [^113freNP]. Diagnosis is **confirmed by compatible clinical findings**, positive treponemal tests, and supportive non-treponemal titers, with CSF or tissue confirmation when indicated [^111mVdU3].

---

## Clinical assessment and staging

Tertiary syphilis is **assessed clinically** by identifying **gummatous lesions** [^113freNP], **cardiovascular involvement** (e.g. aortitis, aneurysms), and **neurosyphilis** (e.g. tabes dorsalis, general paresis) [^112dmXW2]. Staging is guided by clinical history and examination [^1127w5YA] because laboratory results alone cannot determine the stage.

---

## Serologic testing

Serologic testing is **the cornerstone of tertiary syphilis diagnosis**, using treponemal assays (EIA, CIA, TPPA, TPHA) for screening [^117CbhvJ] with confirmation by a different treponemal test [^114cM4bv]; treponemal tests typically remain positive for life and cannot distinguish active from past infection [^115kRHaF]. Non-treponemal tests (RPR, VDRL) provide quantitative assessment of disease activity and treatment response but have lower sensitivity in tertiary syphilis (47–64%) [^111DoAmU]. The testing algorithm screens with a treponemal test [^113yZW16], confirms with a different treponemal assay [^114cM4bv], and then performs a quantitative non-treponemal test to assess activity [^111mVdU3].

---

## Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis

CSF analysis is indicated when **neurologic, ocular, or otic involvement** is suspected:

- **Indications**: Clinical evidence of neurological, ocular, or otic involvement [^114UmpCR], or cardiovascular/gummatous disease [^112KRZZB].

- **CSF tests**: CSF VDRL (specific but less sensitive), cell count, protein, and glucose levels [^114UmpCR].

- **Interpretation**: Positive CSF VDRL, elevated protein, and pleocytosis support neurosyphilis diagnosis [^111pwrxE].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging studies are **essential for detecting organ-specific involvement** in tertiary syphilis [^112dmXW2]. MRI delineates neurologic involvement, gummatous lesions, and cardiovascular abnormalities; CT helps identify osseous and gummatous lesions and cardiovascular involvement; and echocardiography evaluates cardiovascular disease such as aortic aneurysms and valvular disease [^111pwrxE].

---

## Histopathological examination

Histopathological examination is **indicated for atypical presentations**, when serology is inconclusive, or when gummatous lesions are suspected [^113freNP]. Findings include granulomatous inflammation, necrosis, and the presence of Treponema pallidum organisms.

---

## Diagnostic criteria and guidelines

The diagnosis of tertiary syphilis is confirmed by:

- **Clinical findings**: Compatible clinical findings (gummatous lesions, cardiovascular, or neurological involvement) [^111pwrxE].

- **Serologic tests**: Positive treponemal tests and supportive non-treponemal titers [^114cM4bv].

- **CSF analysis**: Positive CSF VDRL or abnormal CSF findings when neurological involvement is suspected [^114UmpCR].

- **Histopathology**: Histopathological confirmation when indicated [^113freNP].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Diagnosing tertiary syphilis is challenging: **non-treponemal tests have lower sensitivity** in tertiary disease, and treponemal tests remain positive for life, complicating interpretation [^111DoAmU] [^115kRHaF]. Clinical manifestations are diverse and can mimic other diseases, leading to misdiagnosis or delays [^112dmXW2]. Limited access to advanced diagnostic tools in resource-limited settings further hampers diagnosis [^111pwrxE].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential to assess **treatment response** and detect **relapse or reinfection**:

- **Serologic monitoring**: Regular quantitative non-treponemal tests (RPR or VDRL) to assess treatment response [^113G9qA9].

- **Clinical monitoring**: Regular clinical evaluations to detect relapse or reinfection [^112dRLSz].

- **CSF monitoring**: Repeat CSF analysis if neurological involvement was present initially [^114UmpCR].

---

Tertiary syphilis diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical assessment, serologic testing, CSF analysis, imaging studies, and histopathological examination. Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential to ensure **successful treatment** and prevent **complications** [^111pwrxE].

### The traditional or reverse algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis: Pros and cons [^113yZW16]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What diagnostic considerations should be taken into account when screening for syphilis using the traditional or reverse algorithm?" Improved laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is an important element of the effort to reduce syphilis rates. Screening for syphilis is performed using either a nontreponemal or treponemal test (part of the traditional or reverse algorithm, respectively).

Both syphilis algorithms are used by laboratories. However, there are limited data on the performance and cost-effectiveness of the algorithms. An expert panel generated "key questions" in the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis. This paper pertains to the key factors that should be considered when deciding whether to screen for syphilis using either the traditional or the reverse algorithm. A systematic literature review was performed, and tables of evidence were created to address this question.

- **Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction**: One of the patients in the study, who presented with bilateral posterior uveitis, including ASPPC, vitritis, and exudative retinal detachment, experienced a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This reaction was characterized by headache, fever, and a generalized maculopapular rash, which started 24 hours after the first dose of benzylpenicillin and was alleviated with paracetamol. The reaction resolved completely within 48 hours. Notably, the patient had an initial serum VDRL titer of 1:256 dilutions upon admission.

- **Evolution of ocular syphilis cases over time**: Over the past fourteen years, the incidence of ocular syphilis at our ophthalmological center has shown a notable trend of increase and fluctuation, reflecting broader epidemiological patterns of syphilis infection, especially in the 2022–2023 biennium as shown in Figure 6, with 10 cases diagnosed.

Regarding the medical management of syphilis, particularly concerning corticosteroid use, the BASHH 2024 guidelines recommend administering corticosteroids (40–60 mg prednisolone once daily for 3 days, starting 24 hours before antibiotics) in the treatment of neurological (both early and tertiary) or cardiovascular syphilis. This precaution is advised to prevent potentially serious consequences of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.

### A 14-year retrospective clinical analysis of ocular manifestations of syphilis in a Portuguese tertiary center [^111HYxbD]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a re-emerging infectious disease with various systemic manifestations, including ocular involvement, which can lead to significant morbidity if untreated. This study aims to analyze the ocular manifestations of syphilis in patients treated at a Portuguese tertiary center over a 14-year period.

- **Patients and methods**: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with syphilis who presented with ocular symptoms from 2010 to 2023 was conducted. Data collected included demographic information, clinical presentation, ophthalmologic findings, serologic test results, treatment regimens, and outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 47 patients with ocular syphilis were identified. The mean age of the cohort was 45, with a male predominance of 78.7%. The most common ocular manifestations included uveitis (mostly posterior and panuveitis), optic neuritis, acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis, and vitritis. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at presentation was highly variable, ranging from hand movements to no impairment of visual acuity. At the end of the follow-up period, the majority of the study eyes achieved a BCVA between 0 and 0.1 (p < 0.000). Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis was associated with poorer visual outcomes after treatment, indicating its presence is a poor prognosis factor. HIV status, the presence of vitritis, vasculitis, and papillitis at presentation, a positive syphilis serology in cerebrospinal fluid, and treatment regimen did not appear to have a significant impact on the final BCVA.

- **Conclusion**: Ocular syphilis, though rare, can lead to significant visual morbidity. It is essential for clinicians to include syphilis in the differential diagnosis when encountering ocular inflammatory diseases, especially given the potential severity and systemic implications of untreated disease.

### Syphilis in the modern era: An update for physicians [^111CcEDA]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a complex, systemic disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It is most commonly transmitted sexually or congenitally and can involve nearly every organ system. Its clinical progression includes several well-characterized stages: an incubation period, a primary stage, a secondary stage, a latent stage, and a late or tertiary stage. Syphilis during pregnancy is a leading cause of perinatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and can result in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, prematurity, low birth weight, or congenital syphilis. Penicillin is highly effective against syphilis and remains the treatment of choice. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic approach, treatment, and prevention of syphilis.

### Syphilis in children [^112WApK2]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Syphilis, caused by *Treponema pallidum*, is transmitted both sexually and transplacentally. Untreated syphilis is a progressive disease that may result in death or disability in children and adults. Syphilis diagnosis requires two-stage serologic testing for nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies. Congenital syphilis diagnosis requires careful review of maternal testing and treatment, comparison of maternal and neonatal nontreponemal antibody titers, and clinical evaluation of the neonate.

In this review, we present the epidemiology of syphilis, and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of syphilis as they relate to pediatric practice, specifically, congenital syphilis and acquired syphilis in adolescents and pregnant women.

### A 14-year retrospective clinical analysis of ocular manifestations of syphilis in a Portuguese tertiary center [^115KArsJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, ocular syphilis, though rare, remains a significant cause of visual morbidity. Diagnosing syphilis-related ocular manifestations poses challenges due to its varied clinical presentations. Clinicians must maintain a high suspicion for ocular syphilis in HIV-positive patients presenting with uveitis. Early diagnosis, supported by detailed clinical history and specific ocular findings, is crucial for preventing permanent vision loss despite occasional negative serological tests.

Research into vaccines for syphilis is ongoing but lacks a viable candidate in the near term. Recent studies suggest potential for biomedical prevention using doxycycline: a daily dose reduced syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia infections by 73% in HIV-infected men. While routine use of doxycycline is not recommended yet, it may become a key preventive strategy.

Strategies to combat syphilis should include awareness and health education campaigns, promotion of condom use, and screening and treatment programs for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in health centers and hospitals.

### Pulmonary syphilis with a cicatricial variant of organizing pneumonia: a case report [^111dfjam]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a chronic disease that progresses in the primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages. Pulmonary manifestations of syphilis are rare, and their histological features have not been well-described.

- **Case presentation**: A 78-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of a solitary nodular shadow in the right middle lung field on a chest radiograph. Five years prior, a rash appeared on both legs. He was tested for syphilis at a public health center, and the non-treponemal test result was negative. When he was approximately 35 years old, he had unspecified sexual intercourse. Chest computed tomography showed a 13-mm nodule with a cavity in S6 of the right lower lobe of the lung. Robot-assisted resection of the right lower lobe was performed because of suspected localized right lower lobe lung cancer. A cicatricial variant of organizing pneumonia (CiOP) was observed, and immunohistochemistry identified Treponema pallidum inside the macrophages in the nodule cavity. The rapid plasma regain (RPR) value was negative, and the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay was positive. The patient was diagnosed as having secondary syphilis with pulmonary involvement. Insidious progression of secondary syphilis may result in CiOP and a negative RPR test result.

- **Conclusions**: We report the first case of pulmonary syphilis with a histological pattern of CiOP. It may be asymptomatic and difficult to diagnose because the RPR test may be negative for a long period of time. When either non-treponemal or treponemal test results are positive, the possibility of pul…

### Syphilis in pregnancy [^111sXip9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Despite a national plan to eliminate syphilis by 2005, recent trends have reversed previously achieved progress in the United States. After a nadir between 2000 and 2013, rates of primary and secondary syphilis among women and congenital syphilis rose by 172% and 185% between 2014 and 2018, respectively. Screening early in pregnancy, repeat screening in the third trimester, and at delivery among women at high risk, adherence to recommended treatment regimens, and prompt reporting of newly diagnosed syphilis cases to local public health authorities are strategies that obstetrician-gynecologists can employ to fight the epidemic.

In this report, clinical manifestations and management of syphilis in pregnancy are reviewed. Both traditional and reverse sequence screening algorithms are reviewed in detail in the context of clinical obstetrics.

### Sexually acquired syphilis: Historical aspects, microbiology, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations [^113ZB6Lm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020).

Syphilis is caused by infection with the spirochetal bacterium Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum. It was first recognized in the late 15th century. Since 2000, the incidence of sexually acquired syphilis has increased substantially in the developed world, with men who have sex with men and persons living with HIV infection disproportionately affected. Clinical manifestations of syphilis are protean and often include mucocutaneous manifestations. This article reviews the historical aspects, microbiology, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of sexually acquired syphilis in a continuing medical education series.

### Vital signs: Missed opportunities for preventing congenital syphilis - United States, 2022 [^116aeAAn]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

In a time when perinatal infections like HIV and hepatitis B are declining in the United States, cases of congenital syphilis, a disease resulting from perinatal transmission of syphilis, have substantially increased. During 2012–2021, the number of reported congenital syphilis cases rose by 755%, from 335 in 2012 to 2,865 by 2021. Congenital syphilis can result in stillbirth, miscarriage, or neonatal death. Surviving infants who do not receive adequate treatment might develop blindness, deafness, developmental delays, or skeletal abnormalities.

Congenital syphilis is preventable through timely testing and adequate treatment of syphilis during pregnancy. The increases in congenital syphilis reflect trends observed in rates of primary and secondary syphilis cases among women of reproductive age, which increased by 676% (from 2.1 to 16.3 per 100,000 population) between 2012 and 2021. There are racial and geographic disparities in rates of congenital syphilis and syphilis among women.

To reduce perinatal transmission, the CDC recommends screening for syphilis during pregnancy at the first prenatal care visit. Where access to prenatal care is suboptimal, screening and treatment (if indicated) should occur as soon as pregnancy is identified. The CDC advises screening at 28 weeks' gestation and at delivery for those who: 1) live in communities with high rates of syphilis, 2) are at high risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g. due to substance use or a new sex partner), or 3) were not previously tested during the pregnancy.

### Pulmonary syphilis with a cicatricial variant of organizing pneumonia: A case report [^117HvbfW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a chronic disease that progresses through primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages. Pulmonary manifestations of syphilis are rare, and their histological features have not been well described.

- **Case presentation**: A 78-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to a solitary nodular shadow in the right middle lung field on a chest radiograph. Five years prior, a rash appeared on both legs. He was tested for syphilis at a public health center, and the non-treponemal test result was negative. When he was approximately 35 years old, he had unspecified sexual intercourse. Chest computed tomography showed a 13-mm nodule with a cavity in S6 of the right lower lobe of the lung. Robot-assisted resection of the right lower lobe was performed because of suspected localized right lower lobe lung cancer. A cicatricial variant of organizing pneumonia (CiOP) was observed, and immunohistochemistry identified Treponema pallidum inside the macrophages in the nodule cavity. The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) value was negative, and the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay was positive. The patient was diagnosed with secondary syphilis with pulmonary involvement. Insidious progression of secondary syphilis may result in CiOP and a negative RPR test result.

- **Conclusions**: We report the first case of pulmonary syphilis with a histological pattern of CiOP. It may be asymptomatic and difficult to diagnose because the RPR test may be negative for a long period. When either non-treponemal or treponemal test results are positive, the possibility of pulmonary involvement should be considered.

### A patient with secondary syphilis following incomplete treatment of primary infection [^1162ciXw]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum and is primarily transmitted via skin-to-skin or mucosal contact during sexual encounters, or through vertical transmission during pregnancy. Cases continue to rise globally across various demographic groups despite effective treatment and prevention interventions. We discuss the case of a 28-year-old cisgender man who presented with secondary syphilis one month after being inadequately treated for primary syphilis. Individuals can present with symptoms and signs of syphilis to clinicians of various subspecialties due to diverse clinical presentations. All healthcare providers should be able to identify the common and less common manifestations of this infection. Adequate treatment and follow-up are crucial to preventing serious sequelae. Novel biomedical prevention interventions, such as doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis, are on the horizon.

- **Interference with timely diagnosis of syphilis**: Cipro has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis. Antimicrobial agents used in high doses for short periods to treat gonorrhea may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis. It is essential to perform a serologic test for syphilis in all patients with gonorrhea at the time of diagnosis and conduct a follow-up serologic test for syphilis three months after Cipro treatment.

- **Crystalluria**: Crystals of ciprofloxacin have been observed rarely in the urine of human subjects but more frequently in the urine of laboratory animals, which is usually alkaline. Crystalluria related to Cipro has been reported only rarely in humans because human urine is usually acidic. To prevent the formation of highly concentrated urine, avoid alkalinity in the urine of patients receiving Cipro and ensure patients are well hydrated.

- **Blood glucose disturbances**: Fluoroquinolones, including Cipro, have been associated with disturbances in blood glucose levels, including symptomatic hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (for example, glyburide) or with insulin. In these patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. Severe cases of hypoglycemia resulting in coma or death have been reported. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs in a patient being treated with Cipro, discontinue Cipro and initiate appropriate therapy immediately.

### Primary and secondary syphilis — United States, 2005–2013 [^116YjxGs]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

After being on the verge of elimination in 2000 in the United States, syphilis cases have rebounded. Rates of primary and secondary syphilis continued to increase overall during 2005–2013; although rates stabilized during 2009–2010, they have increased since 2011. Increases have occurred primarily among men, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM), who contributed the vast majority of male primary and secondary syphilis cases during 2009–2012.

The epidemiology of syphilis among men, including MSM, has shifted since 2009, with larger increases occurring among Hispanic and white men. Despite this increase, disparities in primary and secondary syphilis between black men and other racial/ethnic groups remain large. Many barriers to contacting and treating sex partners exist, including delays in reporting cases to the health department, anonymous partners, physicians who rely on patients to notify their partners, and the observed tendency of MSM to notify a smaller proportion of their sex partners than heterosexuals.

These analyses indicate that syphilis prevention measures for MSM of all races/ethnicities need to be strengthened throughout the United States. This could be accomplished by working with private health-care providers because a substantial number of primary and secondary syphilis cases among MSM are reported by private physicians. Furthermore, both private and public providers should be aware of the resurgence in syphilis and should be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of syphilis, conduct risk assessments, and screen all sexually active individuals.

### State-specific rates of primary and secondary syphilis among men who have sex with men - United States, 2015 [^111wzBgk]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Despite these limitations, these findings are consistent with previous reports that showed pronounced disparities in primary and secondary syphilis rates between men who have sex with men (MSM) and men who have sex with women only. The use of state-specific MSM population sizes and primary and secondary syphilis case counts permits comparison of syphilis rates by state. Rates among MSM compared with men who have sex with women only were higher in every state, but state-specific data suggested that certain states might have a greater need for syphilis prevention.

Since MSM represent the majority of all primary and secondary syphilis cases, the success of syphilis prevention programs is contingent upon addressing the high rates of syphilis among MSM. It is important that both private and public health care providers:

- **Recognize the signs and symptoms of syphilis**: Conduct a comprehensive sexual history.
- **Screen all sexually active MSM for syphilis at least annually**: Provide timely treatment according to national sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines.

Part of this sexual history includes eliciting information on sexual practices and the sex of patients' sex partners.

### Is it time to test and treat for syphilis [^113Q2hBe]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Syphilis has a wide range of clinical symptoms depending on its stage. Severe complications of syphilis include neurosyphilis, cardiovascular syphilis, and congenital syphilis. Additionally, syphilis increases the likelihood of HIV acquisition and transmission, which is a particular concern among certain at-risk groups.

Syphilis continues to be a problem. Despite calls from the World Health Organization to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of syphilis globally, the number of syphilis cases increased over the last decade. In the United States, the number of reported cases of syphilis increased from 115,000 cases in 2018 to more than 209,000 cases in 2023, including 3,882 cases of congenital syphilis, a 50-year high. We need new approaches to address the ongoing crisis.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services developed the STI National Strategic Plan to reverse the recent rise in STIs in the United States. The goals of the plan are to prevent new infections; improve the health of people by reducing adverse STI outcomes; accelerate progress in STI research, technology, and innovation; reduce STI-related health disparities and health inequities; and achieve integrated, coordinated efforts that address the STI epidemic. Specific priority populations include adolescents and young adults, men who have sex with men, and pregnant women.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the use of home testing, there is increased public awareness of rapid, point-of-care, lateral flow assays. In general, lateral flow assays are becoming a more recognized and utilized method for testing.

### Granulomatous secondary syphilis: two case reports and a literature review [^115pwQHZ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Historically, granulomatous inflammation has been described in association with tertiary syphilis. However, in recent years, there have been increasing reports of granulomatous inflammation in patients with secondary syphilis. Here, we discuss two patients who presented with erythematous infiltrated papules and nodules and were eventually diagnosed with granulomatous secondary syphilis, experiencing clearance of their rashes following treatment.

We highlight important clues that can direct clinicians and histopathologists toward a diagnosis of syphilis instead of differential diagnoses such as leprosy in reaction, cutaneous histiocytosis, and lymphoma. Furthermore, after performing a literature review and reflecting on our own experiences, we emphasize that granulomatous syphilis is often palmoplantar-sparing and its presence may not necessarily indicate immunocompromised states like HIV infection. In this increasingly connected world, the recognition of an atypical presentation of an age-old disease in patients with different skin types must be underscored by close clinicopathological correlations.

### Manifest psychosis in neurosyphilis [^113N8WPh]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Recent surveys have assessed a remarkable increase in the prevalence of infectious syphilis. If left untreated, 30% of patients may develop tertiary syphilis, which can manifest as neurosyphilis.

- **Case report**: The authors present a case of an acute psychosis during and after pregnancy in a 37-year-old woman, which was identified as a manifestation of neurosyphilis after admission to a psychiatric ward. The positive screening test for syphilis provided the first hint of syphilis and guided further diagnosis and specific treatment. Subsequently, the patient was treated with psychotropic medication in conjunction with adequate antibiotic treatment for neurosyphilis and was simultaneously monitored psychologically. An improvement of psychotic symptoms during antibiotic therapy was observed.

- **Conclusion**: This case emphasizes that neurosyphilis still has to be considered in the differential diagnosis within the context of psychiatric conditions and diseases. Owing to epidemiological data and difficulties in diagnosing syphilis, routine screening tests in the psychiatric field are necessary.

### Contemporary clinical management of otosyphilis for practicing otolaryngologists-a scoping review [^111TYkKY]. The Laryngoscope (2025). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic marked the resurgence of an old disease, syphilis. The CDC reported increased syphilis cases in the United States from 2016 to 2022, necessitating early recognition of syphilis to properly diagnose complications. We revisit otosyphilis management with the intent of developing an updated diagnostic testing algorithm and treatment plan for otolaryngologists to prevent worsening hearing loss.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases.

- **Methods**: A scoping review of diagnostic and treatment methods for otosyphilis was completed and reported in compliance with the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA-ScR extension for scoping reviews statement. A retrospective case series was also conducted by reviewing patient charts from a tertiary care hospital network. Patients with otosyphilis or neurosyphilis with otic symptoms, as diagnosed by an otolaryngology or infectious disease specialist, were included.

- **Results**: In 57 studies (222 patients), the mean reported symptom duration was 6.6 ± 5.0 weeks (n = 30), with nine outliers presenting after 6 months. Sixty-five percent had hearing loss, 43% tinnitus, and 24% vertigo. Most (97%) received penicillin. Of 84 with outcomes, 48 (57%) improved. In 18 additional patients from the tertiary hospital system cohort (17 males, 1 female; 25–87 years, 9 HIV-positive), penicillin or doxycycline was used. Six patients fully recovered, four required further therapy, two partially recovered, and one did not improve.

- **Conclusion**: Otosyphilis has an insidious presentation and can mimic other audio conditions.

### Is it time to test and treat for syphilis [^111fRK8s]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Recent advances in the availability of accurate, 10–15-minute point-of-care syphilis tests have created an opportunity for reconsidering our approach to syphilis. Traditionally, many clinicians have been trained that the diagnosis of syphilis requires both the use of a laboratory-based treponemal and nontreponemal antibody test for the confirmation and staging of infection. Such an algorithm is often associated with a delay in or lack of treatment due to loss-to-follow-up. Treatment at the time of a positive test result, a "test and treat" strategy, could be highly effective and decrease transmission.

In January 2024, the National Syphilis Task Force issued considerations for the use of rapid point-of-care syphilis tests, including the suggestion for immediate testing and treatment, but clinical uptake continues to be limited. Patients that could benefit most from this strategy include those with challenges accessing medical care and those at higher risk for loss to follow-up for treatment, such as pregnant women, youth, sex workers, and people experiencing homelessness.

### Estimation of the lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to syphilis acquired in the United States in 2018 [^117HPGzq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Syphilis, a sexually transmitted genital ulcerative disease caused by infection with Treponema pallidum, can cause a range of adverse health outcomes if left untreated, including severe outcomes related to pregnancy. In the United States in 2019, there were 129,813 diagnosed syphilis cases, the highest number reported since 1991, and 1,870 reported cases of congenital syphilis, a fourfold increase compared to diagnoses in 2013. Considering this large and rising burden, estimates of the lifetime costs and the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost per infection can quantify the public health and economic impact of syphilis infections and inform cost-effectiveness analyses of interventions to prevent syphilis. A recent modeling study estimated that the average discounted lifetime cost per infection is $1,190 in the United States. However, to our knowledge, no published studies have assessed the average number of QALYs lost per infection or the overall annual QALY losses attributable to syphilis.

Measuring the health impact of syphilis in adults and congenital syphilis using a standard health metric like QALYs has the benefit of combining the morbidity and mortality impact into one measure. Health conditions like syphilis can cause reductions in the quality and length of life, thereby reducing the number of QALYs that would have been achieved in the absence of syphilis. For example, in adults, the early stage of syphilis involves symptoms like sores, skin rashes, fever, and fatigue. Development of tertiary syphilis can affect multiple organ systems, such as the cardiovascular system, and…

### Syphilis: An unusual manifestation [^112xRDG2]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a widely investigated infectious venereal disease with varied presentations frequently mimicking other diseases. It progresses in distinct, well-characterized stages: early (primary and secondary), latent, and late (tertiary), each stage having its own unique presentations. However, there has been increasing evidence of atypical presentations. We describe one such presentation of early syphilis in its secondary stage. A man in his late 20s presented with a rash, which is typical of the secondary stage, and with bone pain and multiple lytic lesions, which is rare in the secondary stage but more typical of the tertiary stage. The patient was successfully treated for secondary syphilis. On the basis of our case and an analysis of other case reports and research of early-stage syphilitic bone involvement, we conclude that the true incidence of bone involvement in early-stage syphilis may be higher than has been previously appreciated, and thus may be under-recognized and underdiagnosed.

### Detection of Treponema pallidum DNA for diagnosis, resistance identification, and treatment outcome prediction in early syphilis among men who have sex with men [^115zq1aN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Low credibility.

We investigated the use of Treponema pallidum DNA (TP-DNA) for diagnosis, resistance identification, and treatment outcome prediction in early syphilis among men who have sex with men (MSM).

- **Methods**: MSM seeking care for sexually transmitted infections were prospectively enrolled from September 2021 to August 2024. Oral rinse, rectal swab, and urethral swab samples were tested for TP-DNA. Resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) to macrolides and tetracyclines were identified. Treatment responses were compared between syphilis cases with detected TP-DNA and those without.

- **Results**: Of 656 MSM enrolled, TP-DNA was most frequently detected in oral rinse samples (37.8% [193/510]), followed by rectal swab (20.2% [103/510]) and urethral swab samples (11.6%, 59/510) during clinic visits for early syphilis. TP-DNA was detected in 45.7% (233/510) of early syphilis cases and 0.7% (1/141) of cases without syphilis. This resulted in a specificity of 99.3% (95% CI: 96.1–100%) and sensitivity of 45.7% (95% CI: 41.3–50.1%). Secondary syphilis cases had the highest yield of TP-DNA detection (67.6% [117/173]), followed by primary (48.7% [19/39]) and early latent syphilis cases (32.6% [97/298]). The Ct values of T. pallidum PCR in oral rinse samples were significantly lower in cases with higher rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titres (p < 0.001). The rate of T. pallidum harbouring RAMs to macrolides was 58.9% (139/236), increasing over 6-month intervals, from 32.4% (12/37) in 2021 to 77.8% (21/27) in 2023. Cases of detected TP-DNA had greater serological responses to treatments than those without.

### A complex neurological presentation of syphilis [^111rbi2W]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a contagious sexually transmitted infection notable for its complex array of systemic presentations. It is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Although once considered a largely historical condition in the UK, the recent rise in incidence makes syphilis increasingly relevant when considering unusual presentations in at-risk patients. The disease has three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The tertiary stage is associated with a plethora of neurological features ranging from psychosis to seizures, caused by direct invasion of the spirochete into the central nervous system.

Here we describe the case of a 45-year-old man presenting with tonic-clonic seizures on a background of balance and visual problems. Following normal examination and routine investigations, further serology confirmed a diagnosis of neurosyphilis. The patient was started on appropriate treatment and made an excellent clinical recovery.

### A 14-year retrospective clinical analysis of ocular manifestations of syphilis in a Portuguese tertiary center [^114Lrg6d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a re-emerging infectious disease with various systemic manifestations, including ocular involvement, which can lead to significant morbidity if untreated. This study aims to analyze the ocular manifestations of syphilis in patients treated at a Portuguese tertiary center over a 14-year period.

- **Patients and methods**: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with syphilis who presented with ocular symptoms from 2010 to 2023 was conducted. Data collected included demographic information, clinical presentation, ophthalmologic findings, serologic test results, treatment regimens, and outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 47 patients with ocular syphilis were identified. The mean age of the cohort was 45, with a male predominance of 78.7%. The most common ocular manifestations included uveitis (mostly posterior and panuveitis), optic neuritis, acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis, and vitritis. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at presentation was highly variable, ranging from hand movements to no impairment of visual acuity. At the end of the follow-up period, the majority of the study eyes achieved a BCVA between 0 and 0.1 (p < 0.000). Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis was associated with poorer visual outcomes after treatment, indicating its presence is a poor prognosis factor. HIV status, the presence of vitritis, vasculitis, and papillitis at presentation, a positive syphilis serology in cerebrospinal fluid, and treatment regimen did not appear to have a significant impact on the final BCVA.

- **Conclusion**: Ocular syphilis, though rare, can lead to significant visual impairment if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Prompt recognition and treatment are critical to improving visual outcomes and reducing morbidity associated with this condition.

### Syphilis: A great imitator [^1123L69P]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Despite advances in the control, diagnosis, and treatment of syphilis, its recognition is often misunderstood or not considered by dermatologists and other physicians. This occurs especially among those who either have limited specialized training in the intricacies of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or whose dermatologic practice infrequently consults individuals from communities where STIs are prevalent.

Our aim is to highlight contemporary ideas and findings on syphilis, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is made and recognized treatments are administered. Additionally, necessary measures such as counseling to exclude other STIs, preventing reinfection, partner notification, and public health epidemiology should not be overlooked. For syphilis, like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, not only is the biomedical aspect important, but also the social and psychological components are crucial.

### Molecular and direct detection tests for Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum: A review of the literature, 1964–2017 [^115kRHaF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

The number of primary and secondary syphilis cases caused by infection with Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (herein T. pallidum) has steadily increased in the United States since the early 2000s. This has resulted in a nearly 73% increase in the overall number of cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2017 compared to 2013, and it is apparent across sexual behaviors, ethnicities, and genders, leading to a more than 40% increase in congenital syphilis cases over the past year.

In the absence of treatment, syphilis can progress through multiple stages and present with a variety of clinical manifestations. This makes laboratory testing, alongside a careful clinical evaluation, invaluable for establishing the diagnosis. Diagnostic testing for syphilis can be challenging, however, as the organism cannot be grown in routine culture, and there is no single assay with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to identify all stages of the disease.

Currently, diagnosis remains primarily dependent on the serologic evaluation for antibodies to T. pallidum using both treponemal and nontreponemal assays, employing either a traditional or reverse algorithmic approach. Although serologic testing is associated with high sensitivity (> 95%) during secondary and later stages of the disease, the ability of these assays to detect cases of primary infection is significantly diminished. Studies suggest that 14% to 46% of patients with primary syphilis may be seronegative, depending on the method used. Additional limitations of serologic testing include…

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of ocular syphilis, co-infection, and therapy response [^1165Xufr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Syphilis is an infectious disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, which is most often transmitted sexually in acquired disease or vertically during pregnancy in congenital syphilis (CS). Four stages have been described in the acquired disease, and overlap can exist between the stages. The primary stage is characterized by a painless ulcerated lesion known as a chancre, which is thought to be the site of entrance into the host. The secondary stage typically occurs two weeks to several months after infection and is associated with a skin rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. A period of latency can occur after the secondary stage, and recurrences often present during the first year after diagnosis. Patients can remain in this stage indefinitely or develop tertiary syphilis.

During this stage, serious systemic manifestations occur, including cardiovascular and neurologic symptoms, as well as gumma formation throughout the body. Ocular syphilis is considered to occur during any stage of infection, and it is known as the "great masquerader". CS has been classified as early CS and late CS. Early CS is characterized by organ involvements including liver, kidney, bone, and hematological and mucocutaneous manifestations. Ocular manifestations including interstitial keratitis, chorioretinitis, salt-pepper fundus, glaucoma, cataract, and chancres of the eyelid have been mostly described in late CS. Every patient with ocular inflammation is recommended to be tested for syphilis since non-specific treponemal tests, including the venereal disease research laboratory test.

### Characteristics of syphilitic uveitis in northern China [^111YxCuz]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

This study aims to describe the characteristics of patients with syphilitic uveitis in northern China. A case series of 21 patients (33 eyes) diagnosed with syphilitic uveitis from 2011 to 2016 at a tertiary center in northern China was retrospectively analyzed.

Twenty-one patients (33 eyes) were diagnosed with syphilitic uveitis. Posterior segment involvement was found in 32 eyes (97.0%). Vitreous haze, neuroretinitis, and posterior placoid chorioretinitis were mainly found in patients with a relatively short duration of the disease. In contrast, diffuse chorioretinitis, pseudoretinitis pigmentosa, cystoid macular edema, and epiretinal membrane were found in patients with a relatively long duration of ocular involvement.

A low best-corrected visual acuity (P = 0.022) and a delay in syphilis treatment (P < 0.001) were associated with a significantly worse visual outcome. Syphilitic uveitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of any form of posterior ocular inflammation. The pattern of ocular involvement may change with disease progression.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for syphilis, specifically concerning CSF analysis, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend considering CSF assessment in asymptomatic patients to exclude asymptomatic neurosyphilis under certain conditions:

- **HIV-positive patients**: Those with late syphilis and CD4 cells ≤ 350/mm³ and/or a serum VDRL/RPR titer > 1:32.

- **Serological failure**: Indicated by a less than fourfold decrease in the antibody titer of a non-treponemal test 6–12 months after treatment of early syphilis.

- **Serofast patients**: Persistence of a low antibody titer, i.e. ≤ 4 in a non-treponemal test 1–2 years after treatment of early syphilis.

- **Alternative treatments**: Patients who have received alternative treatment, such as doxycycline, for late syphilis.

### Sexually acquired syphilis: Laboratory diagnosis, management, and prevention [^115B3dvk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

The methods used for the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis include direct detection of *Treponema pallidum* subspecies pallidum and serologic testing. Serologic testing relies on both nontreponemal and treponemal tests. In newly developed reverse-sequence screening algorithms, treponemal tests are performed before nontreponemal tests. The management of syphilis requires appropriate staging, treatment, and follow-up of patients, along with the prompt reporting of infections to public health authorities to assist with prevention and control efforts.

Benzathine penicillin G remains the treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis. Screening of populations at higher risk for syphilis is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Preventive Services Task Force, and the World Health Organization. The second article in this continuing medical education series reviews the testing for and the management of sexually acquired syphilis.

### Syphilitic uveitis and optic neuritis in Sydney, Australia [^112JPNJr]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to describe ocular syphilis presentations to a tertiary referral eye hospital over a 5-year period and to document HIV coinfection frequency. A retrospective chart review was conducted of consecutive ocular syphilis presentations to Sydney Eye Hospital from 2007 to 2012. The inclusion criteria were positive syphilis serology, ocular inflammation on clinical examination, and appropriate syphilis treatment. Outcome measures were clinical features at presentation and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at interval follow-up.

Thirty-seven eyes of 25 patients were included in the series. Patients were predominantly male (92.0%, p < 0.05), with a mean age of 43.7 ± 14.0 years. Eight (32.0%) patients had confirmed HIV coinfection, with three newly diagnosed with HIV. Twelve (32.4%) eyes demonstrated anterior segment involvement with anterior uveitis. Twenty-five (67.6%) eyes demonstrated posterior segment involvement, including panuveitis, acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis, retinitis, necrotizing retinitis, punctate retinitis, and optic neuritis. There was a significant improvement in BCVA for involved eyes (p < 0.05) at 1 month and 2–3 months follow-up.

The clinical findings of 37 eyes with ocular syphilis demonstrated a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Rates of HIV coinfection were high, with patients exhibiting both anterior and posterior segment inflammation. Visual outcomes improved following syphilis treatment.

### Oral ulcers as a presentation of secondary syphilis [^114FKaM1]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of syphilis is increasing, and it typically presents in patients with known risk factors, often to genitourinary physicians. Patients presenting to a dermatologist or ophthalmologist are more likely to have secondary syphilis, with the potential for associated complications. Early recognition is therefore vital to limit both the disease and the risk of further contact spread. In this review, we include two case histories demonstrating the value of recognizing oral signs. Additionally, we review the currently accepted diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations.

To describe the clinical presentation of patients diagnosed with presumed latent ocular syphilis and congenital ocular syphilis at a tertiary referral center in Turkey, and to compare the clinical findings with patients described in other studies, specifically focusing on demographics and co-infections. This retrospective study reviews the medical records of patients diagnosed with ocular inflammation between January 2012 and June 2014 at a tertiary referral center in Turkey. Ocular syphilis was diagnosed based on non-treponemal and treponemal antibody tests and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. All patients diagnosed with ocular syphilis were tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes.

A total of 1,115 patients were evaluated between January 2012 and June 2014, and 12 patients (1.07%) were diagnosed with ocular syphilis based on the inclusion criteria. None of the patients were seropositive for HIV. Two patients were seropositive for T. gondii-specific IgG. Clinical presentations include non-necrotizing anterior scleritis, non-necrotizing sclerokeratitis, anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, panuveitis, and optic neuritis. All of the patients showed clinical improvement in the level of ocular inflammation with intravenous penicillin 24 million U/day for 10 days. Three patients received additional oral methotrexate as an adjunctive therapy. Two cases received low-dose trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole.

### Primary and secondary syphilis — United States, 2005–2013 [^114juU1p]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Public health officials should seek to improve the quality of data regarding the sex of sex partners. They should share local MSM, sexually transmitted disease, and HIV data consistent with local laws and regulations with medical providers to increase their awareness of disease burden in their communities and ensure that providers can recognize syphilis symptoms. Two CDC cooperative agreements are encouraging local and state participants to make MSM a priority population and direct resources to areas of greatest need based on local epidemiology. The CDC, in collaboration with state and local partners, health-care providers, and MSM-oriented organizations, is also engaged in research to better understand risk factors for syphilis among MSM. They aim to develop improved care models to better reach and serve MSM populations, assess whether MSM are being tested and treated appropriately, and determine what barriers exist in the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis among MSM.

The continued decline of primary and secondary syphilis rates among Black women since 2008 is encouraging and might suggest that targeted efforts to reduce syphilis among certain populations have had some success. Although primary and secondary syphilis is currently a predominantly MSM epidemic, it is important that efforts to prevent syphilis among heterosexual men and women continue, especially given the severe consequences of syphilis infection acquired in utero, including stillbirths.

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, primary and secondary syphilis case-report data likely underestimate the extent of the epidemic.

Because syphilis has no test-of-cure, conversion to a non-reactive RPR is the best evidence of successful treatment. Patients should be tested at the start of treatment and monitored at six and 12 months. No clinical data guide interpretation of RPR titres after treatment, and guidelines are based on expert opinion.

Recommendations for assessment of treatment of syphilis from various guidelines, including European, UK, US, Canadian, and WHO, should be reviewed.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of ocular syphilis, co-infection, and therapy response [^1176Pd2r]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical presentation of patients diagnosed with presumed latent ocular syphilis and congenital ocular syphilis at a tertiary referral center in Turkey. It compares these clinical findings with patients described in other studies, specifically focusing on demographics and co-infections.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective study reviewing the medical records of patients diagnosed with ocular inflammation between January 2012 and June 2014 at a tertiary referral center in Turkey. Ocular syphilis was diagnosed based on non-treponemal and treponemal antibody tests and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. All patients diagnosed with ocular syphilis were tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes.

- **Results**: A total of 1,115 patients were evaluated between January 2012 and June 2014, and 12 patients (1.07%) were diagnosed with ocular syphilis based on the inclusion criteria. None of the patients were seropositive for HIV. Two patients were seropositive for T. gondii-specific IgG. Clinical presentations included non-necrotizing anterior scleritis, non-necrotizing sclerokeratitis, anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, panuveitis, and optic neuritis. All patients showed clinical improvement in the level of ocular inflammation with intravenous penicillin 24 million U/day for 10 days. Three patients received additional oral methotrexate as adjunctive therapy, and two cases received low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

In conclusion, ocular syphilis is an uncommon cause of ocular inflammation but can be effectively treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy.

### Biological basis for syphilis [^112af83H]. Clinical Microbiology Reviews (2006). High credibility.

The disease syphilis can be associated with a wide range of symptoms and conditions, including condylomata lata, weight loss, skin rash, cognitive impairment, aortic aneurysm, and genital ulcers. Additional associations include lymphadenopathy, tabes dorsalis, and certain risk factors such as unprotected sexual intercourse, homelessness, and multiple sexual partners. Syphilis can also present with oral ulcers, lichenoid lesions, and positive serological tests like FTA-ABS and VDRL.

Syphilis is often found in conjunction with other conditions such as HIV infection and can present with clinical manifestations like mucosal erosions, perianal ulcers, and anisocoria. It may cause systemic symptoms such as fever and other manifestations like scleritis, elevated serum transaminases, leukoderma, oral plaques, and skin papules. Neurological symptoms may include neck stiffness, seizures, abnormal proprioception, optic neuritis, and other positive tests like treponema pallidum particle agglutination.

Other symptoms that may complicate diagnosis include sore throat, visual disturbances, meningismus, atrioventricular block, psoriasiform rash, retinitis, confusion, myocardial infarction, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), myalgia, headache, and tinnitus. Uveitis, painless chancre, malaise, photophobia, and genital papules are also noted. Cardiovascular complications can include aortic regurgitation and frambesiform lesions. Additional symptoms include lip ulcers and hearing loss.

### Screening for syphilis: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^1171hMYF]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Screening for syphilis infection is currently recommended for high-risk individuals, including those with previous syphilis infection, an infected sexual partner, HIV infection, or more than four sex partners in the preceding year.

- **Objective**: To update a 2004 systematic review of studies on syphilis screening effectiveness, test accuracy, and screening harms in nonpregnant adults and adolescents.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through October 2015 and Ovid MEDLINE (January 2004 to October 2015), with an updated search through March 2016.

- **Study selection**: English-language trials and observational studies of screening effectiveness, test accuracy, and screening harms in nonpregnant adults and adolescents.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: One investigator abstracted data, a second checked data for accuracy, and two investigators independently assessed study quality using predefined criteria.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Transmission of disease, including HIV; complications of syphilis; diagnostic accuracy; and harms of screening.

- **Results**: No evidence was identified regarding the effectiveness of screening on clinical outcomes, the effectiveness of risk assessment instruments, the harms of screening, or the effectiveness of screening in average-risk, nonpregnant adolescents or adults. This also includes high-risk individuals other than men who have sex with men (MSM) or men who are HIV positive. Four non-US studies indicated higher rates of syphilis detection with screening every three months vs. six or twelve months.

### Hard bilateral syphilitic testes with vasculitis: a case report and literature review [^1155gUaT]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Syphilis has three stages: primary syphilis, characterized by a painless chancre occurring 2–6 weeks after infection; secondary syphilis, characterized by condylomata lata 1–2 months after primary syphilis; and tertiary syphilis, occurring 2–50 years after the initial infection, characterized by gummatous disease, meningovascular disease, tabes dorsalis, cardiovascular, ocular, and otic syphilis.

Serologic testing is currently the standard approach for diagnosis; however, it lacks sensitivity in detecting early syphilis, congenital syphilis, neurosyphilis, tertiary syphilis, and HIV or Hepatitis C coinfection. Consequently, several other approaches are considered for the detection of clinically undetected syphilis, including immunohistochemistry (IHC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, morphological observation, and seroassay. In a previous study, IHC demonstrated 49–92% sensitivity and excellent specificity for the diagnosis of secondary syphilis. It can be utilized as a tool for further investigation when serological assays fail to identify the organism. However, there is a possibility of cross-reaction with Borrelia burgdorferi and intestinal spirochetes. PCR exhibits a sensitivity of 89.1% in chancre specimens from patients with primary syphilis. In fact, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that PCR is valuable for chancre samples.

Syphilitic gummata can mimic testicular tumors, which are usually diagnosed after surgery. Differential diagnoses such as testicular neoplasms, mumps orchitis, tubercular epididymitis, and gonococcal epididymitis should be considered.

### A 14-year retrospective clinical analysis of ocular manifestations of syphilis in a Portuguese tertiary center [^111yGLF8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

A global resurgence of syphilis has recently been reported, and Portugal, like many other European countries, is no exception. According to the Portuguese National Health Institute (Instituto Nacional de Saúde Doutor Ricardo Jorge), data indicates an increase in the incidence of syphilis, with a significant growth in the number of cases since the early 2000s. This increase is attributed to various factors, including risky sexual behaviors, such as decreased use of condoms and an increase in multiple sexual partners.

According to the 2022 report from the Portuguese General Directorate of Health (Direção-Geral da Saúde), the number of notified syphilis cases has shown an upward trend, especially in large metropolitan areas like Lisbon and Porto. Syphilis predominantly affects men, with a high proportion of cases among men who have sex with men (MSM). In 2021, the notification rate was approximately 11 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

Congenital syphilis, which occurs when the infection is transmitted from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy, continues to be a public health concern. Notification of this condition is mandatory in Portugal, and preventive measures include systematic screening of all pregnant women for syphilis, usually conducted in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy.

Ocular syphilis is uncommon, with recent studies indicating that approximately 0.5–1.5% of patients with syphilis exhibit ocular manifestations. Ocular involvement can occur at any stage of syphilis, with acute ocular inflammation typically arising during the early stages.

### Update on syphilis diagnostics [^111n651Z]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Syphilis is rising globally, with resultant increases in morbidity and mortality that disproportionately impact underserved populations. Appropriate screening and testing for syphilis with accurate, reliable, affordable, and timely assays is crucial for combating this epidemic. This review provides a brief overview of laboratory methods for syphilis diagnosis, with a focus on recent updates in diagnostics and directions for future research. Syphilis can be complex and time-consuming to diagnose and stage appropriately. The historic use of darkfield microscopy for diagnosis has been eclipsed by algorithms that include both nontreponemal and treponemal antibody tests for screening and confirmation of active Treponema pallidum infection.

- **Recent findings**: Newer diagnostic modalities include nucleic acid amplification assays (NAATs) and point-of-care testing (POCT), which hold promise for increasing identification of active syphilis but have notable limitations. More work is needed to develop accurate, reliable, affordable, and expeditious tests to optimize syphilis diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Algorithms utilizing a combination of serological treponemal and nontreponemal assays remain the standard of care for the diagnosis of syphilis, but recently developed NAATs and POCT assays present opportunities to increase syphilis detection. Further research is warranted to improve upon these testing modalities and explore other markers that could aid in syphilis diagnosis.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for syphilis, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining serological screening for syphilis in all pregnant individuals at their first antenatal visit (first trimester). It is also advised to repeat serology, ideally during the third trimester at 28–32 weeks of gestation and at delivery, in high-risk populations and in settings with a high syphilis prevalence.

### Vital signs: Missed opportunities for preventing congenital syphilis - United States, 2022 [^114qBKBN]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Historically, syphilis screening and interventions have targeted individual risk factors. For many sexually active persons, however, their most significant risk factor is living in a community with high rates of syphilis. CDC guidelines recommend syphilis screening for sexually active persons in such communities; however, the threshold for a high rate is not defined.

Currently, the Healthy People 2030 goal is to reduce the rate of primary and secondary syphilis cases among females aged 15–44 years to 4.6 per 100,000 population.

- **Screening recommendations**: In counties with a rate that exceeds this goal, offering syphilis testing to sexually active females aged 15–44 years and their sex partners might help identify syphilis cases, prevent spread, support progress toward meeting the Healthy People 2030 goals, and reduce congenital syphilis. In 2021, 38% of U.S. counties, accounting for 72% of the U.S. population, had syphilis rates above the goal level.

- **Disparities and access to care**: Disparities in syphilis rates by race and ethnicity are not explained by differences in sexual behaviors but reflect access to sexual health care, differences in sexual networks, and persistent and systemic racism in medical care. Screening based on geographic risk can decrease stigma and biases associated with screening based on individual risk factors.

In counties already at or below the Healthy People 2030 goal level, clinicians should continue to assess individual risk factors (e.g. diagnosis of other sexually transmitted infections, a new partner), and adapt their approach accordingly.

### Evaluation of Elecsys syphilis assay for routine and blood screening and detection of early infection [^115zAqKn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Although syphilis is typically considered a historic infection, its incidence is increasing. In 2008, approximately 11 million new cases of infection were reported worldwide; from 2005 to 2013, the number of primary and secondary syphilis cases per year reported in the United States almost doubled, and the annual rate increased from 2.9 to 5.3 cases per 100,000 population. In high-income countries, infection rates are specifically increasing among men who have sex with men, and high rates of HIV coinfection have also been documented. This reemergence warrants renewed attention to the strategies used for the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis.

In order to treat syphilis and prevent its transmission, testing is a common component of prenatal, blood donor, organ donor, and STI screenings. There are many diagnostic tests for syphilis available; however, a commonly accepted standard method is still lacking, and the algorithms used for initial screening and confirmation vary between countries. Syphilis cannot be cultured in vitro, and direct swabbing and testing of a primary lesion for syphilis are often not possible, as primary lesions are apparent only for a short time and, depending on the location, may go unnoticed by the patient. As a result, the diagnosis of syphilis is usually based on serological methods and typically uses either a treponemal or nontreponemal test for primary screening. The result is subsequently confirmed by retesting, e.g. with an alternative treponemal test and a quantitative nontreponemal test. However, this is dependent on the diagnostic algorithm.

How should I manage contact tracing?

Contacts, specifically people who have had sex with a person diagnosed with infectious (early) syphilis within 90 days, should receive treatment with one dose of BPG even if their serology results are negative. Asymptomatic contacts who had sex with an infected person more than 90 days ago could defer treatment until their serology results are available, but only if follow-up is assured. Discussions about contact tracing should be non-stigmatizing and sensitive to patients' concerns about confidentiality. Explain that contact tracing has important benefits for the individual concerned and their contacts, as it helps to limit the ongoing transmission of a serious infection and prevent re-infection. Patients need help and support to notify contacts confidentially.

- **How this article was created**: This article was created based on a review of international guidelines, expert opinion from local public health units, STI clinics, and infectious disease departments, and through a review of Medline and CINAHL using the search term "syphilis". We also undertook a manual review of the reference lists of identified articles.

- **Education into practice**:
	- Do you consider syphilis as a differential diagnosis of genital lesions and rashes among sexually active patients?
	- How would you approach a conversation about contact tracing with a young man, recently diagnosed?

- **How patients were involved in this article**: We reviewed the contents of this material with Max Ottawa, a local community-based organization that focuses on maximizing the health and wellness of gay, bisexual, and Two-Spirit communities.

### Cutaneous manifestations of syphilis: recognition and management [^114kHrWd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

After a marked decline in the number of syphilis cases due to AIDS prevention campaigns, a significant increase has been observed in the states of the former Soviet Union since 1994. In recent years, outbreaks have also been reported in the US, Canada, and several European countries. The epidemic in the US and different parts of Europe has largely involved men who have sex with men, many of whom are infected with HIV. A misdiagnosis of syphilis can have serious consequences for patients, pregnancies, and newborns. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the many manifestations of syphilis and the difficulties in its diagnosis and management. Younger clinicians, in particular, may not be familiar with the diverse clinical symptoms and complex diagnostics of syphilis.

Patients co-infected with HIV may present with atypical clinical manifestations and laboratory test results. Furthermore, due to its association with an increased risk of HIV infection, syphilis has acquired a new potential for morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of syphilis should be routinely considered in patients with uveitis, sudden deafness, aortic thoracic aneurysm, or pregnancy. Only a minority of syphilis infections are detected in the primary stage. This may be due to atypical locations and occasionally atypical morphology of the lesions; however, it may also be due to the difficulty of detecting the pathogen. In the secondary stage, which is clinically extremely diverse, the diagnosis is confirmed serologically. There is a need for an increase…

### Syphilis [^112dmXW2]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum, endemic in low-income countries and occurring at lower rates in middle-income and high-income countries. The disease holds both individual and public health importance. In addition to its direct morbidity, it increases the risk of HIV infection and can cause lifelong morbidity in children born to infected mothers. Without treatment, the disease can progress over years through a series of clinical stages, leading to irreversible neurological or cardiovascular complications.

Although syphilis is an ancient disease and the principles of its recommended management have been established for decades, diagnosis and management are often challenging due to its varied manifestations and the difficulty in interpreting serological tests used to confirm diagnosis and evaluate response to therapy. In North America and Western Europe, the incidence of syphilis has increased dramatically in the past decade among men who have sex with men, particularly those with coexistent HIV infection. Only one drug, penicillin, is recommended for syphilis treatment, and response to therapy is assessed based on changes over months in serological test titres. Treatment for patients who cannot receive penicillin and management of patients who do not serologically respond to treatment remain common clinical problems.

Late latent syphilis or syphilis of unknown duration

We identified two high-quality papers with a clearly defined gold standard and two lower-quality papers with a less well-defined gold standard for late latent syphilis or syphilis of unknown duration. There was one high-quality study that reported a sensitivity of 61% for RPR. The other three studies reported a sensitivity of 64–75% for VDRL, and the other high-quality study reported a sensitivity of 64% for VDRL.

Conclusions

Based on a small number of studies (two high-quality and two lower-quality studies), the sensitivity of RPR and VDRL for diagnosing late latent syphilis ranges from 64–75% overall and from 61–64% based on the two high-quality papers.

Tertiary syphilis

Only two lower-quality papers, for which the gold standard was not well defined, were identified for tertiary syphilis. The first, based on 17 patients, reported a VDRL sensitivity of 47%. The second, based on 58 patients, reported a VDRL sensitivity of 64%.

Conclusions

Based on two studies with very limited data, the sensitivity of serum VDRL for tertiary syphilis is 47–64%.

### Syphilis [^1127w5YA]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Staging of syphilis cannot be determined through laboratory results alone; it requires a comprehensive history and examination. It is important to note that primary and secondary syphilis present symptoms, whereas early and late latent syphilis are generally asymptomatic. A meticulous examination to identify unnoticed symptoms is critical and should include a thorough anogenital and dermatological inspection.

- **Staging criteria for early latent syphilis**: Patients with early latent syphilis remain asymptomatic but meet one of the following criteria:
	- New positive serology with a documented negative test within the previous 12 or 24 months.
	- A ≥ 4-fold increase in the RPR titre relative to a previous test conducted within 12 or 24 months.
	- Unequivocal symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis within the previous 12 or 24 months.
	- Only one possible exposure, which occurred within the previous 12 or 24 months.

### Biological basis for syphilis [^113freNP]. Clinical Microbiology Reviews (2006). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on syphilis:

- **Definition**: Syphilis is an STI caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of syphilis involves the entry of Treponema pallidum through mucous membranes or broken skin during sexual contact. Within days to weeks, Treponema pallidum disseminates via blood and lymphatic vessels and accumulates in perivascular spaces of different organs, leading to various clinical manifestations.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of primary and secondary syphilis in the U.S. is estimated at 17.7 per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of late syphilis or syphilis of unknown duration in the U.S. is estimated at 26.3 per 100,000 person-years.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for syphilis include unprotected sex, having multiple sexual partners, homelessness, history of HIV, history of other STIs, tobacco use, and illicit drug use.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of syphilis is divided into stages. Primary syphilis is characterized by a chancre, typically a single, painless, indurated ulcer with a clean base discharging clear serum. Secondary syphilis involves multisystem manifestations such as a non-itching skin rash, fever, and generalized lymphadenopathy. The latent stage is asymptomatic, and tertiary syphilis can involve neurological, cardiovascular, or gummatous complications.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of syphilis is generally good if detected and treated early, with penicillin being the mainstay of treatment.
