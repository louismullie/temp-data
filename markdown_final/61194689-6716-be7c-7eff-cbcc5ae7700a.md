## Question

Urine analysis RBC abnormal

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage an abnormal RBC result on urinalysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true microscopic hematuria and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should classify the hematuria by source and risk stratify for malignancy. Next, I will outline the initial workup, including history, exam, labs, and when to repeat urinalysis. After that, I need to specify imaging and cystoscopy decisions by risk tier, including special populations. Finally, I should address follow-up, documentation, and when to escalate or de-escalate care, ensuring I verify each step against current guidelines and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and the need to verify true microscopic hematuria, because I should not jump to conclusions based on a dipstick alone. Microscopic hematuria is defined as at least 3 RBCs per high-power field on microscopic examination of a properly collected urine specimen, and a positive dipstick for blood must be confirmed microscopically before initiating any evaluation, given frequent false positives and the poor predictive value of dipstick-only "hematuria" for malignancy [^39f5932b] [^9b5ee3f3].

> Wait, let me verify specimen quality and pre-analytic factors that can confound results. I need to check for contamination, especially in women, by noting squamous epithelial cells; fewer than 2 squamous cells per HPF improves the positive predictive value of a voided specimen for true hematuria, and catheterized samples can resolve uncertainty when contamination is suspected. I should also avoid sampling immediately after vigorous exercise, sexual activity, or prolonged recumbency, and I must consider RBC lysis in dilute or alkaline urine, which can cause false-negative microscopy; if suspected, I should repeat with a first-morning, concentrated specimen and analyze promptly or refrigerate to preserve cells [^8156e96c] [^6a66c5d2] [^de32a4c6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I classify the hematuria. I will now examine whether the RBCs are isomorphic, suggesting lower urinary tract bleeding, or dysmorphic with acanthocytes and RBC casts, which point to glomerular disease. This distinction guides whether I prioritize urologic versus nephrologic evaluation, and I should double-check that I am using phase-contrast or high-quality microscopy to improve morphologic accuracy, recognizing that interobserver variability exists but is lowest for isomorphic RBCs and highest for tubular epithelial cells [^e98cbe93] [^fee511b6].

> Next, I should review malignancy risk stratification because it determines the intensity of imaging and cystoscopy. Low/negligible risk typically includes patients under 35–50 years, never smokers, without gross hematuria, and with lower RBC counts, whereas intermediate risk includes older age, smoking, or moderate RBC counts, and high risk includes patients over 60, gross hematuria, or very high RBC counts. Importantly, in low-risk, never-smoking women under 50 with fewer than 25 RBCs/hpf, the risk of urologic malignancy is 0.5% or less, supporting a more conservative approach in that subgroup [^ecbbfa73] [^4931467b] [^8770c6c5].

> I need to ensure the initial workup is structured and complete. Let me first confirm a careful history and physical, including blood pressure, genitourinary and gynecologic history, smoking, occupational exposures, recent trauma or instrumentation, and symptoms such as dysuria, flank pain, or obstructive voiding. I should obtain serum creatinine with eGFR to screen for kidney disease and consider repeating urinalysis to confirm persistence, especially in low-risk patients, before committing to invasive testing [^ffc6b277] [^d50b5e85] [^ea054c22].

> For low/negligible-risk patients, I should double-check that I am not overtesting. If repeat urinalysis is negative, no further urologic workup is needed, and if hematuria persists, I should reclassify to intermediate or high risk and proceed accordingly. Shared decision-making is essential, and I should document the rationale for deferring or pursuing evaluation, including patient preferences and comorbidities [^ea054c22] [^b8c36b1c].

> For intermediate-risk patients, I should confirm that cystoscopy and renal ultrasound are the appropriate first-line tests. Cystoscopy evaluates the lower tract for malignancy or other pathology, while renal ultrasound assesses the upper tract for stones, masses, or hydronephrosis. I need to ensure I do not substitute ultrasound for CT when ultrasound is nondiagnostic or when suspicion remains high, reserving CT urography for selected cases or higher-risk tiers [^34fe16d4].

> For high-risk patients, I should verify that multiphasic CT urography and cystoscopy are indicated. CT urography provides high sensitivity for small renal masses and urothelial lesions, and cystoscopy remains mandatory to evaluate the bladder urothelium. I should also remember that urine cytology is not recommended routinely in the initial evaluation due to low sensitivity and limited yield, though it may be considered selectively in high-risk patients with equivocal cystoscopy or persistent hematuria after a negative workup [^258b589d] [^167cdd83] [^839726ca].

> But wait, what if I suspect a glomerular source based on dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, or proteinuria. In that case, I should pivot to a nephrologic workup, including quantification of proteinuria, autoimmune serologies, and consideration of kidney biopsy, because persistent hematuria with proteinuria or active sediment suggests inflammatory glomerular disease and may alter management and prognosis, particularly in entities like IgA nephropathy or lupus nephritis [^53312b22] [^2396ba0a] [^04a423fb].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In children, ultrasound is preferred for initial imaging and the threshold for invasive workup is generally higher, with nephrology referral for persistent hematuria with proteinuria or abnormal ultrasound. In patients with sickle cell trait, papillary necrosis is a common cause of gross hematuria and often resolves conservatively, so I need to check for sickle hemoglobin before pursuing biopsy. In women with contamination concerns, catheterized specimens can prevent unnecessary evaluation [^8c727380] [^5b8ac2ad] [^8156e96c].

> Next, I should review follow-up after a negative evaluation. If the initial risk-based workup is negative, shared decision-making about repeating urinalysis is reasonable. If hematuria resolves and later recurs, or if gross hematuria or new symptoms develop, I should re-evaluate. Conversely, if hematuria resolves and remains absent, discontinuing further surveillance is acceptable, and I should document the plan and counsel on warning signs [^e6575d8b] [^178c370e].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have addressed documentation and communication. I need to record the exact RBC count, morphology, presence of casts or protein, risk tier, rationale for testing or deferral, and the shared decision-making discussion. This ensures continuity, supports value-based care, and aligns with guideline expectations for transparent, reproducible evaluation pathways [^ea054c22].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: confirm true microscopic hematuria with microscopy, assess specimen quality and repeat if needed, classify morphology to distinguish glomerular from non-glomerular sources, risk-stratify for malignancy, tailor imaging and cystoscopy to risk tier, consider nephrology referral when glomerular features are present, and use shared decision-making for follow-up. This minimizes overdiagnosis, reduces unnecessary procedures, and catches clinically significant disease early when it matters most [^39f5932b] [^ecbbfa73] [^53312b22].

An abnormal RBC on urinalysis means **≥ 3 RBCs/hpf** [^39f5932b] on microscopic examination of a properly collected specimen, after excluding contamination and confirming with repeat testing if needed [^9b5ee3f3]. This finding is **never normal** and warrants evaluation to distinguish glomerular from non-glomerular causes and to assess for malignancy risk [^258b589d]. Initial workup should include history, exam, serum creatinine/eGFR, and repeat urinalysis; further testing (imaging and cystoscopy) is risk-stratified by age, sex, smoking, and degree of hematuria [^ecbbfa73] [^d50b5e85]. Persistent hematuria increases malignancy risk, so **do not ignore** it [^ea054c22].

---

## Definition and significance

Microscopic hematuria is defined as **≥ 3 RBCs/hpf** on microscopic examination of a properly collected urine specimen [^39f5932b]; dipstick positivity alone is insufficient and must be confirmed microscopically [^9b5ee3f3]. This finding is **never normal** and requires evaluation to determine the underlying cause, which may range from benign conditions to serious diseases such as malignancy or glomerular disease [^258b589d].

---

## Common causes of abnormal RBCs in urinalysis

Abnormal RBCs in urinalysis can arise from **various sources**, broadly categorized into glomerular and non-glomerular causes:

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Glomerular causes | - IgA nephropathy <br/> - Lupus nephritis <br/> - Alport syndrome <br/> - Thin basement membrane disease <br/> - Post-infectious glomerulonephritis [^notfound] |
| Non-glomerular causes | - Urinary tract infections <br/> - Kidney stones <br/> - Benign prostatic hyperplasia <br/> - Malignancy (bladder, renal, prostate) <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Exercise-induced hematuria <br/> - Menstrual contamination [^258b589d] |

---

## Clinical significance and implications

The presence of abnormal RBCs in urinalysis is **clinically significant** because it may indicate underlying pathology. The risk of malignancy increases with age, male sex, smoking, and the degree of hematuria (number of RBCs per high-power field) [^4898121e]. Persistent microscopic hematuria is associated with a higher risk of urinary tract malignancy, particularly bladder and renal cancers [^ea054c22].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

The evaluation of abnormal RBCs in urinalysis should be **systematic and risk-stratified**:

- **Initial evaluation**: History, physical examination, and laboratory tests (serum creatinine, eGFR) to assess renal function and identify risk factors for malignancy or renal disease [^d50b5e85].
- **Repeat urinalysis**: Confirm persistent hematuria and exclude transient causes such as infection or contamination [^ea054c22].
- **Imaging**: Risk-based imaging of the upper urinary tract (renal ultrasound or multiphasic CT urography) to identify stones, masses, or structural abnormalities [^34fe16d4].
- **Cystoscopy**: Direct visualization of the lower urinary tract to identify bladder or urethral lesions, particularly in intermediate- and high-risk patients [^34fe16d4].

---

## Risk stratification and management

Risk stratification guides the extent of evaluation. Low-risk patients (young, female, non-smoker, low RBC count) may undergo **conservative management with repeat urinalysis**, whereas intermediate- and high-risk patients (older, male, smoker, high RBC count) require comprehensive evaluation, including imaging and cystoscopy [^ecbbfa73] [^34fe16d4]. Persistent hematuria after exclusion of benign causes **warrants further evaluation** to exclude malignancy or significant renal disease [^258b589d].

---

## Conclusion

Abnormal RBCs in urinalysis, defined as **≥ 3 RBCs/hpf**, are never normal and require a structured evaluation to identify the underlying cause. The diagnostic approach should be risk-stratified, incorporating history, laboratory tests, repeat urinalysis, imaging, and cystoscopy as indicated. Persistent hematuria increases the risk of malignancy, making further evaluation essential [^ea054c22].

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^af3a1e66]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed. Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after treatment of urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

Introduction

Hematuria is a common urinary abnormality indicative of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the long asymptomatic early phase of CKD, urinalysis was considered a high priority for evaluating patients with suspected kidney diseases that manifest as hematuria. Urine red blood cells (RBCs) count, a strong indicator of hematuria, has true variability in individual patients ranging from asymptomatic to rapidly progressive stages. Fluctuations in urinary component concentration are affected by water intake, exercise, and improper urine sample collection and are associated with the instability of urinary RBC count (URBC). Although limited data are available regarding the test performance of RBCs count, efforts are being made to clarify urine test competence and identify candidates for enhancing the accuracy of hematuria diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to optimize the URBC based routine urinalysis, explore new urinary indexes, and subsequently improve accuracy and stability in hematuria diagnosis and early detection of CKD.

### The abnormal urinalysis [^2aa09b1f]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The urinalysis is one of the most commonly performed tests in pediatrics, and whether expected or incidental, abnormal findings are common. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the urinalysis allows one to maximize its use as a screening tool while avoiding expensive and unnecessary evaluations. This article reviews the significance of abnormal results on urine dipstick testing and urine microscopy. Causes of false positive and false negative results are summarized. Initial diagnostic considerations of abnormal urinalysis findings are provided where appropriate.

### Biomarkers in sickle cell disease [^b2d66eb5]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

More than 100 different blood and urine biomarkers have been described in sickle cell disease (SCD), with the number increasing rapidly as analytical techniques develop. Nearly all of these biomarkers are abnormal in the steady state, and become more so during complications. The range of abnormalities demonstrates the multisystem nature of SCD and the complex pathophysiology. Some biomarkers indicate damage to specific organs, such as urine albumin:creatinine ratio in nephropathy, whereas others indicate more systemic processes. Biomarkers have been useful in identifying various interrelated pathological mechanisms, including haemolysis, inflammation, hypercoagulability, oxidative stress, reperfusion injury, vasculopathy and endothelial dysfunction. However, most biomarkers correlate closely with other more routine measurements, and also with each other. It is not clear that any provide specific prognostic or clinical information beyond that given by the simple measurement of haemoglobin concentration. The identification of prognostically validated biomarkers in prospective clinical trials would be useful.

Conclusion

In combination with clinical information, the accuracy of urine RBC counting could be improved, and the integrity of hematuria diagnosis could also be promoted simultaneously to achieve or approach the non-invasive diagnosis of CKD. This small sample size study might provide crucial support for the diagnosis and treatment of patients who are contraindicated for renal biopsy and likely guide and support clinical activities for primary health care institutes that do not qualify to perform renal biopsy.

### Blood doping: potential of blood and urine sampling to detect autologous transfusion [^3ff49c94]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The collection of blood, its storage as red blood cell (RBC) concentrates and its reinjection is prohibited; until now, the practice cannot be reliably detected. A recent innovation-the haematological module of the athlete's biological passport-can provide authorities with indications towards autologous blood transfusion. In situations where a given athlete has been exposed to altitude, heat stress, sickness, etc, additional evidence may be needed to establish beyond any reasonable doubt that a blood transfusion may actually have occurred. Additional evidence may be obtained from at least three different approaches using parameters related to blood and urine matrices. Genomics applied to mRNA or miRNA is one of the most promising analytical tools. Proteomics of changes associated with RBC membranes may reveal the presence of cells stored for some time, as can an abnormal pattern of size distribution of aged cells. In urine, high concentrations of metabolites of plasticisers originating from the blood storing bags strongly suggest a recent blood transfusion. We emphasise the usefulness of simultaneously obtaining and then analysing blood and urine for complementary evidence of autologous blood transfusion ('blood doping').

Discussion

Hematuria, defined as the presence of RBCs in urine, was identified by urinalysis of a concentrated urine sediment specimen. Prompt referral to a nephrologist is indicated when hematuria does not resolve within weeks of onset. Effective and accurate URBC-based hematuria measurements provide explainable insights into hematuria resolution and chronic disease management. Our study investigated new complex indicators to improve URBC confirmed by a particular renal biopsy. Urine RBC counts can be measured using automated urine sediment analyzers. A previous study suggested that the determination of urinary RBC distribution with an automated analyzer and analysis of the distribution curves may be a more reliable measure of erythrocyte morphology. Renal biopsy, the gold standard for the diagnosis of kidney diseases, can be used to verify the sources of urinary RBCs, and the count and morphology of urinary RBCs can, in turn, provide important information on patients' renal pathological changes. In our study, we focused on hematuria originated from kidney diseases.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^04a423fb]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus — diagnosis of kidney involvement (urine abnormalities) indicates testing at systemic lupus erythematosus presentation or suspicion of flare with a testing panel of serum creatinine, urinalysis (dipstick and sediment), spot protein–creatinine ratio (PCR), and serology (anti-dsDNA and complement). Evidence of abnormal proteinuria or urine sediment is defined as dipstick protein ≥ 2+ (any level of specific gravity), dipstick protein 1+ (low specific gravity), or spot PCR > 500 mg/g (50 mg/mmol), with or without urine sediment positive for dysmorphic red blood cells (≥ 5%), red blood cell casts or white blood cell casts. If there is no such evidence, the pathway states "No further urine testing at this time"; if present, it directs to "Quantify proteinuria" and asks "Is 24-hour proteinuria ≥ 500 mg/d?", with "Consider kidney biopsy" for the positive branch and "Repeat testing and follow the progress" for the negative branch.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaHematuria-child [^8c727380]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hematuria is the presence of red blood cells in the urine, either visible to the eye (macroscopic hematuria) or as viewed under the microscope (microscopic hematuria). The clinical evaluation of children and adolescents with any form of hematuria begins with a meticulous history and thorough evaluation of the urine. The need for imaging evaluation depends on the clinical scenario in which hematuria presents, including the suspected etiology. Ultrasound and CT are the most common imaging methods used to assess hematuria in children, although other imaging modalities may be appropriate in certain instances. This review focuses on the following clinical variations of childhood hematuria: isolated hematuria (nonpainful, nontraumatic, and microscopic versus macroscopic), painful hematuria (ie, suspected nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis), and renal trauma with hematuria (microscopic versus macroscopic). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults: summary of the AUA best practice policy recommendations [^be6c22a1]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The American Urological Association (AUA) convened the Best Practice Policy Panel on Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria to formulate policy statements and recommendations for the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria in adults. The recommended definition of microscopic hematuria is three or more red blood cells per high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. This definition accounts for some degree of hematuria in normal patients, as well as the intermittent nature of hematuria in patients with urologic malignancies. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has causes ranging from minor findings that do not require treatment to highly significant, life-threatening lesions. Therefore, the AUA recommends that an appropriate renal or urologic evaluation be performed in all patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who are at risk for urologic disease or primary renal disease. At this time, there is no consensus on when to test for microscopic hematuria in the primary care setting, and screening is not addressed in this report. However, the AUA report suggests that the patient's history and physical examination should help the physician decide whether testing is appropriate.

### Evaluation of proteinuria and hematuria in ambulatory setting [^15b213b6]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria and/or hematuria are common findings in ambulatory settings. Proteinuria can be glomerular and/or tubular in origin and it may be transient, orthostatic, or persistent. Persistent proteinuria may be indicative of a serious kidney pathology. Hematuria, which denotes the presence of an increased number of red blood cells in the urine, can be gross or microscopic. Hematuria can originate from the glomeruli or other sites of the urinary tract. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or mild proteinuria in an otherwise healthy child is less likely to be of clinical significance. However, the presence of both requires further workup and careful monitoring.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^9b5ee3f3]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — dipstick versus microscopy: Clinicians should not define microhematuria by positive dipstick testing alone, and a positive urine dipstick test (trace blood or greater) should prompt formal microscopic evaluation of the urine; this is a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Level: Grade C. The Panel emphasizes that a positive dipstick merits microscopic examination of the urinary sediment but does not warrant full evaluation unless microscopic evaluation confirms ≥ 3 RBC/HPF, and if suspicion persists, repeat microscopic testing may be reasonable after assessing patient risk and preference. Supporting data note that in a series of 237 female patients with a positive dipstick, 20.3% had a normal urinalysis, and amongst 54 patients referred for microhematuria evaluations based solely on a positive dipstick, only 14 (26%) had a positive urinalysis result.

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: a physician-patient real world data analysis [^818fd57c]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hematuria, or blood in the urine, is a common occurrence in clinical practice. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH; defined as > 3 red blood cells/high-powered field in a properly collected urine sample) is present in up to 24% of the general population and is the primary reason for more than 485,000 referrals to urologists in the US every year.

The current American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend a full urological work-up to diagnose or rule out UC in patients with AMH within 180 days, however several barriers to referral for a full urological work-up exist. For example, clinical diagnostic algorithms for patients with hematuria are complicated, difficult to follow and enable a degree of latitude in their interpretation. Many physicians are also conscious of the burden of invasive procedures and the potential for harm and there is a lack of compliance by patients when confronted with the prospect of many and varied invasive procedures. Invasive procedures, such as cystoscopy and contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, have the potential to impact their patients in terms of adverse events, financial cost and emotional impact. As such, guideline recommendations to administer full urological work-ups to all patients presenting with hematuria may only be selectively adhered to.

In particular, as few as 10% of women with hematuria are referred to urologists. Likewise, < 14% of patients with hematuria undergo cystoscopy or radiological investigation within 180 days and a recent Australian study reported delays of up to 1165 days between initial presentation of hematuria and subsequent treatment for UC. This is particularly concerning given that delayed diagnoses are known to negatively influence outcomes for patients with UC with every day increasing the risk of death for a patient with UC by 1%.

The high probability of delayed treatment is particularly evident for younger and female patients. Treatment for UC is more likely to be delayed for women than men, and although the incidence of UC is higher for men, women are less likely to undergo procedures after being referred and have a higher risk of presenting with UC at an advanced stage and have poorer survival outcomes. Therefore, a simple, rigorous and accurate segregation of patients using a non-invasive risk-assessment tool may reduce barriers to referral and focus the intensity and prioritisation of patients for workup.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^51f25589]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) asymptomatic microscopic hematuria — evaluation scope and evidence indicate the guideline "lowered the age threshold for evaluation from older than 40 years to 35 years", and "the recommended evaluation for all patients meeting the criteria for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (after other causes have been ruled out) includes cystoscopy and upper tract imaging with multiphasic computed tomography (CT) urography, with and without intravenous contrast". The document emphasizes that "'blood' on a dipstick urinalysis is not hematuria, and this finding indicates the need for a microscopic urinalysis to evaluate for red blood cells". Regarding screening, "the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2011 concluded the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic adults (4)". The evidence strength behind the AUA recommendations "is Grade C", is "primarily… based on data from male patients", and "the risk of urinary tract malignancy (bladder, ureter, and kidney) is significantly less in women than in men".

### Evaluation of hematuria in children [^6ec0084a]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The detection of blood in a child's urine is alarming and often prompts many laboratory studies. Hematuria is one of the most important signs of renal or bladder disease, but proteinuria often is a more important diagnostic and prognostic finding. The physician should ensure that serious conditions are not overlooked, avoid unnecessary laboratory studies, reassure the family, and provide guidelines for additional studies if there is a change in the child's course. This article provides an approach to the evaluation and management of hematuria in a child. Many tests have been recommended for the child with hematuria, but no consensus exists on a systematic evaluation.

### Is cytology required for a hematuria evaluation? [^bded84e3]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

The value of urine cytology in evaluating patients with hematuria remains controversial. The American Urological Association Best Practice Policy on Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria recommends cytology only in patients with risk factors for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). This study evaluated how often urine cytology yielded supportive or unique information that led to the diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma, the cost of that information and whether it would have been obtained using the current best practice policy.

Materials and Methods

Between March 1976 and June 1985, 1,000 sequential patients with 1 episode of gross hematuria or microscopic hematuria, defined as greater than 3 red blood cells per high power field on 2 of 3 properly collected urinalyses, were evaluated according to a standard protocol in a closed panel health care system in the state of Hawaii. These records were reviewed to determine if urine cytology yielded supportive or unique information that led to the diagnosis of TCC.

Results

In 4 patients positive urine cytology was the sole finding supporting a TCC diagnosis. Urine cytology had a sensitivity of 55% and a specificity of 99.3%. The cost of a cytology result that yielded unique information was 8,367 US dollars using the 2002 Medicare reimbursement schedule.

Conclusions

Urine cytology can have an important role in the evaluation of hematuria. The current American Urological Society Best Practice Policy using risk factors to select patients for urine cytology would have captured the 4 patients for whom cytology was the key to diagnosis. Urine cytology was comparable to excretory urography, creatinine and cystoscopy in terms of cost analysis.

### How reliable is automated urinalysis in acute kidney injury? [^b98afd62]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Examination of urine sediment is crucial in acute kidney injury (AKI). In such renal injury, tubular epithelial cells, epithelial cell casts, and dysmorphic red cells may provide clues to etiology. The aim of this study was to compare automated urinalysis findings with manual microscopic analysis in AKI.

Methods

Samples from patients diagnosed with AKI and control patients were included in the study. Red blood cells, white blood cells, renal tubular epithelial cells/small round cells, casts, and pathologic (path) cast counts obtained microscopically and by a UF1000i cytometer were compared by Spearman test. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the ability to predict AKI from parameters obtained from the UF1000i.

Results

There was poor correlation between manual and automated analysis in AKI. None of the parameters could predict AKI using logistic regression analysis. However, the increment in the automated path cast count increased the odds of AKI 93 times.

Conclusion

Automated urinalysis parameters are poor predictors of AKI, and there is no agreement with manual microscopy.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^23d197c9]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation of hematuria in glomerular disease — diagnostic microscopy and prognostic monitoring are emphasized: "An abnormal dipstick test for blood should be confirmed by a microscopical examination of fresh, centrifuged urine sediment by phase-contrast microscopy or brightfield optics under low- and high-power magnification". In GN, "the erythrocytes are commonly (50%–80%) misshapen (dysmorphic)", and "the presence of acanthocytes (> 5% of all red blood cells) usually indicates an inflammatory glomerular disease". Practice directives state: "Routine evaluation of urine sediment for erythrocyte morphology and the presence of red cell casts and/or acanthocytes is indicated in all forms of glomerular disease", and "Monitoring of hematuria (magnitude and persistence) may have prognostic value in many forms of glomerular disease.

### Glomerular hematuria and the utility of urine microscopy: a review [^e98cbe93]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of hematuria and microscopic examination of urine sediment are commonly used tools by nephrologists in their assessment of glomerular diseases. Certain morphological aspects of urine red blood cells (RBCs) seen by microscopy may help in identifying the source of hematuria as glomerular or not. Recognized signs of glomerular injury are RBC casts or dysmorphic RBCs, in particular acanthocytes (ring-shaped RBCs with protruding blebs). Despite being a highly operator-dependent test, urine sediment examination revealing these signs of glomerular hematuria has demonstrated specificities and positive predictive values ranging between 90%-100% for diagnosing glomerular disease, although sensitivity can be quite variable. Hematuria is a commonly used tool for diagnosing patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis such as IgA nephropathy, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, and lupus nephritis, sometimes even as a surrogate for kidney involvement. Studies examining the role for hematuria in monitoring and predicting adverse outcomes in these diseases have shown inconsistent results, possibly due to inconsistent definitions that often fail to consider specific markers of glomerular hematuria such as dysmorphic RBCs, acanthocytes, or RBC casts. A consensus definition of what constitutes glomerular hematuria would help standardize use in future studies and likely improve the diagnostic and prognostic value of hematuria as a marker of glomerulonephritis.

### A segregation index combining phenotypic (clinical characteristics) and genotypic (gene expression) biomarkers from a urine sample to triage out patients presenting with hematuria who have a low probability of urothelial carcinoma [^748d6482]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hematuria, which is most often associated with causes such as benign prostatic enlargement, infection or urinary calculi, but is also symptomatic of urothelial carcinoma (UC), is estimated to occur in between 1 and 22% of patients in a general population. Macroscopic (macro-) hematuria is characterized by a visible color change in the urine of patients, while microscopic (micro-) hematuria is defined more precisely as the presence of ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-powered field (RBCs/HPF) in three concurrently collected urine samples. The overall prevalence of UC in patients with microhematuria has been reported to be approximately 4%, whereas several studies have consistently shown that the prevalence of UC is much higher in patients with macrohematuria, ranging from approximately 12–23%, yet up to four times as many patients with micro- versus macrohematuria present for urological evaluation. Notably, given that recent changes to the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines have seen the threshold for asymptomatic microhematuria (AMH) lowered to ≥ 3 RBCs/HPF in a single sample, and even lower thresholds (≥ 1 RBC/HPF) have been proposed, a consequential increase in the number of patients with hematuria who will undergo a urological work-up to investigate potential UC and a corresponding increase in the overall clinical and financial burden of these patients on healthcare systems is expected.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) kidney involvement — Practice Point 10.1.1 outlines a diagnostic approach specifying when to test, the testing panel, abnormal thresholds, and actions. Testing is indicated with "Systemic lupus erythematosus presentation", "As regular surveillance", or "Suspicion of disease flare", and the panel includes "Serum creatinine and eGFR", "Urinalysis (dipstick and sediment)", "Spot protein–creatinine ratio (PCR)", and "Serology (anti-dsDNA and complement)" (eGFR is estimated glomerular filtration rate and anti-dsDNA is anti–double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid). Under "Is there evidence of abnormal proteinuria or urine sediment", abnormal proteinuria is defined by "dipstick protein 2+ (any level of specific gravity), dipstick protein 1+ (low specific gravity), or spot PCR > 500 mg/g (50 mg/mmol)", and urine sediment criteria include "acanthocytes (≥ 5%), red blood cell casts or white blood cell casts"; if "No", "No further urine testing at this time", and if "Yes", "Quantify proteinuria" and if "Is 24-hour proteinuria ≥ 500 mg/d?" "Yes", "Consider kidney biopsy", otherwise "Repeat testing and follow the progress" then "No further urine testing at this time". Under "Is there evidence of decreased or decreasing GFR", examples include "abnormal eGFR that is below the expected level based on age and clinical history, or decreasing eGFR, with no attributable cause other than systemic lupus erythematosus"; if "No", "No further kidney function testing at this time", and pathways lead to "Consider kidney biopsy".

### The application of new complex indicators in the detection of urine [^52e1048d]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients presenting with proteinuria and /or hematuria are usually recommended to have renal biopsy, especially other less invasive procedures are not conclusive enough. Since renal biopsy is not routinely performed in remote areas, let alone inaccessibility of microscopic examinations. These non-invasive urinary complex indicators which based solely on urinalysis, will be helpful for patients in those remote areas. On the other hand, patients with contraindications of renal biopsy may also benefit from our new complex index for non-invasive diagnosis of hematuria. However, not all positive URBC results reflect factual bleeding in the urinary system due to physical and/or chemical interference and limitations of urinalysis. The correspondence of hematuria severity with values of our urinary indicator contributes to brief judgement of illness, and accelerates patients' orientation to nephrology.

This study had some limitations. First, due to the diversity of renal pathological changes, glomeruli, renal tubules, or interstitium lesions may exist alone or together. Therefore, the corresponding urine abnormalities may interfere with one another. Second, the limited sample size and the unbalanced constituent ratio between Type I and Type II barriers further generalization. Third, a discrepancy between the urinalysis and clinical pathology manifestation existed in some cases, which might be attributed to intermittent onset of hematuria, while other patients who presented with recurrent hematuria and no urinary abnormalities between the hematuric bouts may be recorded in this study as well. As a result, patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis may have negative hematuria, especially in well-rested conditions. Failure of patients to comply with the standards of urine collection or any mistakes in urine sample transport and storage would lead to pre-analytical errors and inaccurate results. However, the accuracy of urine tests can be improved by repeated urine tests. Fourth, random urine data collected at a single time point cannot fully and accurately reflect the state of kidney diseases. Last but not the least, the complex indicators were analyzed by urine RBCs intead of RBCs/HPF. The reason was that microscopy of urine RBCs is performed only when the occult (dry chemical analysis) is inconsistent with urine RBCs count (flow cytometry) in our center. Further study can be conducted to explore other complex indicators based on RBCs/HPF and extend the practical utility to centers without automated analyzers.

### Incidence of significant findings of microhematuria workup in women-what guidelines work best? [^47b9acc0]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To apply the American Urogynecological Society (AUGS)/American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendations of foregoing workup in patients under 50 years of age with less than 25 red cells per high-powered field, to a cohort of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) patients, and assess diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value compared to the American Urologic Association (AUA) guidelines.

Methods

Retrospective review of female patients who underwent AMH evaluation from 2012 to 2015. The number of patients who would have avoided workup following the AUGS/ACOG recommendations was determined. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive value and accuracy of the AUGS/ACOG recommendations compared to AUA guidelines were determined.

Results

Six hundred twenty women underwent AMH workup with 265 women undergoing full workup as per the AUA guidelines. Applying the AUGS/ACOG recommendations to this cohort would not have resulted in missed malignant diagnoses. Two tumors were found, both in patients who had undergone complete workup, and for whom AUGS/ACOG recommends workup. Following the AUGS/ACOG recommendations would have avoided workup in 126/620 of all women and 44/265 women who underwent the full AUA workup. In looking at findings of malignancy, the AUGS/ACOG workup had a sensitivity of 100% and a negative predictive value of 100% as compared to the AUA guidelines.

Conclusion

AUA guidelines may over screen female low risk AMH patients. Extensive workup in a low risk group of female patients does not result in increased cancer diagnoses. Perhaps a more nuanced approach could result in fewer workups without compromising cancer detection.

### Prediction of prognosis and renal outcome in lupus nephritis [^4093142c]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

However, the usefulness of the urinalysis in clinical studies has in recent years been debated; the main reason for that being the fact that quantification of its components is characterised by a profound variability between assessors and between consecutive measurements. Moreover, urinalysis has been withdrawn in the newly proposed 2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE.

More importantly, results from urinalysis, in particular haematuria either before the initial immunosuppressive therapy or at 1 year from treatment initiation, have not shown prognostic ability regarding the long-term kidney outcome, and addition of such results to the proteinuria response did not improve the prognostic value of proteinuriaor even worsened it. Additionally, haematuria has in previous investigations shown weak or no correlation with activity features in kidney biopsies.

One of the reasons for this is undoubtedly the fact that different laboratories analyse the urine sediment differently, and thus, no homogenised data can be retrieved for use in trials. Moreover, the urine volume may affect the accuracy of the measurements of cellular counts, with large volumes resulting in greater dilutions of the cellular elements in the pellets. In the same manner, the time of the collection may affect the dilution grade for elements of importance, normally with higher concentrations in the first morning void compared with random collections during the rest of the day. While the aforementioned obstacles could be overcome with clear instructions and standardisation, other important barriers include the multiple reasons for haematuria, especially in female patients, and the high grade of subjectivity during the assessment. Indeed, not all red cells are indicative of glomerular injury, and accurate recognition of dysmorphic acanthocytes of glomerular origin contra red blood cells originating from the lower urinary tract needs special training.

Using more sophisticated approaches such as multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, Mackay et al recently developed panels of routine clinical, laboratory and histological parameters (termed hazard index tools) to predict key long-term outcomes, that is, new or progressive chronic kidney disease, severe kidney injury and permanent kidney replacement. It is worth noting that proteinuria and serum creatinine at month 12 were found to be important components in these tools, whereas urinalysis was not shown to add value.

### Committee opinion no. 703 summary: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^7e7b9428]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is an important clinical sign of urinary tract malignancy. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has been variably defined over the years. In addition, the evidence primarily is based on data from male patients. However, whether the patient is a man or a woman influences the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, and the risk of urinary tract malignancy (bladder, ureter, and kidney) is significantly less in women than in men. Among women, being older than 60 years, having a history of smoking, and having gross hematuria are the strongest predictors of urologic cancer. In low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 years without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%. Furthermore, the evaluation may result in more harm than benefit and is unlikely to be cost effective. Thus, data support changing current hematuria recommendations in this low-risk group. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society encourage organizations producing future guidelines on the evaluation of microscopic hematuria to perform sex-specific analysis of the data and produce practical sex-specific recommendations. In the meantime, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field.

### Hematuria as a marker of occult urinary tract cancer: advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians [^6168f0f7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of blood in the urine, or hematuria, is a common finding in clinical practice and can sometimes be a sign of occult cancer. This article describes the clinical epidemiology of hematuria and the current state of practice and science in this context and provides suggestions for clinicians evaluating patients with hematuria.

Methods

A narrative review of available clinical guidelines and other relevant studies on the evaluation of hematuria was conducted, with particular emphasis on considerations for urologic referral.

High-Value Care Advice 1

Clinicians should include gross hematuria in their routine review of systems and specifically ask all patients with microscopic hematuria about any history of gross hematuria.

High-Value Care Advice 2

Clinicians should not use screening urinalysis for cancer detection in asymptomatic adults.

High-Value Care Advice 3

Clinicians should confirm heme-positive results of dipstick testing with microscopic urinalysis that demonstrates 3 or more erythrocytes per high-powered field before initiating further evaluation in all asymptomatic adults.

High-Value Care Advice 4

Clinicians should refer for further urologic evaluation in all adults with gross hematuria, even if self-limited.

High-Value Care Advice 5

Clinicians should consider urology referral for cystoscopy and imaging in adults with microscopically confirmed hematuria in the absence of some demonstrable benign cause.

High-Value Care Advice 6

Clinicians should pursue evaluation of hematuria even if the patient is receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.

High-Value Care Advice 7

Clinicians should not obtain urinary cytology or other urine-based molecular markers for bladder cancer detection in the initial evaluation of hematuria.

### Urinalysis for the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis: role of dysmorphic red blood cells [^58dac124]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dysmorphic red blood cells (dRBCs) on urine microscopy have been associated with glomerulonephritis (GN). We assessed the prevalence and ability of dRBCs to differentiate GN from other kidney diseases.

Methods

Adult patients with kidney biopsy performed between 2012 and 2015 at a single center who had a concurrent urinalysis were retrospectively studied. The association of ≥ 25% dRBCs with the presence of glomerular pathology was assessed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed on significantly associated variables.

Results

The mean age of the 482 eligible subjects was 55years and 47.7% were female. Overall, 173 (35.9%) had < 25% and 76 (15.8%) had ≥ 25% urine dRBCs. Kidney biopsies revealed glomerular disease in 372 (77.2%) (GN 46% and non-GN 54%). At the dRBC threshold of ≥ 25% used at our center, a sensitivity of 20.4%, specificity of 96.3% and positive predictive value of 94.6% for glomerular disease were observed. In a logistic regression model, urine RBCs [> 10 versus ≤ 10 (P < 0.001)] but not dRBCs ≥ 25% (P = 0.3) independently predicted the presence of GN. A scoring system (0–3) based on hematuria and proteinuria levels revealed the risk for biopsy-proven GN was 15% when the score was 0 compared with 83% when it was 3.

Conclusions

The presence of ≥ 25% urine dRBCs is specific but not sensitive for GN. In this cohort, the combined hematuria (> 10RBCs/high-power field) and proteinuria performed just as well as dRBCs plus proteinuria to predict underlying GN. A model based on the degree of hematuria and proteinuria found on urinalysis was able to predict the presence of GN.

### Defining properly collected urine: thresholds to improve the accuracy of urinalysis for microscopic hematuria evaluation in women [^8156e96c]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Microscopic hematuria is one of the most common office consults for urologists. While revised guidelines have risk-stratified patients to reduce unnecessary screening, they do not provide guidance concerning specimen quality. We sought to define "properly collected" specimens using catheterized urine samples as a reference to improve the utility of hematuria screening in women.

Materials and Methods

We prospectively acquired same-visit voided and catheterized urine samples from 46 women referred for microscopic hematuria from September 2016 to March 2020. Characteristics of pre-referral urinalysis were compared to the matched specimens. True microscopic hematuria was defined as ≥ 3 red blood cells per high power field on catheterization.

Results

Catheterized urinalyses had significantly fewer red blood and squamous epithelial cells in comparison to both referral urinalyses (p = 0.006, p = 0.001, respectively) and same-day void urinalyses (p = 0.02, p = 0.04, respectively). As no catheterized sample had > 2 squamous epithelial cells, we applied this squamous epithelial cell threshold to referral urinalyses for analysis. Addition of this criterion for "properly collected specimen" increased the positive predictive value of referral urinalyses from 46.1% to 68.8% for true microscopic hematuria. Fewer than 2 squamous epithelial cells with elevated RBC was a significant predictor for true microscopic hematuria (p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Voided specimens in the urology clinic had significantly lower red blood cells than referral samples, indicating improved collection technique may reduce false positive urinalyses. Matched collection suggested that repeat collection by catheterization in women who present with > 2 squamous epithelial cells per high power field on referral urinalysis may prevent unnecessary future work-up.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults… [^dc34d34f]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

INTRAVENOUS UROGRAPHY Traditionally, intravenous urography has been the initial radiographic approach for the evaluation of the upper urinary tract in patients with microscopic hematuria. 7, 20 It defines the anatomy of the urologic tract from the kidney to the bladder, and its advantages include relatively low cost and ready availability. 8 One concern regarding intravenous urography as the sole radiographic evaluation of microscopic hematuria is its limited sensitivity for detecting small renal masses. Contrast-enhanced CT has favorable sensitivity over intravenous urography or ultrasonography for identifying small renal parenchymal masses. Contrast-enhanced CT also enables detection of aneurysms in vessels that run along the ureter, a potentially life-threatening, albeit uncommon, condition. 21 Renal and perirenal abscesses are best evaluated by contrast-enhanced CT.

Evaluation of the Lower Urinary Tract Identifying an abnormality in the upper urinary tract does not preclude evaluation of the lower urinary tract because a comorbid lesion may exist. The etiology of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria remains unclear in 70 percent of patients after imaging of the upper urinary tract and assessment of urine for signs of glomerular disease. 2 Urine cytology studies and cystoscopy are used routinely to evaluate the lower urinary tract. URINE CYTOLOGY The AUA recommends that patients with microscopic hematuria have radiographic assessment of the upper urinary tract followed by urine cytology studies. 1 Voided urine cytology studies are less sensitive than cystoscopy for the evaluation of bladder cancer. 2 The sensitivity can be optimized by following urine collection protocols in which urine is collected from the first void of the morning on three consecutive days.

2 Urine cytology does, however, have high specificity. 2 The sensitivity of urine cytology is highest for detection of high-grade lesions in the bladder and carcinoma in situ. 24 The primary advantage of urine cytology versus cystoscopy is that because it is noninvasive, it does not cause the patient any discomfort. Urine cytology is limited in its ability to detect low-grade lesions in the bladder as well as renal cell cancer. 24.

### Additional considerations for the microscopic evaluation of… [^de32a4c6]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: I appreciate the comprehensive and well-organized article by Dr. Hitzeman and colleagues. 1 I would like to offer additional information about the microscopic evaluation of urine. The microscopic evaluation of centrifuged urine for red blood cells is roughly quantitative, and not as exact as an Addis count because there are usually no or very few red blood cells. 2 Red blood cells in a urine sample lyse if the specific gravity is low or the pH is high. This phenomenon varies, but lysis is usually partial or complete with a specific gravity of less than 1. 010 or a pH of 7 or greater. In either instance, a urine dipstick test is more accurate than microscopic evaluation. 3–5. Urine with low osmolality can occur in several examples provided in the article. Urine can be alkaline or become alkaline due to the patient's diet or if the specimen is left for long periods without refrigeration.

When a dipstick evaluation suggests the presence of red blood cells, care should be taken to ensure the specific gravity is greater than 1. 010 and the pH is less than 7 before relying on a microscopic evaluation. White blood cells are more ubiquitous in urine than red blood cells, but they also lyse with low specific gravity or high pH; therefore, the same considerations apply. In Reply: Thank you for your interest in our article on office-based urinalysis. There are caveats to consider when interpreting a dipstick or microscopic analysis of the urine. Thank you for highlighting possible false-negative microscopic results when red blood cells may have lysed due to diluted urine or a high pH. If the clinical picture does not support a corresponding false-positive dipstick result, clinicians should be vigilant and look at these dipstick markers.

An immediate recollection or collection at a future date with a morning void to minimize confounding variables should be considered. Most importantly, urine should be refrigerated or analyzed in a timely manner after collection. Nothing good comes from a specimen lingering on the counter.

### Study on fine-grained visual classification of low-resolution urinary erythrocyte [^d085091d]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The morphological analysis test item of urine red blood cells is referred to as "extracorporeal renal biopsy", which holds significant importance for medical department testing. However, the accuracy of existing urine red blood cell morphology analyzers is suboptimal, and they are not widely utilized in medical examinations. Challenges include low image spatial resolution, blurred distinguishing features between cells, difficulty in fine-grained feature extraction, and insufficient data volume. This article aims to improve the classification accuracy of low-resolution urine red blood cells. This paper proposes a super-resolution method based on category-aware loss and an RBC-MIX data enhancement approach. It optimizes the cross-entropy loss to maximize the classification boundary and improve intra-class tightness and inter-class difference, achieving fine-grained classification of low-resolution urine red blood cells. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that with this method, an accuracy rate of 97.8% can be achieved for low-resolution urine red blood cell images. This algorithm attains outstanding classification performance for low-resolution urine red blood cells with only category labels required. This method can serve as a practical reference for urine red blood cell morphology examination items.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^6a66c5d2]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — specimen handling and analytic considerations: The specimen container should be labeled per institutional protocol and analyzed within standard laboratory regulations, and method of collection, date, and time should be included in the labeling. Analytic techniques vary, with some now using flow cytometry rather than microscopy. Urine specimens collected immediately after prolonged recumbency (first void in morning) or the first voiding after vigorous physical or sexual activity should not be examined to assess for microhematuria. In dilute urine, usually below an osmolality of 308 mOsm, most RBCs lyse; therefore, the number of RBCs per 400x magnification may be artificially reduced.

### Red urine, updated for the nephrologist: a case report [^5b8ac2ad]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Sickle cell trait is not completely benign, and can be responsible for specific renal abnormalities: micro- or gross hematuria, weak bladder, papillary necrosis, renal infarction, renal medullary carcinoma, increased risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis, chronic kidney disease and albuminuria. Hematuria is the most common complication in male patients with the sickle cell trait compared to those with normal hemoglobin. Hematuria may originate from either kidney, although a preponderance of left-sided renal bleeding has been observed. Papillary necrosis is most common in subjects aged 30 to 40 years. Most frequently, the bleeding remits spontaneously with symptomatic treatment but may recur in 50% of cases. Rarely, hematuria requires multiple transfusions and is life-threatening. Recurrent papillary necrosis may contribute to the development of chronic kidney disease.

Sickle cell trait is caused by a single mutation involving the substitution of a single amino acid (Glu → Val) at the sixth position of the β-chain of a normal hemoglobin (HbA) molecule. This single-point mutation leads to the polymerization of the mutant hemoglobin (sickle hemoglobin or HbS) molecule and morphological deformation of red blood cells (RBCs) into rigid sickle shapes with abnormal rheology under deoxygenated conditions. Two major factors may promote HbS polymerization in the arterial blood passing through the long vasa recta of the renal medulla: First, the low partial pressure of oxygen leading to RBC sickling in the vasa recta; second, shrinkage of RBCs due to hypertonic medulla shifts water from the interior of the RBC, thus leading to HbS polymerization which is extremely sensitive to hemoglobin concentration. These factors which promote sickling by prolonging red cell microvascular transit times play a critical role in the initiation of a renal vaso-occlusive event. They result in microthrombi formation and infarction, which leads to microscopic papillary necrosis or frank papillary necrosis. Therefore, hematuria related to the sickle cell trait is urological and not glomerular in essence. Repeated microinfarctions in the renal medulla and changes in the renal blood flow disrupt the counter-current mechanisms leading to the relative loss of the concentrating ability of the kidney, namely impaired urinary concentration, which is dose dependent according to the percentage of sickle hemoglobin. Of note, papillary necrosis is not always present on standard imaging.

### Different urinalysis appearances in children with simple and perforated appendicitis [^864a6d69]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to determine whether routine urinalysis may serve as a tool in discriminating between acute appendicitis and perforated appendicitis in children.

Basic Procedures

We prospectively collected 357 patients with clinically suspected acute appendicitis. Urinalysis was performed in patients with clinically suspected acute appendicitis before surgical intervention. Routine urinalysis is composed of 2 examinations: chemical tests for abnormal chemical constituents and microscopic tests for abnormal insoluble constituents. Receiver operating characteristic curves for urine white blood cell (WBC) counts and urine red blood cell (RBC) counts in distinguishing between patients with simple appendicitis and patients with perforated appendicitis were also analyzed.

Main Findings

Urine ketone bodies, leukocyte esterase, specific gravity, pH, WBC, and RBC counts were all significant parameters among patients with normal appendices, simple appendicitis, and perforated appendicitis (all P < .05). Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, positive urine ketone bodies and nitrate were significant parameters in predicting perforated appendicitis (P = 0.002 and P = 0.008, respectively). According to the results of receiver operating characteristic curves, the appropriate cutoff values were 2.0/high-power field for urine RBC counts and 4.0/high-power field for urine WBC counts in predicting perforated appendicitis in children.

Principal Conclusions

Routine urinalysis may serve to aid in discriminating between simple and perforated appendicitis. Clinically, we believe that these urine parameters may aid primary emergency physicians with decision making in patients with clinically suspected appendicitis.

Kidney damage markers in acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Kidney damage is most commonly ascertained by urinary markers and imaging studies; examples include urinary red blood cells/casts, white blood cells/casts, renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cells/casts, fine and coarse granular casts, proteinuria, blood markers of tubular syndromes, and imaging abnormalities such as large kidneys, hydronephrosis, cysts, and stones, while small kidneys and size discrepancy indicate CKD; kidney damage is not a criterion for acute kidney injury (AKI) and, in the presence of AKI, does not indicate a separate diagnosis of AKD.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease in adults: part II. glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and other markers [^bfc530ae]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation published clinical practice guidelines on chronic kidney disease in February 2002. Of the 15 guidelines, the first six are of greatest relevance to family physicians. Part II of this two-part review covers guidelines 4, 5, and 6. Glomerular filtration rate is the best overall indicator of kidney function. It is superior to the serum creatinine level, which varies with age, sex, and race and often does not reflect kidney function accurately. The glomerular filtration rate can be estimated using prediction equations that take into account the serum creatinine level and some or all of specific variables (age, sex, race, body size). In many patients, estimates of the glomerular filtration rate can replace 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance measurements. Urine dipsticks generally are acceptable for detecting proteinuria. To quantify proteinuria, the ratio of protein or albumin to creatinine in an untimed (spot) urine sample is an accurate alternative to measurement of protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection. Patients with persistent proteinuria have chronic kidney disease. Other techniques for evaluating patients with chronic kidney disease include examination of urinary sediment, urine dipstick testing for red and white blood cells, and imaging studies of the kidneys (especially ultrasonography). These techniques also can help determine the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease. Family physicians should weigh the value of the National Kidney Foundation guidelines for their clinical practice based on the strength of evidence and perceived cost-effectiveness until additional evidence becomes available on the usefulness of the recommended quality indicators.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^eca625fc]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) referral — adults: Practice Point 5.1.1 directs, "Refer adults with CKD to specialist kidney care services in the circumstances listed in Figure 48". Circumstances include diagnostic uncertainty or specific causes — "Cause of CKD is uncertain", "Hereditary kidney disease", and "Recurrent extensive nephrolithiasis" — with the action "Further evaluation and specialist management based on diagnosis". Risk or kidney function triggers include "A 3%–5% 5-year risk of requiring KRT measured using a validated risk equation", "eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2", or "A sustained fall in eGFR of > 20% or > 30% in those people initiating hemodynamically active therapies", prompting "Planning and preparation for kidney replacement therapy". Albuminuria/hematuria triggers include "Consistent finding of significant albuminuria (ACR ≥ 300 mg/g [≥ 30 mg/mmol] or AER ≥ 300 mg/24 hours, approximately equivalent to PCR ≥ 500 mg/g [≥ 50 mg/mmol] or PER ≥ 300 mg/24 h) in combination with hematuria", plus " ≥ 2-fold increase in albuminuria in people with significant albuminuria undergoing monitoring", "A consistent finding of ACR > 700 mg/g [> 70 mg/mmol]", or "Urinary red cell casts; RBC > 20 per high power field sustained and not readily explained", with the action "Further evaluation and management". Other indications include "CKD and hypertension refractory to treatment", "Persistent abnormalities of serum potassium", "Acidosis", "Anemia", "Bone disease", and "Malnutrition", with the action "Management of CKD complications".

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^07bed5b8]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis — diagnosis of kidney involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is guided by a testing algorithm in which testing is indicated when systemic lupus erythematosus presentation, as regular surveillance, or suspicion of disease flare, and the testing panel includes serum creatinine and eGFR, urinalysis (dipstick and sediment), spot protein–creatinine ratio (PCR), and serology (anti-dsDNA and complement). Abnormal proteinuria or urine sediment is defined by dipstick protein 2+ (any level of specific gravity), dipstick protein 1+ (low specific gravity), or spot PCR > 500 mg/g (50 mg/mmol), and by urine sediment positive for acanthocytes (≥ 5%), red blood cell casts or white blood cell casts. If there is no evidence of abnormal proteinuria or urine sediment, no further urine testing at this time; if there is evidence, quantify proteinuria and assess whether 24-hour proteinuria is ≥ 500 mg/d, in which case consider kidney biopsy, while if not, repeat testing and follow the progress. For decreased or decreasing kidney function, evidence of decreased or decreasing GFR (e.g., abnormal eGFR below expected based on age and clinical history, or decreasing eGFR, with no attributable cause other than systemic lupus erythematosus) leads to repeat testing, whereas absence of such evidence leads to no further kidney function testing at this time.

### Value and use of urinalysis for myoglobinuria [^300a9e6d]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context —

Urine myoglobin testing is primarily indicated for diagnosis and risk assessment of kidney injury in patients with rhabdomyolysis. However, its utility is limited by a lack of rapid and reliable results. Myoglobin reacts positively for blood by urine dipstick, which can serve as an indicator of myoglobinuria.

Objective —

To evaluate the performance and value of blood and red cell measurements by urinalysis as a surrogate test for myoglobinuria in routine clinical practice.

Design —

This study is a retrospective observational study involving analysis of hemoglobin and red blood cell results by urinalysis in patients tested for urine myoglobin.

Results —

A total of 13139 urine myoglobin results from 88 Veterans Affairs facilities during a 15-year period ending in October 2014 were evaluated. Among methods used by each laboratory, qualitative urine myoglobin tests declined from 25 of 53 (47.1%) in 2000 to 5 of 77 (6.4%) in 2013. Of 7311 tests (55.6%) performed by quantitative methods with concomitant urinalysis, 3915 (53.5%) showed negative to trace blood results, of which myoglobin was 1000 μg/L or greater in 17 (0.4%). Among 1875 (25.5%) with 3+ (large) blood results, urine myoglobin was ≥ 1000 μg/L in 273 of 1533 (17.8%) with hematuria (≥ 5 red blood cells per microliter) and 109 of 342 (31.9%) without hematuria.

Conclusions —

Urinalysis results reliably predicted the absence of myoglobinuria and could be used to avert overtesting for urine myoglobin while also providing useful diagnostic information when urine myoglobin test results are not immediately available.

### Red urine, updated for the nephrologist: a case report [^dcd33697]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell trait is not completely benign, and some renal complications can occur. The baseline rate of admission for gross hematuria in normal males carrying the sickle cell trait is 2%.

Case Presentation

A 35-year-old non-smoking African man experienced a 2-week history of painless, profuse and persistent gross hematuria. Laboratory tests showed normal renal function, hematuria and mild proteinuria. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography angiography revealed no renal abnormalities; the bladder appeared pristine under cystoscopy. The diagnosis of sickle cell trait associated with gross hematuria was made using hemoglobin electrophoresis; renal biopsy and its complications were avoided. Urine was clear after 2 weeks of oral hydration and gamma epsilon-aminocaproic acid.

Conclusion

Hemoglobin electrophoresis should be performed in cases of gross hematuria. Coupled with other non-invasive evaluation, this could avoid renal biopsy and its associated complications.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^4931467b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women is less likely to be associated with urinary tract malignancy among women than men, and in women the strongest predictors of urologic cancer are being older than 60 years, a history of smoking, and gross hematuria. In low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 years without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%, and evaluation may result in more harm than benefit and is unlikely to be cost effective. Based on these data, the College and AUGS recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field.

### Assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults [^258b589d]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although routine screening for bladder cancer is not recommended, microscopic hematuria is often incidentally discovered by primary care physicians. The American Urological Association has published an updated guideline for the management of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, which is defined as the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field visible in a properly collected urine specimen without evidence of infection. The most common causes of microscopic hematuria are urinary tract infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary calculi. However, up to 5% of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria are found to have a urinary tract malignancy. The risk of urologic malignancy is increased in men, persons older than 35 years, and persons with a history of smoking. Microscopic hematuria in the setting of urinary tract infection should resolve after appropriate antibiotic treatment; persistence of hematuria warrants a diagnostic workup. Dysmorphic red blood cells, cellular casts, proteinuria, elevated creatinine levels, or hypertension in the presence of microscopic hematuria should prompt concurrent nephrologic and urologic referral. The upper urinary tract is best evaluated with multiphasic computed tomography urography, which identifies hydronephrosis, urinary calculi, and renal and ureteral lesions. The lower urinary tract is best evaluated with cystoscopy for urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder masses. Voided urine cytology is no longer recommended as part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, unless there are risk factors for malignancy.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^ffc6b277]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — initial history, examination, and laboratory assessment: Physical examination should include measurement of blood pressure and a genitourinary examination; clinicians should perform a probative history and physical examination, obtain a menstrual and gynecological history, and note that a catheterized UA may be helpful to confirm MH; symptoms and signs of UTI such as fever and dysuria should be elicited; patients should be asked about flank pain and obstructive urinary symptoms; hypertension, history of kidney disease, dysmorphic red blood cells (RBCs), and proteinuria may indicate glomerular disease; the initial evaluation should also include measurement of serum creatinine and an estimate of glomerular filtration rate; and patients should be asked about recent perineal trauma or genitourinary instrumentation.

### The application of new complex indicators in the detection of urine [^92844c4c]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate diagnosis and assessment of hematuria is crucial for the early detection of chronic kidney disease(CKD). As instability of urinary RBC count (URBC) often results with clinical uncertainty, therefore new urinary indexes are demanded to improve the accuracy of diagnosis of hematuria. In this study, we aimed to investigate the benefit of applying new complex indicators based on random urine red blood cell counts confirmed in hematuric kidney diseases.

Methods

All patients enrolled underwent renal biopsy, and their clinical information was collected. Urinary and blood biomedical indexes were implemented with red blood cell counts to derive complex indicators. Patients were divided into two groups (hematuria-dominant renal histologic lesions and non-hematuria-dominant renal histologic lesions) based on their renal pathological manifestations. The target index was determined by comparing the predictive capabilities of the candidate parameters for hematuric kidney diseases. Hematuria stratification was divided into four categories based on the scale of complex indicators and distributional features. The practicality of the new complex indicators was demonstrated by fitting candidate parameters to models comprising demographic information.

Results

A total of 1,066 cases (678 hematuria-dominant renal histologic lesions) were included in this study, with a mean age of 44.9 ± 15 years. In differentiating hematuria-dominant renal histologic lesion from the non-hematuria-dominant renal histologic lesion, the AUC value of "The ratio of the random URBC to 24-h albumin excretion" was 0.76, higher than the standard approach of Lg (URBC) [AUC = 0.744] (95% Confidence interval (CI) 0.712 ~ 0.776). The odds ratio of hematuria-dominant renal histologic lesion (Type I) increased from Q2 (3.81, 95% CI 2.66 ~ 5.50) to Q4 (14.17, 95% CI 9.09 ~ 22.72). The predictive model, composed of stratification of new composite indexes, basic demographic characteristics, and biochemical parameters, performed best with AUC value of 0.869 (95% CI 0.856–0.905).

Conclusion

The new urinary complex indicators improved the diagnostic accuracy of hematuria and may serve as a useful parameter for screening hematuric kidney diseases.

### Commentary: the role of cytologic analysis of voided urine in the work-up of asymptomatic microhematuria [^d7fc928b]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is a common finding in patients presenting to both primary care doctors as well as urologists. Sources of microscopic hematuria include infection, stones, inflammatory disorders as well as cancer of the genitourinary tract, particularly urothelial cancer. A primary focus in the urologic workup of hematuria is to rule out cancer. This is done using radiographic studies as well as procedures such as cystoscopy and bladder biopsy. As the authors state in their article titled "The utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria", cytologic analysis of voided urine, though attractive due to its noninvasive nature, has been found to have the neither the sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, nor the ease of administration necessary to replace more invasive diagnostics in the evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

### Red urine, updated for the nephrologist: a case report [^62006e0b]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Sickle cell trait, which confers malarial resistance by an unknown mechanism, has long been considered benign and asymptomatic. Hematuria is among the most common renal manifestations in both sickle cell trait and disease. Up to 50% of patients with sickle cell trait may develop papillary necrosis. Sickle cell trait and renal involvement such as papillary necrosis as gross hematuria is not rare. In our case, isolated macroscopic hematuria was the initial presentation of sickle cell trait, which led to its diagnosis. Our case is an important reminder to nephrologists to avoid a renal biopsy and its adverse effects in black patients who have no apparent previous medical history.

### The application of new complex indicators in the detection of urine [^c099c49f]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

We developed a parameter (URBC/24 hUP) that adjusts 24-h urinary protein quantification for surrogates of random urine RBC count to better reflect hematuria. From our study results, 24-h urinary protein quantification displayed significant distribution discrepancies in the two pathological types and was more related to Type I. Clinical practice guidelines recommend screening for and monitoring albuminuria and incorporating increased albuminuria into the definition and staging of CKD. The 24-h urinary protein quantification known as the "gold standard" method for evaluating proteinuria is an ideal target to be adjusted, as it avoids protein fluctuations during the day and can indirectly reflect patients' kidney functions. The findings of "patients in the hematuria group often had overt proteinuria " support the application of the 24-h urinary protein quantification.

In capturing trends in upgrading hematuria stratification-derived AUC values, we observed that patients with a higher URBC/24 hUP showed more specific interactions with Type I changes. Stratification of Lg (URBC/24 hUP) achieved an AUC value of 0.751 (95% CI, 0.719–0.782). When fitted into the model incorporating demographic characteristics and past medical history, the AUC value increased to 0.866 (95% CI 0.842–0.889). After the integration of biochemical data, the AUC further increased to 0.880 (95% CI, 0.855–0.905). These findings indicate that new urinary complex indicators corresponded better with Type I in the population at high risk of CKD, such as patients with hypertension and diabetes. For patients in the high-risk group (Q4), 24-h urine collection is a typical method of disease assessment and management. Compared to routine RBCs count based on a single collection, URBC/24 hUP corrects the urine RBC count by "24-h urinary protein quantification", reflecting a time-accumlation effect.

### Association of hematuria on microscopic urinalysis and risk of urinary tract cancer [^4898121e]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined the incidence of urinary tract cancer in patients with hematuria, stratified risk by age, gender and hematuria degree, and examined current best policy recommendations.

Materials and Methods

We performed a large, retrospective population based cohort study of patients who underwent microscopic urinalysis during 2004 and 2005 in a large managed care organization. Patients were followed for 3 years for urinary tract cancer.

Results

We identified 772,002 patients who underwent urinalysis during the study period. After exclusions due to previous hematuria, age less than 18 years, pregnancy, urinary tract infection, inpatient status and prior urinary tract cancer 309,402 patients were available for analysis, of whom 156,691 had hematuria. The overall 3-year incidence of urinary tract cancer in those with hematuria was 0.68%. Older age (greater than 40 years OR 17.0, 95% CI 11.2–25.7), greater hematuria (greater than 25 red blood cells per high power field OR 4.0, 95% CI 3.5–4.5) and male gender (OR 4.8, 95% CI 4.2–5.6) were associated with a higher risk of cancer. The American Urological Association definition of microhematuria had 50% sensitivity, 84% specificity and 1.3% positive predictive value.

Conclusions

The incidence of urinary tract cancer is low even in individuals with microhematuria. Thus, current best policy recommendations do not perform well. Since older age, male gender and greater hematuria are associated with a higher risk of cancer, future studies should evaluate strategies that target these populations.

### Practical use of investigations in patients with hematuria [^559e7209]. Journal of Endourology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The majority of patients with microscopic hematuria undergo a complete evaluation resulting in negative findings. The outcome of patients with hematuria was analyzed in an effort to optimize the use of investigations.

Patients and Methods

The records for 404 patients who presented with hematuria were reviewed. Data were collected on demographics, type of hematuria, investigations, and final diagnosis.

Results

The hematuria was microscopic in 140 patients (35%) and gross in 264 patients (65%). In gross hematuria patients, 10% had urinary tract tumors and 12% had calculi. All patients with genitourinary tumors and 87% of patients with calculi had gross hematuria and/or ≥ 5 RBCs/HPF (red blood cells per high-power microscopic field) on urinalysis. The sensitivity and specificity were 94% and 6% for the dipstick urine test, 37% and 71% for urine cytology, 92% and 93% for computed tomography (CT), 50% and 95% for ultrasound scans, and 38% and 90% for intravenous pyelography, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that age and number of RBCs/HPF in the urinalyses were the only significant factors predicting genitourinary cancer. In patients ≤ 40 years old, there was one patient with malignancy and seven patients with stones. In older patients, there were 31 patients with malignancy and 32 patients with stones.

Conclusions

Patients with < 5 RBCs/HPF on three urinalyses are unlikely to have significant pathology and could possibly be followed up conservatively. Patients ≤ 40 years of age should have a noncontrast CT or ultrasound study if they present with microscopic hematuria, and a cystoscopy should be added if gross hematuria exists. In older patients, a pre- and postcontrast CT and a cystoscopy should be performed.

### Red urine, updated for the nephrologist: a case report [^2af17e18]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Gross hematuria in young adults requires a complete work-up, including renal imaging with ultrasound, computed tomography angiography, cystoscopy and microbiological tests to rule out renal obstruction, kidney stones, renal infarction, schistosomiasis, other infections, toxic/herbal consumption and urological tumors. Renal biopsy is then often needed to explore glomerulopathies such as IgA nephropathy.

The prevalence of the sickle cell trait in the African black population is between 20 and 40%. Although it is often asymptomatic, it can be responsible for specific renal abnormalities. Half of the cases of hematuria are due to renal papillary necrosis, although renal obstruction, urinary infection, kidney stones, renal infarction, papillary necrosis, schistosomiasis and urological tumors such as renal medullary carcinoma must be ruled out.

Only a few cases of sickle cell trait and gross hematuria have been described. We describe here a case of gross hematuria in a patient with unknown sickle cell trait that we feel should be brought to the attention of nephrologists.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^0d9ef563]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 1.5 - evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
free light chains and bone marrow examination.
Hb electrophoresis.

### Screening with urinary dipsticks for reducing morbidity and mortality [^0375dbd1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary dipsticks are sometimes used for screening asymptomatic people, and for case-finding among inpatients or outpatients who do not have genitourinary symptoms. Abnormalities identified on screening sometimes lead to additional investigations, which may identify serious disease, such as bladder cancer and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Urinary dipstick screening could improve prognoses due to earlier detection, but could also lead to unnecessary and potentially invasive follow-up testing and unnecessary treatment.

Objectives

We aimed to quantify the benefits and harms of screening with urinary dipsticks in general populations and patients in hospitals.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 8 September 2014 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and other study types that compared urinary dipstick screening with no dipstick screening were eligible for inclusion. We searched for studies that investigated the use of urinary dipsticks for detecting haemoglobin, protein, albumin, albumin-creatinine ratio, leukocytes, nitrite, or glucose, alone or in any combination, and in any setting. We planned to exclude studies conducted in patients with urinary disorders.

Data Collection and Analysis

It was planned that two authors would independently extract data from included studies and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. However, no studies met our inclusion criteria.

Main Results

Literature searches to 8 September 2014 yielded 4298 records, of which 4249 were excluded following title and abstract assessment. There were 49 records (44 studies) eligible for full text assessment; of these 18 studies were not RCTs and 26 studies compared interventions or controls that were not relevant to this review. Thus, no studies were eligible for inclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening with urinary dipsticks, which remain unknown.

### Prevalence and associated factors for dipstick microscopic hematuria in men [^4458fc81]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Many etiologies exist for microscopic hematuria such as infection, urolithiasis, benign prostate hyperplasia, malignancy, nephropathies or physiologic. About 3.6% of patients presenting with microscopic hematuria will present a urinary tract malignancy but positive predictive value of microhematuria for malignancy is low and thus population screening has not been recommended. The definition of microscopic hematuria is three or greater red-blood cells (RBC) per high power field on a properly collected microscopic urinalysis as per the American Urological Association guidelines whereas the Canadian Urological Association guidelines require confirmation with a second microscopic urinalysis. However, in clinical practice, microscopy is often not ordered or not performed by the laboratory. Several studies have confirmed that dipstick urinalysis has good specificity (65–95%) and sensitivity (91–100%) in detecting microhematuria; rates of false positives and negatives are low and can be due to hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, ascorbic acid or reducing agents such as povidone.

Routine screening dipstick urinalysis is currently not recommended by any organization, including the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, as there is insufficient data to support this type of screening. However, up to 50% of general practitioners perform a routine urinalysis on all their patients as part of annual health screening visits. Microscopic hematuria (MH) is a common finding during routine urinalysis and leads to frequent referrals to urologists and nephrologists. According to current guidelines, MH often prompts a workup of the lower and upper tracts with cystoscopy and abdominal imaging representing a significant cost to health care systems.

Our primary objective was to identify and describe factors associated with microscopic hematuria. We also report on the prevalence of MH in the male population presenting to a men's health fair.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^ea054c22]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — management after repeat urinalysis in initially low/negligible-risk patients: Low/negligible-risk patients with microhematuria on repeat urinalysis should be reclassified as intermediate- or high-risk based on repeat urinalysis; in such patients, clinicians should perform risk-based evaluation in accordance with recommendations for these respective risk strata (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Low/negligible-risk patients should undergo a repeat UA to evaluate for the resolution versus persistence of MH, and if the repeat UA shows no evidence of MH, then no further evaluation of the bladder or upper tract is needed at this time. A study of over 11,000 patients found that persistent MH on repeat urine testing had a significantly higher rate of malignancy on subsequent evaluation (0.35% versus 0.07%), and patients with persistent MH are classified as either intermediate- or high-risk for malignancy depending upon the degree of MH at the repeat UA and other risk factors.

### Commentary: the role of cytologic analysis of voided urine in the work-up of asymptomatic microhematuria [^0e1c12e1]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Additionally, in the workup of hematuria, microscopic or otherwise, the urologist's job goes beyond ruling out the presence or absence of urinary tract malignancy. Stones, vascular malformations, inflammatory as well as infectious lesions detectable by cystoscopy, may all result in blood in the urine. Furthermore, bladder wash cytology, which has increased sensitivity compared to cytology on voided urine specimens, may be obtained during cystoscopy, serving to add diagnostic value over voided urine cytology even in the face of CIS missed cystoscopically or radiologically. In sum, voided urine cytology does not obviate the need for cystoscopy. For similar reasons, voided urine cytology cannot replace radiographic studies, which can detect not only benign lesions but neoplasms outside the collecting system, for example, in the renal parenchyma.

Voided urine cytology does not appear to have a primary role in the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria but may have a role as a supplement to cystoscopy and excretory urography in a minority of cases (for example when "invisible" diseases such as CIS are suspected.) However, hematuria is a "late" detector of bladder cancer and almost never is voided urine cytology the single test during a hematuria workup that detects urothelial cancer.

One may argue that in the above series by Hofland and Mariani, for the 4 patients in whom malignancy was solely detected by urine cytology that this test proved to be very valuable. But the question arises, "for a disease with a rather low prevalence (urothelial CIS), is a test with a very small unique diagnostic yield justified?" If one extrapolates the cost analysis by Hofland and Mariani to the general population, the magnitude of inefficiency becomes glaringly obvious. Asymptomatic microhematuria is prevalent in up to 21% of the US population or roughly 60 million Americans. If each individual was only tested once, cytology alone would cost over $3 billion. Furthermore, if a similar yield of diagnostically unique information of 0.6% was applied to this population, over $2.98 billion would be spent on a relatively insensitive and redundant test. In today's political environment where increased pressure is being placed on the health care system to reign in costs, the elimination of voided urinary cytology in the workup of asymptomatic microhematuria has the potential to effect significant savings.

### Persistent hematuria and kidney disease progression in IgA nephropathy: a cohort study [^de71672d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Hematuria is the most typical presentation of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN); however, its role in disease progression is still controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the association of hematuria and progression of IgAN.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

A cohort of 1,333 patients with IgAN treated at a Chinese referral hospital with a median follow-up of 45 months.

Predictors

Microhematuria was evaluated in fresh urine using a fully automated urine particle analyzer (automated method) and urine sediment examination by a skilled examiner (manual method). Hematuria was characterized as a time-varying attribute; namely, average hematuria level was calculated for every 6-month period for each patient during follow-up. Remission was defined as average red blood cell count ≤ 5/high-power field (manual method) or ≤ 28 red blood cells/μL (automated method) during the first 6 months of follow-up.

Outcomes

Composite event of 50% decline in estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate or development of kidney failure.

Analytical Approach

Multivariable cause-specific hazards models to analyze the relationship between hematuria and the composite kidney disease progression event.

Results

Time-varying hematuria during follow-up was an independent risk factor for the composite kidney disease progression event (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.13–1.87; P = 0.003). Hematuria remission during the 6 months after diagnosis was associated with a significantly lower rate of the composite kidney disease progression event (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.28–0.61; P < 0.001). A significant interaction was detected between remission of proteinuria and remission of hematuria during the first 6 months (P < 0.001). The association between remission of hematuria and kidney disease progression was detectable (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.32–0.68) within the subpopulation with persistent proteinuria (protein excretion > 1.0 g/d during the first 6 months), but not among patients whose proteinuria had remitted (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.31–1.29; P = 0.2). The 2 techniques for hematuria evaluation were strongly and significantly linearly correlated (r = 0.948; P < 0.001), and results using these 2 methods were consistent.

Limitations

A single-center retrospective study. Proportional hazards regression incorporating time-varying covariates may create time-varying confounding. The predictive value of reductions in hematuria was not directly evaluated.

Conclusions

Level of hematuria was independently associated with kidney disease progression, whereas hematuria remission was associated with improved kidney outcomes in IgAN among patients with persistent proteinuria. Additionally, to monitor IgAN progression, automated methods to evaluate hematuria hold promise as a replacement for manual evaluation of urinary sediment.

### A segregation index combining phenotypic (clinical characteristics) and genotypic (gene expression) biomarkers from a urine sample to triage out patients presenting with hematuria who have a low probability of urothelial carcinoma [^8b50a2d0]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

While several studies have previously sought to develop predictive models that consider phenotype when assessing the risk of UC in patients presenting with hematuria, the accuracy of phenotype-dependent models alone appears to be limited. For example, Loo et al. prospectively investigated whether phenotypic parameters could be used to identify patients with microhematuria who may not have required a urological referral and full work-up and concluded that age, male gender and a recent diagnosis of macrohematuria were significant predictors of UC. A history of smoking and > 25 RBCs/HPF in a recent urinalysis were not statistically significant predictors of UC, in isolation, but even when included in their 'Hematuria Risk Index' to improve predictive accuracy, this index resulted in an AUC of 0.809. Interestingly, the phenotypic ORs in this study and those identified by Loo et al. are comparable, with overlapping 95% CIs for smoking history and gender, and while age, gender and smoking history have similar weightings in each model, the influence of the genotypic component of the G + P INDEX presented here is likely to account for the higher AUC.

Likewise, Cha et al. reported that age, smoking history and degree of hematuria, but not gender, were significantly correlated with the presence of UC in patients with asymptomatic hematuria and used a multivariate model to develop a nomogram comprised of phenotypic and urine cytology data for predicting UC. As with Loo et al. the reported phenotypic ORs are comparable to those reported here, but even after incorporating urine cytology into the nomogram, the AUC of 0.831 reported in was lower than that of the G + P INDEX.

In another study, Tan et al. retrospectively stratified patients with hematuria who had been referred to a specialist urology clinic into high- and low-risk groups using a nomogram derived from patient age, gender, smoking history and the degree of hematuria. While comparisons with this study must be made with caution given the high proportion of patients who were excluded due to an absence of data (80 out of 405 patients), the AUC of 0.804, sensitivity of 0.900 and NPV of 0.953 were all lower than the G + P INDEX described here.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^472a7f68]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

Institutional review board approval was obtained to query medical records for pertinent clinical information in 239 consecutive patients evaluated between January 2003 and August 2005 for microscopic hematuria at a urology outpatient clinic in a tertiary-care inner-city hospital. Microscopic hematuria was characterized as microscopic hematuria [≥ 3 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf)]. Initial evaluations included medical history; physical examination, urinalysis, and voided urinary cytology. Urine cultures were obtained in patients if there was high suspicion of a urinary tract infection as the cause of the hematuria. Clinic and hospital records were reviewed for several key factors including tobacco usage, voiding symptoms (American Urologic Association, AUA, symptom score), urinalysis, urinary cytology, cystoscopic/radiologic evaluation, and pathologic outcomes. Median follow-up was 40 months (range 1–66 months).

Based on AUA guideline criteria on the use of urinary cytology, voided urinary cytologies were collected over a seven day period prior to radiologic and cystoscopic evaluation. Of the 239 patients, 182 patients had one cytology available for review whereas 125 and 96 patients had two and three cytologies, respectively, available for evaluation. Thus a total of 403 urinary cytologies were reviewed by our cytopathologists. In accordance with accepted nomenclature, final cytologic testing results were classified by the cytopathologists into 1 of 4 categories: normal, atypical/indeterminate, suspicious, or malignant.

Cystoscopic evaluation of the lower urinary tract and bladder biopsy

Hematuria evaluation included cystourethroscopy performed by an attending urologist with a 30- and 70-degree endoscope in a 17-F sheath in women in the outpatient setting, an 18-F flexible cystoscopy in men in the outpatient setting, or with a 30-and 70-degree endoscope with a 21-F sheath in the operating room. Any abnormal bladder lesions were biopsied and frank tumors were resected. Pathologic specimens were sent for evaluation in 10% formalin. In patients with atypia, suspicious, or carcinoma on cytology and no obviously bladder tumor, random bladder and prostatic biopsies were obtained at the discretion of the treating surgeon.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^ff676142]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^178c370e]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria follow-up after a negative evaluation: in patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Most patients who have an appropriate risk-stratified negative hematuria evaluation do not require ongoing urologic monitoring and may be safely discharged from the urology clinic after shared decision-making and discussion of the best available evidence, and for these patients a future UA may be considered.

### Urinalysis: case presentations for the primary care physician [^49da5f0c]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is useful in diagnosing systemic and genitourinary conditions. In patients with suspected microscopic hematuria, urine dipstick testing may suggest the presence of blood, but results should be confirmed with a microscopic examination. In the absence of obvious causes, the evaluation of microscopic hematuria should include renal function testing, urinary tract imaging, and cystoscopy. In a patient with a ureteral stent, urinalysis alone cannot establish the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. Plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can identify a stent and is preferred over computed tomography. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen obtained from a person without symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in nonpregnant adults, including those with prolonged urinary catheter use.

### The use of selected urine chemistries in the diagnosis of kidney disorders [^2a55fd77]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary chemistries vary widely in both health and disease and are affected by diet, volume status, medications, and disease states. When properly examined, these tests provide important insight into the mechanism and therapy of various clinical disorders that are first detected by abnormalities in plasma chemistries. These tests cannot be interpreted in isolation, but instead require knowledge of key clinical information, such as medications, physical examination, and plasma chemistries, to include kidney function. When used appropriately and with knowledge of limitations, urine chemistries can provide important insight into the pathophysiology and treatment of a wide variety of disorders.

### Assessment of interobserver reliability of nephrologist examination of urine sediment [^fee511b6]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

For particles in the urine sediment other than casts, overall percent agreement was 69% (95% CI, 61%-77%) and the overall κ was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.56–0.73). Interobserver reliability was highest for squamous epithelial cells (κ = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.94), isomorphic red blood cells (RBCs) (κ = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.81–0.88), and dysmorphic RBCs (κ = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.80–0.86). The lowest κ statistics were seen for kidney tubular epithelial cells (κ = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.26–0.33) and transitional epithelial cells (κ = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.45–0.52).

The disease processes believed most likely to be present in each case based on the reviewers' evaluation of the urine sediment findings in comparison with the diagnoses made after kidney biopsy are presented in Table 2 and depicted in Figure 3. Agreement varied considerably between cases but was highest when glomerular pathology was present. In 3 cases, all 14 reviewers suspected the same underlying disease process with perfect agreement, which was, in turn, consistent with the findings on biopsy. Results of urinalyses as reported by the central laboratory, which were available from urine samples collected within 2 days before biopsy in 9 of 10 cases, are given in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Notably, in none of these cases were any findings other than isomorphic RBCs, WBCs, squamous cells, bacteria, and hyaline casts reported by the laboratory.

### An evidence-based microscopic hematuria care pathway optimizes decision-making among providers [^36552811]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Microscopic hematuria (MH) has many etiologies in women and requires specific gynecologic evaluation. We created a standardized MH pathway to serve as an evidence-based decision aid for providers in our practice.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi process, a multidisciplinary team reviewed existing guidelines for MH diagnosis and treatment to reach consensus on care pathway components.

Results

Entry into the care pathway by an advanced practice provider is determined by the finding of ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-power field (RBC/HPF) on microscopic urinalysis. Initial evaluation includes history and physical exam. If there are signs of a gynecologic cause of MH, the conditions are treated and repeat urinalysis is performed in 6 months. If repeat urinalysis shows persistent MH or there are no other apparent causes for MH, we proceed with risk stratification. Through shared decision-making, low-risk patients may undergo repeat urinalysis in 6 months or cystoscopy with urinary tract ultrasound. For intermediate-risk patients, cystoscopy and urinary tract ultrasound are recommended. For high-risk patients, cystoscopy and axial upper urinary tract imaging are recommended. If evaluation is positive, urology referral is provided. If evaluation is negative, low-risk patients are released from care, but intermediate-risk or high-risk patients undergo repeat urinalysis in 12 months. If repeat urinalysis is positive, shared decision-making is used to determine a plan.

Conclusions

We developed an MH care pathway to standardize care of women with MH across a multidisciplinary group. This pathway serves as a component of value-based care and supports evidence-based care by providers.

### Comparison and interpretation of urinalysis performed by a nephrologist versus a hospital-based clinical laboratory [^5fec5116]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Urinalysis (UA) is considered the most important laboratory test in evaluating patients with kidney disease. Anecdotally, we have observed differences between results of UA performed by nephrologists compared with those performed by certified medical technologists or clinical laboratory scientists that could affect a clinician's diagnosis. Whether there are differences between UA performed by the clinical laboratory and that performed by a nephrologist was determined, and accuracy of diagnosis based on interpretation of the UA was compared.

Methods

Urine samples were obtained from 26 patients with acute renal failure (ARF). An aliquot of urine was sent to the clinical laboratory for UA. Nephrologist A, blinded to the patient's clinical information, performed a UA on the other aliquot of urine, generated a report, and assigned the most likely diagnosis for ARF based on UA findings. Nephrologist B, also blinded to the clinical information, reviewed nephrologist A's UA reports and assigned a diagnosis for ARF to each report. Nephrologists A and B both assigned a diagnosis (or diagnoses) for the ARF based on laboratory UA results. These 4 sets of diagnoses were compared with those assigned by the consult nephrologists.

Results

Nephrologist A correctly diagnosed the cause of ARF in 24 of 26 samples (92.3% success rate) based on his performance of the UA. Diagnoses by nephrologists A and B, based on their review of the clinical laboratory UA report, were correct in only 23.1% and 19.2% of the samples, respectively. Accuracy of diagnosis for nephrologist B improved to 69.3% when she reviewed UA reports from nephrologist A. Nephrologist A's review of urine sediment was significantly more accurate than interpretations by nephrologist A or B of clinical laboratory reports (sign test, P < 0.001). Nephrologist A reported a greater number of renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cells (P < 0.0001), granular casts (P = 0.0017), hyaline casts (P = 0.0233), RTE casts (P = 0.0008), and dysmorphic red blood cells. The laboratory noted a greater number of squamous cells (P = 0.0034).

Conclusion

A nephrologist is more likely to recognize the presence of RTE cells, granular casts, RTE casts, and dysmorphic red blood cells in urine. The laboratory may be reporting RTE cells incorrectly as squamous epithelial cells. Nephrologist-performed UA is superior to laboratory-performed UA in determining the correct diagnosis.
