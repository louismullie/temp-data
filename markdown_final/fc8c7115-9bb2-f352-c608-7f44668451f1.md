## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of the following is not one of the competing responsibilities that influence corporate social responsibility: ethical, economic, discretionary, or technical. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the canonical framework of CSR responsibilities. Then, I should verify whether "technical" appears in that framework. Next, I will check the provided documents for any mention of "technical" as a CSR responsibility. Finally, I will confirm the correct answer and briefly justify it.

> Let me first confirm the standard CSR framework. The widely used model classifies corporate responsibilities into four competing domains: economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary or philanthropic, which are often depicted as overlapping circles where firms must balance profit with law, ethics, and voluntary contributions to society [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify whether "technical" appears anywhere in that canonical model. I need to ensure I'm not missing a variant that includes a technical pillar. Hold on, I should verify: the established framework consistently lists economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary responsibilities; "technical" is not included as a separate competing responsibility in this schema, which focuses on obligation types rather than operational or technological capabilities [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the provided documents to see if any of them introduce "technical" as a CSR responsibility. Let me check carefully: the materials repeatedly use "technical" in clinical, engineering, and methodological contexts (e.g., technical performance, technical standards, technical replicates), but I do not find "technical" presented as a category of corporate social responsibility alongside economic, ethical, or discretionary duties in CSR discussions within these sources [^c32c6228] [^b7d19cca] [^a512ce02].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could "technical" be implicitly grouped under another pillar like economic or ethical? Let me reconsider: while technology and technical expertise can influence economic outcomes or ethical decisions, the framework itself does not designate "technical" as a standalone competing responsibility; rather, technical considerations are typically embedded within economic strategy or ethical risk assessments rather than constituting a separate CSR obligation category [^notfound].

> I should double-check the options against the canonical pillars to avoid a mistake. Ethical, economic, and discretionary are all established competing responsibilities in CSR, whereas "technical" is not recognized as a distinct pillar in that framework, which confirms that the outlier here is "technical" [^notfound].

> Conclusion: The factor that is not one of the competing responsibilities influencing corporate social responsibility is D. Technical, because the standard CSR model comprises economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary responsibilities, and "technical" does not appear as a separate competing category in that framework or in the provided CSR-related content [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **D. Technical**. The competing responsibilities that influence corporate social responsibility are **economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary** [^notfound]; "technical" is not a recognized category in CSR frameworks. Economic responsibility refers to profitability and financial performance; legal responsibility to compliance with laws and regulations; ethical responsibility to doing what is right beyond legal requirements; and discretionary responsibility to voluntary contributions and philanthropy. "Technical" relates to operational or technological capabilities, not a distinct CSR responsibility.

---

## Competing responsibilities in corporate social responsibility

CSR is commonly understood as encompassing **four competing responsibilities**:

| **Responsibility** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Economic | Profitability, financial performance, and sustainable business operations. |
| Legal | Compliance with laws, regulations, and industry standards. |
| Ethical | Doing what is right, just, and fair beyond legal obligations. |
| Discretionary | Voluntary contributions to society, such as philanthropy and community engagement. |

---

These responsibilities often conflict, requiring companies to balance profit with legal, ethical, and philanthropic obligations [^notfound].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

- **A. Ethical**: Ethical responsibility is a core CSR dimension, requiring companies to act morally and fairly beyond legal compliance [^notfound].

- **B. Economic**: Economic responsibility is fundamental, as businesses must be profitable and financially sustainable to fulfill other CSR obligations [^notfound].

- **C. Discretionary**: Discretionary responsibility involves voluntary societal contributions, such as philanthropy and community engagement [^notfound].

- **D. Technical**: "Technical" is not a recognized CSR responsibility; it pertains to operational or technological capabilities rather than a distinct CSR obligation.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **D. Technical**, because CSR frameworks recognize economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary responsibilities — not technical — as the competing responsibilities that influence corporate social responsibility.

### IDEAL-D framework for device innovation: a consensus statement on the preclinical stage [^71bb0afb]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To extend the IDEAL framework for device innovation, IDEAL-D, to include the preclinical stage of development (stage 0).

Background

In previous work, the IDEAL collaboration has proposed frameworks for new surgical techniques and complex therapeutic technologies, the central tenet being that development and evaluation can and should proceed together in an ordered and logical manner that balances innovation and safety.

Methods

Following agreement at the IDEAL Collaboration Council, a multidisciplinary working group was formed comprising 12 representatives from healthcare, academia, industry, and a patient advocate. The group conducted a series of discussions following the principles used in the development of the original IDEAL framework. Importantly, IDEAL aims for maximal transparency, optimal validity in the evaluation of primary effects, and minimization of potential risk to patients or others. The proposals were subjected to further review and editing by members of the IDEAL Council before a final consensus version was adopted.

Results

In considering which studies are required before a first-in-human study, we have: (1) classified devices according to what they do and the risks they carry, (2) classified studies according to what they show about the device, and (3) made recommendations based on the principle that the more invasive and high risk a device is, the greater proof required of their safety and effectiveness before progression to clinical studies (stage 1).

Conclusions

The proposed recommendations for preclinical evaluation of medical devices represent a proportionate and pragmatic approach that balances the de-risking of first-in-human translational studies against the benefits of rapid translation of new devices into clinical practice.

### Strategies to enable large-scale proteomics for reproducible research [^2382f63b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

ProNorM utilises a technical replacement strategy that leverages peptide detection in technical replicates to replace ~20% of missing values with plausible non-zero intensities. A caveat of this approach is that a minimum of three technical replicates are desirable. Increasing technical replicate MS runs clearly comes at a cost. Increasing the number of technical replicates may be a useful strategy for analysis of small clinical cohorts, such as those available from rare diseases or clinical trials, or where researchers would derive benefit from a data matrix with fewer missing values. In the absence of technical triplicates for all samples, RUV-III-C can still be applied to a cohort independent of technical replacement, provided that at least some samples are replicated at various points during the experimental period.

Our results have other practical implications for the design of large-scale studies of complex samples such as cancer tissues. Our experimental design was not intended to focus on assessing the reproducibility of sample preparation. Nor did the design enable the effects of MS and liquid chromatography performance to be fully distinguished, and performance benefits may be achieved by varying the existing maintenance schedules of each of these pieces of equipment. We show that technical replicates are best run on multiple instruments at different stages of performance degradation. Where multiple instruments are not available, running technical replicates at disparate times rather than consecutively is beneficial. This has the dual benefit of maximising peptide identifications for technical replacement and ensuring that replicates measure the greatest amount of unwanted variation for removal. Since the only requirement for technical replacement is the existence of technical replicates, the replacement strategy is not limited to proteomics but could be applicable to other quantitative measurements that are prone to missing values.

### IDEAL-D framework for device innovation: a consensus statement on the preclinical stage [^549c19b3]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

New devices have preceded many of the major advances in clinical practice, especially in surgery. The process of translation of devices from the laboratory to clinical practice can be seen as analogous to the process of drug development, progressing through a predictable series of unique stages, each associated with their own challenges and risks. The context is, however, very different, because there are major differences in the nature of the developmental process, and these have resulted in markedly different regulatory environments. The result has been that rigorous scientific evaluation of devices, especially therapeutic devices, is generally acknowledged to lag behind that of new medicines. This difficulty has been recognized by the World Health Organization's 2014 resolution on Health Technology Assessment calling for “rigorous and structured research methodology and transparent and inclusive processes” for all types of health technology.

An independent network of clinicians and scientists initially convened to provide a framework for evaluating innovation in surgical techniques, the idea, development, exploration, assessment, long-term follow-up (IDEAL) collaboration, has previously proposed a model for the clinical evaluation of device innovation, IDEAL-D. – The central tenet of this framework is that development and evaluation can and should proceed together in an ordered and logical manner that balances innovation and safety (Fig. 1). Whilst for surgical operations procedural modification and optimization of new interventions largely takes place in the clinical environment, with devices this largely occurs before the first-in-human studies.Arguably the most challenging translational barrier for devices is taking their development to the point of a first-in-human study. As few as 1 in 10 devices developed in academia ever result in a first-in-human study.Any methodological framework for device evaluation that begins with the first clinical study, therefore, ignores the majority of the development process. For this reason, the IDEAL-D paper proposed an IDEAL stage 0 analogous to the phase 0 trials in the pharmaceutical industry, designed to efficiently assess whether a specific agent works as desired in humans before phase I testing. However that publication avoided making specific methodological recommendations for stage 0, for 2 main reasons. First, the potential range of studies that might be relevant is formidable, and second, in most jurisdictions a significant amount of evaluation work is prespecified by governmental regulatory bodies charged with ensuring the safety and effectiveness of devices, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and the national competent authorities in the European Union (EU).

### Expert consensus-based technical guidelines for remote robotic-assisted surgery and procedures [^1a3d9e3a]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

1.3 Value of Industry Guidelines

As healthcare rapidly embraces this transformative technology, establishing comprehensive technical guidelines is critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining universal quality. Recognizing this need, a working group of industry leaders was formed to develop technical guidelines to inform the design and implementation of. This initiative followed industry‐recognized guidelines development processes, including consensus‐driven collaboration, broad stakeholder engagement with technical and clinical subject matter experts, and an extensive literature review.

Although primarily technical in scope, these guidelines have far‐reaching implications for the entire remote procedures ecosystem, including patient care, operational workflows, and industry alignment. By establishing clear technical guidelines, this initiative aims to support the safe and effective expansion of remote procedure programs, providing a structured framework that plays a crucial role in shaping the future of surgical care worldwide. The ultimate goal is to democratize worldwide access to safe, high‐quality, interoperable, and scalable surgical and procedural care.

1.4 Applying the Guidelines

The resulting Remote Robotic‐Assisted Surgery and Procedures Technical Guidelines define critical requirements forcharacteristics, cybersecurity, system interfaces,, and facility‐level considerations. The document also outlines additional key design and implementation requirements foras well as cybersecurity best practices. These guidelines do not define specifications (e.g.andallocation) as these parameters vary based on theand other factors. Additionally, these specifications will be validated through the development process for defined use cases.

As remote procedures continue to evolve, these guidelines will be updated accordingly to reflect technological advancements and emerging best practices. In addition, a range of clinical, operational, and ethical considerations must be addressed to ensure patient safety and support the broader adoption of remote procedures. Complementary practice guidelines, covering issues, such as liability, licensure, credentialing, and safety protocols, will align with the technical guidelines, working together to support the safe and effective expansion of remote programs.

1.5 Intended Audience

These Technical Guidelines are intended for all stakeholders involved in designing, developing, or implementing, including the following groups:
Medical device manufacturers and robotic companies
Telecommunications and infrastructure providers
Technology and cybersecurity professionals
Healthcare organizations, hospital administrators, IT, and other professionals
Healthcare providers and clinical teams
Research and academic institutions
Healthcare regulators

### Relationship between non-technical skills and technical performance during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: does stress have an influence? [^b8e16ab3]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Relationship between non-technical and technical performance

Overall, a significant positive correlation was observed between non-technical (ANTS) and technical performance scores (r=0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.69, p<0.001), meaning that better non-technical performance was associated with better technical performance. This overall correlation, however, is explained by a significant positive correlation in scenarios with external stressors (r=0.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.83, p<0.001), while no evidence for a relationship between technical and non-technical performance was observed when no external stressors were present (r=0.15, 95% CI −0.22 to 0.49, p=0.42, figure 3). Likewise, all scores of the domains of the ANTS framework showed a significant positive relationship with the technical performance when additional stressors were present, but not under control conditions (table 3).

Figure 3 
Scatter plot showing the relationship between non-technical (Anaesthetists’ Non-Technical Skills (ANTS)) and transformed technical performance scores. Solid dots and the dashed line show the significant correlation in scenarios with external stressors (r=0.67, p<0.001). Open circles and the dotted line show the non-significant correlation in scenarios without external stressors (r=0.15, p=0.42).

Table 3 
Correlations between the non-technical (ANTS) score and the transformed technical performance score.

The GEE analysis provides strong evidence for an interaction between non-technical performance and stress (unadjusted p=0.015, adjusted for period effects=0.001), confirming that the relationship between non-technical and technical performance varies depending on the presence or absence of external stressors (table 4).

### Identifying and prioritising technical and non-technical skills for simulation-based curriculum in anaesthesiology: a Delphi-based needs assessment [^cc36944e]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Delphi round 3: elimination and prioritisation

In the third round of the Delphi process, participants were provided with the preliminary prioritised list of technical procedures developed in round 2 and list of scenarios and non-technical skills from round 1. They were tasked with reviewing this list and eliminating procedures they deemed unsuitable for SBT. Criteria for elimination included:

Inappropriateness for simulation: Procedures that were not conducive to being taught in a simulated environment.
Basic procedures: Simple technical procedures that should have been mastered during undergraduate medical education.
Advanced procedures: Highly complex procedures that are typically learnt in the later stages of specialist training.

Additionally, participants had the opportunity to reprioritise the remaining procedures based on their relevance and importance for SBT.

Data analysis

In Delphi round 1, we grouped similar skills together where the procedures could be combined and trained in one training programme. We separated the non-technical skills from the technical and put them in a separate category. We also made a separate category for scenarios. In Delphi round 2, the mean score for each factor was calculated and the CAMES NAF score was used to produce a preliminary list of technical procedures. The qualitative data (open-ended questions) for scenarios and non-technical skills were collected and ranked according to most suggested to least suggested. In Delphi round 3, we calculated the number of occurrences for each response using frequency analysis and applied a degree of agreement of ≥70% to establish consensus. The skills and scenarios that had <70% support from the participants were eliminated from the final list. The final list was developed following a focused group discussion among the steering research members.

### The effect of technical performance on patient outcomes in surgery: a systematic review [^c32c6228]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Systematic review of the effect of intraoperative technical performance on patient outcomes.

Background

The operating room is a high-stakes, high-risk environment. As a result, the quality of surgical interventions affecting patient outcomes has been the subject of discussion and research for years.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases were searched. All surgical specialties were eligible for inclusion. Data were reviewed in regards to the methods by which technical performance was measured, what patient outcomes were assessed, and how intraoperative technical performance affected patient outcomes. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI).

Results

Of the 12,758 studies initially identified, 24 articles (7775 total participants) were ultimately included in this review. Seventeen studies assessed the performance of the faculty alone, 2 assessed both the faculty and trainees, 1 assessed trainees alone, and in 4 studies, the level of the operating surgeon was not specified. In 18 studies, a performance assessment tool was used. Patient outcomes were evaluated using intraoperative complications, short-term morbidity, long-term morbidity, short-term mortality, and long-term mortality. The average MERSQI score was 11.67 (range 9.5-14.5). Twenty-one studies demonstrated that superior technical performance was related to improved patient outcomes.

Conclusions

The results of this systematic review demonstrated that superior technical performance positively affects patient outcomes. Despite this initial evidence, more robust research is needed to directly assess intraoperative technical performance and its effect on postoperative patient outcomes using meaningful assessment instruments and reliable processes.

Replication

To confirm the reproducibility of the technology, we performed a series of technical replicates, which were typically recorded across several biological specimens, as indicated below. For analyses, only datasets of high labelling and imaging quality were pursued. Typically, during the development phase, a number of experiments with some variation of parameters were performed. In all images, representative data from single experiments are shown. For some of the experiments that we performed routinely, the stated numbers give lower bounds and we did not count further replicates beyond n = 10.

### IDEAL-D framework for device innovation: a consensus statement on the preclinical stage [^433a98be]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

These IDEAL-D recommendations for preclinical (stage 0) evaluation of medical devices represent a proportionate and pragmatic approach that balances the de-risking of first-in-human translational studies against the benefits of rapid translation of new devices into clinical practice. They suggest that preclinical evaluation should be tailored to the device classification (Table 1) and to risk stratification of its potential failure modes (Table 2). The recommendations (Fig. 3) are derived from the ethical principles of the IDEAL collaboration (Box 2) and propose a systematic and proportionate approach to selecting appropriate topics for study and study designs from an enormous range of possibilities. We hope that their use will reduce research waste and associated costs and delays, whilst ensuring more appropriate and useful evaluation and less risks of harm during initial clinical studies.

The recommendations have been developed by expert consensus and are not, therefore, evidence based. They, therefore, need to be subjected to empirical testing, and modifications made where proposals prove inappropriate or impractical in case studies. The impact of these recommendations on safety and efficacy aspects of stage 1 studies and the rates of transition from stage 0 to stage 1 should be evaluated.

An important issue, not addressed in these recommendations, is the initial determination of when a device is considered new, and therefore warrants full preclinical assessment within IDEAL-D stage 0. In many cases, it may be unclear whether an alteration in a device's design or use represents a significant change. Future work by the IDEAL collaboration will seek to develop specific recommendations to help innovators make this judgement. In the meantime, we would suggest a group including representatives of innovators, clinicians, scientists, and patients be asked to reach a consensus-based decision based on the ethical principles of the IDEAL collaboration.

### Relationship between non-technical skills and technical performance during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: does stress have an influence? [^5d33336e]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Background

High quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is crucial for survival of patients in cardiac arrest.In this context, optimal technical performance of interventions is emphasised in resuscitation guidelines.However, coordinated performance of such interventions within CPR teams requires more than mastering the technical skills. Non-technical skills such as task management, leadership, situational awareness, communication and decision-making refer to cognitive, behavioural and social skills that contribute to safe and efficient team performance.Herein, the team leader plays a pivotal role in coordinating the team effort, and previous research has shown that absence of efficient leadership is associated with poor CPR performance.

Relationship between non-technical and technical skills

Data on the actual strength of the relationship between the team leader’s non-technical skills and the technical performance of the CPR team are scarce.Moreover, it is unclear whether and how non-technical performance itself as well as the relationship between non-technical and technical performance are influenced by other factors that might interfere with CPR performance, such as the stress level. A more detailed understanding of the relationship between non-technical skills of the team leader and technical performance of the team during CPR may have important implications for training and clinical performance of resuscitation teams.

In a prior study, we demonstrated that additional external stressors during CPR adversely affect the technical performance of resuscitation teams regardless of the experience level of the team leader.We hypothesised that non-technical skills become increasingly important to maintain adequate CPR performance under stressful circumstances when individuals are distracted from their tasks.

Therefore, in this analysis, we determine whether non-technical performance is affected by the level of external stressors and whether specific domains of non-technical performance are differentially affected.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of whole-breast ultrasound for screening and staging [^03ca26a2]. ACR (2024). High credibility.

Whole-breast ultrasound methods and technical factors state that whole-breast ultrasound can be performed with a general-purpose ultrasound machine or systems designed specifically for whole-breast ultrasound; if a general-purpose machine is employed, a linear high-frequency transducer with a center frequency of at least 12 MHz if possible should be used for breast scanning. Handheld whole-breast screening ultrasound relies on the operator to identify and capture images, and because lesion characterization by ultrasonography is highly dependent on technical factors, operators should optimize gain settings, focal zone selections, and fields of view when capturing images. Semiautomated whole-breast ultrasound involves adding a robotic arm to a general-purpose ultrasound machine to guide the transducer over the breast, producing uniplanar images in sequential scan rows that are stitched together into a single continuous video for each breast; because a trained operator positions the transducer and maintains appropriate pressure, the technique is considered semiautomated, and proprietary viewing software enables localization of findings using the nipple, scan row, and frame number.

### The future of gastroenterology training: instruction in technical skills [^1174af2e]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Endoscopy training has developed extensively over the past decade but despite significant improvements many challenges remain and further development of endoscopy training programmes and content is required. Endoscopy training is struggling with increasing pressure from service provision and competition for limited National Health Service (NHS) resources. There is a rapidly increasing proportion of work shifting from diagnostic to therapeutic practice in the face of limited dedicated therapeutic training provision. In addition, there is a need to align quality assurance outcomes related to endoscopic practice with the key NHS quality indicators of patient experience, clinical effectiveness and safety. A vision for the future of endoscopy training is presented focusing on the need to target training resources most effectively and developing technical skills training in parallel to non-technical skills training (eg, effective decision making, communication and teamwork). Proposals for specialist technical skills training, future information technology systems and quality assurance framework integration are developed. The need to challenge some existing culture and behaviours is explained along with a challenge to embed a life-long learning approach in endoscopy training. Endoscopy training developments aim to ensure a high quality assured endoscopy service for all patients, where a skilled workforce can be provided to meet rising demand and changing technical skills requirements.

The technical success rate for studies investigating benign SVCS alone was 88.8% (95% CI 83.0–93.1%) (Fig. 3). Most studies described technical success as navigation and successful deployment and expansion of the stent across the obstruction or stenosis, with evidence of flow restoration on post-intervention venography. Further requisites for technical success where specified included a final pressure gradient < 10 mmHg in 4 studies and < 50% residual stenosis in 3 studies. Two studies used the Society of Interventional Radiologists (SIR) definition of technical success; complete coverage of the obstruction, with overlapping margins of 1 cm on either side and residual stenosis < 30%.

### Artificial intelligence investments reduce risks to critical mineral supply [^3a5498be]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 4 
Technical risk premium for major critical minerals.

This measure of the technical risk premium is based on six characteristics (crustal abundance, crustal concentration, ease of mining, ease of processing, criticality of use, and diversity of use). Details of the construction of this measure of the technical risk premium, data, and calculations are available in the methods, Supplementary Information, and Supplementary Data.

In Fig. 5, we present estimates of the total risk premium for the 13 critical minerals for which we have data on technical and non-technical risk. Rare earth elements, tin, manganese, tungsten, and zinc have the highest total risk premium. The only mineral showing a total risk premium discount is copper, reflecting its lower technical score relative to the benchmark.

### Ex vivo technical skills training transfers to the operating room and enhances cognitive learning: a randomized controlled trial [^b68d0b1c]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical training in the operating room includes acquiring technical skills and cognitive knowledge. Technical skills training on simulated models has been shown to improve technical performance in the operating room, and may also enhance the acquisition of other skills by freeing cognitive capacity. This has yet to be investigated.

Methods

We conducted a single-blinded randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of ex vivo technical skills training on cognitive learning in the operating room. Eighteen novice surgical residents were randomized to 2 groups. All participants were taught the basics of fascial closure and performed 1 closure on a low fidelity synthetic model. Residents in the intervention group practiced on the models until technical proficiency was reached. Residents in the control group had no further contact with the models. All residents then performed a fascial closure on a patient in the operating room while listening to a script that contained relevant clinical information. A validated evaluation tool was used to assess the technical merit of the closure. Finally, all participants completed a multiple-choice test designed to test the information retained from the script.

Results

The technical performance of the ex vivo trained group was significantly higher than that of the untrained group (P = 0.04). The ex vivo trained group also performed significantly better on the cognitive retention test (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Technical skills training using a low fidelity synthetic simulator resulted in improved technical performance in the operating room, and enhanced the ability of residents to attend to cognitive components of surgical expertise.

### Technical skills rotation for general surgery residents [^73c0d9e8]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Technical skills are an important part of any general surgery residency curriculum. With the demands of limited work weeks, it is imperative that educators create novel methods of teaching technical skills to their residents. Our program utilizes a dedicated month to help accomplish this. This study hypothesized that general surgery residents would report a positive effect of a dedicated technical skills rotation.

Methods

Residents who had undergone a 1 mo rotation in technical skills during their first year were asked to fill out a survey concerning their experience. During the 1-mo rotation, the residents had almost no clinical responsibilities. Teaching of technical skills was performed with various activities, including video content (VC), virtual reality simulators (VR), open foam procedures (OF), laparoscopic box trainers (BT), surgical equipment in-service (SE), and animate sessions (AS). Responses were given on a Likert scale (1-10) with higher numbers being more positive responses.

Results

There were seven residents in this study. The residents gave a very positive response to the overall rotation (9.4) and exposure to laparoscopic procedures (9.6). The other responses were enthusiastic as well: exposure to open procedures (8.9) and preparation for operative room (9.4). After their rotation, the residents were comfortable performing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (9.2), a hand-sewn anastomosis (8.7), and a stapled anastomosis (9.4). The residents found theses activities helpful in increasing order: VC (7.8), VR (8.0), BT (9.0), ES (9.7), OF (9.8), and AS (9.8).

Conclusions

A 1-mo dedicated technical skills rotations was perceived to be extremely positive by the residents. The residents felt very comfortable performing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a hand-sewn anastomosis, and a stapled anastomosis. With the 80-h work week, alternatives to learning technical skills in the operating room are essential. Further studies need to be performed to determine if this rotation aids in accomplishing this goal.

### Trovafloxacin mesylate (Trovan) [^ef722531]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard trovafloxacin mesylate powder should provide the following MIC values:

Diffusion Techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure2requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with trovafloxacin mesylate equivalent to 10 µg trovafloxacin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to trovafloxacin.

Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a trovafloxacin mesylate disk (equivalent to 10 µg trovafloxacin) should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

The following zone diameter interpretive criteria should be used for testing non-fastidious aerobic organisms:

For testing Haemophilus spp.:

For testing Streptococcus spp. including Streptococcus pneumoniae :

Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for trovafloxacin.

As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the trovafloxacin mesylate equivalent to 10-µg trovafloxacin disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory quality control strains:

Anaerobic Techniques: For anaerobic bacteria, the susceptibility to trovafloxacin as MICs can be determined by standardized test methods3. The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

Interpretation is identical to that stated above for results using dilution techniques.

As with other susceptibility techniques, the use of laboratory control microorganisms is required to control the technical aspects of the laboratory standardized procedures. Standardized trovafloxacin mesylate powder should provide the following MIC values:

### Systematic evaluation of DNA methylation age estimation with common preprocessing methods and the infinium methylationEPIC beadChip array [^3a1eea1e]. Clinical Epigenetics (2018). Low credibility.

We assessed how different preprocessing methods influenced the DNAm age estimate by examining the concordance of DNAm age measured from EPIC array technical replicates. A technical replicate pair represented an identical DNA sample quantified twice for quality control purposes; specifically, the sample was divided into two separate tubes after bisulfite conversion and DNAm was quantified separately. Technical replicate sample identity was confirmed by examining the 59 SNP probes present on the EPIC array (Additional file 1 : Figure S8). We focused on the 24 technical replicates (12 pairs) from the EPIC array, calculating DNAm age for each technical replicate from data subjected to each separate preprocessing method: raw, GS color corrected and background subtracted, quantile normalized, or noob normalized. We calculated the median absolute difference between each technical replicate pair’s DNAm age estimates in each dataset. We found that the GS color correction and background subtraction had the least deviation across replicates (error GS = 2.17 years), followed by noob normalization (error Noob = 2.41 years), quantile normalization (error Quantile = 2.89 years), and then raw data having the largest deviation (error Raw = 3.14 years, Fig. 4). Notably, these values are all below the median absolute error of the epigenetic clock (3.6 years).

### IDEAL-D framework for device innovation: a consensus statement on the preclinical stage [^e8e64049]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient and clinician perspective studies are recommended for devices with intermediate or high risks according to the FMEA analysis, especially if they are required to be operated by clinicians or patients. Low risk devices may benefit from demonstrating patient or clinician acceptability, but we do not consider this necessary for first-in-human studies in most cases.

System perspective studies are recommended for devices with high risk. In these cases, potentially high risk first-in-human studies can only be ethically justified if there is a reasonable prospect that the device will ultimately be adopted by the community. High risk devices that do not satisfy an unmet need, or are not economically viable, may therefore not be appropriate for a first-in-human study.

These recommendations (Fig. 3) are based on the guiding ethical principles of the IDEAL collaboration (Box 2), the most important of which is ensuring, as far as possible, that no harm is caused in the stage 1 first-in-human studies.

Studies should of course have a robust design appropriate to the study question and follow relevant reporting guidelines. To ensure maximal general benefit and avoid duplication, studies should be published and subject to peer review. Collation of reports related to a particular device's stage 0 assessment in a centralized resource would allow transparent assessment.This transparency should not interfere with intellectual property protection and, in fact, should run in parallel to this process. There are useful frameworks to guide developers on what aspects of intellectual property to consider at each stage of the development process.

To best illustrate our recommendation and the underlying principles of the IDEAL collaboration, we provide 3 examples to illustrate the process of how the stage 0 recommendations can be tailored to specific devices to optimize the translation to clinical practice (Table 4).

### Concordance of hospital ranks and category ratings using the current technical specification of US hospital star ratings and reasonable alternative specifications [^6fe8dadd]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Context of the Literature

Examining the Design of Composite Indicators

Most previous analyses of the sensitivity of composite indicators to technical approaches have only assessed single dimensions of technical specifications,,,,, including previous examinations of the outcomes of alternative technical specifications of CMS star ratings. Detailed examinations of multiple technical aspects of composite indicators in the literature are rare. Exceptions include a 2004 discussion of multiple technical aspects of the construction of composite indicators in health care, based on hypothetical example and limited number of measures and not examining multiple technical choices simultaneously.

Reporting of Composite Indicators

Most assessment of the effect of technical decisions on hospital performance on composite scores thus far has focused on the issues of weighting. Rumball-Smith and colleaguessuggest providing “personalized hospital ratings,” where users can set their own domain weights to prioritize specific areas. While this is an appealing suggestion, the present findings illustrate that domain weights are not the only influential decision in producing composite indicators—and it is not necessarily easy to vary other important design aspects such as standardization or how measures are grouped into domains.

Justification of Decisions Taken When Developing Composite Indicators

Published sensitivity analyses of health care composite indicators are uncommon. Although it has been suggested that such analyses should be carried out,, they are not typically reflected in public-facing documentation or publications. Justification of the decisions relating to the technical specifications adopted in the CMS star ratings, and a description of alternative approaches that may have been considered,, does not appear to be publicly available. This study demonstrates the need for transparency about decisions relating to the development and specification of composite indicators. An example of such transparency is the US Baby-MONITOR composite indicator of neonatal intensive care unit quality, where developers compared 5 different approaches to weighting and aggregating measures, and justified their chosen approach based on the fact that all 5 approaches gave similar results.

Strengths and Limitations

We used a large sample of real-world performance data and examined multiple aspects of the technical design of the composite indicator. We demonstrated that design choices about technical specifications for calculating performance matter greatly for 2021 CMS star ratings for typical hospitals. We also described the sensitivity of hospital performance ratings within the CMS peer groups defined by the number of domains of quality reported.

Although we examined 3 reasonable different alternatives to the 2021 technical specification, these represent only a fraction of all of the technical choices involved in producing a large composite indicator like the star ratings.

### IDEAL-D framework for device innovation: a consensus statement on the preclinical stage [^8ef0070c]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Following agreement at the IDEAL Collaboration Council, a multidisciplinary working group was formed comprising 12 representatives from healthcare, academia, industry, and a patient advocate. Collectively the group included consultant surgeons, university professors, and industry experts with experience of device development and evaluation. The group conducted a series of discussions chaired by HJM, following the principles used in the development of the original IDEAL Framework. Importantly, IDEAL aims for maximal transparency, optimal validity in the evaluation of primary effects, and minimization of potential risk to patients or others. Where countervailing pressures limit our capacity to achieve these aims, this is highlighted and explained. The proposals were subjected to further review and editing by members of the IDEAL Council before a final consensus version was adopted.

We adopted a consensus-based approach to developing these recommendations. In considering which studies are required or desirable before a device is ready for a first-in-human study, we decided to divide the problem into 3 parts:

(1) What devices we are considering and how to stratify the level of risk in the devices?
(2) What types of studies might be needed?
(3) How we should decide on what to evaluate, and how rigorous should this evaluation be?

To help us answer these questions, we developed:

(1) A classification system based on what the devices do alongside a broadly applicable risk assessment system.
(2) A classification for study types based on what they show about the device.
(3) A risk-based approach to evaluation, taking the view that any predictable significant risk to patients requires evaluation sufficient to demonstrate conclusively that it can be managed or eliminated before human trials.

In developing our classification of devices we worked to ensure that our classification was founded on the IDEAL principles but compatible with both of the major regulatory device classification systems, rather than offering an alternative to them.

### A literature review of zika virus [^44f1e6ac]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Health officials in French Polynesia have reported an apparent increase in congenital central nervous system (CNS) malformations, coinciding with the outbreak occurring during 2013–2014 (Technical Appendix reference 51). However, this finding should be cautiously interpreted; reports included only 17 cases, and none were laboratory-confirmed Zika virus cases. In addition, the true baseline rate of such malformations before the outbreak is unknown (Technical Appendix reference 51).

A plausible neuropathologic link between Zika virus and CNS anomalies is supported by research showing viral neurotropism in intraperitoneally infected mice (Technical Appendix reference 52) and progression of disease in directly infected mouse brains (Technical Appendix reference 53). One hypothesis for Zika virus’s role in CNS malformations pertains to the virus’s hijacking of autophagy during viral replication (Technical Appendix reference 54). Some cellular proteins have a dual role in autophagy and centrosome stability; a normal number of centrosomes is important for brain development (Technical Appendix reference 54). An increase in centrosomes in mice has been shown to result in microcephaly (Technical Appendix reference 54). Therefore, Zika virus’s interference in autophagy has been hypothesized to lead to an increase in centrosome number and microcephaly; this potential role in malformations merits further investigation.

Severe neurologic sequelae have also been described in adults, including meningitis, meningoencephalitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome (Technical Appendix reference 55). A surge in Guillain-Barre syndrome cases has been observed in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Suriname, Venezuela, and French Polynesia during outbreaks; however, Zika virus has been laboratory confirmed in only some of these cases (Technical Appendix reference 55).

Nonneurologic sequelae include transient hearing loss, hypotension, and genitourinary symptoms (, ; Technical Appendix references 56,57). Hematospermia was reported in 2 cases. A 44-year-old man in Tahiti in whom hematospermia developed 2 weeks after symptoms of Zika virus infection was found to have replicative cultured Zika virus particles in his semen. In addition, a 36-year-old man from the United States contracted Zika virus infection while in Senegal, and subsequently, his wife was infected in the United States; this case supports sexual transmission. A second sexually acquired case was reported in Texas (Technical Appendix reference 58).

### Technical standards for the education of physicians with physical disabilities: perspectives of medical students, residents, and attending physicians [^bf6106d9]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This pilot study assessed the opinions of medical students, residents, and attending physicians regarding the technical standards for medical school admission and the competencies required of graduates in the context of physical disability issues.

Design

Students, residents, and faculty from all specialties at a major academic medical center were surveyed regarding the concept of the "undifferentiated graduate;" the relative importance of motor, sensory, observation, and communication skills; the importance of specific technical skills; and the use of physician extenders and other accommodations to fulfill technical standards.

Results

Respondents placed higher importance on observation and communication skills compared with motor skills. Of respondents, 69.8% either disagree or strongly disagree with the idea that a medical student should be an undifferentiated candidate possessing all the technical skills necessary to enter any specialty.

Conclusions

Technical skills used in interpretation and observation were more important to respondents than those technical skills that are purely procedural. Respondents largely rejected the concept of the undifferentiated graduate. Although statistical analyses are of limited reliability because of low response rates, this study represents the most extensive sampling to date of medical professionals' opinions on these issues. Respondents' narrative comments also provided valuable perspectives.

### Artificial intelligence investments reduce risks to critical mineral supply [^bbb053fc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Risk premiums for critical minerals

Figure 3 presents the non-technical risk premium for each of the critical minerals for 2022. The measurement of the non-technical risk premium is described in the methods, Supplementary Information Section 2, and in the Supplementary Data. Each of the critical minerals exhibits a non-technical risk premium, relative to the front-ended non-critical mineral benchmark, consisting of coal, gold, and iron ore. The non-technical risk premium varies from rare earth elements (30.6%) to nickel (2.9%), with the average being 15.7%. The heterogeneity in non-technical risk between critical minerals largely reflects the geographical distribution of specific critical minerals, with those exhibiting higher non-technical risk concentrated in countries having less attractive investment environments. In Supplementary Fig. 3, we show these results are robust to including the only major front-ended critical mineral (copper) in addition to coal, gold and iron ore in the benchmark of front-ended minerals.

Fig. 3 
Non-technical risk premium for major critical minerals.

This figure represents the non-technical risk premium for 16 critical minerals relative to a front-ended minerals benchmark consisting of coal, gold, and iron ore for the period 2022. Details of the construction of this measure of the non-technical risk premium, data, and calculations are available in the methods, Supplementary Information, and Supplementary Data.

Figure 4 presents the technical risk premium for 14 critical minerals for which we have data. The measurement of the technical risk premium is described in the methods and Supplementary Information Section 3. Tin has the highest technical risk premium, while copper and antimony have a technical risk discount, relative to the non-critical mineral benchmark. The average technical risk premium across the 14 critical minerals is 18.4%.

### Social determinants of health (SDOH) | About CDC (...) [^f28df9b6]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know Social determinants of health are the nonmedical factors that influence health outcomes. They are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, worship, and age. These conditions include a wide set of forces and systems that shape daily life such as economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies, and political systems. CDC has adapted this definition from the World Health Organization. Why are SDOH important to CDC. SDOH are one of three priority areas for Healthy People 2030, along with health equity and health literacy. Healthy People 2030 sets data-driven national objectives in five key areas of SDOH: healthcare access and quality, education access and quality, social and community context, economic stability, and neighborhood and built environment.

Some examples of SDOH included in Healthy People 2030 are safe housing, transportation, and neighborhoods; polluted air and water; and access to nutritious foods and physical health opportunities. As the federal government's leading public health agency, CDC has a unique role in contributing to work on SDOH. Why is addressing SDOH important for CDC and public health. Addressing differences in SDOH accelerates progress toward health equity, a state in which every person has the opportunity to attain their highest level of health. SDOH have been shown to have a greater influence on health than either genetic factors or access to healthcare services. For example, poverty is highly correlated with poorer health outcomes and higher risk of premature death. A. CDC is coordinating efforts to focus its resources on the areas where federal public health investments can make the most difference.

For example, CDC's Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health focuses on reducing high rates of chronic diseases for specific racial and ethnic groups in urban, rural, and tribal communities. Since 1999, the program has worked across sectors in racial and ethnic minority communities to reduce tobacco use, improve access to healthy foods, change the built environment to promote physical activity, and connect people to clinical care. Public health actions that affect SDOH Public health organizations can: Convene Bring together community members and organizations to identify local concerns. CDC has a long history of convening partners through national conferences, webinars, collaborative publications, and guideline development. CDC also encourages other public health organizations to act as conveners by including coalition-building or community engagement activities as a requirement in some funded projects.

### Use of a hand-held digital cognitive aid in simulated crises: the MAX randomized controlled trial [^9f7cd763]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive aids improve the technical performance of individuals and teams dealing with high-stakes crises. Hand-held electronic cognitive aids have rarely been investigated. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the effects of a smartphone application, named MAX (for Medical Assistance eXpert), on the technical and non-technical performance of anaesthesia residents dealing with simulated crises.

Methods

This single-centre randomized, controlled, unblinded trial was conducted in the simulation centre at Lyon, France. Participants were anaesthesia residents with >1yr of clinical experience. Each participant had to deal with two different simulated crises with and without the help of a digital cognitive aid. The primary outcome was technical performance, evaluated as adherence to guidelines. Two independent observers remotely assessed performance on video recordings.

Results

Fifty-two residents were included between July 2015 and February 2016. Six participants were excluded for technical issues; 46 participants were confronted with a total of 92 high-fidelity simulation scenarios (46 with MAX and 46 without). Mean (sd) age was 27 (1.8)yr and clinical experience 3.2 (1.0)yr. Inter-rater agreement was 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.85-0.92). Mean technical scores were higher when residents used MAX [82 (11.9) vs 59 (10.8)%; P<0.001].

Conclusion

The use of a hand-held cognitive aid was associated with better technical performance of residents dealing with simulated crises. These findings could help digital cognitive aids to find their way into daily medical practice and improve the quality of health care when dealing with high-stakes crises.

### Best practices in the development and use of experimental models of bacterial pneumonia: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^0acee09e]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2025). High credibility.

Pneumonia models—development and selection considerations emphasize defining the specific research question, with methodological rigor and careful attention to factors so models provide relevant and reliable data, including the organisms, host factors, specific methodology, and outcome measures. Choice of organism and model type, including selection of an appropriate animal species that recapitulates human lung physiology and immune response, is important, and each animal species has unique immune and respiratory features with relevance to human infection. For ethical or cost reasons, in vitro models and in silico models can be useful, and human-derived lung organoids or cell coculture systems provide insights into human-specific host–pathogen interactions without animal use. Inoculation method and technical details such as intranasal versus intratracheal inoculation can vary across laboratories, and options include simulation of natural routes such as aerosolized infections. Consistency in key factors is paramount, including bacterial preparation, mouse age and environment, acclimatization, and anesthesia type, and recent publications outline standardized methods; consistency in animal husbandry also mitigates microbiota-related variations in pulmonary response. Host factors and immune responses can be assessed using genetically modified animals or animals with induced comorbidities, and measuring immune cell recruitment, cytokine levels, and markers of lung injury provides insights.

### IDEAL-D framework for device innovation: a consensus statement on the preclinical stage [^7582a1a7]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Classification of Devices

The most widely currently applied classifications for medical devices are those utilized by certifying bodies, such as the EU Council Directive (CE mark), and the FDA in the United States.

Broadly speaking, devices have been classified according to an ordinal scale of patient risk or by categorical factors (eg, associated specialty, intended use, duration of use, invasiveness, or surgical vs nonsurgical). The EU CE marking process utilizes a prescriptive set of 18 “rules,” associated with a series of algorithms to confirm class, and sub-class.The FDA process is less well defined with devices classified directly to 3 regulatory classes (I–III) based on the level of potential patient risk plus stratification amongst 16 medical specialty panels.

We adopted a different approach to classification, designed to be consistent, easy to use, and to avoid duplication, but informed by both the FDA and EU classifications. Devices are classified according to a 3-tiered descriptive taxonomy, outlined in Table 1. The first 2 tiers classify the device as invasive or noninvasive, and surgical versus nonsurgical (see definitions below). The third tier is more descriptive and helps elucidate the potential harm a device may pose to a patient. This taxonomy leads to a classification compatible with the historic risk class system used by the FDA and CE marking processes, but which does not rely on the arbitrary decisions used in both systems. Although the table indicates the current EU device class, the simplicity and principles-based nature of this classification should ensure it can adapt to any changes in classification that may be introduced by either the EU or the FDA.

### Fundamentals of vascular surgery: a plan for the uniform instruction and assessment of basic skills in vascular surgery [^5289779e]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Training surgeons poses many unique challenges. In addition to the clinical acumen that must be learned, a minimum threshold of technical competency is a requisite for independent practice. The trends of endovascular interventions and open surgical procedures add another layer of complexity to vascular surgery training. Simulation can provide a solution for both technical skills training and evaluating proficiency. The Education Committee of the Association of Program Directors of Vascular Surgery (APDVS) developed the Fundamentals of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery platform to provide an opportunity for more uniform basic technical skill teaching and assessment across all vascular training programs. Evaluation by experts with standardized scoring of Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) Global Rating Score and Global Summary grading systems have demonstrated correlation with participant ability when completing the end-to-side anastomosis, patch angioplasty, and clockface suturing models. Future research should be directed toward developing autonomous and objective methods for technical assessments on these models.

### Inter-hospital transport of critically ill patients ; expect surprises [^89372451]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inter-hospital transport of critically ill patients is increasing. When performed by specialized retrieval teams there are less adverse events compared to transport by ambulance. These transports are performed with technical equipment also used in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). As a consequence technical problems may arise and have to be dealt with on the road. In this study, all technical problems encountered while transporting patients with our mobile intensive care unit service (MICU) were evaluated.

Methods

From March 2009 until August 2011 all transports were reviewed for technical problems. The cause, solution and, where relevant, its influence on protocol were stated.

Results

In this period of 30 months, 353 patients were transported. In total 55 technical problems were encountered. We provide examples of how they influenced transport and how they may be resolved.

Conclusion

The use of technical equipment is part of intensive care medicine. Wherever this kind of equipment is used, technical problems will occur. During inter-hospital transports, without extra personnel or technical assistance, the transport team is dependent on its own ability to resolve these problems. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of having some technical understanding of the equipment used and the importance of training to anticipate, prevent and resolve technical problems. Being an outstanding intensivist on the ICU does not necessarily mean being qualified for transporting the critically ill as well. Although these are lessons derived from inter-hospital transport, they may also apply to intra-hospital transport.

### Multidisciplinary crisis simulations: the way forward for training surgical teams [^cc920b56]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

High-reliability organizations have stressed the importance of non-technical skills for safety and of regularly providing such training to their teams. Recently safety skills training has been applied in the practice of medicine. In this study, we developed and piloted a module using multidisciplinary crisis scenarios in a simulated operating theatre to train entire surgical teams.

Methods

Twenty teams participated (n = 80); each consisted of a trainee surgeon, anesthetist, operating department practitioner (ODP), and scrub nurse. Crisis scenarios such as difficult intubation, hemorrhage, or cardiac arrest were simulated. Technical and non-technical skills (leadership, communication, team skills, decision making, and vigilance), were assessed by clinical experts and by two psychologists using relevant technical and human factors rating scales. Participants received technical and non-technical feedback, and the whole team received feedback on teamwork.

Results

Trainees assessed the training favorably. For technical skills there were no differences between surgical trainees' assessment scores and the assessment scores of the trainers. However, nurses overrated their technical skill. Regarding non-technical skills, leadership and decision making were scored lower than the other three non-technical skills (communication, team skills, and vigilance). Surgeons scored lower than nurses on communication and teamwork skills. Surgeons and anesthetists scored lower than nurses on leadership.

Conclusions

Multidisciplinary simulation-based team training is feasible and well received by surgical teams. Non-technical skills can be assessed alongside technical skills, and differences in performance indicate where there is a need for further training. Future work should focus on developing team performance measures for training and on the development and evaluation of systematic training for technical and non-technical skills to enhance team performance and safety in surgery.

### Analysis of technical repeat studies in screening mammography [^71effc4e]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify causes of technical repeats, determine whether differences exist between mobile and fixed mammography units, and evaluate the rate of improvement on repeat imaging.

Methods

IRB approval was obtained for retrospective review of Enhancing Quality Using the Inspection Program (EQUIP) logs of screening mammography technical repeats performed from March 2017 to December 2018 at a hospital breast imaging center and from April 2017 to December 2018 on mobile mammography units. Frequency tables and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis.

Results

Technical deficiencies were reported in 483 cases and reviewed by two or three auditors. Auditors identified no technical deficiencies in 31 cases, which were excluded. The remaining 452 cases were assigned a technical recall category: motion, positioning/excluded tissue, skin folds, artifacts, undercompression, or contrast (under/overexposure). Motion was the most common technical recall category (253/452, 56.0%). Positioning/excluded tissue was the second most common reason (150/452, 33.2%). Statistically significant differences in technical deficiencies were identified between mammograms performed on mobile versus fixed mammography units for motion (94/143, 65.7% vs 159/309, 51.5%, respectively, P =0.0058), skin folds (16/143, 11.2% vs 15/309, 4.8%, respectively, P =0.02), and positioning/excluded tissue (30/143, 21% vs 120/309, 38.8%, respectively, P =0.00016). Most recalls improved with repeat imaging (auditor 1: 451/483, 93% and auditor 2: 387/483, 80%).

Conclusion

Motion and positioning/excluded tissue are the most common reasons for screening mammography technical recalls. The reasons for technical recall differ between patients imaged on mobile and fixed mammography units, likely because of differences in each location's patient population.

### Impact of sleep deprivation on anaesthesia residents' non-technical skills: a pilot simulation-based prospective randomized trial [^ce08ad3d]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sleep deprivation is common in anaesthesia residents, but its impact on performance remains uncertain. Non-technical skills (team working, situation awareness, decision making, and task management) are key components of quality of care in anaesthesia, particularly in crisis situations occurring in the operating room. The impact of sleep deprivation on non-technical skills is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that in anaesthesia residents sleep deprivation is associated with impaired non-technical skills.

Methods

Twenty anaesthesia residents were randomly allocated to undergo a simulation session after a night shift [sleep-deprived (SLD) group, n =10] or after a night of rest [rested (R) group, n =10] from January to March 2015. The simulated scenario was a situation of crisis management in the operating room. The primary end point was a composite score of anaesthetists' non-technical skills (ANTS) assessed by two blinded evaluators.

Results

Non-technical skills were significantly impaired in the SLD group [ANTS score 12.2 (interquartile range 10.5-13)] compared with the R group [14.5 (14-15), P <0.02]. This difference was mainly accounted for by a difference in the team working item. On the day of simulation, the SLD group showed increased sleepiness and decreased confidence in anaesthesia skills.

Conclusions

In this randomized pilot trial, sleep deprivation was associated with impaired non-technical skills of anaesthesia residents in a simulated anaesthesia intraoperative crisis scenario.

NMCP-led process.

In Mali, Senegal and Zanzibar the NMCP led the evaluation process and brought in local and external technical partners to assist as needed. The NMCP in Senegal led the process and a local consulting firm was hired to help conduct the evaluation. The consultants worked directly with designated staff members from the NMCP and had an office within the NMCP for the duration of the evaluation to facilitate interaction. The NMCP, consultants, and the PMI/Senegal team working together were responsible for analysis, interpretation, and writing of the report with support and guidance from an international technical partner. In Mali, the local partner worked closely with the NMCP and the PMI/Mali team to organize technical meetings with key malaria partners, analyze the majority of the data, and write the report.

In-country technical partner as the lead.

In-country technical partners led the evaluation in a subset of countries. The local partner organized stakeholder meetings, conducted some of the analyses, and wrote the impact evaluation report; whereas, the external technical partner conducted the analysis of the household survey data. For example, in mainland Tanzania the evaluation was led by a local partner whose strong working relationship with the NMCP and other partners in malaria control in country facilitated collaboration across various expert groups and data sources. Similarly, in Kenya, the evaluation was led by an in-country partner with strong participation of the NMCP and a local research institution and with technical support from an international technical partner.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^2044d80a]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Evidence grading system—guideline definitions for evidence-based statements define four statement types with clinician implications. For a strong recommendation, The Expert Panel believes that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent (Grade A or B). In some clearly defined circumstances, strong recommendations may be made on the basis of lesser evidence (Grade C or D) when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and when the anticipated benefits clearly outweigh the harms. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. For a recommendation, The Expert Panel believes that the benefits exceed the harms but that the quality of the evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C). In some clearly defined circumstances, recommendations may be made on the basis of lesser evidence (Grade D) when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and when the anticipated benefits clearly outweigh the harms. Clinicians should generally follow a recommendation but remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. For optional statements, Either the quality of the evidence that exists is suspect (Grade D) or well-performed studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach versus another, and Clinicians should be flexible in their decision-making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set boundaries on alternatives; patient and family preference should have a substantial influencing role. For no recommendation, There is both a lack of pertinent evidence (Grade D) and an unclear balance between benefits and harms, and Clinicians should not be constrained in their decision-making and should be alert to newly published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm; patient and family preferences should have a substantial influencing role.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia—reintervention outcomes after mesenteric artery stenting (Tallarita et al) show frequent restenosis but high technical success with repeat endovascular therapy: Among the 157 patients treated initially, 57 (36%) developed recurrent stenosis at a mean follow-up of 29 months with 24 patients (42%) with recurrent stenoses developing recurrent symptoms (CMI, 21; AMI, 3). Repeat endovascular treatment was possible in 26 (87%) with low mortality (3%) and excellent symptom improvement (92%), despite a moderate complication rate (27%). Importantly, 43% of the restenosis corresponded with technical defects identified at the index procedure.

### Collaborative team training in virtual reality is superior to individual learning for performing complex open surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^51d8a580]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To assess whether multiplayer immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) training was superior to single-player training for the acquisition of both technical and nontechnical skills in learning complex surgery.

Background:

Superior teamwork in the operating room (OR) is associated with improved technical performance and clinical outcomes. iVR can successfully train OR staff individually; however, iVR team training has yet to be investigated.

Methods:

Forty participants were randomized to individual or team iVR training. Individually trained participants practiced alongside virtual avatar counterparts, whereas teams trained live in pairs. Both groups underwent 5 iVR training sessions over 6 weeks. Subsequently, they completed a real-life assessment in which they performed anterior approach total hip arthroplasty surgery on a high-fidelity model with real equipment in a simulated OR. Teams performed together, and individually trained participants were randomly paired up. Videos were marked by 2 blinded assessors recording the ‘Non-Operative Technical Skills for Surgeons, Oxford NOn-TECHnical Skills II and Scrub Practitioners’ List of Intraoperative Non-Technical Skills’ scores. Secondary outcomes were procedure duration and the number of technical errors.

Results:

Teams outperformed individually trained participants for nontechnical skills in the real-world assessment (Non-Operative Technical Skills for Surgeons: 13.1±1.5 vs 10.6±1.6, P = 0.002, Non-TECHnical Skills II score: 51.7 ± 5.5 vs 42.3 ± 5.6, P = 0.001 and Scrub Practitioners’ List of Intraoperative Non-Technical Skills: 10 ± 1.2 vs 7.9 ± 1.6, P = 0.004). They completed the assessment 33% faster (28.2 minutes ± 5.5 vs 41.8 ± 8.9, P < 0.001), and made fewer than half the number of technical errors (10.4 ± 6.1 vs 22.6 ± 5.4, P < 0.001).

Conclusions:

Multiplayer training leads to faster surgery with fewer technical errors and the development of superior nontechnical skills.

### SAGES guidelines for the introduction of new technology and techniques [^06caf701]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

SAGES guidelines for the introduction of new technology and techniques (NT&T) in surgical practice state that recommendations are based on published evidence and expert opinion, acknowledging that the available evidence is extremely limited and that the effectiveness of proposed standards is scarcely demonstrated. Examples cited include Spigelman’s local policy for new interventional procedures, where the policy “facilitated rather than inhibited innovation,” and a report from McGregor and Brophy at the McGill University Health Centre describing “an estimated $3,000,000 of savings per year.” The authors note that whether one introduction process is superior “remains to be seen and needs further study.” The guidelines aim to separately address technology and technique and to handle variability in what constitutes new; survey responses varied across “4 predefined categories (modified devices, new devices, modified procedures, and new procedures),” and the created categories “provide a framework” to define processes for NT&T introduction.

### Recognising the elephant in the room: the commercial determinants of health [^03c8cebd]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Towards a systems definition of commercial determinants of health

Drawing on existing CDoH and SDoH definitions, and considering CDoH literature more broadly, we propose that CDoH definitions incorporate five elements, shown in box 2.

Box 2 
Proposed elements for a commercial determinants of health definition (CDoH)

Any CDoH definition should incorporate the following elements:

The CDoH are a series of systems that initially materialise around systems of commercial and/or corporate power;
These systems are strongly oriented towards pursuit of profit;
In this pursuit they are greatly enabled by political, social, technical and economic systems, and frequently exercise significant influence over these;
All of these systems are inter-related, and form a constellation of factors with potential to profoundly influence population and planetary health and well-being; and
While acknowledging that CDoH systems’ influences may be positive or negative, the primary focus must be on preventing and reducing harm.

We propose positioning CDoH as similar to SDoH, where benefits and harms are nuanced, circumstantial and sometimes concurrent. Modifying systems that facilitate CDoH may modify, reduce or eliminate commercial and corporate forces’ harm-producing characteristics, and may have potential to facilitate or maximise benefits. These systems include macro-level political–economic conditions and power dynamics, and associated activities, structures and relations such as marketing and media interactivity, corporate political activity, corporate social responsibility, supply chain integration, product formulation, production processes and accessibility, industrial relations, and social, environmental, economic and financial policy, including enforcement or reasonable taxation. Further, we emphasise that CDoH are at the intersection of political, economic, social, environmental and other determinants of health.

### Recommendations for multimodality imaging of patients with left ventricular assist devices and temporary mechanical support: updated recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^06ddd315]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). High credibility.

Right ventricular function assessment after LVAD placement—Measures of right ventricular (RV) systolic function such as right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and indexed RV end‑diastolic and end‑systolic volumes by three‑dimensional (3D) echocardiography have emerged as predictors of early right ventricular failure (RVF) after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement; however, the evidence is limited, and whenever technically feasible, calculation of RV volumes and RVEF by 3D echocardiographic assessment should be considered, recognizing that this approach can be technically challenging and not readily available; recent studies have demonstrated the incremental value of RV strain analysis and these 3D echocardiographic measures in predicting RVF.

### Travel-and community-based transmission of multidrug-resistant Shigella sonnei lineage among international orthodox jewish communities [^56bf6611]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Table 2 
Antimicrobial resistance determinants among isolates isolates sequenced in study of travel- and community-based transmission of multidrug-resistant Shigella sonnei among international OJCs*

*Excludes global context isolates. OJC-associated lineage defined in Technical Appendix Figure 1. OJC, Orthodox Jewish communities. †Detected separately.

To consider AMR mechanisms that had potential to mobilize among bacteria, we further examined antimicrobial resistance genes that were inconsistently present (in 5%–95% of isolates) (Figure 3 ; Technical Appendix 1 ; Technical Appendix 2 Figure 2). The 7 genes found to be inconsistently present across the lineage were second copies of aadA1 present in some isolates; the aminoglycoside resistance–conferring strA and strB genes; the sulphonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 ; the tetracycline resistance gene tetA ; and the ampicillin resistance gene bla TEM (Figure 3 ; Technical Appendix 2 Figure 2). Attempts were made to determine the coinheritance and genetic carriage elements of these genes (within the limitations of genome assembly). In isolates that had additional copies of aadA1, the gene was typically co-inherited with the sul1 gene (Figure 3 ; Technical Appendix 1 ; Technical Appendix 2 Figure 2); this combination was found on plasmids of 2 different incompatibility groups, I1 and P, as well as on contiguous sequences where no plasmid incompatibility groups were identified, shown as unknown (Figure 3 ; Technical Appendix 2 Figure 2). Similarly, strA, strB, and sul2 were frequently co-inherited and found on plasmids of 4 different incompatibility groups. Isolates collected earlier in the lineage’s evolution tended to carry strA/strB/sul2 on B/O/K/Z, Q1, and P incompatibility group plasmids, whereas later isolates carried the genes on I1 plasmids (Figure 3 ; Technical Appendix 2 Figure 2). Similarly, the tetA gene appeared to have had 2 major introductions into the lineage, earlier on a P group plasmid and later on an I1 plasmid (Figure 3 ; Technical Appendix 2 Figure 2). Last, bla TEM genes were found in 86% of isolates in the lineage, compared with 14% outside of the lineage (Table 2 ; Technical Appendix 1); these genes were carried on plasmids of 5 different incompatibility groups, with sporadic coinheritance patterns with other resistance genes (Figure 3 ; Technical Appendix 2 Figure 2).

### Percutaneous cryoablation of large tumors: safety, feasibility, and technical considerations [^170d9165]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Large tumors may prove unsuitable for surgical cure or other local therapies due to their size, involvement of critical structures, prior non-ablative treatment failure, or coexisting disease burden. This study was performed to assess the safety and feasibility of percutaneous cryoablation for treatment of large tumors exceeding 6 cm in size, and to highlight the key technical considerations inherent to such cases.

Materials and Methods

This single-institution retrospective study identified 77 patients (42 male, 35 female; median age 55 years) who underwent 96 cryoablation procedures for treatment of 78 tumors (mean diameter 9.8±3.6 cm) from 2008 through 2020. Technical success, procedure-related complications, mortality, oncologic outcomes, and procedural logistics were evaluated. Technical success was defined as ice ball extension at least 5 mm beyond the tumor margins.

Results

Intentional subtotal ablations were performed in 32% of cases due to tumor encroachment on vulnerable structures or as part of staged/combined therapies. Of the 68% of cases that were planned for complete ablation, the technical success rate was 100%. Major complications occurred after 19/96 (20%) procedures, with hemorrhage and acute kidney injury each occurring in 6/96 (6%). Post-procedural myositis occurred in 24/96 (25%) cases and was not considered a major complication in the absence of acute kidney injury. Local recurrence occurred in 2/23 (8.7%) of patients undergoing ablation for cure or local control at a median follow-up duration of 13 months.

Conclusion

Percutaneous cryoablation may be used to treat large (>6 cm) tumors with a high degree of technical success and an acceptable safety profile.

### Intersectional dynamics and care disparities in intrapartum electronic fetal monitoring: a socio-technical systems perspective [^14dec3f4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Personalised care and support plans in maternity, central to Better Births and a cornerstone to the NHS Long Term Plan, are known to have a positive impact on health inequalities. NHS England expects maternity staff to complete cultural competence and unconscious bias training in response to the “constellation of biases” that prevent women with complex and diverse intersectional factors from receiving equitable maternity care. Nevertheless, there is a lack of standards about auditing, supporting and financing cultural competence and unconscious bias recommendations, and it is up to individual organisations whether they implement them and how. Several participants reported a lack of cultural competence and unconscious bias training in their work place. Also, some study participants reported practising with a “SDH and colour blindness” lenses, which illustrates a socially and politically correct narrative to portrait a distorted equality. Colour blindness and, by extension, SDH blindness, represent modern racism, where the blame is placed on the individual and their life choices. This blindness also fails to acknowledge the role of system-level SDH, such as structural and institutional factors, and its impact on care provision and health outcomes. Moreover, this blindness reduces sensitivity to bias and racism, and negates the opportunity for addressing it. Addressing SDH and unbiased, culturally competent labour care is vital for ensuring equitable and truly personalised care for women and their babies. It is also an ethical, human rights and social justice matter, to ensure that every woman and baby can achieve their highest health possible and free from harm. A SDH approach to the provision of EFM care could address existing disparities and improve care by fostering empathetic and humanised relationships with women after self-reflecting on existing structural bias and barriers that lead to suboptimal outcomes. Although some training initiatives have been piloted, further work is needed to better understand approaches to influence healthcare providers and staff to address racial health inequalities.

6 CONCLUSION

CRT is one of the cornerstone therapies for patients with HFrEF. However, many obstacles lie ahead of successful and complication‐free LV lead implantation. Over the years, we have developed new tools and refined techniques to improve success. We are confident that using the processes, interventional tools, and techniques described here can help improve the success rate of BiV implantation. Additionally, we believe that many patients with previously failed attempts at LV lead implantation, using the interventional tools and techniques described here will be able to successfully undergo BiV implantation, and reap the benefits of CRT.

### Race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status in research on child health [^52966cea]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Interactions between race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and other confounders—attributing causal effects to any one factor is complicated because these constructs interact with and are confounded by each other and potentially other social influences, as well as geographic, environmental, and genetic influences. Racial segregation creates different exposures to economic opportunity, environmental conditions, and other resources that improve health, resulting in racial disparities confounded by disparities based on geographic location, and environmental pollution may be more intense in impoverished areas with hazardous waste sites intentionally located in poor and minority neighborhoods, making it difficult to disentangle the adverse consequences of pollution from the effects of discrimination. Although most studies have focused on adults, the need for inquiries into such factors affecting child health is equally strong, yet an AAP technical report documented that 22% of studies did not perform multivariable or stratified analyses to ensure that racial and ethnic disparities persisted after adjustment for SES and other potential confounders, and little is known about how these social factors influence the health of children or their effects on the trajectory or the development of adult health or disease.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2009). Medium credibility.

Prosthetic aortic regurgitation—role of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and integrative grading are outlined as follows. “The role of TEE in prosthetic AR is to better identify sites in the technically difficult transthoracic echocardiographic studies (valvular vs paravalvular) and delineate the mechanism of regurgitation and associated complications such as endocarditis, abscess formation, masses, or thrombus that interfere with disc function.” Posterior paravalvular leaks “that were not visible on surface imaging may be evident, and it may be possible to map the full extent of dehiscence leading to regurgitation.” The long-axis view “is useful for measuring jet width and the ratio of jet width to LVO tract width for the evaluation of severity,” but “the presence of a concomitant mitral prosthesis will cause significant shadowing and obscure the LVOT tract.” Because assessment “is in general more difficult than in native valves,” “the process of grading AR should be comprehensive and integrative, using a combination of qualitative and semiquantitative parameters such as shown in Table 6.” “If the AR is definitely determined as mild or less using these parameters, no further measurement is required,” whereas if “there are parameters suggestive of more than mild AR and the quality of the data lends itself to quantitation, it is desirable to measure quantitatively the degree of AR, including the regurgitant volume and fraction.” When parameters conflict, “one must look carefully for technical and physiologic reasons… and rely on the components that have the best quality and are the most accurate.” TTE “may be adequate for most of the qualitative and quantitative information needed to evaluate AR severity,” and “TEE complements the transthoracic approach in technically difficult studies, in mapping the extent of annular involvement, and in evaluating the etiology of AR and associated complications.”

### Personalized neuroprosthetics [^1b987e68]. Science Translational Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Decades of technological developments have populated the field of neuroprosthetics with myriad replacement strategies, neuromodulation therapies, and rehabilitation procedures to improve the quality of life for individuals with neuromotor disorders. Despite the few but impressive clinical successes, and multiple breakthroughs in animal models, neuroprosthetic technologies remain mainly confined to sophisticated laboratory environments. We summarize the core principles and latest achievements in neuroprosthetics, but also address the challenges that lie along the path toward clinical fruition. We propose a pragmatic framework to personalize neurotechnologies and rehabilitation for patient-specific impairments to achieve the timely dissemination of neuroprosthetic medicine.

### Typology of how' harmful commodity industries' interact with local governments in england: a critical interpretive synthesis [^8b0ad9b0]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

‘Harmful commodity industries’ (HCIs) are corporations that produce and market products and services such as tobacco, alcohol, gambling and unhealthy foods and beverages. Use of such harmful commodities is a major driver of the burden of preventable non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and HCIs have been identified as important vectors of the growth of NCDs.Addressing the commercial determinants of health (CDoH) is therefore a pressing public health priority.The jobs, revenue, technical and research expertise, and ability to exert corporate power provide HCIs with a powerful voice to shape public perceptions of health, science and policy.The power of HCIs in influencing and shaping public health policy at the national and international level is well establishedthrough strategies to engage, and influence the cultural, social, political and knowledge environments.Approaches across HCIs are largely coherent,including echoing tactics of lobbying, marketing and corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies, among others.These activities all extend and amplify HCI impact and influence, by enhancing the desirability and acceptability of harmful commodities, challenging policy barriers, deflecting attention from harms and whitewashing tarnished reputations of HCIs.
